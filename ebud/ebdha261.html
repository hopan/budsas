      <P><FONT SIZE="6">A</FONT>ll civilizations whether primitive, ancient, 
      mediaeval or modem have in the course of their development produced 
      cultures. In the name of Culture they have created art and architecture, 
      language and literature, music and dance social customs, codes of ethics 
      and behaviour, laws, philosophy and religion. It is by examining a 
      civilization's cultural contributions to the world that we can gain some 
      idea and appreciation of its achievements. This becomes more visible when 
      we look into different periods of the art and architecture from around the 
      world. Every civilization's religion too, in the course of its history 
      contributes something to the world in general and in particular to the 
      world of art and architecture. Religious beliefs, ideas and ideals are 
      sometimes given visual expression and sometimes form the subject matter of 
      art and architecture. In a sense art and architecture provide mirrors to 
      reflect a civilization's religion. In this respect Buddhism is no 
      exception. </P>
      <P>To contribute means to give. What Buddhism has given to the world is 
      not only a profound analysis of, and a practical solution for the problem 
      of human suffering but also a monumental and rich legacy to the world of 
      art and architecture. Much of this legacy is visible even today in its 
      homeland of India and in much of the eastern world. Today, I would like to 
      give all of you gathered here, a glimpse at what is in a way Buddhism's 
      fourth jewel, its art and architecture.</P>
      <P>The very earliest examples of Buddhist art are not iconic but aniconic 
      images and were popular in India after the death of the Buddha. This is 
      because the Buddha, himself did not sanction personal worship or the 
      making of images of the Tathagata, as to have done so would have 
      contradicted his message to mankind. He taught and encouraged people to 
      heed his example and be self-reliant in striving to put an end to human 
      suffering and endless rebirth in Samsara and realise Nibbana for 
      themselves. He was the living proof that this was possible and promised 
      this was attainable by anyone through renouncing worldly and ego-centric 
      desires and by making earnest efforts at mental development and 
      purification as this would help one to eradicate the causes of suffering, 
      greed, hatred and delusion and ultimately result in the attainment of 
      Arahatship and Nibbana. Siddhatha Gotama was a Buddha, a self-perfected, 
      self-enlightened human being and not a saviour of men. He was a human 
      role-model to be followed but not idolized. Of himself he said, 'Buddha's 
      only point the way'. So this is why the earliest artistic tributes to the 
      Buddha Gotama are abstract symbols indicative of major events and 
      achievements in his last life and in some cases his previous lives. They 
      also serve as reminders of his teachings and provide inspiration. Some of 
      these early aniconic representations of the Buddha include:</P>
      <P>1. The Buddha's footprints which were often created at a place where he 
      was know to have walked or was the scene of one of the Jataka Tales which 
      recount his lifetimes as the Bodhisatta, striving to fulfil the 
      perfections necessary in order to become a Buddha in the future. Such an 
      image exists at Swat in Pakistan and indicates what is believed to have 
      been the scene of the Deer or Migara Jataka Story. Another example of this 
      type of narrative imagery are the depictions of the Jataka Tales at Barhut 
      in India. </P>
      <P>2. The Bodhi-tree which is symbolic of Gotama's enlightenment at the 
      age of thirty-five. A cutting of a tree, believed to have been taken from 
      the original Bodhi Tree is enshrined at Bodh Gaya in the grounds of the 
      Mahabodhi Temple. The Bodhi-tree image was retained and used in many later 
      examples of Buddhist art.</P>
      <P>3. The Lotus Flower which symbolizes both purity and enlightenment and 
      is a popular motif in much Buddhist art and architecture and is very 
      widely used in Tibetan Buddhist Art.</P>
      <P>4. The Wheel which is a reminder of the Buddha's First Sermon. 'The 
      Turning of the Wheel of the Law&quot; delivered at Sarnath in Northern India 
      and where stand the ruins of the ancient Dhamekh Stupa commemorating this 
      major event. The wheel has also been adapted to symbolize the wheel of 
      suffering in Samsara in Tibetan Buddhism and many examples of it are 
      beautifully and skillfully depicted in Tibetan Buddhist Art on mandals, a 
      type of meditation-aid and on the cloth paintings known as thankgas.</P>
      <P>5. A riderless horse which recalls Prince Siddhattha's renunciation of 
      worldly life for the ascetic life and the beginning of his search for the 
      path to Enlightenment.</P>
      <P>6. An empty throne which serves as a reminder of his passing away and 
      attainment of Parinibbana.</P>
      <P>After the Buddha's death out of deference to his wishes and devotion to 
      his memory and his teachings, these symbols were widely used in the early 
      days of Buddhist Art in India. Some still survive there and can be seen 
      for example, at the Mahabodhi Temple built at Bodh Gaya, near the scene of 
      the Buddha's Enlightenment. Some of them were also incorporated in later 
      developments of Buddhist art and architecture and featured prominently in 
      places as far afield as for example, the Temples of Thailand. Many of 
      these symbols are used in contemporary Buddhist art and architecture in 
      both the East and West.</P>
      <P>To better appreciate Buddhism's contribution to art and architectural 
      we have to take into account the two major schools of Buddhism, the 
      Theravada or Hinayana and the Mahayana as these were to play significant 
      roles in the creation and development of very different types of Buddhist 
      art and architecture. The two schools arose as the result of a rift in the 
      Sangha which had its cause in a dispute over the rule of life for monks. 
      This occurred during the Second Buddhist Council, convened about a century 
      after the first Council was called, in order that the Sangha Elders might 
      recite and agree upon the Dhamma (doctrine) and Vinaya (discipline). This 
      was necessary as the Buddha chose to name no successor. He explicitly 
      stated that the Dhamma and Vinaya was to be his followers' only guide and 
      teacher when he had gone. Later on this fundamental spilt caused the 
      Dhamma itself to be interpreted differently and this brought about the 
      rise of the two major schools of Buddhism with their different beliefs and 
      ideals, which in turn were to have an important influence on Buddhist art 
      and architecture. Despite the schism and the establishing of the two 
      schools neither school's adherents abandoned the Buddha nor the ultimate 
      goal of deliverance from suffering and rebirth culminating in the 
      realisation of Nibbana or Nirvana. However, as the word, 'yana' implies, 
      the vehicle used to reach that goal was different. It is this choice of 
      vehicle which accounts for a difference in the beliefs and ideals which we 
      see mirrored in the art and architecture created by Theravadins and 
      Mahayanists throughout the history of Buddhism.</P>
      <P>The Theravada School is the more orthodox and conservative of the two. 
      Its adherents uphold the Dhamma and the ideal of the Arahat and look to 
      the Buddha as the human role-model to imitate in their striving to attain 
      deliverance from suffering and rebirth, and eventually Arahatship and 
      Nibbana. Their vehicle to reach this goal is renunciation of all worldly 
      attachments, the eradication of greed, hatred and delusion through 
      following the Noble Eightfold Path and the cultivation of wisdom and 
      insight. India is the birth-place of Theravada Buddhism and its art and 
      architecture. There the artists and builders of Buddhist structures sought 
      to portray the historical Buddha, and his disciples in the context of 
      Theravadin beliefs and ideals. The chosen medium for this was the Buddha 
      rupa or image and was developed in India. The earliest image we know of is 
      actually a coin struck in the reign of King Kanishak. It shows a robed, 
      standing Buddha. His head is surrounded by a halo, symbolizing his 
      Enlightenment, and his hair is twisted into a top-knot, and one of his 
      hands is raised in the gesture of blessing. The art of Buddhist sculpture 
      and of Buddha images in particular, originated in India, and two distinct 
      styles were created. One in the north, in Gandhara, where the image makers 
      looked to the Greco-Roman tradition for inspiration. </P>
      <P>The second style of Buddha image was directly influenced by the earlier 
      Indian style of art peculiar to the south. The first images that we know 
      of appeared in Mathura. The Mathura Buddha images had straight hair tied 
      up in a top knot, and were garbed in the traditional Indian dhoti. The 
      Mathura Buddhas are often shown, smiling peacefully. As these images were 
      most commonly made of sandstone they are much softer in contour and more 
      rounded and curved than those made in the north. Many early Indian 
      Buddhist images show the Buddha as having the thirty-two marks of a Buddha 
      and with his hands placed in various positions displaying gestures of 
      blessing, meditation and teaching. The number of Buddha images and 
      Buddhist architectural structures which survive in India is very great 
      indeed, but in all of the faces of every image, and in the art and design 
      of every stupa. and temple or rock-cave vihara traces of the Buddha-Dhamma 
      are visible. </P>
      <P>As Buddhist Art developed and spread outside India the two basic styles 
      were imitated as for example in China where the Gandhara style was 
      imitated in images made of bronze. Gradually the faces on these images 
      were made to look more and more Chinese and are even dressed in long 
      flowing, robes and shawls, after the Chinese fashion. In those countries 
      where Sarvastivada or Theravada Buddhism took hold and remained, such as 
      Afghanistan, Laos, and Sri Lanka, famous for its enormous reclining 
      Buddha. and in Siam, modern Thailand, which is famous for its exquisite 
      and graceful 'Walking Buddhas' or in the temples and shrines of the 
      ancient capital city of Pagan in Burma now known as Myanmar with its many 
      temples, and in the temples of Malaysia, too the Buddha images housed 
      there, show the influence of the early types of Indian Buddha image.</P>
      <P>Other notable surviving examples of Buddhist art which mirror the 
      Theravada tradition are to be found at Lumbini in Nepal, the site of the 
      Buddha's birth and in India at Bodh Gaya, Saranath. Kushinagara, Nalanda 
      and at the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, Myanmar, and also at the massive 
      temple complex at Angkor Wat in Cambodia and the very simply, designed yet 
      impressive Temple of the Sacred Tooth in Kandy, Sri Lanka.</P>
      <P>The main difference between the Theravada and Mahayana Schools of Art 
      is their subject matter. This difference was a direct reflection of the 
      different ideals and beliefs held by the two schools. For the Theravadins 
      the ideal is the Arahat, who like a Buddha seeks to eradicate suffering 
      and rebirth in Samsara through renouncing the world, and through the 
      eradication of greed, hatred and delusion. This achievement is made 
      possible if one follows the Middle Way and the Noble Eightfold Path as 
      taught by the Buddha Gotama. Nibbana is the Theravadin's final goal and is 
      attainable through the practice of insight. These beliefs and ideals form 
      the subject matter of Theravada Buddhist Art. On the other hand, although 
      the followers of the Mahayana School of Buddhism uphold the goal of 
      Nirvana also and deliverance from endless suffering and rebirth in 
      Samsara, they have a different spiritual hero. Their hero is not the 
      Buddha Gotama, but the Bodhisattva. A Bodhisattva is a kind of divine 
      saviour, whose role is to aid any being desirous of deliverance and 
      Nirvana. In Mahayana Buddhism anyone can become enlightened and 
      renunciation of the world in order to win Arahatship is not absolutely 
      necessary, but the practice of specific rites and rituals and meditations 
      and visualizations is. These spiritual practices will aid the practitioner 
      in purifying the mind and will also attract the help of the Bodhisattva. 
      The Mahayana School recognised the historical Buddha Gotama, the 
      Shakyamuni, but raised him to the level of a god. He then became but one 
      of many, many divine Buddhas and was eventually regarded as a powerful 
      emanation of the Supreme Essence. It was these celestial Buddhas that were 
      portrayed in Mahayanist Art and very beautifully too in countries such as 
      China, Vietnam, Japan and Korea and of course Tibet where the Mahayana 
      Tradition is followed. </P>
      <P>As the Mahayanist school of thought evolved it developed many separate 
      sects which attracted many followers such as the Zen sects of China and 
      Japan. As has been said earlier, Mahayana Buddhism does not uphold the 
      ideal of the Arahat but the Bodhisattva ideal and along with the Cosmic 
      and celestial Buddhas form the subject matter of Mahayanist Art as well as 
      the populous pantheon which surrounds the many Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 
      that belong to the Mahayana Tradition. The word, Bodhisattva, means, 'a 
      being of wisdom' and is a being whose perfections are fulfilled and who 
      stands on the threshold of Nirvana but postpones the attainment of it out 
      of compassion for all other unenlightened beings trapped in Samsara. The 
      greatest virtue of the Bodhisattvas, and there are many, both male and 
      female, is their compassion in contrast to the supreme wisdom of the 
      historical Buddha. This boundless compassion it is what makes a 
      Bodhisattva a saviour and not a human role-model as was the Buddha Gotama. 
      It is also believed that anyone can become enlightened who asks for their 
      help and who practises all the special mediation exercises and performs 
      all the relevant rituals such as chanting. Mahayana Buddhism is much more 
      mystical than Theravada Buddhism, and therefore so is its art. The figures 
      we see depicted in Mahayanist Art such as Maitreya, Avalokiteshvara, 
      Chenrezig, Manjushri, Tara and Kuan Yin, are all Bodhisattvas. Their 
      beauty and other-worldliness is inexpressable in words, but impressively 
      and well conveyed through the medium of art. We can see them portrayed on 
      wall paintings, on silk scrolls or their images delicately carved of wood, 
      and also notably in the Buddhist caves of China such as those at Longmen, 
      and in the surviving temples of Tibet and the Tibetan exile's place of 
      refuge at Dharmasala in India and in the Mahayanist Buddhist holy places 
      of Nepal, Vietnam, Mongolia and in the Buddhist places of Indonesia, in 
      the east as well as in the many Tibetan centres which in recent times have 
      been founded in the West, such as Samye-Ling, in Scotland.</P>
      <P>Throughout the history of Buddhism the supporters of both these major 
      schools have provided countless fine examples of Buddhist art and built 
      magnificent stupas and temples. As one of the functions of Art is to 
      mirror and another is to inspire then most certainly, the ideals and 
      beliefs mirrored in both the major schools of Buddhist Art are a source of 
      inspiration and encouragement to anyone wishing to follow the spiritual 
      beliefs and ideals they reflect.</P>
      <P>Both Buddhist Traditions made a huge and impressive contribution to 
      mankind which can be chronicled for over two thousand years and follows 
      the progress the Buddha-Dhamma made as it spread outwards from India in 
      all directions. To better appreciate just how much Buddhism influenced the 
      world and contributed to the world of art and architecture, it is 
      necessary to understand how and why Buddhism spread as far as it did. 
      Buddhism owes its success and its many converts to the catholicity of its 
      appeal and its promise of deliverance from suffering. This is true of both 
      traditions. It also was widely adopted and in some case fully integrated 
      into an existing culture as was the case in Japan. And this success was 
      possible because of the non-coercive approach of its missionaries. 
      However, Buddhists did sometimes suffer persecution and even death and was 
      the case in India, Tibet and China. Buddhism was also successful because 
      at various times in its history, it enjoyed royal patronage, as for 
      example, that of the great Mauryan King Asoka and some of the later rulers 
      of India including the Pala Kings, the last Buddhist Kings of India. 
      Outside India it was embraced by King Tissa of Ceylon, in 247 B.C.E., the 
      Mon ruler of Thaton. and later in 1056 by the Burmese King Anawrahta the 
      founder of Pagan, in Siam in the eleventh century by King Rama Khamheng 
      and in 1327 by Cambodia's King Jayavarman VII who ruled from his capital 
      at Angkor. It was also adopted by the rulers of Laos and in the eight 
      century in Indonesia by King Sailendra who sponsored the building of the 
      largest Buddhist monument in the world, Borobodur. This devotion to 
      Buddhism and the enthusiasm for Buddhist culture shown by these royal 
      converts and most of their subjects was sincere and the world of art and 
      architecture was all the richer for it. </P>
      <P>Another significant factor to influence the spread of Buddhism and 
      indirectly the development of Buddhist Art and Architecture was the 
      tremendous volume of trade which existed in the ancient world most notably 
      along the Silk Road, which was a trade route not only for goods but for 
      ideas as well. The spread of Buddhism in its homeland of northern India 
      began the day the Buddha and the first sixty Arahats went forth to preach 
      the Dhamma. &quot;For the gain of many, for the welfare of many, in compassion 
      for the world.&quot; Although Buddhism in India was to die out as a result of 
      the revival of Hinduism and in the aftermath of the Moslem invasions in 
      the seventh century, it was able to spread, and evolve and survive in many 
      other places since. The visible proof of this is to be see in the many 
      examples of Buddhist Architecture. The size of Buddhism's contribution to 
      the world of architecture is enormous. There are two basic types of 
      structure found in those places where Buddhism spread and developed and 
      they are the Vihara and the Stupa. The word vihara, means &quot;an abode&quot;, and 
      its function was two-fold. It was intended to house Buddha images and art 
      and also to serve as a dwelling place for monks. King Bimbisara donated 
      the first Vihara, Veluvana at Rajagaha. to the Buddha himself and his 
      disciples. This was a monastery sited in a Bamboo Grove. Much later on 
      monks would dwell in the shelter of India's caves. One of the most famous 
      cave complexes is the magnificently embellished caves at Ajanta, with its 
      brightly coloured Buddhist murals. Another impressive cave complex is in 
      Afghanistan. As the Vihara evolved in style it was adapted to the climate 
      and terrain of the countries to which Buddhism spread and its design 
      changed and evolved and eventually reflected the cultural characteristics 
      of the lands where either Mahayana Buddhism or Theravada Buddhism had 
      taken root and flourished. The more modern styles of Buddhist temple 
      remain a type of vihara. These structures are made from a variety of 
      materials such as stone in India and Sri Lanka, and from wood as can be 
      see at Kyoto and Nara, in Japan. Brick was also used and some of the 
      surviving temples of Pagan are made of brick. Sandstone is the material 
      used in the building of Malaysian temples.</P>
      <P>The second type of Buddhist structure is the Stupa and is itself an 
      object of worship as it was intended to serve as a relic chamber for the 
      Buddha's remains. The earliest examples of the Buddhist stupa were raised 
      in India, as for example the dome shaped stupa at Sanchi, the ancient 
      Dhamekh Stupa at Sarnath and those built inside the caves at Ellora and 
      Ajanta. In time the basic Indian stupa-design evolved into the Dagoba in 
      Sri Lanka, the Chorten in Tibet and the Pagodas of China, Korea and Japan. 
      One of the finest examples of all is the splendid Shwedagon Pagoda in 
      Yangon. As with Buddhist Art, the materials used in the building of 
      viharas and temples and the various types of stupa and pagoda varied and 
      depended on the materials available in the places where they were built. 
      So we find some stupas are built of marble or other types of local stone 
      or brick and even wood, as was the Goose Pagoda at Chagan in China. 
      Happily in the west where Buddhism is becoming a very popular religion, 
      the artists and architects who work on Buddhist building projects turn to 
      the rich and varied legacy of Buddhist Art and Architecture for their 
      inspiration.</P>
      <P>All the Buddhist structures that were ever built by their very 
      existence contributed something to the world and are holy places, places 
      of learning and sanctuary for the people who were to use them and the 
      repositories of some of the greatest treasures of Buddhist Art. They were 
      and those that have survived continue to be a source of personal 
      inspiration for all who saw them either in person long ago or even see 
      them depicted in a drawing or a photograph these days. As was said, 
      earlier Buddhist Art and Architecture mirrors the beliefs, ideas and 
      ideals of both the Mahayana and Theravada traditions.</P>
      <P>Buddhism in India together with its art and architecture reached its 
      zenith during the Gupta dynasty which was established in northern India in 
      320 A.D. It was to last into the seventh century. The best known examples 
      of Buddhist Art are from this period and were to form the standard of 
      comparison for all subsequent Buddhist art and architecture both in India 
      and in the rest of the Asian countries where it spread, took root and 
      flourished. The Gupta period also saw the advent of Buddhism's decline in 
      India. It slowly waned for three reasons. First was the rise of Mahayana 
      Buddhism in India which was to bring Buddhism closer to Hinduism. The 
      second reason was that Hinduism enjoyed the support of Kings and underwent 
      a revival. This was so successful that in time it was to absorb the now 
      strongly Mahayana influenced Buddhism. The third reason for Buddhism's 
      decline was the various Moslem invasions, the last of which was waged in 
      the seventh century A.D. and was directly responsible for Buddhism's slow 
      decline and fall. However, at this time as we shall see Buddhism spread 
      out of India to Nepal, later on to Sri Lanka and then eastwards to South 
      East Asia and survived.</P>
      <P>In short, Buddhism and its art and architecture was to spread 
      geographically outwards from India in two directions. One was to the 
      northwest into Afghanistan, Iran and then along the Silk Road to Central 
      Asia and then further east to China, Korea and Japan. This development 
      came about not only because of the activity of Buddhist Missionaries, but 
      also because of the work of those Indian traders and the migration of 
      those Indian emigres who settled in Central Asia. These people carried 
      both Hinduism, and Buddhism and much of Indian culture with them wherever 
      they went. This is obvious when we look at the wealth of Indian and 
      Buddhist Art which was created there and can still be seen, today. 
      However, in China, Korea and Japan Buddhism did not supplant the existing 
      cultures but was totally integrated into them.</P>
      <P>At the end of India's Gupta period Buddhism was taken to Nepal, Sri 
      Lanka and to the South East Asian Mainland. As I said before, this outward 
      movement was the direct result of the changes taking place in India at the 
      time. Indian commerce also played a part, in Buddhism's spread to these 
      places and were to be greatly influenced not only by Indian culture but 
      also by the work of Indian merchants and monks, who brought with them not 
      only religion but also their country's civilization - writing, art, 
      architecture and methods of ruling as well. The influence of Hinduism was 
      to touch these places before that of Buddhism did, but in time the two 
      coexisted. In the end, however, Hinduism could not endure for long abroad 
      because of the very rigid caste system it supported. Nevertheless, traces 
      of Hindu culture have survived in these places and testify to the great 
      contribution India made over the centuries to all of the Asian world and 
      is still going on. Nowadays India's culture is being carried abroad by the 
      large numbers of Asians emigrating to Australia, Europe, Africa and the 
      United States of America and South America. They are the current carriers 
      of Buddhism and its fourth jewel Buddhist Art and Architecture.</P>
      <P>Now, I would like to tell you a true story. The late John Blofeld, a 
      Buddhist scholar and writer of great repute once told the story of how he 
      first became attracted to Buddhism when he was young. One day, he spied a 
      strange statue in shop in Brighton. Sussex and his curiosity was awakened. 
      When he asked what it was, the shop-keeper kindly told him it was a statue 
      of a Buddha. Although, he could not afford to by it then and there, he 
      very much wanted to. For days he could not get the image with its calm and 
      peaceful expression out of his mind. As soon as he was able to afford it 
      he bought it and it became his most treasured possession and kept it with 
      him always. Seeing that statue, was for him a turning-point in his life. 
      Later he began a life-long investigation into Buddhism.</P>
      <P>Buddhism has been making contributions to the world's cultures through 
      its teachings, its art and architecture for more than two millennium long.
