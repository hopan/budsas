<P>Monks, these five future dangers are just enough, when considered, for a
monk living in the wilderness -- uncomplacent, ardent, and resolute -- to
live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the
as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. What five?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> (1) There is the case where a monk living in the wilderness reminds 
himself of this: I am now living alone in the wilderness. While I am living
alone in the wilderness a snake might bite me, a scorpion might sting me, a
centipede might bite me. That would be how my death would come about. That
would be an obstruction for me. So let me make an effort for the attaining of
the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization
of the as-yet-unrealized.
<P> This is the first future danger that is just enough, when considered, 
 for a monk living in the wilderness -- uncomplacent, ardent, and resolute --
to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the
as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

<P> (2) Furthermore, the monk living in the wilderness reminds himself of 
this: I am now living alone in the wilderness. While I am living alone in the
wilderness, stumbling, I might fall; my food, digested, might trouble me; my
bile might be provoked, my phlegm... piercing wind forces (in the body) might
be provoked. That would be how my death would come about. That would be an
obstruction for me. So let me make an effort for the attaining of the
as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of
the as-yet-unrealized.
<P> This is the second future danger that is just enough, when considered, 
 for a monk living in the wilderness -- uncomplacent, ardent, and resolute
-- to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the
as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

<P> (3) Furthermore, the monk living in the wilderness reminds himself of 
this: I am now living alone in the wilderness. While I am living alone in the
wilderness, I might meet up with vicious beasts: a lion or a tiger or a
leopard or a bear or a hyena. They might take my life. That would be how my
death would come about. That would be an obstruction for me. So let me make
an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the
as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.
<P> This is the third future danger that is just enough, when considered, 
 for a monk living in the wilderness -- uncomplacent, ardent, and resolute --
to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the
as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

<P> (4) Furthermore, the monk living in the wilderness reminds himself of 
this: I am now living alone in the wilderness. While I am living alone in the
wilderness, I might meet up with youths on their way to committing a crime or
on their way back. They might take my life. That would be how my death would
come about. That would be an obstruction for me. So let me make an effort for
the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached,
the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.
<P> This is the fourth future danger that is just enough, when considered, 
 for a monk living in the wilderness -- uncomplacent, ardent, and resolute
-- to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the
as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

<P> (5) Furthermore, the monk living in the wilderness reminds himself of 
this: I am now living alone in the wilderness. And in the wilderness are
vicious non-human beings (spirits). They might take my life. That would be
how my death would come about. That would be an obstruction for me. So let me
make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of
the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.
<P>
 This is the fifth future danger that is just enough, when considered, for a
monk living in the wilderness -- uncomplacent, ardent, and resolute -- to
live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the
as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

<P>Monks, these five future dangers are just enough, when considered, for a
monk -- uncomplacent, ardent, and resolute -- to live for the attaining of
the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 (1) There is the case where a monk reminds himself of this: At present I am
young, black-haired, endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage
of life. The time will come, though, when this body is beset by old age. When
one is overcome with old age and decay, it is not easy to pay attention to
the Buddha's teachings. It is not easy to reside in isolated forest or
wilderness dwellings. Before this unwelcome, disagreeable, displeasing thing
happens, let me first make an effort for the attaining of the
as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of
the as-yet-unrealized, so that -- endowed with that Dhamma -- I will live in
peace even when old.
<P>
 This is the first future danger that is just enough, when considered, for a
monk -- uncomplacent, ardent, and resolute -- to live for the attaining of
the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization
of the as-yet-unrealized.

<P>
 (2) Furthermore, the monk reminds himself of this: At present I am free from
illness and discomfort, endowed with good digestion: not too cold, not too
hot, of medium strength and tolerance. The time will come, though, when this
body is beset with illness. When one is overcome with illness, it is not easy
to pay attention to the Buddha's teachings. It is not easy to reside in
isolated forest or wilderness dwellings. Before this unwelcome, disagreeable,
displeasing thing happens, let me first make an effort for the attaining of
the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the 
realization of the as-yet-unrealized, so that -- endowed with that Dhamma --
I will live in peace even when ill.
<P>
 This is the second future danger that is just enough, when considered, for
a monk -- uncomplacent, ardent, and resolute -- to live for the attaining of
the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization
of the as-yet-unrealized.

<P>
 (3) Furthermore, the monk reminds himself of this: At present food is 
plentiful, alms are easy to come by. It is easy to maintain oneself by 
gleanings and patronage. The time will come, though, when there is famine:
Food is scarce, alms are hard to come by, and it is not easy to maintain
oneself by gleanings and patronage. When there is famine, people will
congregate where food is plentiful. There they will live packed and crowded
together. When one is living packed and crowded together, it is not easy to
pay attention to the Buddha's teachings. It is not easy to reside in isolated
forest or wilderness dwellings. Before this unwelcome, disagreeable,
displeasing thing happens, let me first make an effort for the attaining of
the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization
of the as-yet-unrealized, so that -- endowed with that Dhamma -- I will live 
 in peace even when there is famine.
<P>
 This is the third future danger that is just enough, when considered, for a
monk -- uncomplacent, ardent, and resolute -- to live for the attaining of
the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization
of the as-yet-unrealized.

<P>
 (4) Furthermore, the monk reminds himself of this: At present people are in
harmony, on friendly terms, without quarreling, like milk mixed with water,
viewing one another with eyes of affection. The time will come, though, when
there is danger and an invasion of savage tribes. Taking power, they will
surround the countryside. When there is danger, people will congregate where
it is safe. There they will live packed and crowded together. When one is
living packed and crowded together, it is not easy to pay attention to the
Buddha's teachings. It is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness
dwellings. Before this unwelcome, disagreeable, displeasing thing happens,
let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the 
 reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized,
so that -- endowed with that Dhamma -- I will live in peace even when there
is danger.
<P>
 This is the fourth future danger that is just enough, when considered, for
a monk -- uncomplacent, ardent, and resolute -- to live for the attaining of
the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization
of the as-yet-unrealized.

<P>
 (5) Furthermore, the monk reminds himself of this: At present the Sangha -- in
harmony, on friendly terms, without quarreling -- lives in comfort with a
single recitation. The time will come, though, when the Sangha splits. When
the Sangha is split, it is not easy to pay attention to the Buddha's
teachings. It is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness
dwellings. Before this unwelcome, disagreeable, displeasing thing happens,
let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the
reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized,
so that -- endowed with that Dhamma -- I will live in peace even when the
Sangha is split.
<P>
 This is the fifth future danger that is just enough, when considered, for a
monk -- uncomplacent, ardent, and resolute -- to live for the attaining of
the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization
of the as-yet-unrealized.

<P>Monks, these five future dangers, unarisen at present, will arise in the
future. Be alert to them and, being alert, work to get rid of them. What
five?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 (1) There will be, in the course of the future, monks undeveloped in bodily
conduct, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, undeveloped in
discernment. They -- being undeveloped in bodily conduct, undeveloped in
virtue, undeveloped in mind, undeveloped in discernment -- will give full
ordination to others and will not be able to discipline them in heightened
virtue, heightened mind, heightened discernment. These too will then be
undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment. They -- being
undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment -- will give
full ordination to still others and will not be able to discipline them in 
heightened virtue, heightened mind, heightened discernment. These too will
then be undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment. Thus
from corrupt Dhamma comes corrupt discipline; from corrupt discipline,
corrupt Dhamma.
<P>
 This, monks, is the first future danger, unarisen at present, that will
arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it.

<P>
 (2) And again, there will be in the course of the future monks undeveloped in
bodily conduct, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, undeveloped in
discernment. They -- being undeveloped in bodily conduct, undeveloped in
virtue, undeveloped in mind, undeveloped in discernment -- will take on
others as students and will not be able to discipline them in heightened
virtue, heightened mind, heightened discernment. These too will then be
undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment. They -- being
undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment -- will take
on still others as students and will not be able to discipline them in
heightened virtue, heightened mind, heightened discernment. These too will
then be undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment. 
Thus from corrupt Dhamma comes corrupt discipline; from corrupt discipline,
corrupt Dhamma.
<P>
 This, monks, is the second future danger, unarisen at present, that will
arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it.

<P>
 (3) And again, there will be in the course of the future monks undeveloped in
bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment. They -- being undeveloped in
bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment -- when giving a talk on
higher Dhamma or a talk composed of questions and answers, will fall into
dark mental states without being aware of it. Thus from corrupt Dhamma comes
corrupt discipline; from corrupt discipline, corrupt Dhamma. 
<P>
 This, monks, is the third future danger, unarisen at present, that will
arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it.

<P>
 (4) And again, there will be in the course of the future monks undeveloped in
bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment. They -- being undeveloped in
bodily conduct... virtue.... mind... discernment -- will not listen when
discourses that are words of the Tathagata -- deep, profound, transcendent,
connected with the Void -- are being recited. They will not lend ear, will
not set their hearts on knowing them, will not regard these teachings as
worth grasping or mastering. But they will listen when discourses that are
literary works -- the works of poets, elegant in sound, elegant in rhetoric,
the work of outsiders, words of disciples -- are recited. They will lend ear
and set their hearts on knowing them. They will regard these teachings as 
worth grasping and mastering. Thus from corrupt Dhamma comes corrupt 
discipline; from corrupt discipline, corrupt Dhamma. 
<P>
 This, monks, is the fourth future danger, unarisen at present, that will
arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it.

<P>
 (5) And again, there will be in the course of the future monks undeveloped in
bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment. They -- being undeveloped in
bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment -- will become elders living
in luxury, lethargic, foremost in falling back, shirking the duties of
solitude. They will not make an effort for the attaining of the
as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of
the as-yet-unrealized. They will become an example for later generations, who
will become luxurious in their living, lethargic, foremost in falling back,
shirking the duties of solitude, and who will not make an effort for the
attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the
 realization of the as-yet-unrealized. Thus from corrupt Dhamma comes 
corrupt discipline; from corrupt discipline, corrupt Dhamma. 
<P>
 This, monks, is the fifth future danger, unarisen at present, that will
arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it.

<P>
 (1) There will be, in the course of the future, monks desirous of fine robes.
They, desirous of fine robes, will neglect the practice of wearing cast-off
cloth; will neglect isolated forest and wilderness dwellings; will move to
towns, cities, and royal capitals, taking up residence there. For the sake of
a robe they will do many kinds of unseemly, inappropriate things.

 (2) Furthermore, in the course of the future there will be monks desirous of
fine food. They, desirous of fine food, will neglect the practice of going
for alms; will neglect isolated forest and wilderness dwellings; will move to
towns, cities, and royal capitals, taking up residence there and searching
out the tip-top tastes with the tip of the tongue. For the sake of food they
will do many kinds of unseemly, inappropriate things.

 This, monks, is the second future danger, unarisen at present, that will
arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it.

<P>
 (3) Furthermore, in the course of the future there will be monks desirous of
fine lodgings. They, desirous of fine lodgings, will neglect the practice of
living in the wilds; will neglect isolated forest and wilderness dwellings;
will move to towns, cities, and royal capitals, taking up residence there.
For the sake of lodgings they will do many kinds of unseemly, inappropriate
things.
<P>
 This, monks, is the third future danger, unarisen at present, that will
arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it.

<P>
 (4) Furthermore, in the course of the future there will be monks who will live
in close association with nuns, female probationers, and female novices. As
they interact with nuns, female probationers, and female novices, they can be
expected either to lead the holy life dissatisfied or to fall into one of the
grosser offenses, leaving the training, returning to a lower way of life.
<P>
 This, monks, is the fourth future danger, unarisen at present, that will
arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it.

<P>
 (5) Furthermore, in the course of the future there will be monks who will live
in close association with monastery attendants and novices. As they interact
with monastery attendants and novices, they can be expected to live intent on
storing up all kinds of possessions and to stake out crops and fields.
