        <p><em><b>Translator's note:</b></em><em> The Buddha
        praised Dhammadinna the nun as the foremost Dhamma
        teacher among his nun disciples. In this discourse she
        answers questions put to her by a layman -- Visakha --
        who, according to the commentary, was her former husband,
        a merchant of Rajagaha, and a non-returner. </em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr width="25%">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was
    staying near <a name="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a> in the Bamboo
    Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Then <a name="visakha">Visakha</a>
    the lay follower went to <a name="dhammadinna">Dhammadinna</a>
    the nun and, on arrival, having bowed down to her, sat to one
    side. As he was sitting there he said to her,
    &quot;'Self-identification. Self-identification,' it is said,
    lady. Which self-identification is described by the Blessed
    One?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;There are these five clinging-aggregates, friend
    Visakha: form as a clinging-aggregate, feeling as a
    clinging-aggregate, perception as a clinging-aggregate,
    fabrications as a clinging-aggregate, consciousness as a
    clinging-aggregate. These five clinging-aggregates are the
    self-identification described by the Blessed One.&quot; </p>
    <p>Saying, &quot;Yes, lady,&quot; Visakha the lay follower
    delighted and rejoiced in what Dhammadinna the nun had said.
    Then he asked her a further question: &quot;'The origination
    of self-identification, the origination of
    self-identification,' it is said, lady. Which origination of
    self-identification is described by the Blessed One?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;The craving that makes for further becoming --
    accompanied by passion and delight, relishing now here and
    now there -- i.e., craving for sensual pleasure, craving for
    becoming, craving for non-becoming: This, friend Visakha, is
    the origination of self-identification described by the
    Blessed One.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;'The cessation of self-identification, the cessation
    of self-identification,' it is said, lady. Which cessation of
    self-identification is described by the Blessed One?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;The remainderless fading and cessation,
    renunciation, relinquishment, release, and letting go of that
    very craving: This, friend Visakha, is the cessation of
    self-identification described by the Blessed One.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;'The way of practice leading to the cessation of
    self-identification, the way of practice leading to the
    cessation of self-identification,' it is said, lady. Which
    way of practice leading to the cessation of
    self-identification is described by the Blessed One?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Precisely this noble eightfold path -- right view,
    right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood,
    right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration: This,
    friend Visakha, is the way of practice leading to the
    cessation of self-identification described by the Blessed
    One.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Is it the case, lady, that clinging is the same
    thing as the five clinging-aggregates or is it something
    separate?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Friend Visakha, neither is clinging the same thing
    as the five clinging-aggregates, nor is it something
    separate. Whatever desire and passion there is with regard to
    the five clinging-aggregates, that is the clinging
    there.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;But, lady, how does self-identification come
    about?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;There is the case, friend Visakha, where an
    uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person -- who has no regard for
    noble ones, is not well-versed or disciplined in their
    Dhamma; who has no regard for men of integrity, is not
    well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma -- assumes form
    (the body) to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or
    form as in the self, or the self as in form. </p>
    <p>&quot;He assumes feeling to be the self.... </p>
    <p>&quot;He assumes perception to be the self.... </p>
    <p>&quot;He assumes (mental) fabrications to be the self.... </p>
    <p>&quot;He assumes consciousness to be the self, or the self
    as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self,
    or the self as in consciousness. This is how
    self-identification comes about.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;But, lady, how does self-identification not come
    about?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;There is the case where a well-instructed noble
    disciple -- who has regard for noble ones, is well-versed and
    disciplined in their Dhamma; who has regard for men of
    integrity, is well-versed and disciplined in their Dhamma --
    does not assume form to be the self, or the self as
    possessing form, or form as in the self, or the self as in
    form. </p>
    <p>&quot;He does not assume feeling to be the self.... </p>
    <p>&quot;He does not assume perception to be the self.... </p>
    <p>&quot;He does not assume fabrications to be the self.... </p>
    <p>&quot;He does not assume consciousness to be the self, or
    the self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in
    the self, or the self as in consciousness. This is how
    self-identification does not come about.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Now, again, lady, what is the noble eightfold
    path?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;This is the noble eightfold path, friend Visakha:
    right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right
    livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right
    concentration.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Is the noble eightfold path fabricated or
    unfabricated?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;The noble eightfold path is fabricated.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;<a name="3agg">And are the three</a> aggregates [of
    virtue, concentration, and discernment] included under the
    noble eightfold path, lady, or is the noble eightfold path
    included under the three aggregates?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;The three aggregates are not included under the
    noble eightfold path, friend Visakha, but the noble eightfold
    path is included under the three aggregates. Right speech,
    right action, and right livelihood come under the aggregate
    of virtue. Right effort, right mindfulness, and right
    concentration come under the aggregate of concentration.
    Right view and right resolve come under the aggregate of
    discernment.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Now what is concentration, lady, what qualities are
    its themes, what qualities are its requisites, and what is
    its development?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Singleness of mind is concentration, friend Visakha;
    the four frames of reference are its themes; the four right
    exertions are its requisites; and any cultivation,
    development, and pursuit of these qualities is its
    development.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Now, lady, what are fabrications?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;These three fabrications, friend Visakha:
    bodily-fabrications, verbal fabrications, and mental
    fabrications.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;But what are bodily-fabrications? What are verbal
    fabrications? What are mental fabrications?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;In-and-out breaths are bodily fabrications. Directed
    thought and evaluation are verbal fabrications. Perceptions
    and feelings are mental fabrications.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;But why are in-and-out breaths bodily fabrications?
    Why are directed thought and evaluation verbal fabrications?
    Why are perceptions and feelings mental fabrications?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;In-and-out breaths are bodily; these are things tied
    up with the body. That's why in-and-out breaths are bodily
    fabrications. Having first directed one's thoughts and made
    an evaluation, one then breaks out into speech. That's why
    directed thought and evaluation are verbal fabrications.
    Perceptions and feelings are mental; these are things tied up
    with the mind. That's why perceptions and feelings are mental
    fabrications.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Now, lady, how does the attainment of the cessation
    of perception and feeling come about?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;The thought does not occur to a monk as he is
    attaining the cessation of perception and feeling that 'I am
    about to attain the cessation of perception and feeling' or
    that 'I am attaining the cessation of perception and feeling'
    or that 'I have attained the cessation of perception and
    feeling.' Instead, the way his mind has previously been
    developed leads him to that state.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;But when a monk is attaining the cessation of
    perception and feeling, which things cease first: bodily
    fabrications, verbal fabrications, or mental
    fabrications?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;When a monk is attaining the cessation of perception
    and feeling, friend Visakha, verbal fabrications cease first,
    then bodily fabrications, then mental fabrications.&quot;[<a
    href="#n1" name="1">1</a>] </p>
    <p>&quot;Now, lady, how does emergence from the cessation of
    perception and feeling come about?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;The thought does not occur to a monk as he is
    emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling that 'I
    am about to emerge from the cessation of perception and
    feeling' or that 'I am emerging from the cessation of
    perception and feeling' or that 'I have emerged from the
    cessation of perception and feeling.' Instead, the way his
    mind has previously been developed leads him to that
    state.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;But when a monk is emerging from the cessation of
    perception and feeling, which things arise first: bodily
    fabrications, verbal fabrications, or mental
    fabrications?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;When a monk is attaining the cessation of perception
    and feeling, friend Visakha, mental fabrications arise first,
    then bodily fabrications, then verbal fabrications.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;When a monk has emerged from the cessation of
    perception and feeling, lady, how many contacts make
    contact?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;When a monk has emerged from the cessation of
    perception and feeling, friend Visakha, three contacts make
    contact: contact with emptiness, contact with the signless,
    and contact with the undirected.&quot;[<a href="#n2" name="2">2</a>]
    </p>
    <p>&quot;When a monk has emerged from the cessation of
    perception and feeling, lady, to what does his mind lean, to
    what does it tend, to what does it incline?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;When a monk has emerged from the cessation of
    perception and feeling, friend Visakha, his mind leans to
    seclusion, tends to seclusion, inclines to seclusion.&quot;[<a
    href="#n3" name="3">3</a>] </p>
    <p>&quot;Now, lady, how many kinds of feeling are
    there?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;These three kinds of feeling: pleasant feeling,
    painful feeling, and neither-pleasant-nor-painful
    feeling.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;What is pleasant feeling? What is painful feeling?
    What is neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Whatever is experienced physically or mentally as
    pleasant and gratifying is pleasant feeling. Whatever is
    experienced physically or mentally as painful and hurting is
    painful feeling. Whatever is experienced physically or
    mentally as neither gratifying nor hurting is
    neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;In what way is pleasant feeling pleasant, lady, and
    in what way painful?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Pleasant feeling is pleasant in remaining, and
    painful in changing, friend Visakha. Painful feeling is
    painful in remaining and pleasant in changing.
    Neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling is pleasant in occurring
    together with knowledge, and painful in occurring without
    knowledge.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;What latent tendency lies latent in pleasant
    feeling? What latent tendency lies latent in painful feeling?
    What latent tendency lies latent in
    neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;The latent tendency to passion lies latent in
    pleasant feeling. The latent tendency to irritation lies
    latent in painful feeling. The latent tendency to ignorance
    lies latent in neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Does the latent tendency to passion lie latent in
    all pleasant feeling? Does the latent tendency to irritation
    lie latent in all painful feeling? Does the latent tendency
    to ignorance lie latent in all neither-pleasant-nor-painful
    feeling?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;No....&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;What is to be abandoned in pleasant feeling? What is
    to be abandoned in painful feeling? What is to be abandoned
    in neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;The latent tendency to passion is to be abandoned in
    pleasant feeling. The latent tendency to irritation is to be
    abandoned in painful feeling. The latent tendency to
    ignorance is to be abandoned in neither-pleasant-nor-painful
    feeling.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Is the latent tendency to passion to be abandoned in
    all pleasant feeling? Is the latent tendency to irritation to
    be abandoned in all painful feeling? Is the latent tendency
    to ignorance to be abandoned in all
    neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;No .... There is the case where a monk -- quite
    withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful
    qualities -- enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture
    and pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed
    thought and evaluation. With that he abandons passion. No
    latent tendency to passion lies latent there.[<a href="#n4"
    name="4">4</a>] There is the case where a monk considers, 'O
    when will I enter and remain in the sphere that those who are
    noble now enter and remain in?' And as he thus nurses this
    yearning for the unexcelled liberations, there arises within
    him sorrow based on that yearning. With that he abandons
    irritation. No latent tendency to irritation lies latent
    there.[<a href="#n5" name="5">5</a>] There is the case where
    a monk, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain -- as with
    the earlier disappearance of elation and distress -- enters
    and remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity and
    mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. With that he abandons
    ignorance. No latent tendency to ignorance lies latent
    there.&quot;[<a href="#n6" name="6">6</a>] </p>
    <p>&quot;Now what, lady, lies on the other side of pleasant
    feeling?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Passion lies on the other side of pleasant
    feeling.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;And what lies on the other side of painful
    feeling?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Irritation lies on the other side of painful
    feeling.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;What lies on the other side of
    neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Ignorance lies on the other side of
    neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;What lies on the other side of ignorance?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Clear knowing lies on the other side of
    ignorance.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;What lies on the other side of clear knowing?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Release lies on the other side of clear
    knowing.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;What lies on the other side of release?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Unbinding lies on the other side of release.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;<a name="beyond">What</a> lies on the other side of
    Unbinding?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;You've gone too far, friend Visakha. You can't keep
    holding on up to the limit of questions. For the holy life
    plunges into Unbinding, culminates in Unbinding, has
    Unbinding as its final end. If you wish, go to the Blessed
    One and ask him the meaning of these things. Whatever he
    says, that's how you should remember it.&quot; </p>
    <p>Then Visakha the lay follower, delighting and rejoicing in
    what Dhammadinna the nun had said, bowed down to her and,
    keeping her to his right, went to the Blessed One. On
    arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, he sat to one
    side. As he was sitting there he told the Blessed One the
    full extent of the conversation he had had with Dhammadinna
    the nun. When this was said, the Blessed One said to him,
    &quot;Dhammadinna the nun is wise, Visakha, a woman of great
    discernment. If you had asked me those things, I would have
    answered you in the same way she did. That is the meaning of
    those things. That is how you should remember it.&quot; </p>
    <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Visakha the
    lay follower delighted in the Blessed One's words. </p>

        the commentary, they color one's first apprehension of
        Unbinding: a meditator who has been focusing on the theme
        of inconstancy will first apprehend Unbinding as
        signless; one who has been focusing on the theme of
        stress will first apprehend it as undirected; one who has
