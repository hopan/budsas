    <h3><font color="#000080">The Life and Teachings of the
    Buddha</font></h3>
    <p>Gautama the Buddha was born in northern India about 2,500
    years ago. The exact place of his birth is understood to be
    the Lumbini Garden, which nowadays lies just inside the
    border of the little Himalayan kingdom of Nepal.</p>
    <p>Gautama's father, Suddhodana, was the ruler of the tiny
    kingdom of the Sakyas. Naturally, he was delighted to have an
    heir who could follow him on to the throne. Naturally he was
    not very pleased when a wise man predicted, upon seeing the
    new arrival, that if he did not become a great world ruler he
    would become a great religious teacher. </p>
    <p>King Suddhodana knew that it would be experience of the
    hard, painful things of life that would turn Gautama's mind
    in the direction of religion, so he did everything in his
    power to keep them out of the young prince's life. Gautama
    was thus brought up in a sealed world of security and luxury.
    He lived in beautiful palaces, wore clothes of the most
    splendid materials, ate only the finest foods, and was
    generally entertained and waited upon in the best style.</p>
    <p>Gautama grew up and eventually married a young princess,
    Yasodhara, who bore him a son, Rahula. One day, however, he
    persuaded his groom, Channa, to drive him down to the nearby
    town, where he had not been till then. In all, he was to make
    four trips to the town which were to totally change his life.
    On the first trip, he met an old man, on the second a sick
    man, and on the third he met a party of people carrying a
    corpse to the cremation ground. Not having seen old age,
    sickness and death before, he was naturally deeply shocked.
    In fact so shocked that palace life was no longer pleasant or
    even bearable for him. He became very concerned with the fact
    of suffering and with finding a way of ending it. On a fourth
    trip to the town, he came upon a possible way of finding an
    answer to his problem. He met an ascetic, a holy man: one who
    had given up everything to follow the religious life. Despite
    having nothing, this man radiated a calmness that suggested
    to Gautama that he had somehow come to terms with the
    unpleasant fact of suffering.</p>
    <p>So Gautama decided to follow the example of the ascetic.
    He slipped out of the palace in the dead of night, exchanged
    his splendid silken robe for the simple orange one of a holy
    man, and cut off all his beautiful black hair. Then, carrying
    nothing but an alms bowl for people to put food in, he set
    off on his great search. Gautama went to all the most famous
    religious teachers of his day and learned all they had to
    teach. In the process, he subjected his body to great
    hardship and torment. He lived in terrifying forests, burning
    in the heat of the midday sun and freezing at night; he slept
    on beds of thorns; sometimes he lived in cemeteries; he
    starved himself until he became so thin that if he touched
    his stomach he could feel his backbone. But still he could
    not find an answer to his fundamental problem and he realised
    that if he kept on that way he would probably die before
    finding one.</p>
    <p>He therefore decided on a Middle Way between luxury and
    austerity. He took a little food much to the disgust of his
    fellow ascetics, who promptly left him. Then he sat himself
    on the immovable spot under a great Bo tree at a place
    nowadays called Bodh Gaya. He was determined to sit there
    until he found an answer or die trying.</p>
    <p>During the night of the full moon of May, Gautama passed
    into deep meditation and gained various kinds of new
    knowledge. He saw into his past lives; he saw how karma works
    (karma means volitional action: action done by choice or
    conscious decision; it has inevitable effects - good actions
    produce good results, bad actions produce bad results); he
    also saw how to overcome desire, attachment to existence and
    clinging to false or fixed views. Finally, as the morning
    star rose, he awakened as from a dream and could declare: 'It
    is liberated . . . birth is exhausted, the Holy Life has been
    lived out, what was to be done has been done, there is no
    more to come . . .' He was Gautama no more but The Buddha The
    Awakened One. He had seen things as they really are.
    Sometimes he is spoken of as having attained Nirvana. Nirvana
    is - the extinction of greed, the extinction of hate, the
    extinction of delusion. Its true nature cannot be put into
    words; a person must know it for himself in his own heart.</p>
    <p>At first the Buddha was reluctant to tell other people
    about what he had discovered. He felt they would not
    understand. He was persuaded, however, that there were some
    'with but a little dust in their eyes' who might benefit from
    being told. He therefore went to Isipatana (modern Sarnath,
    near Benares) where he delivered his first sermon in a deer
    park. Thus began a forty-five year teaching career.</p>
    <p>The Buddha taught all classes, conditions and types of men
    and women, and, indeed, all beings. The way that he taught is
    often called The Middle Way, because it teaches that we
    should try and keep to a middle path between all extremes.
    Soon the Buddha gathered around himself a following ready to
    give up everything to hear his teachings and put them into
    practice. Thus was born the Sangha: the community of Buddhist
    monks and nuns, which from the start was supported by a large
    lay community.</p>
    <p>As a man, the Buddha's life had eventually to end. He
    passed away when he was about 80 at Kushinara. Naturally, his
    followers were deeply grieved. His final words to them were:
    'Impermanent are all compounded things. Strive on heedfully.'
    Afterwards, he passed into what Buddhists call his
    parinirvana or Full nirvana, a state that can no more be
    conveyed in words than his first Nirvana.</p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">Fundamental Buddhist Teachings</font></h3>
    <p>Gautama was not a god, a prophet or any kind of
    supernatural being. He was, as we have seen, one who was
    born, lived and died a human being. But a remarkable human
    being, who discovered a way of achieving true wisdom,
    compassion and freedom from suffering. Rather he rediscovered
    a very old way that had always existed.</p>
    <p>The Buddha did not teach that a God created the Universe.
    Rather he pointed to a great Law or Dharma running through
    everything that exists. It is by living in accordance with
    this Law that true Wisdom and compassion and hence freedom
    from suffering may be achieved. Suffering may only be
    overcome, however, by being met and endured. In the Buddha's
    words: 'Suffering I teach and the way out of suffering.'
    Fundamental Buddhist doctrines include the following:</p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">The Three Signs of Being</font></h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>(1) Change,<br>
        (2) Suffering,<br>
        (3) No &quot;I &quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The first, Change, points out the basic fact that nothing
    in the world is fixed or permanent. We ourselves are not the
    same people, either physically, emotionally or mentally, that
    we were 10 years - or even 10 minutes ago! Living as we do,
    then, as shifting beings upon shifting sands, it is not
    possible for us to find lasting security. </p>
    <p>As regards the second Sign, we have already seen how it
    was Suffering that sent the Buddha off on his great spiritual
    quest, though suffering is not a very good translation of the
    original word, dukkha. Dukkha implies the generally
    unsatisfactory and imperfect nature of life. Please do not
    think, though, that Buddhists believe that life is all
    suffering. They believe that there is joy in life, but know
    that life can't be all joy; even in the most fortunate of
    lives there must be suffering.</p>
    <p>No-I, the third Sign, is a little more difficult.
    Buddhists do not believe that there is anything everlasting
    or unchangeable in human beings, no soul or self in which a
    stable sense of 'I' might anchor itself. The whole idea of
    'I' is in fact a basically false one that tries to set itself
    up in an unstable and temporary collection of elements.</p>
    <p>Take the analogy of a cart. A cart may be broken down into
    its basic components -axle, wheels, shafts, sides, etc. Then
    the cart is no more; all we have is a pile of components. In
    the same way 'I' am made up of various elements or aggregates
    (skandhas): form (body), perception, conception, volition and
    consciousness (mind). Upon death these elements do not vanish
    from the face of the universe, they form new combinations
    elsewhere. Thus the whole universe is a great, ever-changing
    orchestration of interconnected movements without beginning
    or end.</p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">The Four Noble Truths</font></h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>(1) Suffering and unsatisfactoriness exist. <br>
        (2) The cause of Suffering and unsatisfactoriness exists.
        <br>
        (3) The cause may be brought to an end. <br>
        (4) The means whereby this may be achieved: The Noble
        Eightfold Path.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As we have seen, Buddhism begins with the fundamental fact
    of suffering. But before we can do anything about it, we must
    know its cause, which is the deeply-rooted sense of 'I' that
    we all have. Because of this we are always struggling to get
    things that are pleasurable and avoid things that are painful
    to find ease and security, and generally to manipulate people
    and situations to be the way I want them. And because the
    rest of the world does not necessarily fit in with what I
    want, we often find ourselves cutting against the general
    flow of things, and getting hurt and disappointed in the
    process. Suffering may be therefore brought to an end by
    transcending this strong sense of 'I' so that we come into
    greater harmony with things in general. The means of doing
    this is The Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">The Noble Eightfold Path</font></h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>(1) Right Seeing. <br>
        (2) Right Thought. <br>
        (3) Right Speech. <br>
        (4) Right Action. <br>
        (5) Right Livelihood. <br>
        (6) Right Effort <br>
        (7) Right Mindfulness. <br>
        (8) Right Contemplation.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Right Seeing is important at the start because if we
    cannot see the truth of the Four Noble Truths then we can't
    make any sort of beginning. Right Thought follows naturally
    from this. 'Right' here means in accordance with the facts:
    with the way things are - which may be different from how I
    would like them to be. Right Thought, Right Speech, Right
    Action and Right Livelihood involve moral restraint
    refraining from lying, stealing, committing violent acts,
    earning one's living in a way harmful to others, and things
    like that. Moral restraint not only helps bring about general
    social harmony but also helps us control and diminish the
    sense of 'I'. Like a greedy child, 'I' grows big and unruly
    the more we let it have its own way. Next, Right Effort is
    important because 'I' thrives on idleness, and in any case if
    we are not prepared to exert ourselves we cannot hope to
    achieve anything at all. The last two steps of the Path,
    Right Mindfulness and Right Contemplation, represent the
    first footholds on the shore of No-I. They involve
    meditation. In the most basic form of Buddhist meditation, a
    person sits upright in a chair or cross-legged on a cushion
    on the floor. He quietly watches the rise and fall of the
    breath. If thoughts, emotions or impulses arise, he just
    observes them come up and go like clouds in a blue sky,
    without rejecting them on the one hand or being carried away
    into daydreaming or restlessness on the other. </p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">The Three Fires</font></h3>
    <p>'Your house is a fire, burns with the Three Fires; there
    is no dwelling in it' - thus spoke the Buddha in his great
    Fire Sermon. The house he speaks of here is the human body;
    the three fires that burn it are Desire/Wanting, Anger and
    Delusion. They are all kinds of energy and are called 'fires'
    because, untamed, they can rage through us and hurt us and
    other people too! Properly gentled through spiritual
    training, however, they can be transformed into the genuine
    warmth of real humanity.</p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">In General</font></h3>
    <p><em><strong>'Not to do any evil; to cultivate good; to
    purify one's heart - this is the teaching of the Buddha.'</strong></em></p>
    <p>Although Buddhists value highly such virtues as loving
    kindness, humanity, patience and giving, perhaps they value
    compassion most of all. The idea of ahimsa or harmlessness is
    very closely connected with compassion. The compassionate
    desire to cause no harm to other beings (Buddhists would
    include animals, plants, inanimate objects and even the world
    in general in this) has caused many Buddhists to become
    pacifists or vegetarians, although they are not obliged to do
    so. In all things Buddhism places great stress on
    self-reliance and the Buddha himself told his followers not
    to believe a thing because he told it but to test it for
    themselves.</p>
    <p>Buddhism is also a very practical religion and aims at
    helping people to live their lives; it is as much if not more
    concerned with giving people things to do as with giving them
    things to believe. Doing things like chanting a simple
    formula, visiting a temple to make an offering or to perform
    prostrations - such simple acts help to reduce a person's
    sense of 'I.'</p>
    <p>Buddhists also try to practice the Buddhist virtues
    actively in their everyday lives. The final goal of all
    Buddhist practice is to bring about that same awakening that
    the Buddha himself achieved.</p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">The Spread of Buddhism</font></h3>
    <p>Buddhists follow three main traditions. There are those
    who adhere to the Theravada or Southern tradition, those who
    adhere to the Mahayana or Northern tradition and those who
    adhere to the Vajrayana or Tibetan tradition.</p>
    <p>Long ago, Buddhism began to spread southwards from its
    place of origin in northern India to Sri Lanka, Burma,
    Thailand, Indo-China and other South East Asian countries. It
    also moved northwards into the Himalayan kingdoms (Sikkim,
    Bhutan, Nepal), Tibet, Mongolia and other parts of Central
    Asia, and also into China, Korea and Japan. </p>
    <p>This was a fortunate development because Buddhism all but
    died out in India after the Moslem incursions of the 11th
    Century ce. In more modern times, the spread of Communism has
    also virtually obliterated Buddhism from various other
    countries where it was once strongly established (e.g. China,
    Vietnam, Tibet, etc.). There is now a resurgence of Buddhism
    in these countries. Nowadays, however, Buddhism is attracting
    an increasing following in Europe and the Americas. In Asia,
    it is thriving in countries like Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand,
    Korea and Japan. </p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">The Sangha</font></h3>
    <p>In Theravada (southern) Buddhist countries, the monks
    (bhikkhus) are easily recognized because they wear the
    characteristic orange robe, have their heads shaven, and go
    about barefoot. They are given a new name and the robe, and
    will have to live according to a code of 227 rules (the
    Vinaya). A monk may decide to disrobe (cease being a monk) at
    any time.</p>
    <p>Bhikkhus live a strict, simple life of meditation, study
    and work, with very short hours of sleep and only one meal a
    day. They do not own money or any possessions to speak of.
    They help with the important task of teaching and assisting
    lay people, and conducting ceremonies.</p>
    <p>In Mahayana (northern) Buddhist countries there are two
    main branches, the Tibetan with monks wearing the
    characteristic maroon robe, and the Far Eastern, which also
    has an unbroken line of nuns, where the robes are black or
    grey. </p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">Buddhist Festivals and Ceremonies</font></h3>
    <p>Buddhism has tended to merge into the everyday life of the
    countries where it has taken root. Buddhist festivals have
    religious, social and historical dimensions, and in some
    countries (e.g. Nepal) these are numerous and very colourful.
    The highpoint of the Buddhist calendar in Theravada countries
    is WESAK, when the birth, Enlightenment and passing away of
    the Buddha are celebrated. This generally falls on the full
    moon day of the month of May each year. In Mahayana
    (northern) Buddhist countries, there are regional and
    sectarian differences as to how these great events are
    celebrated.</p>
    <p>There are no universal Buddhist birth, marriage and death
    ceremonies (rites of passage). These also vary from country
    to country and from traditition to traditition. In many
    places, however, monks or priests will participate in some
    way, by chanting from the scriptures (sutras), giving
    blessings, delivering a sermon and so on: also the people
    involved may go to a Buddhist monastery or temple for some
    kind of ceremony. </p>
