    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There were occasions when we found it difficult to ordain
    foreigners because we did not have any book in Eng1ish that gave relevant information on
    the procedure of ordination or on the Vinaya. We felt an urgent need to remedy the
    situation. As a result this booklet was first compiled and printed in 1986, and this
    second edition has now been prepared after careful revision. It may be helpful for those
    who are in need of this information.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We write this booklet based on Pali Texts, their
    Commentaries and two other treatises on the vinaya, namely, <b><font COLOR="#0000FF">Patimokkha</font></b><i>
    </i>by Nyanamoli Thera and <b><font COLOR="#0000FF">The Buddhist Monastic Code </font></b>by
    Bhikkhu (Jeffrey) Thanissaro. We have got many technical terms and expressions from the
    two treatises. We are, therefore, deeply indebted to both authors.</font></p>

    OF ORDINATION</b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Burma, the Buddhist custom of ordination begins with
    the applicant's request to a bhikkhu to permit him to receive a samanera-ordination. The
    applicant, having received the permission, requests the sangha to allow him to be shaved.
    Having been shaved, he goes to a senior bhikkhu and pays respect to him as a teacher by
    bowing down three times.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then he makes supplication to the teacher and hands over a
    set of robes to him reciting a passage prescribed for the purpose. This done, he asks the
    teacher for the robes, which he puts on with the help of a bhikkhu. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After he has requested the teacher to ordain him a
    samanera (novice), he formally takes up the Three Refuges and the Ten Precepts. He has now
    become a samanera. As a samanera he has to request the teacher to be his preceptor. Then,
    the preceptor gives him a new name in Pali.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Food: </b>A bhikkhu's life depends on the food he has
    collected by going alms-round. So he should consume it and make an effort to practise
    dhamma. But there are special allowances: They are a community meal, a designated meal, a
    meal by lot, a meal by invitation, a meal on the days of the waxing and the waning moon, a
    meal on the observance day and a meal on the day following observance day.</font></p>

    devotees out of their faith in the Buddha sasana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Robe: </b>A bhikkhu's life depends on a dusty robe
    (pamsukula civara) or a rag-robe which is made of different pieces of cloth thrown away by
    the people. So he should put it on and make an effort to practise dhamma. But there are
    special allowances: they are robes made of linen, cotton, silk, wool, hemp or a robe made
    of different kinds of material.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short he can put on any allowable robe offered by
    devotees out of their faith in the Buddha sasana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Lodging:</b> A bhikkhu's life depends on the foot of a
    tree as a lordging. So he should live under the shade of a tree and make an effort to
    practise dhamma. But there are special allowances: they are a cave, a building with a
    thatched roof, with the roof on one side, with the roof on both sides, with a pinnacle,
    without a pinnacle, made of wood, bricks, bamboo etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The buildings with the roof of leaves, zinc-sheets,
    asbestos-sheets, reinforced concrete etc. are also permissible as they are not prohibited.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Medicine:</b> A bhikkhu's life depends on fermented
    urine as medicine. So he should take fermented urine as medicine and make an effort to
    practise dhamma. But there are special allowances: they are ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey
    and molasses. Having formally accepted them, he is to take them as medicine within seven
    days at most. On the seventh day he shall give them away. However, he may use them
    externally after the seventh day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He can also take any allowable indigenous or Western
    medicine donated by devotees out of their faith in the Buddha-sasana.</font></p>

    disrobed and cannot be reordained a bhikkhu in this present existence.</font></p>

    take what is not given, even a piece of grass or split of bamboo. If he does, he is no
    longer a bhikkhu, not a son of the Buddha of the Sakyan clan. He must be disrobed and
    cannot be reordained a bhikkhu in this present existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Killing: </b>An ordained bhikkhu shall not
    intentionally kill a living being, even a white, red or black ant. If he kills an animal,
    even an insect, he has a Pacittiya offence. If he kills a human being, even if he gives
    any kind of medicine for abortion, he is no longer a bhikkhu, not a son of the Buddha of
    the Sakyan clan. He must be disrobed and cannot be reordained a bhikkhu in this present
    existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>False Claim :</b>An ordained bhikkhu shall not falsely
    claim to attain superhuman attainments such as Jhana (absorption concentration), Magga
    (Path knowledge), and Phala (Fruition knowledge); he shall not even say that he takes
    delight in a quiet place. If he, having evil desire, falsely claim to have any of
    superhuman attainment such as Jhana, he is no longer a bhikkhu, not a son of the Buddha of
