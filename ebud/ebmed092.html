      <td width="100%"><FONT SIZE="4">1. Introduction</FONT><P>When reading the 
      Suttas of the Pali Canon it is difficult not to be struck by the central 
      importance of <I>samādhi</I> and <I>jhāna</I> on the Buddhist path.(1),(2)
      <I>Samādhi</I> and <I>jhāna</I> appear in Sutta after Sutta, often as the 
      pivotal condition that allows deep insight into the nature of existence. 
      In spite of this, there appears to have been an historical tendency to 
      underestimate the importance of these states.(3) Perhaps 
      the most potent of the many factors that have lead to such underestimation 
      was the early post-<I>Nikāya</I> rise of the Abhidhamma concept of &#39;<I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>&#39;. 
      In this paper I wish to examine this concept, to investigate whether it 
      has any counterpart in the Suttas, to discuss the implications of using it 
      to interpret the Suttas, and finally to look more closely at the 
      Abhidhamma&#39;s treatment of <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>. I will argue that the 
      common Commentarial practice of using <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> to define <I>
      jhāna</I> is misleading.</P>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="4">2. The Concept of </FONT><I><FONT SIZE="4">
      Lokuttarajjhāna</FONT></I></B></P>
      <P>The very name &#39;<I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>&#39; suggests a connection to <I>
      jhāna</I> and by implication to <I>sammāsamādhi</I> and <I>samādhi</I> in 
      general. However, whereas <I>jhāna</I> and <I>samādhi</I> are important 
      doctrinal terms of the Pali Suttas, <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> first appears 
      in the Abhidhamma. To avoid any confusion between these various terms it 
      is necessary to look more closely at the Abhidhamma&#39;s definition.(4)
      </P>
      <P>According to Abhidhamma theory each stage of Enlightenment is 
      experienced through two types of consciousness, known as <I>magga</I> 
      (path) and <I>phala</I> (fruit). The first type of consciousness, the <I>
      magga</I>, which lasts only one mind moment, has the function of cutting 
      off mental fetters. The second type, the <I>phala</I>, is the experience 
      of bliss that results from the cutting off of the fetters by the <I>magga</I> 
      consciousness.(5) Again according to the Abhidhamma, 
      these two types of consciousness are experienced together with a 
      particular set of <I>jhāna</I> factors that correspond to each of the four
      <I>jhāna</I>s respectively.(6) Thus they are called &#39;<I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>s&#39;, 
      &#39;transcendent <I>jhāna</I>s&#39;,(7) because they combine the
      <I>jhāna</I> factors with an Enlightenment experience.</P>
      <P>From this it emerges that the Abhidhamma term <I>lokuttarajhāna</I> is 
      a name for the particular moment one attains one of the various stages of 
      Enlightenment. The Suttas have their own terminology for describing these 
      attainments, terminology that does not refer to momentary experiences and 
      that never explicitly relates to <I>samādhi</I> or <I>jhāna</I>.(8) 
      Consequently, it seems from the outset that <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> and <I>
      jhāna</I>/<I>samādhi</I> refer to very different types of experience.(9)
      </P>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="4">3. </FONT><I><FONT SIZE="4">Ariyo Sammāsamādhi</FONT></I></B></P>
      <P>In spite of the above, it has been argued that <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>, 
      in its momentary Abhidhamma sense, is implicitly referred to in the Suttas 
      but using different terminology. Of all the Sutta terminology it is 
      perhaps &#39;<I>ariyo sammāsamādhi</I>&#39;, &#39;noble right <I>samādhi</I>&#39;, which 
      is most often identified as <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>.(10) 
      It appears it is the qualifier &#39;<I>ariya</I>&#39; which has made this 
      identification common. &#39;<I>Ariya</I>&#39;, &#39;noble&#39;, is a Sutta term usually 
      referring to the persons who have attained one of the stages of 
      Enlightenment. Therefore, when it is used as a qualifier, it is likely to 
      signify some connection to the stages of Enlightenment. To discover what 
      this connection is we need to look at how this phrase is used in the 
      Suttas.</P>
      <P><I>Ariyo sammāsamādhi</I> is only found on five separate occasions in 
      the Suttas.(11) Two of these occasions are simply the 
      same bare definitions:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>&quot;There are: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, 
        right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness. The one-pointedness 
        of mind equipped with these seven factors is called noble right 
        concentration (<I>sammāsamādhi</I>) &#39;with its supports&#39;, and also &#39;with 
        its accessories&#39;.&quot;(12) </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>This is not enough to give a precise idea of the phrase, but at least 
      it makes it clear that only a person practicing the Noble Eightfold Path 
      can have this kind of <I>samādhi</I>.</P>
      <P>The third occasion is found at M117 where &#39;<I>ariyo sammāsamādhi</I>&#39; 
      is initially explained in the same way as above, but then expanded on 
      considerably. Of particular importance here is that the factor of <I>
      sammāditthi</I>, one of the seven &#39;equipments&#39; mentioned above, can be 
      either the Noble Right View of the <I>Sotāpanna</I> <B>or</B> it can be 
      ordinary right view possessed by the person who is not yet a <I>Sotāpanna</I>.(13) 
      Thus it seems that it is possible to possess <I>ariyo sammāsamādhi</I> 
      without yet having attained to <I>Sotāpatti</I>. If this is correct, it is 
      impossible that this <I>samādhi</I> is the &#39;<I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>&#39; of the 
      Abhidhamma.(14) </P>
      <P>The fourth occurrence of <I>ariyo sammāsamādhi</I> does not add 
      anything of interest but the fifth occurrence is important: it is a 
      statement of what this <I>samādhi</I> consists of.(15) 
      Not surprisingly it is said to consist of the four <I>jhāna</I>s and also 
      &quot;<I>the reviewing sign which is well-grasped, well-attended to, 
      well-considered, and well-penetrated by wisdom</I>&quot;.(16) 
      Note that there is nothing here about attaining any of the stages of 
      Enlightenment, just the standard passage on the four <I>jhāna</I>s 
      together with the usual similes. If there ever was a time for clearly 
      defining &#39;<I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>&#39;, if that were what is meant by <I>ariya 
      sammāsamādhi</I>, this would seem to be the ideal opportunity. Each time 
      an obvious opportunity for an explicit definition is missed, any claim 
      that <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> is what is meant is severely undermined. Even 
      the Commentary does not seem to define <I>ariyo sammāsamādhi</I> here as 
      anything but &#39;ordinary&#39; <I>jhāna</I>.(17) In conclusion, 
      there is no evidence in the Suttas that <I>ariyo sammāsamādhi</I> refers 
      to <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>, but the evidence to the contrary is sufficient 
      to throw serious doubts on this interpretation.(18)</P>
      <P>It thus appears that even the most promising candidate-term from the 
      Suttas has nothing to do with the Abhidhamma&#39;s <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>. If 
      this is correct, then it is unlikely that there is any terminology at all 
      in the Suttas that is equivalent to <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>. If the most 
      promising terminology fails to hit the mark, then any other terminology is 
      even less likely to do so.</P>
      <P>However, it is still necessary to investigate whether the terms &#39;<I>jhāna</I>&#39; 
      or &#39;<I>samādhi</I>&#39; in themselves, as they occur in the Suttas, have a 
      twofold meaning, sometimes refering to ordinary <I>jhāna</I> but at other 
      times referring to <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>.(19) This 
      takes us to the Commentaries, which often assert that particular instances 
      of <I>jhāna</I> or <I>samādhi</I> in the Suttas actually refer to <I>
      lokuttarajjhāna</I>.</P>
      <H2><FONT SIZE="4">4. Commentarial Interpretations</FONT></H2>
      <P>An important aspect of the Commentaries&#39; method is the use of later 
      concepts, especially from the Abhidhamma, to explain the Suttas. In 
      practice this means that when <I>jhāna</I> or <I>samādhi</I> occur in the 
      Suttas, the Commentaries decide whether &#39;ordinary&#39; <I>jhāna</I> is meant 
      or <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>.(20) The result is that the 
      Commentaries back-read a later concept into the Suttas themselves. To find 
      out whether this is reasonable, it is instructive to investigate a few 
      examples of such Commentarial interpretations.</P>
      <P><B>4.1 <I>Samanamandika</I> Sutta, M78</B> (21)</P>
      <P>This Sutta contains a, for our purposes, interesting discussion on the 
      ending of intentions. The Sutta states that all unwholesome intentions 
      cease without remainder in the first <I>jhāna</I> and that all wholesome 
      intentions cease without remainder in the second <I>jhāna</I>.(22) 
      The Commentary then goes on to define both instances of <I>jhāna</I> here 
      as <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>: the first being equivalent to the state of <I>
      Anāgāmī</I> and the second that of <I>Arahant</I>.(23)
      </P>
      <P>There are several issues here. Firstly, one might ask why the Sutta 
      speaks of <I>jhāna</I> when in fact, according to the Commentary, it means 
      the attainment of <I>Anāgāmī</I> and <I>Arahant</I> respectively. There 
      are several standard ways in which the Suttas describe the attainments of
      <I>Anāgāmī</I> and <I>Arahant</I>, but &#39;<I>jhāna</I>&#39; is not one of them. 
      One may then wonder why this Sutta does not apply one of these standard 
      ways of describing such attainments rather than use a term, i.e. <I>jhāna</I>, 
      which ordinarily has a completely different meaning. According to the 
      Suttas the &quot;<I>brahmacariya is endowed with all aspects, fulfilled in all 
      aspects, not deficient, with nothing superfluous, well-proclaimed, fully 
      complete, well-expounded</I>&quot;,(24) but if the Commentary 
      is right, then one could rightfully question whether this Sutta is indeed 
      &quot;<I>well-proclaimed</I>&quot;. The fact is that using <I>jhāna</I> in this 
      context while meaning the attainments of <I>Anāgāmī</I> and <I>Arahant</I> 
      would obscure the passage considerably and one would be totally dependent 
      on outside expertise, i.e. the Commentaries, to unravel the meaning.(25) 
      The Buddha never said that one needed to depend on outside expertise to 
      understand his teachings, quite the contrary according to the above quote.(26)
      </P>
      <P>Even more problematic for the Commentary&#39;s interpretation is the 
      differentiation in the present Sutta between the use of the first <I>jhāna</I> 
      to describe the ending of unwholesome intentions and the second <I>jhāna</I> 
      to describe the ending of wholesome intentions. If indeed, as the 
      Commentary holds, this refers to the attainments of <I>Anāgāmī</I> and <I>
      Arahant</I> respectively, then the level of <I>jhāna</I> is in fact 
      completely irrelevant as far as the ending of the corresponding intentions 
      is concerned. Again, one can only wonder whether such a presentation could 
      be considered &quot;<I>well-proclaimed</I>&quot;.</P>
      <P>Lastly, the Sutta is perfectly well explainable in terms of &#39;ordinary&#39;
      <I>jhāna</I> without having to bring in an explanation from the 
      Abhidhamma. The first <I>jhāna</I> is throughout the Suttas qualified as &quot;<I>secluded 
      from unwholesome states</I>&quot;,(27) which would include 
      unwholesome intentions. In the second <I>jhāna</I> the <I>vitakka</I> and
      <I>vicāra</I> aspects of first <I>jhāna</I> cease. In the first <I>jhāna</I> 
      these aspects are the movement of the mind onto the object and the holding 
      on to the object respectively. It is easy to see how this could be 
      regarded as the last vestige of intention, the mind intending towards the 
      wholesome object of the first <I>jhāna</I>. In the second <I>jhāna</I> the 
      mind is perfectly concentrated,(28) all movement has 
      been abandoned, and therefore all intention, wholesome and unwholesome, 
      has &quot;<I>ceased without remainder</I>&quot;.(29) </P>
      <P><B>4.2 <I>So Vata</I> Sutta </B>(30)</P>
      <P>This Sutta is of particular importance because it gives a sequence of 
      conditions without which a given effect cannot occur. The most interesting 
      relationship for the purposes of this paper is the one between &quot;<I>sammāsamādhi</I>&quot; 
      (i.e. <I>jhāna</I>) and &quot;<I>the abandoning of the fetters</I>&quot;, where the 
      latter is said to be impossible (&quot;<I>thānam n&#39;etam vijjati</I>&quot;) without 
      the former. This is clearly an important statement as it gives a fixed 
      sequence of how the Buddhist path must be developed.</P>
      <P>It is therefore highly significant when the Commentary to this passage 
      states that what is meant here by <I>sammāsamādhi</I> is in fact <I>
      lokuttarajjhāna</I>.(31) It is not difficult to see how 
      this Commentarial interpretation undermines the vital necessity of <I>
      jhāna</I> on the path and potentially has a significant impact on our 
      understanding of the Suttas. It is therefore necessary to investigate 
      whether there are any grounds for the Commentary&#39;s assertion.</P>
      <P>The first thing to note is that if <I>sammāsamādhi</I> here really is a 
      reference to <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>, this passage in effect says that the 
      necessary condition for <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> (i.e. &quot;<I>the abandoning of 
      the fetters</I>&quot;, which in Abhidhamma terminology is a <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> 
      mind moment) is <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> itself. Thus the whole purpose of 
      the causal sequence is defeated.(32) Moreover, as the <I>
      sammāsamādhi</I> here is defined by the Commentary as including both path
      <I>and</I> fruit, whereas &quot;<I>the abandoning of the fetters</I>&quot; is just a 
      path moment, one ends up with a situation where the effect precedes the 
      cause.(33) This clearly makes no sense.</P>
      <P>At this point it seems worthwhile to quote a larger portion of the 
      passage we are concerned with:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>&quot; &#39;Not grasping the sign of the mind, one will fulfill right view&#39;, 
        this is not possible. &#39;Not having fulfilled right view, one will fulfill
        <I>sammāsamādhi</I>&#39;, this is not possible. &#39;Not having fulfilled <I>
        sammāsamādhi</I>, one will abandon the fetters&#39;, this is not possible. 
        &#39;Not having abandoned the fetters, one will realize <I>Nibbāna</I>&#39;, 
        this is not possible.&quot;(34) </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Of interest here is that <I>sammāditthi</I> must be fulfilled before <I>
      sammāsamādhi</I> can be fulfilled. In Sutta usage the fulfilment of <I>
      sammāditthi</I> is equivalent to the attainment of <I>Sotāpatti</I>. The 
      attainment of <I>Sotāpatti</I> in turn is a <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> moment 
      according to Abhidhamma terminology. Thus, once again, if one is to follow 
      the Commentarial interpretation, one arrives at a situation where <I>
      lokuttarajjhāna</I> (i.e. <I>sammāditthi</I>) is the cause for <I>
      lokuttarajjhāna</I> (i.e. <I>sammāsamādhi</I>). Thus the conditional 
      relationship expressed in the Sutta is apparently reduced to something 
      quite trivial. To summarise, both &quot;<I>the abandoning of the fetters</I>&quot; 
      and &quot;<I>the fulfillment of right view</I>&quot; are redundant if <I>
      sammāsamādhi</I> (as <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>) encompasses both of them.</P>
      <P>The final question we need to answer is whether reading <I>sammāsamādhi</I> 
      in the present passage as &#39;ordinary&#39; <I>jhāna</I> is confirmed or negated 
      by other Suttas. It is well known that <I>jhāna</I> and <I>sammāsamādhi</I> 
      occur very frequently in the Suttas as part of the training leading to the 
      attainment of <I>Arahant</I>ship. Perhaps the most significant of these 
      occurrences is the listing of the four <I>jhāna</I>s in the gradual 
      training immediately prior to the attainment of the three higher 
      knowledges (<I>tevijjā</I>). This sequence is found countless times 
      throughout the Suttas.(35) However, this does not 
      establish that attaining <I>Arahant</I>ship is <I>impossible</I> without 
      &#39;ordinary&#39; <I>jhāna</I>, as the <I>So Vata</I> Sutta seems to imply. To 
      find such a passage we need to turn to M64:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>&quot;There is a path, Ānanda, a way to the abandoning of the five lower 
        fetters; that anyone without relying on that path, on that way shall 
        know or see or abandon the five lower fetters - this is not possible. 
        Just as when there is a great tree standing possessed of heartwood, it 
        is not possible that anyone shall cut out its heartwood without cutting 
        through its bark and sapwood ... </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>And what Ānanda is the path, the way to the abandoning of the five 
        lower fetters? Here Ānanda a bhikkhu ... enters upon and abides in the 
        first <I>jhāna</I> ... the second <I>jhāna</I> ... the third <I>jhāna</I> 
        ... the fourth <I>jhāna</I> ...&quot;.(36) </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Note that this passage is very clear that it is impossible to become an
      <I>Anāgāmī</I> without having attained at least the first <I>jhāna</I>. 
      Also significant is that the Commentary does not define <I>jhāna</I> here 
      as <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>, and thus one has to assume that also the 
      Commentary regards this as &#39;ordinary&#39; <I>jhāna</I>.(37)
      </P>
      <P>Again, given this evidence from the Suttas, one can only conclude that 
      there is no evidence to support the Commentarial assertion that what is 
      meant by <I>sammāsamādhi</I> in the So Vata Sutta is in fact <I>
      lokuttarajjhāna</I>. Quite the contrary, the standard Sutta explanation of
      <I>sammāsamādhi</I>, as referring to the (ordinary) four <I>jhāna</I>s, 
      fits the situation perfectly. </P>
      <P><B>4.3 Other Suttas</B></P>
      <P>The above examples are only two among a large number where the 
      Commentaries claim that <I>jhāna</I> or <I>samādhi</I> in the Suttas 
      actually refer to <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>. It would be an enormous amount 
      of work to investigate each one of these occurrences to evaluate whether 
      the Commentarial interpretations are reasonable. In many instances it 
      would in fact be impossible to come to any satisfactory conclusion because 
      of a lack of revealing contextual evidence. In these circumstances one is 
      left with the Commentarial interpretation without any way of validating 
      the Commentary&#39;s assertions. This is surely not satisfactory, particularly 
      when there is no convincing evidence from the Suttas that <I>jhāna</I> or
      <I>samādhi</I> <I>ever</I> refers to the attainment of the stages of 
      Enlightenment.(38) There appears to be only one possible 
      solution to this problem and that is to assume that <I>jhāna</I> and <I>
      samādhi</I> in the Suttas <I>always</I> refer to &#39;ordinary&#39; <I>jhāna</I> 
      and <I>samādhi</I> even if this goes directly against the Commentarial 
      view.(39) </P>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="4">5. The Danger in Reduced Respect for <I>samādhi</I> 
      and </FONT><I><FONT SIZE="4">jhāna</FONT></I></B></P>
      <P>If the analysis so far, on the whole, is accepted, it might reasonably 
      be asked why the Commentaries would mistakenly reinterpret the <I>jhāna</I>/<I>samādhi</I> 
      of central Sutta passages in terms of the later Abhidhamma concept of <I>
      lokuttarajjhāna</I> and thereby significantly distort the message of the 
      former. There are in fact several Sutta passages that relate to this 
      question. These passages concern the future of the Dhamma and, in 
      particular, they mention how a reduced respect for <I>samādhi</I> is a 
      condition for the decline of the Buddha&#39;s teaching as a whole. Consider 
      the following:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>&quot;Just as, Kassapa, gold does not disappear so long as counterfeit 
        gold has not arisen in the world, but when counterfeit gold arises true 
        gold disappears, so the true Dhamma does not disappear so long as a 
        counterfeit of the true Dhamma has not arisen in the world, but when a 
        counterfeit of the true Dhamma arises in the world then the true Dhamma 
        disappears. ...</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>It is senseless people who arise right here who cause the true Dhamma 
        to disappear.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>The true Dhamma does not disappear all at once in the way a ship 
        sinks. There are, Kassapa, five detrimental things that lead to the 
        decay and disappearance of the true Dhamma. What are the five? Here the 
        bhikkhus, the bhikkhunis, the male lay followers, and the female lay 
        followers dwell without reverence and deference towards the Teacher ... 
        towards the Dhamma ... towards the Sangha ... towards the training ... 
        towards concentration [<I>samādhi</I>]. These are the five detrimental 
        things that lead to the decay and disappearance of the true Dhamma.&quot;(40)
        </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Thus it appears that over time there is a natural tendency for the 
      Dhamma to get distorted, that the distorters are members of the Sangha 
      itself, and finally that one of the factors that lead to the gradual 
      confusion and disappearance of the Dhamma is a lack of reverence and 
      deference for <I>samādhi</I>.(41) It is easy to see why 
      the Triple Gem and the training as a whole are mentioned here, because 
      lack of respect for any of these is tantamount to a repudiation of the 
      entire Dhamma. But it is quite remarkable that <I>samādhi</I> is the one 
      aspect of the training that is singled out here, not wisdom, not the four
      <I>satipatthāna</I>s or any other aspect of the path. And this is only one 
      among many instances where <I>samādhi</I> is singled out in this way.(42) 
      This is surely highly significant and says much about the central 
      importance of <I>samādhi</I> in the Dhamma.</P>
      <P>So it seems that it is to be expected that the important role of <I>
      samādhi</I> is undermined over time, and therefore one should perhaps not 
      be surprised that this is exactly what seems to happen in the Pali 
      Commentaries.(43) Maybe this is because <I>samādhi</I> 
      can appear so difficult to achieve. But this is obviously not a sufficient 
      reason to downgrade its importance. <I>Samādhi</I> is an integral part of 
      the Buddhist path and any attempt to reduce its importance because it is 
      hard to achieve, will only result in the exact opposite, making the true 
      goal of the path, Enlightenment, even more difficult to achieve. By 
      overlooking the absolutely central importance of <I>samādhi</I> one is in 
      grave danger of making the supreme goal of the Buddhist practice 
      unattainable.</P>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="4">6. <I>Abhidhamma-bhājaniya</I> &amp; </FONT><I>
      <FONT SIZE="4">Suttanta-bhājaniya</FONT></I></B></P>
      <P>In light of the above, it may prove useful to take a closer look at the 
      Abhidhamma.(44) The first thing to notice about the 
      Abhidhamma&#39;s treatment is that it is divided into two separate categories, 
      the Sutta-exposition (<I>Suttanta-bhājaniya</I>) and the 
      Abhidhamma-exposition (<I>Abhidhamma-bhājaniya</I>).(45) 
      This is of great importance for this study because it suggests that the 
      Suttas and the Abhidhamma must be kept strictly apart and, more 
      particularly, that the Abhidhamma analysis is not applicable to the 
      Suttas.</P>
      <P>This conclusion is reinforced by a closer comparison of the 
      Sutta-exposition with the Abhidhamma-exposition. The <I>Suttanta-bhājaniya</I> 
      is a list of factors, together with definitions, of some of the most 
      important doctrinal sets found in the Suttas.(46) The 
      exposition is largely identical to that of the Suttas, as one would 
      expect. In the Suttas these sets are concerned with the pragmatic problem 
      of how to arrive at Enlightenment, and the various factors listed refer to 
      qualities of mind that have to be developed for Enlightenment to be 
      possible.(47) The <I>Abhidhamma-bhājaniya</I>, however, 
      is a significant departure from the Sutta-exposition. It discusses the 
      same sets, but the definitions of the individual factors are here quite 
      different from those found in the Suttas. The emphasis is now on how these 
      factors, when they are fully developed, take part in the experiences of 
      the stages of Enlightenment.(48) The Abhidhamma&#39;s 
      purpose, therefore, is to describe the <I>contents</I> of specific states 
      of mind rather than the <I>path</I> by which one arrives at those states.(49) 
      In other words, where the Suttas and the Abhidhamma speak of what appears 
      to be the same sets, they are actually speaking of quite different things. 
      It now becomes clear why the Sutta-exposition has to be kept apart from 
      the Abhidhamma-exposition.(50) </P>
      <P>The above can now be related to <I>jhāna</I>/<I>samādhi</I> and <I>
      lokuttarajjhāna</I>. <I>Samādhi</I> and <I>jhāna</I> are terms used in the
      <I>Suttanta-bhājaniya</I> and thus they refer to Sutta usage. In 
      particular, as they are closely related to the above mentioned sets that 
      constitute the path to Enlightenment, they are factors of that same path.
      <I>Lokuttarajjhāna</I>, on the other hand, belongs to the <I>
      Abhidhamma-bhājaniya</I> and is a term for the constellation of mental 
      factors present at the moments of Enlightenment. Being a term peculiar to 
      the <I>Abhidhamma-bhājaniya</I>, it only relates to the Abhidhamma and can 
      therefore not be used to explain <I>samādhi</I> or <I>jhāna</I> as it 
      appears in the Suttas. If this is correct, it follows that the 
      Commentaries make a dangerous blunder when they explain <I>jhāna</I> and
      <I>samādhi</I> with Abhidhamma terminology that was never capable of being 
      used in this way.</P>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="4">7. Conclusion</FONT></B></P>
      <P>It is sometimes claimed that the Abhidhamma is simply a natural 
      extension of the Suttas, and that its ideas flow without conflict straight 
      out of concepts already established in the Suttas. This may be largely 
      correct, but there is always a problem of unforeseen consequences when one 
      elaborates on a body of texts of such fundamental importance for Buddhism 
      as the original Suttas. I hope I have been able to show one such instance 
      of unforeseen consequences, and an important one at that, in which the 
      Suttas are effectively rewritten in line with later concepts and 
      terminology.(51) It shows that one has to be careful 
      about uncritically accepting the Commentaries&#39; interpretations of the 
      Suttas. This is particularly so when established Sutta concepts are 
      redefined by the Commentaries in accordance with ideas that arose after 
      the Suttas were composed.</P>
      <P>As for the term <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>, I suggest that it was never 
      meant to be used apart from the Abhidhamma itself. The idea of <I>
      lokuttarajjhāna</I> may very well be a reasonable description of 
      attainments on the Buddhist path, but this does not mean that it has any 
      direct counterpart in the Suttas: in fact it seems clear that it does not. 
      Because <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> concerns the <I>goal</I> of the path, and 
      not the path itself, the Commentaries&#39; redefinition of <I>jhāna</I>/<I>samādhi</I> 
      in terms of <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> has the effect of shifting the reality 
      of <I>jhāna</I> from being a factor of the path to becoming a result of 
      the practice of the path. Thus the Suttas&#39; insistence on the centrality of
      <I>jhāna</I>/<I>samādhi</I> as a path factor is undermined, an undermining 
      which only serves to seriously distort the timeless message of the Buddha.</P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="4">Notes:</FONT></B></P>
      (1) The term &#39;Sutta&#39; in this paper generally refers to the four 
      main <I>Nikāya</I>s of the Sutta <I>Pitaka</I>: the <I>Dīgha Nikāya</I>, 
      the <I>Majjhima Nikāya</I>, the <I>Samyutta Nikāya</I>, and the <I>
      Anguttara</I> <I>Nikāya</I>.<P>(2) By <I>samādhi</I> I generally 
      understand the four <I>jhāna</I>s, sometimes a slightly broader concept. 
      It might be thought that this is a narrow understanding of <I>samādhi</I> 
      because the Suttas contain many instances of <I>samādhi</I> that are 
      clearly not <I>jhāna</I>. These <I>samādhi</I>s can broadly be classified 
      into two types: <I>samādhi</I> that can arise prior to <I>jhāna</I> and <I>
      samādhi</I> that comes after <I>jhāna</I> and that depends on <I>jhāna</I>. 
      Into the latter category fall the formless attainments, the <I>samādhi</I> 
      that leads to <I>Arahant</I>ship (see A.II.45,23-33) and also the <I>
      samādhi</I> that is the result of <I>Arahant</I>ship (see A.V.7,7 - 10,2). 
      Because these <I>samādhi</I>s are based on <I>jhāna</I> their existence 
      confirms the importance of <I>jhāna</I> on the path.</P>
      <P>Into the former category fall such <I>samādhi</I>s as <I>
      animittasamādhi</I>, <I>suññatasamādhi</I> and <I>appanihitasamādhi</I> 
      (see e.g. D.III.219,21-22), <I>samādhi</I> gained from walking meditation 
      (see A.III.30) and possibly <I>samādhi</I> in conjunction with <I>
      satipatthāna</I> (see S.V.144,19 - 145,19 &amp; A.IV.300,24 - 301,15). But 
      even with these <I>samādhi</I>s it is far from clear that they do not, or 
      at least cannot, rely on <I>jhāna</I>. In the case of (A.IV.300,24 - 
      301,15), if one is to follow the sequential presentation in the Sutta 
      strictly (which presumably one must), <I>jhāna</I> precedes the <I>samādhi</I>s 
      based on <I>satipatthāna</I>. The same is quite possibly true of 
      (S.V.144,19 - 145,19). As for the first three <I>samādhi</I>s of <I>
      animittasamādhi</I> etc., it seems that they also are normally practised 
      after <I>jhāna</I> (see M.III.111), although the evidence may not be 
      conclusive that they have to be.<P>The most important fact about the various types of <I>samādhi</I>, 
      however, is that by far the most frequently occuring type is <I>jhāna</I>. 
      The three <I>samādhi</I>s of <I>animittasamādhi</I>, <I>suññatasamādhi</I> 
      and <I>appanihitasamādhi</I> occur very rarely in the Suttas compared to
      <I>jhāna</I>, and the same is true for &quot;<I>satipatthāna</I> <I>samādhi</I>&quot;. 
      Thus the relative importance of <I>jhāna</I> far outweighs the importance 
      of any of the other types of <I>samādhi</I> and <I>jhāna</I> is therefore 
      the preeminent type of <I>samādhi</I> on the Buddhist path. Thus when the 
      Suttas only speak of <I>samādhi</I>, without further qualification, it 
      seems reasonable to conclude that this is predominantly a reference to <I>
      jhāna</I>.
      <P>(3) By historical tendency I primarily mean the shift in focus 
      from the <I>Nikāya</I>s to the Commentaries. Where the <I>Nikāya</I>s put 
      great emphasis on <I>samādhi</I> and <I>jhāna</I>, even saying that full 
      Enlightenment is impossible without <I>jhāna</I> (see &quot;<I>So Vata</I> 
      Sutta&quot;, section 4.2), the Commentaries shift the emphasis towards pure <I>
      vipassanā</I> practice and in the process invent new terminology such as &quot;<I>sukkhavipassaka</I>&quot; 
      (one who practises dry insight) and &quot;<I>suddhavipassanā</I>&quot; (pure 
      insight). This shift in emphasis has been very influential to the present 
      day. <I>vipassanā</I> meditation with little emphasis on <I>samādhi</I>, 
      and often no emphasis on <I>jhāna</I>s, has been by far the most 
      influential &quot;meditation system&quot; of the Theravada tradition worldwide in 
      the second half of the 20th century.</P>
      (4) It should be noted that, although the term <I>
      lokuttarajjhāna</I> first appears in the Canonical Abhidhamma, it is 
      precisely defined only in the Abhidhamma Commentaries. Whether the 
      Abhidhamma Commentaries understand <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> in the same way 
      as the Canonical Abhidhamma is a moot point. However, because my main 
      critique in this paper is aimed at the Sutta Commentaries, which 
      presuppose both the Canonical Abhidhamma as well as its Commentaries, I 
      have made no distinction between the two.<P>(5) According to the Abhidhamma Commentaries the fruit 
      consciousness lasts two or three mind moments (see &quot;A Comprehensive Manual 
      of Abhidhamma&quot; by Bhikkhu Bodhi, p.177).</P>
      (6) And also to a fivefold classification of <I>jhāna</I> 
      adopted by the Abhidhamma (cf. Dhs. 167-174) but which is only rarely 
      mentioned in the Suttas (cf. M.III.162,15).
      
      <P>(7) Lit. &#39;<I>jhāna</I>s beyond the world&#39;.
      
      </P>
      (8) The Suttas, in contrast with the Abhidhamma, never focus 
      exclusively on the precise moments that the stages of Enlightenment are 
      attained. Rather, the Suttas seem to speak of these stages as &quot;ongoing 
      realities&quot;. Typical terminology used in the Suttas include: &quot;<I>dhammacakkhum 
      udapādi</I>&quot;, &quot;the eye of the Dhamma arose&quot;, (e.g. Vin.I.11,34); &quot;<I>sammāditthiyā 
      uppadāya</I>&quot;, &quot;the arising of right view&quot;, (M.I.294,1); &quot;<I>sotāpattiphalam 
      pi sacchikaronti</I>, <I>sakadāgāmīphalam pi sacchikaronti</I>, <I>
      anāgāmīphalam pi sacchikaronti</I>, <I>arahattam pi sacchikaronti</I>&quot;, 
      &quot;they realised the fruit of streamentry, they realised the fruit of 
      once-returner, they realised the fruit of non-returner, they realised the 
      fruit of <I>Arahant</I>ship&quot;, (D.I.229,4); &quot;<I>anupadāya āsavehi cittāni 
      vimuccimsu</I>&quot;, &quot;(their) minds were freed from the outflowings without 
      grasping&quot;, (e.g. Vin.I.14,35); &quot;<I>āsavānam khayam pāpunāti</I>&quot;, &quot;he 
      attained the destruction of the outflowings&quot;, (M.I.436,4). Each of these 
      refers to enduring realities.
      
      <P>(9) For the sake of completeness, it should be mentioned that 
      the Suttas on a few occasions mention types of <I>samādhi</I> that 
      possibly are directly related to the attainment of the four stages of 
      Enlightenment. The most important example would seem to be <I>
      animittasamādhi</I>, see (A.IV.78,18-30). However, even these <I>samādhi</I>s 
      do not appear to be momentary in the sense that <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> is 
      said to be.
      
      </P>
      (10) This is how the Commentaries tend to understand this 
      term, e.g. (MA.IV.130,22-24): &quot;<I>Tattha ariyan ti niddosam. Lokuttaram 
      niddosam hi ariyan ti vuccati. sammāsamādhin ti maggasamādhim</I>&quot; - 
      &quot;Therein <I>ariya</I> means undefiled. For <I>ariya</I> is called the 
      undefiled which is supramundane. <I>Sammāsamādhi</I> means path-<I>samādhi</I> 
      [i.e. <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>]&quot;; (AA.IV.28,19): &quot;<I>samādhiparikkhārā ti 
      maggasamādhissa sambhārā</I>&quot; - &quot;Requisite of <I>samādhi</I> means a 
      constituent of path-<I>samādhi</I>&quot;. See also Rupert Gethin&#39;s &quot;The 
      Buddhist Path to Awakening&quot;, p.218, line 19-22: &quot;Secondly there is the 
      attainment of right view etc. as noble, without āsavas, lokuttara, a 
      factor of the path. It is precisely this second stage that must be 
      understood as ariyo sammāsamādhi sa-upaniso sa-parikkhāro.&quot;
      
      <P>(11) It should be noted that only 5 occurrences in the four 
      main <I>Nikāya</I>s makes the phrase a rare one. There are also two 
      occurrences of a <I>samādhi</I> (as opposed to <I>sammāsamādhi</I>) which 
      is said to be &#39;ariya&#39; (D.III.278,27 &amp; A.III.24,15).

      <P>Then the two types of right view are explained in more detail.
      
      <P>(14) Unfortunately it is not perfectly clear in the Sutta 
      whether the twofold right view refers to two separate ways in which <I>
      sammāditthi</I> acts as a requisite to a<I>riya</I> <I>sammāsamādhi</I> or 
      whether both aspects of the twofold <I>sammāditthi</I> are part of the 
      same <I>sammāditthi</I> which is a requisite to a<I>riya</I> <I>
      sammāsamādhi</I>. But even if the latter is the case it is not necessary 
      to bring in <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> as an explanation. I would propose, 
      instead, that in this case <I>ariya</I> should be understood as a direct 
      reference to the person practising a<I>riya</I> <I>sammāsamādhi</I>, i.e. 
      that he is at least a <I>Sotāpanna</I>. <I>Ariya</I> <I>sammāsamādhi</I> 
      would then simply be <I>sammāsamādhi</I> attained by the <I>ariya</I>s. 
      This fits well with the fact that a<I>riya</I>s are said to be endowed 
      with the Noble Eightfold Path (S.V.348,3-4), i.e. <I>ariya</I> <I>
      sammāsamādhi</I> together with its seven requisites.
      
      There is still another way of looking at the passage from M117. According 
      to the Commentary the second type of right view, the view that is 
      supramundane, does in fact not refer to the right view of the <I>Sotāpanna</I> 
      but to the right view at the moment of the four paths, i.e. the moment 
      when each of the four stages of Enlightenment is attained. Thus it is 
      identical with <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>. This interpretation is probably the 
      result of the peculiar vocabulary used to qualify <I>sammāditthi</I> in 
      the present Sutta, in particular <I>magganga</I> and <I>anāsava</I> (but 
      also the string <I>paññā</I>, <I>paññindriya</I>, <I>paññābala</I> and <I>
      dhammavicayasambojjhanga</I>), which is reminiscent of Abhidhamma usage. 
      These terms are never used to qualify <I>sammāditthi</I> anywhere else in 
      the Suttas, and several of the terms used, such as <I>magganga</I>, <I>
      anāsavacitta</I> and <I>ariyacitta</I>, are never found at all in the 
      Suttas. It thus seems probable that these words are a late addition, a 
      conclusion reinforced by the fact that the <I>Āgama</I> version of this 
      Sutta (i.e. the Chinese equivalent) does not include this vocabulary.

      definition. At (Vibh. 334,1-8) one finds the following: &quot;<I>Tattha katamā 
      sammāsamādhi</I>? ... <I>Tamhā tamhā samādhimhā vutthitassa 
      paccavekkhanāñānam paccavekkhanānimittam</I>.&quot; - &quot;Therein what is the 
      five-factored right <I>samādhi</I>? ... The reviewing knowledge, the 
      reviewing sign of one who has come out of this or that <I>samādhi</I> (is 
      the five-factored right <I>samādhi</I>).&quot;
      
      If one is to follow the Vibhanga here, then &quot;this or that <I>samādhi</I>&quot; 
      would seem to refer to the <I>samādhi</I>s just mentioned in the Sutta 
      prior to the mentioning of the <I>paccavekkhanānimittam</I>, i.e. the four
      <I>jhāna</I>s. Thus the <I>paccavekkhanānimittam</I> would be based on one 
      or more of the four <I>jhāna</I>s.
      
      The same conclusion is arrived at when one takes account of the &quot;gradual&quot; 
      nature of the Suttas (cf. A.III.184,17). This means that the standard way 
      of exposition of Dhamma, explicitly recommended by the Buddha and a 
      pattern which is easily recognizable in Sutta after Sutta, is one of 
      natural progression. It is therefore to be expected that the <I>
      paccavekkhanānimittam</I> is a stage on the path which comes after the <I>
      jhāna</I>s and which is based on the <I>jhāna</I>s.

        <P>&quot;(Of) noble (means): (of) one standing far from the defilements which 
        have been abandoned due to suppression&quot;.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>&quot;Abandoning due to suppression&quot;, &quot;<I>vikkhambhanavasena pahinehi</I>&quot;, 
      is a Commentarial reference to suppression due to <I>jhāna</I>. Thus it 
      appears that the term &#39;<I>ariya</I>&#39; here is related to (ordinary) <I>
      jhāna</I> and not to the stages of Enlightenment.
      
      It might be objected that this passage is about the &#39;development&#39;, 
      &#39;bhāvanā&#39;, of <I>ariya</I> <I>sammāsamādhi</I> (i.e. &quot;<I>ariyassa 
      bhikkhave pañcangikassa sammāsamādhissa bhāvanam desissāmi</I> ...&quot;; 
      A.III.25,1-2) and not about <I>ariya</I> <I>sammāsamādhi</I> itself. 
      However, in the Suttas the development of a particular quality is usually 
      explained in terms of the quality itself. For example, the development (<I>bhāvanā</I>) 
      of <I>satipatthāna</I> is explained using the standard <I>satipatthāna</I> 
      formula (S.V.182,23 - 183,4); the same holds for the <I>iddhipāda</I>s 
      (S.V.276,15-19), the <I>sammāppadhāna</I>s (S.V.244,21 - 245,13), and 
      indeed for the <I>jhāna</I>s themselves (S.V.308,2-11). Thus it seems safe 
      to conclude that the &quot;development of <I>ariya</I> <I>sammāsamādhi</I>&quot; is 
      identical with <I>ariya</I> <I>sammāsamādhi</I> itself.
      
      <P>(18) This still does not answer the question of why the name &quot;<I>ariyo 
      sammāsamādhi</I>&quot; is used. I would suggest that because this <I>samādhi</I> 
      is defined as the eighth factor of the Noble Eightfold Path, supported by 
      the other seven factors, one is in effect developing the entire Noble 
      Eightfold Path when developing this <I>samādhi</I>. It would therefore 
      seem that the qualifier &quot;<I>ariya</I>&quot; is taken directly from the name of 
      the Noble (<I>ariya</I>) Eightfold Path.
      
      </P>
      (19) I argued above that the Sutta terminology for the 
      experiences of Enlightenment never refers to <I>samādhi</I> and <I>jhāna</I>. 
      However, since the Abhidhamma&#39;s <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> is not directly 
      equivalent to this Sutta terminology, it is still necessary to investigate 
      whether it might relate to <I>jhāna</I> or <I>samādhi</I>.
      
      <P>(20) The Commentaries use various terminology, such as <I>
      maggasamādhi</I> and <I>phalasamādhi</I>, which is equivalent to <I>
      lokuttarajjhāna</I>.

      attainments of <I>Anāgāmī</I> and <I>Arahant</I> respectively.
      
      </P>
      (26) Of course, a single Sutta may not be fully 
      self-explanatory. But all the Suttas taken together should give one a 
      comprehensive and complete understanding of the Dhamma.
      
      <P>(27) &quot;<I>Vivicca akusalehi dhammehi</I>&quot;; e.g. (D.I.73,23-24).
      
      </P>
      (28) The standard description of the second <I>jhāna</I> says: 
      &quot;<I>avitakkam avicāram samādhijam pītisukham</I>&quot;, &quot;without <I>vitakka</I> 
      without <I>vicāra</I> with rapture and happiness born of <I>samādhi</I>&quot;; 
      e.g. (D.I.74,15).
      
      <P>(29) One might think that the expression &quot;ceased without 
      remainder&quot;, &quot;<I>aparisesā nirujjhanti</I>&quot;, is more likely to be connected 
      with the stages of Enlightenment where defilements are completely uprooted 
      than with <I>jhāna</I> where the defilements are only temporarily 
      suppressed. However, in the Suttas this term is also used with reference 
      to the <I>jhāna</I>s (e.g. M.II.263ff).
      
      It might also seem that because this Sutta ends with a description of the
      <I>Arahant</I>, the previous stages are likely to concern stages of 
      Enlightenment. But it is common in the Suttas to describe the attainment 
      of <I>Arahant</I>ship directly after the attainment of the <I>jhāna</I>s, 
      for instance in the gradual training (e.g. D2).

      (37) In fact it would seem impossible that the <I>jhāna</I>s 
      of M64 refer to <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I>. In this Sutta the <I>jhāna</I>s 
      themselves are viewed as <I>dukkha</I>, <I>anicca</I>, and <I>anattā</I> 
      for the purpose of going beyond them and attaining at least to <I>Anāgāmī</I>. 
      This could therefore not refer to <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> because that 
      attainment is nothing but <I>Nibbāna</I> itself and consequently cannot be 
      considered as <I>dukkha</I>.
      
      <P>(38) With the possible exception of <I>animittasamādhi</I>, 
      see note 9 above. It is difficult, however, to draw any authoritative 
      conclusions on the precise nature of <I>animittasamādhi</I> based on the 
      Suttas alone. In the Suttas, it remains a marginal form of <I>samādhi</I> 
      compared to the <I>jhāna</I>s (see note 1 above) and as such its relevance 
      is limited. Other types of <I>samādhi</I> that may or may not relate 
      directly to the stages of Enlightenment, such as <I>suññatasamādhi</I>, <I>
      appanihitasamādhi</I>, and even <I>aññāphalasamādhi</I> (A.IV.428), are 
      even more marginal. In any case, if the present discussion is limited to 
      the <I>jhāna</I>s (and thus <I>sammāsamādhi</I>) the situation is quite 
      clear cut.
      
      </P>
      (39) This may seem more radical than it really is. As do most 
      Buddhist monks, I agree that it is important to respect the Commentaries 
      and all post-<I>Nikāya</I> Pali works. After all, these works are the 
      opinions of (presumably) highly respected Buddhist monks. One is obliged 
      to be extremely careful not to overestimate one&#39;s own understanding above 
      that of a strong and respected tradition. If there is any doubt, and one 
      does not have direct experience of the Dhamma oneself, one should always 
      defer to the tradition.
      
      Having said this, however, one has to keep in mind what the Buddha stated 
      in the Four Great Standards of the <I>Mahāparinibbāna</I> Sutta 
      (D.II.13,30 - 126,5): that the word of any authority, other than that of 
      the Buddha, which claims to speak the Dhamma should always be checked 
      against what is known with adequate certainty to be the Buddha&#39;s own 
      statements (i.e. the four main <I>Nikāya</I>s). What I have tried to do in 
      this paper is simply to subject one specific Commentarial interpretation 
      to this test.

      (41) All this seems to be a natural process. I think it highly 
      unlikely that members of the Sangha would intentionally distort the 
      Dhamma.
      
      <P>(42) A similar passage is found at (A.IV.84,9-19). There are 
      also a number of passages that mention the same list of five things as 
      being respected by various persons. For example at (A.IV.27,21 - 31,10) 
      there are four Suttas mentioning seven qualities that lead to non-decline, 
      the five factors common to all these Suttas being the Triple Gem, the 
      training, and <I>samādhi</I>. Another such set of seven occurs at 
      (A.IV.120,4 - 125,9). Finally, at (S.V.234,26-31) an <I>Arahant</I> is 
      said to conduct himself with supreme honour towards the <I>Tathāgata</I> 
      and the Dhamma by being reverential and deferential to the same basic set 
      of five.
      
      </P>
      (43) Note the correspondence here between the Buddha warning 
      that it is &quot;senseless people&quot; in the Sangha itself that cause the Dhamma 
      to disappear and the fact that the Commentaries (written by the Sangha) 
      seem to be distorting the Dhamma. (Again, this distortion seems to be 
      natural and unavoidable. If it had not been for the Sangha&#39;s efforts in 
      preserving the Dhamma, it would almost certainlty have disappeared long 
      ago.)
      
      <P>(44) It is the second book of the Abhidhamma, the Vibhanga, 
      which is of interest here.
      
      </P>
      (45) This division is one of the main organising principles of 
      the Vibhanga. However, it should be noted that many scholars consider the 
      Vibhanga to be the earliest part of the Abhidhamma. It thus seems likely 
      that in the rest of the Abhidhamma this division is implied, even if 
      rarely explicitly stated.
      
      <P>(46) I.e. the <I>indriya</I>s, the <I>satipatthāna</I>s, the
      <I>bojjhanga</I>s, etc.
      
      </P>
      (47) These sets are collectively known as the <I>
      Bodhipakkiyadhamma</I>s and they are very prominent in the Suttas, see in 
      particular volume V of the Samyutta <I>Nikāya</I>. (It should be noted 
      that the Vibhanga includes other sets as well - i.e. apart from the <I>
      Bodhipakkiyadhamma</I>s - but these sets are generally not concerned with
      <I>lokuttarajjhāna</I> and are therefore not relevant to this study.) It 
      is significant that when these sets are spoken of in the Suttas they are 
      always spoken of in terms of &quot;development&quot; or &quot;cultivation&quot;, i.e. &quot;<I>bhāvanā</I>&quot;. 
      This seems to be a clear indication that they form part of the <I>path</I> 
      of practice and not the <I>result</I> of practicing the path. This is in 
      sharp contrast to the Sutta terminology used to describe the attainments 
      of the stages of Enlightenment (i.e. the <I>results</I> of practice), 
      terminology such as: &quot;realization&quot; (<I>sacchikiriyā</I>); &quot;attainment&quot; (<I>anuppatta</I>); 
      &quot;liberation&quot; (<I>vimutta</I>); etc. This distinction seems to be very 
      consistent in the Suttas, the former being the path, the latter the 
      results.
      
      <P>(48) This is so for all the sets that make up the <I>
      Bodhipakkhiyadhamma</I>s apart from the 5 <I>indriya</I>s; for the <I>
      indriya</I>s only an Abhidhamma exposition is given.
      
      </P>
      (49) This is not surprising because one of the main purposes 
      of the Abhidhamma is precisely to analyze existence into its component 
      parts.
      
      <P>(50) This does not mean that the Abhidhamma analysis 
      necessarily is wrong, rather that it is not directly comparable to the 
      Sutta usage. It could be argued that the Abhidhamma-exposition describes 
      the culmination of the path as described by the Sutta-exposition (see &quot;The 
      Buddhist Path to Awakening&quot; by Rupert Gethin). Although the two 
      expositions may thus be compatible, they are still concerned with two very 
      different aspects of Buddhist practice, i.e. <I>the result of practicing 
      the path</I> and <I>the path itself</I> respectively.&lt;/50&gt;
