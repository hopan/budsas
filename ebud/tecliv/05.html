      </B>
      <P>WHAT we know as the conscious level of the human mind is only a very 
      small part of the mind in its entirety. General usage of the concept of 
      two levels of the mind, distinguished as the conscious and the 
      subconscious, suggests that the mind has two separate and well-defined 
      compartments; but this concept is by no means an accurate one. It would be 
      far better to compare the mind as a whole to a blackboard in a very dark 
      room, with many words and phrases chalked over the whole surface. Because 
      of the darkness of the room you can’t see any of the words or phrases. 
      However, if you shine the beam of an electric torch on to the centre of 
      the blackboard, you’ll be able to read the word that the centre of the 
      beam illuminates, and you will be able also to see the words around the 
      outside of the torch beam where the light is less bright.</P>
      <P>The centre of the torch beam where the light is brightest can be 
      compared with full consciousness, the chalked word that the beam fully 
      illuminates being like the focus of consciousness. The words within the 
      less bright area on the outside of the lighted area are like the ideas in 
      the fringe of consciousness, while those on the test of the blackboard 
      represent the multitudinous ideas in the subconscious mind.</P>
      <P>As you move the torch beam on to different areas of the blackboard 
      different words and phrases come momentarily into the centre of the beam, 
      with others, less brightly lit,towards the outer edges of the beam. The 
      rest of the blackboard remains in darkness.</P>
      <P>In just the same way, the focus of consciousness moves and brings into 
      full consciousness one idea after another, with generally a few associated 
      ideas in the fringe of consciousness. At all times, the rest of the ideas 
      remain in the subconscious mind.</P>
      <P>If the blackboard were to be completely clear of obstructions you could 
      shine the torch on to any and every word or phrase and bring it into the 
      focus of the beam. But let’s imagine, for the purpose of illustration, 
      that some parts of the blackboard are concealed. A tall filing cabinet 
      stands in front of one corner with a poster pinned over another corner, 
      while on odd parts of the board numerous pieces of sticking plaster 
      obscure various words and phrases. You can’t illuminate the hidden words 
      with the torch beans unless you can remove the filing cabinet and the 
      poster as well as the pieces of sticking plaster.</P>
      <P>In a similar way, the mind of the average person has many regions which 
      are inaccessible to the torch beam of full consciousness. These are the 
      regions which, over the years, have been blocked off by pain and fear, by 
      horror, guilt, and inferiority feelings. To clear these away and make the 
      concealed ideas accessible to consciousness is generally a much greater 
      task than can be accomplished by the average person during his lifetime.</P>
      <P>However, even though you can not discover and remove all the fear, 
      guilt, and inferiority feelings that both in childhood and in later years 
      have blocked off some regions of your mind, you can at least endeavour to 
      accept yourself as you are, with your inheritance of primitive urges and 
      your acquired hatreds, fears, and greeds.</P>
      <P>This acceptance demands continuous mindfulness, for this is the key to 
      self-improvement. Mindfulness in Buddhism has many forms, and that form 
      which has a special value in this connection is called mindfulness of the 
      mind. That is a matter of training yourself to be aware of your own 
      emotional state at all times and to recognise it for what it is. If at a 
      particular time the emotional state is one of annoyance and resentment, or 
      of envy, ill will, or some other retardant mental factor, then the honest 
      recognition of this factor, freed as far as possible from feelings of 
      guilt and attempts at repression, is in effect the acceptance of yourself 
      as your are.</P>
      <P>It is necessary also to develop an awareness of your own progressant 
      mental qualities, such as those of generosity, goodwill, and the 
      discernment of the illusory nature of your own ego, without any element of 
      personal pride or smugness.</P>
      <P>Thus the simple recognition of both the retardant and the progressant 
      mental factors, as and when they arise in your daily contacts and 
      activities, is seen to be the first application of the principle of 
      acceptance.</P>
      <P>The acceptance of yourself as you are must be balanced by the 
      acceptance of other people as they are. As your self-knowledge increases 
      so also your knowledge of other people increases. While people vary 
      tremendously in their levels of self-development as well as in their 
      reactions to circumstances, their most basic instinctive and emotional 
      structures are very similar to your own.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>They too, deep below the consciously accessible regions of their minds, 
      have their own heritages of primitive urges, carried over from their 
      pre-human and caveman ancestors. They too were subjected in childhood to 
      varying degrees of parental mishandling and repressive control, and they 
      too need some degree of deep understanding.</P>
      <P>By way of this deep understanding of others, you learn to accept them 
      as they are, so that, to the degree that you understand and accept them 
      (but only to that degree) you will be likely to react to them without 
      annoyance and resentment.</P>
      <P>You may not be able to eliminate annoyance and resentment entirely from 
      your dealings with others, of course, but you can use such occasions for 
      the recognition and acceptance of both your own and others’ failings. With 
      this acceptance must come greater harmony, both internally and externally.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>So here are two spheres of life in which to practise the principle of 
      acceptance – one’s own emotional and mental structure and the 
      emotion-laden reactions of other people. There’s a third sphere in which 
      to apply the same principle, and this is the world as a whole with its 
      mixture of pleasure and pain.</P>
      <P>If you were to become a prisoner you could adopt any of three attitudes 
      towards your prison. Firstly, you could kick the walls, thump the bars, 
      shout abuse at the guards, and reject it at every point with bitterness 
      and resentment. The effect would be to make your imprisonment more severe 
      and traumatic in every way, and to increase the very things you reject.</P>
      <P>At the other extreme you could sit in passive resignation and brood in 
      an inert manner, making no effort to find a means of escape. Your apathy 
      would serve only to magnify your misery and resentment. </P>
      <P>Both of these extreme attitudes would tend to paralyse your powers. 
      However, there’s a third kind of attitude you could adopt: you could 
      accept your prison as a problem to be solved, assessing it realistically 
      and in great detail, searching for its flaws, and remaining always alert 
      and ready to take the first real opportunity to escape. This attitude, 
      ideally, should have no resentment in it, for resentment and its kindred 
      mental states cause emotional biases, which in turn impair your judgement; 
      and impaired judgement brings unrealistic action.</P>
      <P>The acceptance of the world as it really is must embrace the acceptance 
      of yourself, of all the other people in your environment, and of 
      everything that in any way impinges on you. Positive acceptance doesn’t 
      mean inert resignation. It means acceptance of things as they are as the 
      starting point in the long trek towards freedom.</P>
      <P>This mental attitude of acceptance makes it easier to deal with life 
      and effectively to resist all the difficult things in the environment, as 
      well as all the difficult things in the mind itself.</P>
      <P>This non-resentful acceptance of things as they are is a matter of 
      squarely meeting all things, a matter of learning to control anxiety, to 
      conquer resentment, and to keep self-assertion in check.</P>
      <P>With this attitude of non-resentment and positive acceptance you learn 
      not to tense up more than necessary against adversity. This is not passive 
      resignation; it is the positive acceptance of every problem as the raw 
      material out of which you can build achievement. With all your problems 
      miraculously taken away you would find yourself without any raw material 
      and thus without any possibility of achievement.</P>
      <P>This principle of non-resentful acceptance must seep through the whole 
      of life; it cannot be made into a specific practice or a 
      concisely-formulated exercise. The practical work for this period, then, 
      is only the first step. It is meant to help you to acquire an insight into 
      the degree to which you resent the problems and difficult things in your 
      life, and from this insight the rest will follow.</P>
      <B>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">Practical Work</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">A SELF-QUESTIONNAIRE ON NON-RESENTFUL ACCEPTANCE</P>
      </B>
      <P>In answering the following questionnaire, you could probably go through 
      the whole series of questions and give an immediate answer to each 
      question. In many cases an immediate answer will readily come to mind; but 
      it will not necessarily be a true one, nor will it be of real value to 
      you.</P>
      <P>The aim of each question is not so much to arrive at an answer as to 
      start a train of thought, and the aim of this in turn is to give you some 
      degree of self-understanding.</P>
      <P>Take one question at a time, then, and think about it at odd times 
      during the day; the resulting train of thought will be of greater value 
      than a clear-cut snap answer to the question.</P>
      <P>As a result, it may be that other questions and other ideas, related in 
      some way to the original question, will come into your mind. These, too, 
      will help in the process of self-understanding.</P>
      <P>To start these trains of thought, then, ask yourself the following 
      questions:</P>
      <P>1. Do I resent my problems and the difficult things in my life?</P>
      <P>2. Or do I accept these problems and difficult things as the raw 
      material for achievement?</P>
      <P>3. Do I resent being dominated or controlled by others?</P>
      <P>4. Do I deeply envy the good fortunes of others?</P>
      <P>5. Do I resent being ignored by others?</P>
      <P>6. Do I accept these problems and difficult thing in an inert, defeated 
      way?</P>
      <P>7. If so, has this brought about a half-repressed bitterness and a 
      smouldering resentment towards them?</P>
      <P>8. Do I tend to resent any particular religious group? </P>
      <P>9. Or any particular racial group?</P>
      <P>10. Have I a defensive attitude towards life or people as a whole?</P>
      <P>11. Or an aggressive attitude?</P>
      <P>12. Or a suspicious attitude?</P>
      <P>13. Do I harbour any grudges or desires for revenge? </P>
      <P>14. Do I have any strong motivations which are based on resentment?</P>
      <P>15. Do I react to criticism by hostility or resentment?</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>Assuming that you are employing the self-contract method of 
      self-discipline, look back every few days to see if you have used the 
      questionnaire consistently and in a sufficiently penetrating manner; and, 
      if you feel you have not done so, deprive yourself of some small pleasure.</P>
