      </B>
      <P>IF you want to control something – whatever it is – the more you know 
      about it the better you will be able to control it. If you want to drive a 
      car, you can manage with a minimum of knowledge of its workings while 
      conditions are good; but when it breaks down, miles from help, the greater 
      your knowledge of its mechanism the greater will be your chance of getting 
      it on the move again.</P>
      <P>It is the same with your own emotional problems. You can go only a 
      small distance in life without emotional problems, and while you need no 
      special understanding of them when the going is smooth, you do need all 
      the self-knowledge possible when you enter a rough phase.</P>
      <P>Can you imagine a motor mechanic who has no clear understanding of what 
      goes on under the bonnet of a car? Yet many of us have no clear 
      understanding what goes on under own bonnets.</P>
      <P>The greater the self-knowledge you possess the better, and this is true 
      both of knowledge gained by your own self-observation and of knowledge 
      gained by book-learning. One supplements the other; and this applies 
      particularly to the knowledge of emotion. Let us therefore consider; 
      emotion at the theoretical level.</P>
      <P>Emotions are accompanied by certain bodily changes or perhaps we should 
      say that emotions consist of the awareness of the bodily changes that take 
      place under certain conditions.</P>
      <P>In order to illustrate this point, let us take the condition of fear. 
      When you become frightened it begins with some frightening idea in your 
      mind: this frightening idea is the cause of your emotion of fear, and is 
      accompanied by a nervous current in certain parts of your brain.</P>
      <P>From the brain, this nervous current travels to your adrenal glands, 
      and this causes these glands to discharge into your blood stream a 
      substance known as adrenin (or less accurately as adrenalin). Your blood 
      stream conveys this adrenin to various organs of your body.</P>
      <P>The adrenin hag a definite effect on many of these organs; for example, 
      when it reaches your liver it causes it to discharge into your blood 
      stream an extra supply of sugar, this sugar giving to every muscle that it 
      reaches an additional energy supply.</P>
      <P>As further results of the adrenin in your blood, your heart beats more 
      rapidly, your eyes open wider, and your blood itself clots more readily 
      should you be wounded.</P>
      <P>You can see that all these bodily changes would have a very definite 
      value during actual physical combat or any rapid muscular activity; there 
      are the extra supply of fuel to your muscles, for example, and the quicker 
      heart-beat and circulation which replenish this fuel supply and remove the 
      ash from your cells; these are all valuable to you if you are fleeing or 
      fighting, running or climbing.</P>
      <P>There are some side-effects, too. For example, your hair tends to stand 
      on end. This does not help you, of course, but it does help some of your 
      sub-human relations when it happens to them. It helps a cat to appear 
      bigger and more formidable and thus more frightening to an enemy, and it 
      helps a porcupine because its quills are an actual defensive weapon.</P>
      <P>When your hair stands on end, then, you are automatically responding in 
      the same way as did some of your pre-human-relations. But in you it is an 
      obsolete mechanism.</P>
      <P>The bodily changes are of no real use unless the need for action 
      arises; but that is not the whole story. Man of the civilized world does 
      not generally solve his problems in the same way as did his cave-dwelling 
      ancestors or his primitive brothers, because his problems and his outside 
      conditions are different. Nevertheless his involuntary reactions are much 
      the same.</P>
      <P>In most cases when a man becomes frightened, fighting or fleeing will 
      not solve the problem, as there is often no tangible aggressor to fight 
      and no place to which to flee. Yet the bodily changes occur just the same.</P>
      <P>Your bodily changes during fear, therefore, are often inappropriate; 
      not only so, they are also frequently an embarrassment because too much 
      fuel is released into your blood-stream without any purpose to fulfil. In 
      this way you may have various physical and nervous disorders as a result 
      of repeated emotional disorders, disorders arising not only from fear but 
      also from anxiety, jealousy, resentment, anger, and inferiority feelings.</P>
      <P>But the story is not yet complete. During an emotional disturbance, in 
      order to allow full activity to various muscles – those of the legs for 
      running, the arms for fighting, and so on – the arteries that serve the 
      digestive system are contracted so that they receive a diminished blood 
      supply. To divert their fuel to the other muscles, the muscles of the 
      digestive system are deprived of it and in consequence the digestive 
      activities are held up for the time.</P>
      <P>Such disturbances may last for hours, and you can see how easy it is 
      for digestive troubles to arise as a result of fear, anxiety, jealousy, 
      resentment, anger, and inferiority feelings.</P>
      <P>It has been shown by experiment that adverse emotions generate poisons 
      within the bodily system, and that under extreme conditions some of the 
      brain cells may be temporarily or permanently injured by intense emotion.</P>
      <P>So from all this you can see that some sort of emotional discipline is 
      desirable. Of what possible use are the bodily changes of fear or anger 
      when a man insults you over the telephone? Certainly they give you extra 
      strength to throw the telephone out of the window, but this solves no 
      problems. If a man falls in love with a screen actress, his heart will 
      beat more rapidly to enable him to begin a primitive love-chase; but in 
      the circumstances of modern civilisation where would this chase end – or 
      begin?</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>Now there are three aspects to the matter of disciplining the emotions. 
      The first aspect of emotional discipline is the development of a habit of 
      self-observation with regard to your own emotional conditions. In Buddhist 
      terminology, this is called the detailed observation of the mental state. 
      The second aspect involves the control of emotional manifestations as 
      these arise. The third aspect is a matter of developing a new set of 
      values of such a kind that many of the circumstances that previously 
      called out the responses of fear, anger. self-assertion, and so on, then 
      fail to do so, or at least do so to a reduced extent. </P>
      <P>Little need be said about the need for controlling the powerful 
      emotions that lead to both external discord and internal conflict; their 
      effects are in most cases distressingly obvious. Racial hatreds, religious 
      prejudices, political biases – these lie at the root of many quarrels 
      between individuals and between nations. Ambivalent feelings of love and 
      hate towards others within the family, as well as irrational fears and 
      guilt complexes, give rise to neuroses and other mental aberrations.</P>
      <P>To wait until an emotional problem reaches major proportions before 
      dealing with it is like waiting until a trickle becomes a flood. The 
      Buddhist method is to keep constant watch – to apply constant mindfulness 
      – while an adverse emotion exists as a trickle, and to deal with it at 
      this stage; for when it reaches the proportions of a flood much of the 
      damage, inwardly and outwardly, is already done.</P>
      <P>To try to deal with major emotional problems by any sort of repressive 
      emotional control either drives the real causes into other channels or 
      else intensifies the outer effects, so that emotional control requires 
      something better than any possible form of surface treatment can offer.</P>
      <P>Emotional control must begin with what in Buddhism is called the 
      detailed observation of the mental state. This is a matter of continual 
      self-observation with a view to detecting the presence of any emotion 
      which might retard the mind’s progress towards enlightenment.</P>
      <P>The recognition of such retardant emotions in their mildest and most 
      unobtrusive forms is regarded in Buddhist practice as highly important, 
      for it is necessary to see them for what they are before they reach 
      greater proportions. Recognition is the first essential to control.</P>
      <P>In order to control your emotions you must know what you are 
      controlling, and this knowledge (apart from its theoretical aspect) is the 
      work of mindfulness. Without it attempts at control by will-power alone 
      might degenerate into harmful repression.</P>
      <P>Repression is a matter of pressing unwelcome mental states below the 
      level at which they are accessible to consciousness. The work of 
      mindfulness, on the other hand, is the work of bringing the full light of 
      sharpened awareness to bear on all mental states, unwelcome and otherwise, 
      and this is the very opposite of repression.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, occasions in your everyday life when you must 
      exercise a great deal of effort of will to prevent an emotional outburst. 
      You must bottle up your emotions even though you know that this 
      bottling-up is building up harmful tension, tension of mind and body.</P>
      <P>At other times you feel that it is absolutely imperative to give vent 
      to your adverse emotions, hateful and petty and spiteful as you know them 
      to be. You feel you must have your emotional splurge whatever the 
      consequences.</P>
      <P>Which is right and which is wrong? Right and wrong are conventional 
      words which sometimes obscure the real point. The real question is, which 
      does the less harm in the long run? You must either keep control at all 
      costs – and this, according to some standards, is the right thing to do – 
      or you must let go and give your wrong emotions an outlet.</P>
      <P>The answer, in part at least, is that whatever you do you must do it as 
      mindfully as possible in the circumstances. If you must let go and have 
      your emotional splurge, if you must give way to your annoyance, self-pity, 
      envy, or whatever it is, you should be as fully aware of it as you, can 
      and realise its nature. In this way you will keep some control over it; 
      but once you seek to justify yourself or deceive yourself as to what you 
      are doing you begin to lose this control.</P>
      <P>You must, of course, consider its effects on others, and from this 
      viewpoint an emotional outburst is often quite wrong. From one viewpoint – 
      from the viewpoint of your own development – it is better to do wrong 
      mindfully than to do right mindlessly; it is better to be fully aware of 
      what you are doing and why you are doing it – however conventionally wrong 
      it is – than to do the conventionally right thing without knowing why. </P>
      <P>When your emotions are too strong and you give way to an emotional 
      outburst, this outburst can be considered a failure; but because you are 
      an ordinary human being and not a superhuman these failures will occur 
      from time to time. If you train yourself in mindfulness – especially in 
      the detailed observation of the mental state – such failures will occur 
      less and less frequently. The important thing is that progress is taking 
      place.</P>
      <B>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">Practical Work</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">THE CONTROL OF ANXIETY</P>
      </B>
      <P>To become tense in circumstances of stress is easy; to remain calm and 
      free from agitation is difficult. Being difficult, it requires 
      self-training, self-training not only at the level of muscular relaxation 
      but also at the mental level. Methods of muscular relaxation are of great 
      value in bringing about a generally relaxed condition of both mind and 
      body, for mind and body interact; but muscular relaxation needs to be 
      supplemented by mental relaxation.</P>
      <P>Let us consider, therefore, how best you can approach the problem of 
      tension at the mental level. To do this, of course, you must go further 
      back than the tension itself; you must go back to the tension-causing 
      factors in the mind; and these can be defined in broad terms as anxiety, 
      resentment, and self-assertion.</P>
      <P>These three factors arise from what in Buddhism are called the three 
      roots of mental evil – selfish desire, aversion, and delusion. From 
      selfish desire arises anxiety; from aversion arises resentment; and from 
      delusion arises self-assertion. Of these three tension-causing factors – 
      anxiety, resentment, and self-assertion – let us take just one as the 
      basis for an exercise in mindfulness.</P>
      <P>Therefore, during a period of a month or more, take in hand the problem 
      of anxiety. Make a contract with yourself to the effect that after each 
      time you allow yourself to become unduly anxious about anything at all you 
      will apply some small self-imposed penalty on yourself.</P>
      <P>Just what penalty you use is for you to decide, but it should be an 
      easy one, one that you can impose on yourself without tending to throw it 
      aside. If you find it too irksome you will need to break it down a little; 
      on the other hand if it becomes too easy and ineffective you will need to 
      stiffen it up to some extent.</P>
      <P>You must recognise that anxiety is related to desires of various kinds 
      (selfish and otherwise), to attachment, and to possessiveness. In tackling 
      the problem of anxiety, then, you are working on these other factors as 
      well to some extent.</P>
