      COMPREHENSION</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>IN developing an efficient approach to the problems of life, one of the 
      first essentials is to reach a clear comprehension of what you really want 
      from life. You could simplify – or over-simplify – the answer to this 
      question by saying that all you want from life is happiness. On the other 
      hand you could enumerate a multitude of hopes and ambitions which might 
      become so complicated and so mutually contradictory that you would need to 
      undertake a lengthy process of self-analysis before you could sort it all 
      out.</P>
      <P>Some sort of answer half-way between the too-simple and the too-complex 
      is what is really wanted. Without a well-defined understanding of what 
      your central aim in life is – that is to say, without a clear 
      comprehension of motive, as it is called in Buddhist psychology – there is 
      a tendency to sink into the unthinking drift of life; and once caught up 
      in the unthinking drift your whole life lacks focus.</P>
      <P>To know what you want is very important. To know why you want it is 
      also very important, and it will help you to do this if you understand in 
      theory the nature of your desires, their origins in the instincts, and the 
      emotions associated with them.</P>
      <P>To understand your emotions and desires, you must first understand your 
      instincts. These instincts are inherent tendencies to act in specific ways 
      in specific circumstances. The instincts themselves exist below the level 
      of the intellect – that is to say, below the level of your conscious 
      reasoning processes – and being so much older than the intellect (in an 
      evolutionary sense) they are so much stronger.</P>
      <P>While your instincts are subconscious, your emotions and desires are 
      conscious – sometimes too much so. In fact your emotions and desires are 
      upthrusts into consciousness from your instincts. An instinct is like a 
      volcano; it exists largely below ground level, but when it becomes active 
      it throws lava and smoke upwards. In the same way, an instinct exists 
      below consciousness, but when it becomes active it throws emotions and 
      desires upwards into consciousness.</P>
      <P>You can see, then, that the emotions and desires are upthrusts into 
      consciousness from the instincts; but an emotion is not the same as a 
      desire. An emotion is a comparatively vague and diffuse form of awareness 
      at the level of bodily sensation, while a desire is a form of awareness at 
      a higher level, at the level of ideas.</P>
      <P>Your desires are, in fact, ideas of a sort; they are ideas of 
      activities you want to carry out or else ideas of sensations you want to 
      experience.</P>
      <P>Thus if you are angry you have the idea of striking out at something; 
      this can be called a motor idea, an idea of muscular activity, and it is 
      aroused by the instinct of aggressiveness.</P>
      <P>Again, if you are hungry, the sensory idea of food arises in your mind, 
      energized or aroused by the inherent tendency to eat when the body 
      requires food.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the classification into motor desires and sensory desires – 
      into desires to act and desires to experience – is an over-simplification; 
      perhaps all desires include both motor ideas and sensory ideas; but the 
      main point in the present context is that a desire exists at the 
      ideational level of the mind while an emotion exists at the level of 
      diffuse bodily awareness.</P>
      <P>Let’s look at it in this way; when one of your instincts becomes active 
      your body automatically prepares itself for the appropriate activity by 
      various changes. You become aware of the bodily changes, and the diffuse 
      awareness of them constitutes an emotion.</P>
      <P>At the same time, some specific idea of undertaking some action or 
      undergoing an experience may arise in your mind; this also is a result of 
      the instinct which has been aroused. This idea is emotionally charged – 
      that is to say, it is energised by the energy of the instinct – and thus 
      it becomes a desire.</P>
      <P>In sub-human life all activity is primarily instinctive, and whatever 
      intellect does exist is directed towards finding ways to satisfy the 
      instinctive promptings.</P>
      <P>In human life the situation is not basically different from the 
      situation in sub-human life, but it is vastly more complex. Most activity 
      is primarily motivated in the first place by the instincts, represented in 
      consciousness by the emotions and desires. The intellect functions mainly 
      by seeking ways – most often very devious ways – to gratify the desires 
      and to produce pleasant emotions. This means that the intellect functions 
      mainly by seeking ways to satisfy the instincts. The instincts are like 
      the engines of a ship while the intellect is like the rudder.</P>
      <P>Very little activity, if any, is motivated primarily by the intellect, 
      and intellectual motivation is secondary to instinctive motivation.</P>
      <P>Thus your thoughts, your beliefs, your opinions, and your plans – these 
      are all largely conditioned by the way you feel, by what you like and 
      dislike, by what you want to do, and by what you want to avoid. </P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>So you see that most of your thinking is emotional thinking, and very 
      little of it is objective or dispassionate thinking.</P>
      <P>In emotional thinking, facts and observations are falsified or wrongly 
      coloured by desires and biases and prejudices. On the other hand, in 
      dispassionate thinking – what little of it there is – the same facts are 
      seen clearly and the same observations are unbiased and free from desires 
      and prejudices, with no false colouring.</P>
      <P>In emotional thinking, you tend to believe a thing because it pleases 
      you to believe it or to reject an idea because it displeases you. In 
      objective thinking you accept an idea if it is reasonable, whether it 
      pleases you or repels you, and you reject an idea, however much you like 
      it, if it fails to measure up to reason; or at least you accept it only 
      tentatively and in an experimental spirit.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>It is true that one of the main factors that gave primitive man his 
      supremacy over his sub-human rivals and enemies was his intellect, his 
      ability to use ideas as tools with which to reason, and to use simple 
      words as shorthand symbols, so to speak, for complex ideas.</P>
      <P>At the same time it is important to realize that when opposed to 
      emotions and desires, the intellect shows up as a relatively feeble and 
      sometimes ineffective force. Emotions and desires are upthrusts into 
      consciousness from the tremendous instinctive forces, and even the most 
      powerful intellect may find itself powerless in the face of such 
      opposition.</P>
      <P>To control a desire by simple will-effort, then, is often very 
      difficult, sometimes impossible, and at times perhaps harmful. </P>
      <P>It is difficult when the desire is anything more than a superficial 
      one. It is impossible when the desire serves as an outlet for a powerful 
      instinct. And it may be harmful when the desire serves as an outlet for an 
      instinct which has been denied other outlets. This is especially so when 
      there is a guilt sense or a feeling of shame acting as a repressing force.</P>
      <P>It is then that extensive and deep-reaching self-understanding becomes 
      necessary in order to understand and control your desires; but you cannot 
      deal adequately with strong desires unless you train yourself to handle 
      the small desires that crop up from time to time in your every day life.</P>
      <P>While some forms of Buddhist mind-training can be best undertaken in a 
      quiet and secluded environment, others can be woven into the fabric of 
      everyday concerns and thus can be made an integral part of these concerns.</P>
      <P>The practice of clear comprehension is one of the latter kind, for it 
      has considerable scope for application in the busy workaday routine.</P>
      <P>While the term clear comprehension is fairly self-explanatory, it would 
      be well to discuss, for a short time, what it means in terms of Buddhist 
      mental culture. In the first application of the term, clear comprehension 
      means the clear comprehension of the motive or purpose of an activity.</P>
      <P>In other words, whatever you are doing, you should clearly comprehend 
      why you are doing it. Instead of having a vague or fuzzy idea of what you 
      expect to achieve by it you should try to get a clear-cut idea of its 
      purpose, which is to say a clear-cut idea of the desires that prompt you 
      to carry out the activity.</P>
      <P>Secondly, having clarified your mind as to the motive of an activity, 
      you should get an equally clear-cut idea of whether or not it is really 
      suitable for its purpose. Thus the Buddha-doctrine shows the need not only 
      for a clear comprehension of the motive of an action but also for a clear 
      comprehension of the suitability of the action for its purpose.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, there is the need for absorbing the element of clear 
      comprehension into every activity. In other words, the whole of one’s 
      life, embracing every activity and every experience, is the domain of 
      mindfulness, and thus, by extending the domain of mindfulness into every 
      activity and every experience, the whole of life becomes the basis for 
      mental culture.</P>
      <P>Finally there is a form of mindfulness called the clear comprehension 
      of non-delusion. The full implication of this clear comprehension of 
      non-delusion involves the fundamental Buddhist teaching that the separate 
      self is a delusion; thus the clear comprehension of non-delusion is a 
      sharpened awareness that breaks through self-deceit and penetrates right 
      through the delusion of selfhood to the reality of one’s own being.</P>
      <P>Let us now return to the first kind of clear comprehension, the clear 
      comprehension of motive. When you apply this to the whole of your life, to 
      your hopes and desires, and to all your planning and striving, it 
      presupposes that you have some fundamental purpose in life. You may not 
      have an overall motive in your life, however; you may be caught in the 
      unthinking drift, and if this is so the first thing to do is to become 
      aware of this fact, and if possible to define some kind of overall motive.</P>
      <P>Assuming however, that you have such a motive or purpose in life, it’s 
      desirable, in the interest of efficient living, that you give thought to 
      your activities as a whole to see if they line up with the focus of your 
      life or whether they take you into all sorts of unprofitable side-issues.</P>
      <P>This is not to say, of course, that you cannot have side-issues; these 
      are unavoidable in ordinary life. There are many things you have to do, 
      quite contrary to your central purpose, which left to yourself you would 
      never even think of doing; yet because of your need to earn a living or 
      your responsibilities and duties towards others, you must do those things.</P>
      <P>Now if you allow the need to do these things to build up resentment and 
      annoyance, they certainly will take you aside from your central purpose, 
      whereas if you use them as opportunities to develop patience and tolerance 
      you then bring them into line with your central purpose.</P>
      <P>Thus by the clear comprehension that every experience is the domain of 
      mindfulness you can make the best use of activities that otherwise would 
      be unprofitable.</P>
      <P>While it may not be easy to define your ultimate objective in life, you 
      can generally define the immediate purposes of your everyday activities. 
      You know why you always catch a certain train every working morning; you 
      know why you go to work; and you know why you must earn money. You know 
      also why you buy the necessities of life, and perhaps you know why you 
      also buy some of the luxuries of life.</P>
      <P>Do your luxuries really make life more enjoyable? Some of them do; 
      others make life more difficult. These are the luxuries you must buy for 
      their prestige-value, because your neighbours have them, perhaps, or 
      because in your social set you are expected to have them. But these 
      luxuries may become burdensome necessities, and because they must be paid 
      for and maintained they cost more than they yield.</P>
      <P>This is where the clear comprehension of non-delusion comes into the 
      picture. To what extent are you motivated by self-assertion, for the 
      desire for prestige and approval?</P>
      <P>Perhaps having found the answers to these questions, and having found 
      them to be not very flattering, you find you must continue to do things of 
      no ultimate value. Because of family obligations, or responsibilities to 
      others, or business necessities, you must continue to do things that cut 
      across your fundamental purpose in life. You have applied the principle of 
      clear comprehension of suitability and found certain activities quite 
      unsuitable for their ultimate purpose; but such situations are often 
      unavoidable.</P>
      <P>But at least you are not deceiving yourself. It is when you unmindfully 
      take on unnecessary activities – activities that cut across your central 
      purpose – that you sink into the unthinking drift. The important thing, 
      then, is freedom from the unthinking drift, and the key to this freedom is 
      clear comprehension – the clear comprehension of the purpose of an 
      activity and of its suitability, the clear comprehension that every 
      activity is the domain of mindfulness, and the clear comprehension of that 
      non-delusion.</P>
      <P>This is the Buddhist practice of clear comprehension in its various 
      forms.</P>
      <B>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">Practical Work</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">RECOGNITION OF MOTIVE</P>
      </B>
      <P>In the path to self-understanding you will find that it is of great 
      importance to gain a clear comprehension of the true motives of your 
      various activities. It is in the sphere of motivation that the human mind 
      finds perhaps the greatest scope for self-deceit, and in consequence 
      self-centred anxiety, resentment, and self-assertion are often at the 
      basis of activities which on the surface seem to have nobler and less 
      self-centred motives.</P>
      <P>Your practical work for this period then, consists of constant 
      endeavour to become critically aware of the fundamental motives behind 
      your everyday activities. An activity which appears to you yourself and to 
      others to be generous, full of goodwill, and devoid of self-interest, may 
      on self-examination prove to be motivated by self-centred anxiety, 
      resentment, or self-assertion in some form; and the recognition of your 
      true motives is an essential part of self understanding.</P>
      <P>The exercise of a constant endeavour to become critically aware of 
      these motives is, as you can see, essential; but this constant endeavour 
      may tend to become swamped by the pressure of everyday concerns. This is 
      where the self-contract method of self-discipline will prove most useful. 
      To apply it, every day throughout the period of a month you will look back 
      at the day’s main activities and critically examine your various motives. 
      When you fail to do this, impose on yourself some small penalty.</P>
