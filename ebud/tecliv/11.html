      </B>
      <P>IN his evolutionary history, man has attained to the dominant position 
      in his world by virtue of his intellect; but nevertheless he’s been 
      governed largely by his instincts and emotions. Man’s primary motivation 
      has come from his self-preserving and race-preserving urges towards 
      fighting, escaping, mating, and so on; his intellect has functioned, in 
      part at least, by steering him where his instincts have urged him to go. 
      However, without his instincts and emotions, man would never have 
      survived. It has been said:</P>
      <P>Were it fully understood that the emotions are the masters and the 
      intellect the servant, it would seem that little could be done by 
      improving the servant while the masters remained unimproved. Improving the 
      servant does but give the masters more power of achieving their end. 
      (Herbert Spencer)</P>
      <P>These primitive urges, then, have served a purpose in man’s evolution, 
      but in general they are appropriate to primitive conditions; they were 
      evolved under primitive conditions, and in many ways they fail to fit into 
      the circumstances of civilized life. Thus for further human progress and 
      for the fulfilment of man’s potentialities, it now seems that his 
      motivations must be transformed and refined.</P>
      <P>Progress so far has been racial rather than individual; that is to say 
      it is mankind as a whole that has progressed or evolved, and the 
      individual in most cases has been simply a unit in the evolving race. Now, 
      however, it appears that many individual human beings have reached a point 
      at which their progress along the evolutionary path is largely in their 
      own hands.</P>
      <P>Thus it seems that some of us have reached a point at which our further 
      evolution can be consciously motivated and individual, rather than 
      unconsciously motivated and racial.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the primitive urges are still with us, still integral 
      parts of our mental make-up; and in one way or another they are 
      responsible for a great deal of our emotionally-biased thought processes 
      and for many of our falsely-coloured mental attitudes. They are at the 
      root of many of our inner disturbances and of many of our conflicts with 
      others. In this way, these primitive urges – once the essential factors in 
      our earlier evolution – are now (to some extent) retarding factors. They 
      can become obstacles to the attainment of tranquillity.</P>
      <P>The Buddha-doctrine stresses a number of mental fetters and various 
      inner hindrances which prevent the mind&#39;s proper functioning, and 
      therefore stand in the way of tranquillity. Among the retarding factors 
      are scepticism, the feeling of separate selfhood, and ill-will; these, and 
      others, are spoken of as the paralysing defilements of the mind.</P>
      <P>Let’s consider these obstacles or retarding factors one at a time, 
      beginning with scepticism. From the Buddhist standpoint, scepticism is a 
      state of mental rigidity, and this condition is no better than the 
      opposite one of gullibility. The middle way between the extremes of 
      scepticism and gullibility is a state of mental flexibility, a state of 
      readiness to examine new or strange ideas and to evaluate them without 
      pre-judging them. </P>
      <P>Scepticism or rigidity of mind is an obstacle to tranquillity because 
      it is a refusal to examine and evaluate new ideas without emotional 
      pre-judgment. The dominating emotion in many cases may be a feeling of 
      superiority, or there may be some kind of fear or an element of resentment 
      towards the source of the new ideas; but, except where the intellect is 
      incapable of grasping the new ideas, the rigidity is due to the domination 
      of emotion of some kind or other.</P>
      <P>The conception and conceit of selfhood is another obstacle to 
      tranquillity. According to the Buddha-doctrine the self is an illusion. It 
      has been said:</P>
      <P>The self is a label with nothing attached to it.</P>
      <P>You may agree with the theoretical considerations of this &quot;doctrine of 
      egolessness&quot;, as it is called, or you may not; this is unimportant at this 
      stage. The important thing is your own inner attitude, your own feelings 
      about it. As you feel for the sufferings of others (and for their 
      enjoyments too), so to that extent you have broken down this obstacle, the 
      illusion of selfhood.</P>
      <P>As further progress takes place, the focus is slowly and gradually 
      removed from self-centred interests and transferred to the welfare of life 
      as a whole; and, as the steel grip of self-centredness loosens, so an 
      inner tranquillity begins to take the place of anxiety, resentment, and 
      self-assertion.</P>
      <P>This inner tranquillity may not yet show itself outwardly in the form 
      of completely calm and unruffled behaviour: it is felt at first as a still 
      centre, even though there is yet a great deal of turmoil around it, and to 
      establish this still centre is the first stage in the attainment of 
      tranquillity. It can be expressed in this way:</P>
      <P>Enlightenment is the one still point in the centre of the turmoil, just 
      as the axle is the one still point in the centre of the moving wheel.</P>
      <P>Now another obstacle to tranquillity is ill-will, and this includes all 
      grades of ill-will, from the mildest and almost unnoticeable resentment up 
      to the most raging fury. While you probably think of it as ill-will 
      directed towards the people you dislike, you must recognise that ill-will 
      towards your problems and your circumstances can be just as great an 
      obstacle to tranquillity as is ill-will towards people.</P>
      <P>It is essential, then, to approach all your problems with an attitude 
      of goodwill, and to break down all resentment towards them. This applies 
      to the bills you have to pay and the unpleasant chores you have to do, 
      just as much as to the people who have harmed or hindered you in some way, 
      and equally to the impersonal things that have caused you delays and 
      worries.</P>
      <P>A mental attitude of non-resistance towards the difficult things in 
      your life will help in this respect; but this does not mean that you must 
      cease to resist them physically if you feel they are wrong. A mental 
      attitude of non-resistance does not mean a cessation of effort towards 
      improvement; what it does mean is breaking down of anxiety, resentment, 
      and self-assertion, which are the primary causes of mental tension.</P>
      <P>As a mental attitude, non-resistance must be applied to anything and 
      everything that comes into your life – to the people you meet, to the jobs 
      you must do, and to the problems you have to solve. If you resist your 
      daily work, if you find it too boring, too unskilled for your talents, too 
      much like drudgery, then this resistance will bring about greater fatigue; 
      and so it will form a vicious circle.</P>
      <P>Life presents you with many opportunities to learn, but these 
      opportunities are often disguised as drudgery. It has been said:</P>
      <I>
      <P>Drudgery is as necessary to call out the treasures of the mind as 
      harrowing and planting those of the earth. (Margaret Fuller)</P>
      </I>
      <P>If then, in doing something irksome, you can realise that it may enable 
      you to call out the treasures of your mind, then the attitude of 
      non-resistance will follow. If, in dealing with someone you dislike, you 
      can use the occasion to develop goodwill, you will thereby take a step 
      towards tranquillity. And if you are in a difficult situation, or even a 
      painful one, and you are determined to learn from it everything it has to 
      teach you, then you will have learned the secret of the great attainment. 
      This secret of the great attainment is to love whatever you hate.</P>
      <P>So, with greater flexibility of mind instead of rigid scepticism, with 
      the understanding of the illusionary nature of the self, and with the 
      growing ability to love whatever you hate, then you have made a good 
      start. You have begun – in theory at least – to break down some of the 
      main obstacles to tranquillity.</P>
      <P>There are other obstacles, of course. There is conceit, which is just 
      an over-valuation of the separate self – an over-valuation of a delusion, 
      according to the Buddha doctrine. There are envy and stinginess, which 
      again spring largely from the self-delusion; and there is agitation, the 
      churned-up state that comes from anxiety, resentment, and self-assertion.</P>
      <P>Now you can deal with all these obstacles to tranquillity, in the 
      Buddhist technique, by mindfulness and self-discipline combined. 
      Mindfulness in this connection means dispassionate self-observation; it 
      means an honest recognition of the retarding mental factors in whatever 
      guise they appear. Self-discipline involves a gentle yet persistent effort 
      to keep them in hand without harmfully repressing them.</P>
      <P>All this reduces itself to a matter of forming new habits and 
      thought-patterns and breaking old ones.</P>
      <P>The task may become easier and more specific if you take one of your 
      own mental factors at a time and subject it to observation for a period, 
      to the exclusion of other factors.</P>
      <P>For example, it is possible that in the course of your daily life 
      various occasions arise which cause you to become agitated or flustered; 
      minor critical situations arise from time to time. If you train yourself 
      not to be easily agitated – to refuse to panic – then your judgments will 
      be more accurate, your decisions more wise, and your life more harmonious.</P>
      <P>To begin, you must at first form the habit of observing yourself 
      closely to discover when and under what conditions you tend to become 
      agitated. You may be serving behind the counter in a shop during a rush 
      period, with an impatient customer making things difficult; you may be 
      driving a car when the engine stalls at a busy intersection; or you may be 
      looking after some troublesome children. In such circumstances, you tend 
      to become more agitated than you realise.</P>
      <P>You need first of all to become aware of this fact, and with this 
      increased awareness a gradual improvement will come about. This natural 
      improvement can then be assisted, as necessary, by a definite effort of 
      self-discipline.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>The attainment of tranquility, then, is not a matter of finding ideal 
      circumstances or of finding freedom from outer disturbances: it is a 
      matter of discovering the inner mental obstacles to tranquillity (one by 
      one) by dispassionate self-observation, and of removing them (one by one) 
      by a gentle yet persistent effort of self-discipline.</P>
      <B>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">Practical Work</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">THE DISPASSIONATE OBSERVATION OF EMOTION</P>
      </B>
      <P>To become a little flustered during a minor crisis seems – and 
      generally is – only a small failing. So also are slight anger against 
      frustrating circumstances, mild anxiety, and a limited degree of conceit. 
      These are all normal and small failings, even if they are not ideal states 
      of mind.</P>
      <P>If any one of these minor mental factors is allowed to become 
      excessive, it becomes pathological. It is one of the main tasks of 
      mindfulness to bring about a precise and clear-cut awareness of emotional 
      states when they are mild and ill-defined, for at this stage they are far 
      easier to control than when they reach a pathological degree.</P>
      <P>At any stage, not only in their extreme forms, these mental factors are 
      obstacles to the attainment of tranquillity. At any stage they need to be 
      kept under close observation.</P>
      <P>For a period of at least a month, then, observe yourself closely with a 
      view to discovering the emotional factors within yourself that prevent you 
      from attaining tranquillity. This self-observation will help you to 
      understand and thus to control those emotional factors that work against 
      tranquillity.</P>
      <P>Several times during the month you should decide that, for a period of 
      two or three days, or even a single day, you will make a mental note of 
      all the emotions you experience during that period. You can regard these 
      as experimental periods in which you try to hold a mental attitude of pure 
      observation, at least as far as conditions allow.</P>
      <P>As an aid to dispassionate observation, it is helpful to identify and 
      name each emotional state as it arises, if possible, or if this is not 
      possible, to do so in retrospect. It will help to keep it in check if you 
      can pause, observe yourself critically, and say to yourself &quot;I am becoming 
      envious,&quot; or &quot;I am becoming agitated.&quot; The idea is to register the fact 
      clearly in your mind without becoming further disturbed by it and without 
      either feeling guilty about it or excusing yourself for it. The simple 
      process of clearly naming the mental condition will sometimes help you to 
      deal with it.</P>
      <P>This may not necessarily be so, of course, in the case of strong 
      emotions, but its greatest value is in the recognition of mild ones whose 
      significance may be much greater than at first appears.</P>
      <P>In your home life, in your work, and in your social contacts with other 
      people, you must of necessity react by word and action of some kind, but 
      during the experimental period you must try to make these reactions as 
      free as possible from emotional biases. </P>
      <P>But more important than the outer reactions of word and deed are the 
      inner reactions of thought. You must observe your currents of thought to 
      see how much misplaced, inappropriate, and excess emotion they contain, 
      how much they are biased by prejudices, and how much inner conflict they 
      express.</P>
      <P>This self-observation, growing more and more dispassionate, will bring 
      you greater harmony within your own mind. You will tend to react to things 
      with less misplaced or excess emotion, and thus with less inner conflict 
      and less misunderstanding. The greater harmony in your relationships with 
      other people will in itself repay the effort of mindfulness involved.</P>
      <P>Assuming you are working on the self-contract method of 
      self-discipline, you can impose on yourself a small penalty whenever you 
      become lax in this form of self-observation.</P>
