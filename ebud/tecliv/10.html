      </B>
      <P>ON looking at life as a whole, you will agree that it is a mixture of 
      pain and pleasure, effort and rest, dissatisfaction and contentment. You 
      would like this mixture to he proportioned differently, of course; you 
      would like to have less pain and more pleasure; you would like a little 
      less effort with a little more rest, and then you would be less 
      dissatisfied and more contented.</P>
      <P>But you must realise that without some pain and some sorrow in life 
      there would be no incentive for effort; and without effort you cannot make 
      progress. Without dissatisfaction your life would become too static to be 
      of any ultimate value. It has been said:</P>
      <I>
      <P>The bread of bitterness is the food on which men grow to their fullest 
      stature.</P>
      </I>
      <P>From the Buddhist viewpoint, liberation from suffering can be achieved 
      only by transcending personal existence and by attaining to a state beyond 
      words and beyond thought, a state which is sometimes called the 
      Unconditioned or the Transcendental. This &quot;existence-beyond-existence&quot; is 
      a state in which all traces of craving, aversion and ignorance have been 
      destroyed, and in this state there is said to be no suffering. The 
      attainment of this &quot;existence-beyond-existence&quot; is the ultimate goal of 
      Buddhism.</P>
      <P>However, while the separate self remains – while personal consciousness 
      with its separation from life as a whole still exists – some degree of 
      suffering is inescapable. Nevertheless it is possible to lessen its impact 
      by the cultivation of detachment, or, stated differently, by the 
      progressive reduction of attachment to the pleasures of life.</P>
      <P>There is a Buddhist practice which consists of becoming aware, as fully 
      as possible, of the feelings of pleasure and displeasure as and when they 
      arise and at the same time observing them as dispassionately as possible. 
      The aim, of course, of this increased attention is to evaluate more 
      clearly the pleasures and displeasures of life and thus to avoid becoming 
      overwhelmed by them.</P>
      <P>Without this dispassionate or detached mental attitude you sometimes 
      tend to become too immersed in your pleasures, and, at other times, to 
      swing to the opposite extreme and become immersed in your sorrows and 
      pains. There are times, perhaps, when you wallow in your emotions and let 
      yourself be completely governed by them.</P>
      <P>The objective, then, is to learn to stand off from your experiences 
      both of happiness and of sorrow and to observe them dispassionately, 
      without being swamped by them. You need to learn to do this in retrospect 
      with regard to experiences of the past, and to try to do so also with 
      experiences of the present just as they come to you; while in the same way 
      you must learn to anticipate the experiences of the future without undue 
      emotion. As you learn the futility of grasping at things of the present 
      and yearning for things of the past and future, so your mind develops 
      greater flexibility.</P>
      <P>Whatever you depend on for your happiness is an object of attachment, a 
      prop on which to lean; and whenever you lean on any prop at all you lay 
      yourself open to sorrow. At any time there is the possibility that some of 
      your props will be knocked away, for life has an unpleasant tendency to 
      knock your props from under you.</P>
      <P>Your youth disappears in the passage of time; you lose a loved one, 
      perhaps, and the old familiar externals in your own individual world give 
      place to new and strange externals. If your mind is not flexible enough to 
      keep pace with the losses and changes as your props are knocked away, you 
      suffer all the more in consequence.</P>
      <P>Generally, however, on looking back, you may find that you manage to 
      keep pace with the changes and the impermanence of life by exchanging one 
      prop for another, so that in the long run you are little better off; you 
      are still dependent on props of some kind.</P>
      <P>And this applies not only to the outer world of sense-objects but also 
      to the inner world of mind-objects, for attachment to memories of the past 
      and anticipations of the future is just as strong a bondage as is 
      attachment to external things of the present.</P>
      <P>There is a Buddhist statement that goes like this:</P>
      <I>
      <P>From attachment comes grief, from attachment comes fear. He who is free 
      from attachment knows neither grief nor fear.</P>
      </I>
      <P>The stronger is your attachment to something you love, the greater is 
      the happiness you experience when circumstances allow you to enjoy it; 
      but, when it is wrenched away from you, your suffering then is just as 
      great as your happiness previously was.</P>
      <P>If you strongly desire something, this thing becomes an 
      attachment-object. You naturally cling to your attachment-objects, you 
      grasp at them and clutch them tightly. When they are away from you, you 
      long for their return. But all that this clinging, grasping, clutching, or 
      longing does for you, in the long run, is to make the sorrow of loss so 
      much greater.</P>
      <P>It is axiomatic in the Buddhist philosophy that at some time or other 
      you must part with everything that is nearest and dearest to you, and that 
      the stronger is your attachment to these near and dear things, the harder 
      will be the wrench when it comes.</P>
      <P>Once the vice-like grip of attachment is established, it is impossible 
      to break it by philosophising, and the strength of attachment depends on 
      the strength of the craving for that which has been lost. Once the craving 
      for the lost thing has gained a foothold it cannot be dislodged by 
      theorising, and this craving can arise only when you allow yourself to be 
      dominated by your feelings of pleasure and displeasure.</P>
      <P>This is the Buddhist view of attachment and its related factors, a view 
      that can be expressed in a simplified form in this way:</P>
      <P><I>Attachment depends on craving; craving depends on the feelings of 
      pleasure and displeasure; and the feelings of pleasure and displeasure 
      depend on the contact of the senses with the external world.</I></P>
      <P>In ordinary life, it is impossible to solve the problem of attachment 
      by cutting off the contact of the senses with the outer world of 
      sense-objects, and it is equally impossible to prevent pleasure and 
      displeasure from arising once this contact is made. This means that if 
      this chain of &quot;dependent arising&quot; (or, less accurately, this chain of 
      cause and effect) is to be broken at all, it must be broken at the link of 
      pleasure or displeasure. The chain of sorrow must be attacked at the phase 
      of liking-and-disliking, desire-and-aversion, attraction-and-repulsion.</P>
      <P>Now all this, at first glance, seems to mean that you must give up 
      everything that gives happiness or pleasure; but this is not the idea at 
      all. What it really means is that you must learn to be independent of your 
      feelings of pleasure and displeasure, as far as possible, and not to be 
      controlled by them. It means that your intellect must control your life, 
      not your emotional complexes or, your irrational likes and dislikes; and 
      thus it is essential (in the Buddhist technique at least) to become as 
      fully aware as possible of all that goes on in your own mind.</P>
      <P>In this technique, an ever-increasing mindfulness of all feelings of 
      pleasure and displeasure as they arise is of great importance. Thus, in 
      the first place, it is essential to be fully aware of the true value of 
      your feelings of pleasure and of their real significance in order to 
      prevent them from causing emotional biases and prejudices.</P>
      <P>The same applies, of course, to your feelings of displeasure, for they 
      also tend to give rise to emotional biases and prejudices if not well 
      controlled. Aversion gives rise to craving and attachment just as does 
      desire, and you are just as much in bondage to the things you hate as you 
      are to the things you desire.</P>
      <P>If you can reach even a partial degree of detachment, if you can even 
      partially lessen your grasp on the things that hold you in bondage, you 
      are then more free to enjoy them without attachment, and for the same 
      reason your sense of loss will be less when they have gone.</P>
      <P>The fully-alert mind can make an objective assessment of each 
      experience as and when it arises; but for many of us this dispassionate 
      self-observation cannot be made at the time and can be made only in 
      retrospect. But whether you make it at the actual time of the experience 
      or afterwards, the main thing is to prevent your pleasures and your 
      displeasures from controlling you.</P>
      <P>Once a strong emotional charge of a pleasant or unpleasant nature 
      becomes attached to an idea, this emotional charge can easily get out of 
      hand and cause all sorts of inner disturbance and outer conflict. Only by 
      increased mindfulness can you free the mind from the false emotional 
      associations and the consequent disturbance and conflict.</P>
      <P>The cultivation of detachment, then, aims at freedom from emotional 
      domination and from the domination of pleasure and displeasure; it aims at 
      freedom from attachment to external things, from memories and 
      anticipations, from desires and aversions, and even from the desires for 
      detachment itself.</P>
      <B>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">Practical work</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">THE CULTIVATION OF EMOTIONAL DETACHMENT</P>
      </B>
      <P>In the human mind there are many blind spots – blind spots which are 
      sometimes the causes and sometimes the effects of prejudices and emotional 
      biases – and because of these the mind is unable to see itself as it 
      really is. Such blind spots prevent us from realising the extent and 
      ramifications of our false attachments, and any device that we can use to 
      reduce them is an aid in the work of inwardly-directed mindfulness. </P>
      <P>The following questionnaire is meant to be such a device and to aid you 
      in the process of discovering and evaluating your own attachments. </P>
      <P>In answering the questions, you may find that the first answer that 
      comes to mind may be the correct answer or it may not. Therefore it is 
      desirable that you go through the full questionnaire about six times 
      during the month; allow it to start trains of thoughts rather than trying 
      to arrive immediately at clear-cut answers.</P>
      <P>A question that is difficult to answer will as a rule be of much 
      greater value to you than one which is easy to answer. The real value of 
      the answer lies, not in itself, but in the amount of self-observation or 
      mindfulness employed in arriving at it.</P>
      <P>There is no need to try to make your answers consistent in any respect. 
      You must realise that normally you have ambivalent attitudes towards many 
      of the important things in life; for example, you could both love and hate 
      the same person at different times, or you could feel attracted to one 
      aspect of something and repelled by another aspect of it.</P>
      <P>With ambivalent attitudes of this kind, it may be that one of the two 
      contrary emotions has been repressed, but from some 
      consciously-inaccessible region of your mind it continues to influence 
      your mental life.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to isolate your objects of attachment from your sense 
      of possessiveness, your valuations, your self-assertiveness, or various 
      other aspects of your mental life. The questions which follow, therefore, 
      are intended, not to pinpoint specific objects of attachment, but to help 
      you to develop a greater awareness of your own mental contents; and in the 
      process specific objects of attachment – and perhaps of misplaced 
      attachment – may emerge.</P>
      <P>Here, then, are the questions:</P>
      <P>1. Do I agree with the following statement? &quot;From attachment comes 
      grief, from attachment comes fear. He who is free from attachment knows 
      neither grief nor fear.&quot;</P>
      <P>2. Am I unduly attached to material possessions, as a whole, or in 
      other words do I have a possessive attitude to them?</P>
      <P>3. Am I possessive with regard to other people-my family, my children, 
      my friends, for example? </P>
      <P>4. Do I desire power of some kind, not for what I could accomplish with 
      such power, but purely for the sake of having power?</P>
      <P>5. Do I have any attachment that interferes with my mental and 
      emotional tranquillity?</P>
      <P>6. Am I selfish or self-centred in any particular sphere of life?</P>
      <P>7. Am I more dominated by emotional bias and prejudice than is the 
      average person?</P>
      <P>8. Do I like to dominate my friends, children, and other people?</P>
      <P>9. Do I resent being dominated by others?</P>
      <P>10. Am I too attached-rigidly or inflexibly so-to my beliefs and 
      opinions in any sphere of thought?</P>
      <P>11. Am I held back in any way by an excessive or misplaced attachment 
      to anything or anyone?</P>
      <P>12. Do I like people to admire certain of my possessions to which I am 
      attached?</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>Any form of dispassionate observation-whether directed inwardly towards 
      the mind itself or outwardly towards the world of events – is an aid in 
      the cultivation of detachment. As a specific exercise in mindfulness, you 
      can endeavour to apply the principle of dispassionate observation to your 
      relationships with other people.</P>
      <P>Sometimes you misunderstand something that another person says or does, 
      perhaps because you happen to be upset or annoyed about something quite 
      different. In such a case you give to the other person&#39;s meaning a 
      completely false colouring. Or perhaps you misinterpret a question, and 
      give an answer which more properly applies to an altogether different 
      question. </P>
      <P>In this practice, then, and in your daily contacts with other people, 
      you set out to pay unbiased, dispassionate observation to the other 
      person&#39;s meaning, uncoloured by your own emotions or prejudices. You will 
      often find that the true meaning is quite different from your own first 
      interpretation of it.</P>
      <P>You may find it necessary to train yourself not to interrupt others 
      without good reason. Few people are good listeners, and you may be one of 
      the few; if you are not – if you hear only half of what another is saying, 
      and if you tend to interrupt with irrelevant side issues – then you need 
      to teach yourself to listen, as far as possible, without allowing your own 
      emotional associations to interfere.</P>
      <P>Good listening demands effort, for good listening means listening to 
      all of what is said and interpreting it as correctly as possible. In the 
      process of good listening you will learn to pinpoint any 
      emotionally-charged words and ideas that arise, words and ideas that bring 
      into play your own biases and prejudices. Thus, by pinpointing such words 
      and ideas, they will no longer be able to work from the subconscious 
      levels of your mind, and thus you will gain greater knowledge and control 
      of your own mental processes.</P>
      <P>The practice of dispassionate listening, then, consists largely of 
      careful and attentive listening, coupled with an endeavour to keep free 
      from emotional reactions.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>Assuming that you are employing the self-contract method of 
      self-discipline, look back every few days so see if you have used the 
      questionnaire consistently and in a sufficiently penetrating manner, and 
      if you have carried out the practice of dispassionate listening to a 
      sufficient extent. If you feel that you have not done so, deprive yourself 
      of some small pleasure.</P>
