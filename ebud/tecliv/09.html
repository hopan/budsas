      </B>
      <P>IN most communities the thoughts of the average person are governed by 
      the thoughts of the majority of other average people, and this holds good 
      from early childhood right through to old age. Only to a limited extent 
      does the average person think for himself.</P>
      <P>During early childhood you learnt largely by exercising your senses; 
      you looked at things, you listened to sounds, you smelt and tasted things, 
      you touched and handled them, and you experienced physical pain and 
      physical pleasure from then. Thus by direct first-hand sensory contact you 
      became acquainted with the fundamental elements of experience.</P>
      <P>When by exploring the world with your senses you found something that 
      yielded pleasure or satisfaction, you regarded that thing as good, and 
      similarly when you encountered something that gave rise to pain you 
      regarded it as evil. Good and evil at this stage were identical with 
      pleasure and pain.</P>
      <P>But your elders soon complicated matters for you by scolding you for 
      enjoying your pleasures and by forcing you to do things which, although 
      unpleasant, were called good. As you learnt the language of your elders 
      your concrete concepts of good and evil became further confused with the 
      abstract concepts of right and wrong, while the rightness and wrongness of 
      things were measured by the approval and disapproval of others.</P>
      <P>From the beginning, then, your thoughts were governed largely by the 
      thoughts of those about you, conveyed to you by their approval and 
      disapproval.</P>
      <P>There were other external influences to shape your thoughts as you grew 
      older, but to a large extent the effects of these later influences – 
      although less definite – followed the patterns laid down in earliest 
      childhood.</P>
      <P>You tended to approve of those things that were approved by the people 
      you liked and admired, and to disapprove of the things associated with 
      people you disliked.</P>
      <P>In your present phase of life, whatever it happens to be, you still 
      largely follow the childhood patterns. Sometimes, perhaps, it may be that 
      you believe a thing because it pleases you to believe it, and not because 
      your reason supports it. Or you believe it because everybody around you 
      believes it, or because, years ago, your parents taught you to believe it.</P>
      <P>For the childlike mind, authority forms the only basis for belief; but 
      even if your mind is more mature it probably still retains old beliefs and 
      builds new ones on inadequate foundations, mainly because you are never 
      called upon to apply the critical function of your reasoning powers to the 
      matters concerned. You take them for granted.</P>
      <P>There is a very powerful factor in modern life that continually 
      conditions your thinking, or perhaps your lack of thinking. The patterns 
      and channels of your thoughts are conditioned to a large extent by the 
      continual blare of advertising This uses both blatant and subtle means to 
      keep at the highest pitch both your desires for sensory enjoyment and your 
      sense of self-importance.</P>
      <P>You can realise that it is of vital importance to develop a technique 
      of thought control. In this connection, Buddhist psychology offers a 
      method called bare attention.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most important forms of mindfulness. In bare 
      attention, the attention is stripped bare of all emotional biases, 
      prejudices, self-references, and associated thoughts. This emotion-free 
      attention is essential for seeing things as they really are, because 
      emotional biases, prejudices, and uncontrolled associations bring about 
      falsifications or distortions of perceptions.</P>
      <P>Bare attention thus means the bare uncluttered awareness of a 
      perception, without any reaction to it in the form of deed, speech, or 
      mental comment.</P>
      <P>If you were to examine your normal everyday perceptions, you might find 
      that they are often muddled, cluttered up with mental material that 
      belongs elsewhere, and obscure or distorted.</P>
      <P>Sometimes these falsifications cause misunderstandings, conflict, and 
      discord. You can see that, if you apply the principle of bare attention to 
      your everyday thinking, you can reduce the misunderstandings that 
      sometimes occur, together with their consequent conflict and discord.</P>
      <P>It is not until you become aware of your own mental functioning that 
      you realize just how widespread and deep-seated your strong emotional 
      biases really are. They are, in fact, so widespread and so deep-seated 
      that without special self-training it is impossible to perceive a sense 
      object, to form a clear idea of a situation, or to recollect an event 
      without some distortion or other.</P>
      <P>In the jungle of emotionally-distorted ideas that constitutes a large 
      part of the average mind there are danger zones, and when these are 
      stimulated they give rise to irrational thinking, bad temper, and 
      misjudgments. Any of these can cause quarrels and heartaches when they 
      intrude into your associations with other people.</P>
      <P>And it is important to recognise the fact that you cannot as a rule see 
      the danger zones in your mind, because the tangled masses of emotional 
      undergrowth make them inaccessible to consciousness. Until the light of 
      full consciousness can be brought to bear on them, to identify them, and 
      to clear them away, they will remain as danger zones.</P>
      <P>Much of this undergrowth was planted during childhood and before, and 
      if you really want to arrive at the detailed awareness of your own mind in 
      its fullest sense you must learn to break the false emotional connections 
      formed in your early life. It’s probable that many buried complexes exist 
      in your mind and are at the root of your irrational behaviour, of your 
      unaccountable likes and dislikes, and of your fears and resentments.</P>
      <P>Now it is not my intention to discuss methods of self-analysis or 
      systems of reaching buried complexes. This is a specialist’s territory and 
      any endeavours to enter the danger zones of the mind by a frontal attack 
      could raise more problems than it solves. </P>
      <P>The practice of bare attention, at least in the sense in which we are 
      considering it here, does not make a direct or frontal attack on such 
      problems; it works by establishing a foothold in the observations and 
      perceptions of the present and cleansing these of their biases and 
      prejudices; and then, as these current experiences are purified, the 
      cleaning-up process extends backwards, so to speak, into the past. In 
      other words, as your current experiences are progressively stripped bare 
      of their retardant emotional clutter, the increased awareness extends to 
      the memory-patterns of earlier emotional experiences.</P>
      <P>Whereas a direct frontal attack in approaching a touchy complex is 
      practically certain to fail, the gradual and subtle influence of bare 
      attention seeps through into lower layers of the mind – layers normally 
      inaccessible to consciousness – and cleanses them at their own level.</P>
      <P>However, it must be realised that this is not the work of weeks, or 
      months, or years; it must be considered as a process of decades at least; 
      in fact, it is a lifetime task.</P>
      <P>There is another point of interest in applying bare attention to that 
      jungle of emotional undergrowth called the human mind. As you employ the 
      technique of bare attention to your current experiences – as you endeavour 
      to keep your present observations and perceptions clear of bias, 
      prejudice, and irrelevant emotion – so your mind itself changes. It is 
      like cleaning a mirror which has accumulated spots and splashes; as you 
      proceed with the cleaning process, so you find the reflection becoming 
      truer and clearer. In the same way, as you gradually clean up the 
      perceptive faculties of your mind, so you enable it to see into itself 
      with greater clarity and so to reach to greater depths.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>This matter of bare attention forms an extremely important factor in 
      the Noble Eightfold Path, which is the core of Buddhism. To make this 
      point clear, let’s run through the eight steps.</P>
      <P>Right understanding is the first step. In one sense, this is 
      intellectual understanding of the Buddha-doctrine; in another sense it is 
      the understanding of the true nature of existence; while in yet another 
      sense it becomes a direct insight into the ultimate reality beyond all 
      things.</P>
      <P>The second step, right thought, is one of the specifically 
      psychological aspects of the Path, since it involves the control of mental 
      processes. Next in order come right speech, right action, and right 
      livelihood, which three together summarise the moral aspects of Buddhism.</P>
      <P>Then comes the sixth step, right effort, which being the training of 
      the will, is an essential part of Buddhist psychology. The seventh step, 
      right mindfulness, is also psychological, since it comprises the process 
      of perfecting the normal faculty of attention; while the last of the eight 
      steps, right concentration, takes us beyond the realm of normal psychology 
      into the cultivation of supernormal faculties of the mind.</P>
      <P>Now it is the second step of the Eightfold Path, the step called right 
      thought, that we’re primarily concerned with at present. Right thought is 
      usually described as thought which is free from uncontrolled sensory 
      desires, from ill-will, and from cruelty. </P>
      <P>To a large extent, mental processes involve the use of words, not only 
      for expressing thoughts but also for formulating them; and therefore the 
      control of these mental processes can be assisted by the use of the 
      verbalizing function of the mind.</P>
      <P>Before we deal with verbalized thought, however, it will be of interest 
      to consider what Buddhist psychology has to say about the nature of 
      thought in a broad sense, and later on we can discuss the type of thought 
      which uses words as its instruments.</P>
      <P>The Buddha-doctrine describes thought (in the sense of the general 
      process of cognition) as a conscious process, as a process whereby various 
      stimuli affect consciousness.</P>
      <P>Thought, of course, must always be conscious. There can be no such 
      thing as unconscious thought; and, although we may speak of subconscious 
      mental processes, these processes cannot properly be called thought.</P>
      <P>Just as thought must be conscious, so any kind of consciousness must 
      have a stimulus or object. This stimulus may come from outside by way of 
      one of the five physical senses (vision, hearing, smell, taste, and 
      body-sensibility), or it may come from within the mind itself in the form 
      of an idea or a mental image.</P>
      <P>Thus, if there be no stimulus (no sound, no odour, no recollection, nor 
      any other sense-object or mind-object), then there can be no 
      consciousness. </P>
      <P>Under such conditions, the state of mind that prevails is, in Buddhist 
      psychology, called the mental subcurrent; it is that form of mental energy 
      which gives to the body its life, and without this mental energy the body 
      could not live.</P>
      <P>It can be visualized as an undercurrent of mental life from which full 
      consciousness arises. In English writings on Buddhism it is often called 
      the subconscious mind: but to avoid confusion with Western concepts it is 
      better to use the term mental subcurrent.</P>
      <P>The mental subcurrent may be illustrated by a stream of water flowing 
      placidly and evenly; and, when this flow of water is disturbed, waves 
      arise on the surface. Similarly, when the subcurrent is disturbed by 
      stimuli (either external sense-objects or internal mind-objects) then 
      consciousness arises, as waves arise on the surface of the water.</P>
      <P>The mental subcurrent is the essential foundation of individual life 
      and without the mental subcurrent individual physical life, cannot exist. 
      In it are stored the resultant impressions of all previous experiences; 
      and these sometimes enter consciousness in the form of memories.</P>
      <P>The subcurrent possesses no volition of its own, since volition belongs 
      only to consciousness; but the subconscious mental processes that go on 
      within it are directed by habits which have been formed by conscious 
      will-activity in the past.</P>
      <P>During ordinary waking life, consciousness seems to be completely 
      continuous, but the Buddha-doctrine teaches that this is not as it seems, 
      since ordinary waking life consists of conscious phases rapidly 
      alternating with subconscious phases. </P>
      <P>If we were to look at an electric light being switched on and off many 
      times each second, it would appear to be a completely continuous light, 
      whereas there would actually be a rapid alternation of light and darkness. 
      In the same way, what appears to be continuous consciousness is really a 
      rapid alternation of conscious and subconscious states.</P>
      <P>Each mind-state lasts for an inconceivably small fraction of a second 
      and then passes away, to be followed immediately by the next mind-state. 
      In passing away, each mind-state transmits its energy to the following 
      state, which is thus in sonic degree similar to its predecessor. But this 
      new mind-state is not necessarily similar in all respects to that which 
      preceded it, for new external stimuli may have arisen.</P>
      <P>Thus any mind-state consists of the energy of its predecessor, plus 
      sometimes some degree of modification.</P>
      <P>In waking life, consciousness arises from the mental subcurrent and 
      sinks back to the subconscious condition millions of times a second, and 
      the rapid succession of these alternating states gives the illusion of 
      continuous consciousness. The unit of time used in describing the 
      processes of cognition is called a thought-moment; millions of 
      thought-moments go to make up a second.</P>
      <P>When the mind is in a subconscious state and a strong stimulus occurs, 
      full consciousness may arise, and the process of its arising will occupy a 
      period of seventeen thought moments.</P>
      <P>The following description of the process describes these 
      thought-moments one by one:</P>
      <P>Moment l : The mental subcurrent is evenly flowing below the level of 
      consciousness and the sudden strong stimulus occurs.</P>
      <P>Moment 2: The mental subcurrent is irritated of disturbed.</P>
      <P>Moment 3: The mind turns towards the stimulus or object.</P>
      <P>(This stage is called advertance, but it must not be interpreted as 
      attention since as yet there is no mind-consciousness).</P>
      <P>Moment 4: Consciousness of the sense-object now commences, but this is 
      sensation and nothing more, for it occurs as yet only in the physical 
      sense-organ; it has not as yet been received by mind-consciousness. </P>
      <P>Moment 5: The stimulation is now conveyed via the nerve-fibres to the 
      central nervous system and is received into mind-consciousness. This 
      function, called reception, is more or less under the control of the will, 
      and unless it takes place no further perception of the object can occur. 
      In the case of a weak stimulus, it may be possible volitionally to cut it 
      off; but in the case of a strong stimulus it is not normally possible to 
      keep it out of mind-consciousness. </P>
      <P>Moment 6: In the next phase, the function called investigation takes 
      place. Now investigation as ordinarily understood is a process spread over 
      a period of time, so we are not to suppose that in one thought-moment the 
      whole process of investigation of the nature of the sense-object takes 
      place. What is meant is that in any conscious period of this kind, the 
      mental energy seeks to connect up the new sense-object with the existing 
      impressions left by earlier sense-stimulations. In each succeeding phase 
      of cognition this momentary process is repeated.</P>
      <P>Moment 7: Following on the previous thought-moment’s activity (the 
      investigation phase) some degree of connection with the impressions of 
      earlier similar sense-stimulation is effected, and by virtue of this 
      connection the mind is able to begin to classify the particular 
      sense-object. Here again, the process is repeated in each cognitive 
      process until the classification is complete.</P>
      <P>Moments 8 to 14: During the next seven thought moments, the mind 
      determines an attitude of liking or dislike towards the object, an 
      attitude of either good-will or ill-will. This phase in the conscious 
      period is called impulsion; it is mentally the most active part of the 
      process, and to an extent it is under volitional control. During these 
      seven impulsionmoments, reaction-forces are generated within the mental 
      structure, and each separate thought-moment brings into being its own 
      particular kind of reaction force.</P>
      <P>Moments 15 and 16: During a period of two thought-moments, the process 
      is finally impressed or registered on the mind, or in other words it is 
      passed into the memory-store.</P>
      <P>Moment 17: In the final thought-moment, full consciousness ceases for 
      this period, after which the whole process of cognition may be repeated 
      over and over again while the stimulus lasts.</P>
      <P>The above description applies to a strong sensory stimulus, but if the 
      stimulus is very weak there is no more than a slight disturbance of the 
      mental subcurrent.</P>
      <P>When the stimulus is not a sense-object but a mind object in the form 
      of an idea or a recollection, the process is slightly different; but the 
      effects of the impulsion moments are in general the same. Conscious and 
      unconscious periods alternate with so great a frequency that there is an 
      illusion of continuous consciousness.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>Now as the word thought is used in the second step of the Noble 
      Eightfold Path – the step called right thought – its meaning is to a large 
      extent restricted to what is called the verbalizing function of the mind. 
      We carry out a great part of our thinking by means of words, for words are 
      symbols for ideas, while ideas in their turn are the mental 
      representatives for things, ideas, processes, and abstractions.</P>
      <P>Whereas an idea of a complicated thing is necessarily complicated, it 
      can generally be condensed into a simple word; thus while thinking with 
      ideas (in the absence of words) would be clumsy and laborious, thinking 
      with words is much quicker and easier.</P>
      <P>Thus thought-control largely means the control of the verbalizing 
      function of the mind, of the &quot;inner speech&quot; whereby we silently use words 
      to consider a problem, to reason about it, to reach a decision, and to 
      plan out a line of action.</P>
      <P>We can see, then, that we use words not only to express our thoughts 
      but also to formulate our thoughts. While it can’t be said that all our 
      thinking takes the form of silent speech, or thinking in verbalized form, 
      we must realize that a large part of our thinking does take this form.</P>
      <P>Obviously, then, if the words we choose to formulate our thoughts do 
      not accurately represent the ideas they are intended to represent, our 
      thinking will be loose and inaccurate, so that any tendency towards 
      self-deception we possess will be accentuated.</P>
      <P>Few of us are free from some tendency, however slight, awards 
      self-deception. While we are generally aware of the extreme forms of 
      sensory desire, ill-will, and cruelty as they appear in our own make up, 
      we are not always aware of these adverse qualities when they appear in 
      their mild and unobtrusive forms.</P>
      <P>Thus when we allow one of these adverse qualities to operate in our 
      mind in a small way, we may tend to gloss it over, to excuse it, and to 
      make no effort to deal with it. We feel it is too unimportant to worry 
      about it.</P>
      <P>Yet the small everyday operations of an adverse mind-factor in its 
      minor manifestations strengthen it little by little, and thus lay the 
      foundations for its major appearance at some later time when, perhaps, a 
      crisis arises.</P>
      <P>In cultivating the second step of the Noble Eightfold Path, then, it is 
      essential to watch the small everyday outcroppings of sensory desire, 
      ill-will, and cruelty, and recognise them in their many mild and 
      unobtrusive forms. It is almost useless to wait until they appear in their 
      extreme forms, for then they are too powerful to be handled effectively.</P>
      <P>As long as we allow our thinking to remain vague and fuzzy, we are 
      unlikely to recognise the lesser forms of adverse qualities. If, on the 
      other band, we verbalize our thoughts in the form of precise words, we are 
      likely to discover these qualities and can then more easily deal with 
      them.</P>
      <P>This brings us to the use of the verbal formula as an instrument in 
      thought control. A carefully-worded or well selected phrase, silently 
      repeated, can act as a kind of mechanical aid to direct the thoughts along 
      a particular channel, or alternatively to divert the thoughts from 
      unsuitable or unwanted mind-objects.</P>
      <P>Thus if we are suffering from an acute sense of loss – as for example 
      after a bereavement – it may be helpful to use a phrase like this:</P>
      <P>It is in the very nature of things that at some time or other we must 
      part from all that is dear to us; and by yearning for a return of that 
      which is past we merely prolong our sorrow.</P>
      <P>Of course, the main problem here is to remember to use the formula at 
      the times when it is most needed, for a t these-times we are generally 
      overwhelmed with our sense of loss; but this is a matter of developing the 
      habit of mindfulness, which in itself is a major part of Buddhist 
      mind-training.</P>
      <P>Ideally, we should not wait until a severe loss occurs to begin to 
      train ourselves in detachment. One aspect of right thought is that it is 
      characterised by mental detachment from objects, people, experiences, 
      memories, and anticipations that give pleasure.</P>
      <P>Since ordinary life largely revolves around such things, we generally 
      become enmeshed in the web of attachment, and to break free from this web 
      is normally beyond us.</P>
      <P>Thus when a severe loss does occur, it becomes very important to use 
      every aid – such as that afforded by the mental repetition of a formula – 
      to make an adjustment to the new circumstances. </P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>Now we must admit that thought free from all sensory desire is a good 
      deal to expect from average people, like ourselves, who must live ordinary 
      lives in equally ordinary environments. Perhaps it will help us to 
      understand the problem if we consider what is meant by sensory desire.</P>
      <P>Briefly, sensory desire is thought loaded up with the desire for 
      enjoyment by the six senses, namely by impressions of visual objects, by 
      sounds, by odours, by tastes, by body-sense impressions, and by mental 
      reflections on any of these.</P>
      <P>Sensory desires include the wish to see a sunset, the lights of a town 
      seen across a valley, a beautifully patterned wall-paper, or a glimpse of 
      a loved one’s face; these are all visual things. Many desires are 
      auditory; the desire to hear a piece of music or even a single chord, the 
      trickling of a mountain brook, or the sound of a loved one’s voice. There 
      are desires to experience pleasant perfumes, tastes, and body-impressions, 
      such as of comfortable warmth, and there is the desire to look back on any 
      of these physical sense-enjoyments or to look forward to them.</P>
      <P>Now freedom from all these forms of sense-desire would seem to be 
      freedom from all ordinary forms of motivation; and up to a point this is 
      true. Ordinary motivation is based on the desire for sensory or mental 
      enjoyment of some kind; and without the prospect of enjoyment many of our 
      activities would come to a stop.</P>
      <P>All this is so, of course; but the Eightfold Path is not the path to 
      ordinary life with its ordinary enjoyments, but to the Transcendental, the 
      realm which lies outside and beyond the relative world that we ordinarily 
      know; and attachment to sensory and mental enjoyment becomes an 
      obstruction to one who is aiming to transcend the relative world.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, for those of us who do not feel yet ready to follow this 
      high aim, some degree of control over the desire for sensory enjoyment is 
      necessary if we are to gain. the fullest value from life. While this 
      limited application of sense-control may not involve a complete 
      renunciation of sense-pleasures, it must bring about some degree of 
      detachment to be of any value; and this detachment, instead of reducing 
      the pleasure of living, increases them by cutting away the grasping 
      tendencies which often tend to vitiate these pleasures.</P>
      <P>Sometimes we are advised to be aware of the present and- not to live in 
      the past. At first glance this appears to be good practical advice; but 
      when we try to put it into practice, how often do we succeed? </P>
      <P>We are told: &quot;Kill in yourself all memory of past experience. Do not 
      look behind you or you are lost.&quot; But if we were to follow this literally 
      – assuming it to be possible – the ordinary processes of thinking would 
      cease.</P>
      <P>We are told also that &quot;the past must not control the future, where each 
      minute is a new birth.&quot; But if we were to follow this to the letter, we’d 
      be unable to add up next week’s grocery bill because we refused to allow 
      our past (during which we learned arithmetic) to influence our future 
      household shopping.</P>
      <P>Does this mean that the advice is useless? No: it means we have 
      misunderstood it. What it really means is that we should accept the past 
      with its losses and mistakes, its sorrows and heartbreaks, its joys and 
      pleasures. We must accept the fact that the joys and pleasures of the past 
      had to come to an end at some time or other – this is inherent in the very 
      nature of this universe – and if we look back on them and yearn for them 
      to return, then all we are doing is to vitiate this present moment.</P>
      <P>If we look hack on a happy event of the past and gain from it the 
      pleasure inherent in a happy recollection or memory, without yearning for 
      its return, memory – as then we are living in the present, for that happy 
      memory as a memory but not as an event – is apart of this very present. As 
      an event, it is part of the past, but as a memory that comes into our 
      consciousness at the present moment, then it is in fact our present 
      experience.</P>
      <P>As a memory, we may enjoy it without vitiating the present; but if we 
      yearn for its return or its repetition we are divorcing ourselves from the 
      present and trying to throw ourselves back into the past, which at this 
      moment is non-existent. </P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>So much for the matter of that type of right thought which is called 
      freedom from sensory desires.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of right thought is freedom from ill-will, or, expressed 
      positively, thought that is characterised by good-will. Sometimes even the 
      most even-tempered of us become annoyed with our fellow-men; and although 
      often this annoyance evaporates when the occasion for it has passed, it 
      sometimes leaves a residue of resentment or ill-will which needs special 
      handling.</P>
      <P>It is easy to see that no progress is possible to a mind that is 
      poisoned by ill-will or hate, or by any of its associated mind-factors 
      such as revengefulness, annoyance, or anger.</P>
      <P>Again, right thought is thought that is free from cruelty. While 
      cruelty often springs from hate or anger, much cruelty also arises through 
      an indifference to the suffering of others or to thoughtlessness. Right 
      thought, then, involves not only the absence of active and positive hate, 
      but also the absence of its more negative and passive indifference to the 
      sufferings of others.</P>
      <P>The second step of the Eightfold Path – right thought – must be based 
      on the first step, right understanding; for it is necessary to recognise 
      right thought as right thought, and wrong thought as wrong thought. 
      Without the attentive mind developed by right mindfulness, right thought 
      is not possible in the fullest sense. Thus you can see that the second 
      step of the Noble Eightfold Path must be carried along parallel with 
      various other steps, and each one is inseparable from the others.</P>
      <P>In particular, the practice of right thought must be carried along 
      parallel with that of bare attention, for without the practice of bare 
      attention – an aspect of right mindfulness – all thought processes tend to 
      become cluttered with emotion.</P>
      <B>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">Practical Work</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">BARE ATTENTION</P>
      </B>
      <P>In ideal circumstances, if you wished to establish the mental patterns 
      of bare attention in a complete form, you would put aside all 
      responsibilities and other interests for a period of some weeks and devote 
      yourself to a strict course of self-training. Under such conditions, you 
      would avoid all but the barest essentials in the way of physical work, and 
      you would put aside writing and reading, and even talking as far as 
      possible.</P>
      <P>But these ideal circumstances are beyond the reach of most of us. 
      Unless you are fortunately situated, it is probable that you can’t find 
      sufficient time and freedom from responsibilities to carry out the strict 
      practices of mindfulness to the exclusion of other activities for a long 
      period. How, then, are you to establish the practice of bare attention?</P>
      <P>What you can’t do in its entirety, then, you must do in part. Since you 
      are unable to place yourself in ideal conditions, you must use your daily 
      activities as the basis for your inner development; and it may be, in 
      fact, that these daily activities are really more ideal for the purpose 
      than a life of seclusion would be.</P>
      <P>In order to establish the mental patterns of bare attention you must 
      slow down some activities. As a starting point you can select one definite 
      activity so that, without detriment to anything else, you can carry out 
      this one activity more slowly than usual. If you have to catch the 8:17 
      train every morning, you obviously cannot slow down in that particular 
      activity. If you are a housewife with children to look after you can 
      hardly slow down the chores involved in getting them off to school. Again, 
      if you are a bus conductor you cannot use the peak travelling periods to 
      inaugurate the practice of bare attention.</P>
      <P>However, there must be some daily activity that you can use as a basis 
      for the establishment of the practice. There must be some short periods 
      when the pressing urgency of duty subsides for a time.</P>
      <P>Maybe the office worker can relax in a cafe at lunch time, or the 
      housewife can pause for a few minutes once the children have been bundled 
      off to school, while the bus conductor has a few minutes at the depot 
      during which he can smoke a cigarette.</P>
      <P>In each of these cases there is an opportunity to make a start on the 
      development of bare attention, even in a small way. The office worker can 
      usually slow down during his lunch time and mindfully observe the weight 
      of the knife and fork in his hands, he can chew more slowly and observe 
      the taste of food, and he can observe the colour and shape of his cup and 
      saucer. And, more important, he can at this time observe his own general 
      muscular state, feeling whether his muscles are taut or relaxed.</P>
      <P>In the same way the housewife, when she pauses, can intentionally slow 
      down the process of making a cup of tea for herself, in order to give her 
      full attention to it. She can then become more conscious of the steam 
      rising from the kettle, of the sequence of her own muscular actions as she 
      makes the tea, lifts the cup to her lips, sips and swallows the tea, and 
      so on. fn this exercise in attentiveness she can become more aware of the 
      details she normally misses. These details are unimportant in themselves; 
      the point is that they can supply an opportunity for an increase in 
      mindfulness.</P>
      <P>Again, when the bus conductor smokes his cigarette during a few 
      minutes’ rest at the depot, he can apply increased attention to the 
      sensation of the cigarette between his lips, to the taste, and to the 
      appearance of the wisp of smoke rising from the glowing tip.</P>
      <P>Obviously these small attempts at bare attention will be of little 
      value if they end where they begin. The value of taking one small frequent 
      or regular occasion for mindfulness and consistently applying bare 
      attention to it lies in the fact that it helps to establish a foothold. 
      Once this foothold exists it is relatively easy to extend the practice to 
      other small things throughout the day. However, to change the simile, it 
      is only the thin end of the wedge, and unless the wedge is driven right 
      home it effects very little.</P>
      <P>Your approach to the practice of bare attention, then, should he to 
      select one small thing that you do with some degree of regularity and 
      which you can do more slowly and mindfully than usual. You should resolve 
      to give this one small activity increased attention for a period; and to 
      do this without looking for results, but purely as an exercise in 
      mindfulness.</P>
      <P>You will find, of course, that to make a vague resolution that when an 
      opportunity occurs you will slow down and apply increased mindfulness will 
      be of little use. You will need to be more specific, and you will need to 
      enforce your resolution by a self-imposed penalty. </P>
      <P>To be specific, therefore, resolve that during a period or at least a 
      month you will take twice as long as usual over some small task, such as 
      the task of taking off your shoes each night before going to bed. Should 
      you neglect or forget to slow down this one action and to give increased 
      mindfulness to it, you can impose some small penalty on yourself the next 
      day.</P>
      <P>Then, later on, you should search for another activity and use it also 
      for the same purpose, slowing it down and giving it increased and 
      sharpened awareness. Once the initial phase is established it will be 
      somewhat easier to give increased attentiveness to other activities 
      without the need for greatly slowing them down.</P>
      <P>While this exercise relates mainly to your physical actions rather than 
      to your mental functioning, you will find that it will help in your 
      general overall plan of self-observation, and in this way will reinforce 
      the effects of other practices.</P>
