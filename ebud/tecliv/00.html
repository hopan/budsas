      <P>THERE is one thing that everybody knows by direct experience, and that 
      is that life is a mixture of enjoyment and suffering, happiness and 
      sorrow, pleasure and pain. The intelligent and the stupid, the good and 
      the evil, the rich and the poor, all know some degree of suffering mixed 
      in with their happiness.</P>
      <P>There are times, it is true, when we feel free from the heavier burdens 
      of suffering. There are times when our affairs are going well, when we are 
      able to cope adequately with our responsibilities, and when we can meet 
      our obligations without trouble. But there are other times, too, when 
      things do not go so well, when we suffer severe losses and meet with 
      persistent frustrations; and at these times we feel the need for some 
      special mental approach to our problems.</P>
      <P>In fact, we need this special approach all of the time, during the good 
      times as well as the bad. We need a special approach to success as well as 
      to failure, to gain as well as to loss, to happiness as well as to sorrow. 
      We need a technique to handle the easy times as well as the difficult 
      periods.</P>
      <P>In brief, we need a technique of living. It can be said in general that 
      any technique is better than none at all. Any well considered approach to 
      the problems of life is better than the unthinking drift of life, but 
      perhaps the most efficient technique is one that involves a considerable 
      understanding of life, an increased mindfulness of the mind’s own aims and 
      processes, and a certain degree of self-discipline to keep the mind on its 
      chosen path.</P>
      <P>In a technique of this kind, then, the three keywords are 
      understanding, mindfulness, and self-discipline.</P>
      <P>Understanding life is a matter of gaining and appreciation – either 
      intellectual or intuitive – of the way living beings act and react. 
      Mindfulness of the mind’s own aims and processes involves a sort of inner 
      alertness, a form of attentiveness directed inwardly. And self-discipline 
      is the sustained effort to act and think along certain chosen lines, an 
      effort which requires the exercise of the will.</P>
      <P>Of these three elements – understanding, mindfulness, and self 
      discipline – it is mindfulness which, in the Buddhist system of 
      self-training, becomes the focal point.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>If you want to take on any system of mental development, either as an 
      aim in itself or as a means of gaining greater value from life, the 
      cultivation of mindfulness in some direction at least must play a major 
      part in it. In other words, any system of mental culture must involve the 
      development of the powers of attention.</P>
      <P>As you know from direct observation, your attention may be directed 
      outwardly towards the external world of objects or inwardly towards the 
      internal world of ideas. While the development of mindfulness may bring 
      about a greater alertness with regard to external happenings, this is not 
      its main aim, at least from the Buddhist viewpoint; its primary purpose is 
      to bring about an increased awareness of what goes on in that ‘current of 
      existence’ that you call your own self. Some forms of mindfulness are 
      intended to make you more aware and to give you an increased understanding 
      of your own mental processes in general; for these mental processes are 
      the factors that determine what your life will yield – or fail to yield – 
      in terms of enduring happiness.</P>
      <P>Now the practice of mindfulness is the focal point of a system of 
      mental discipline, a method of mind-training, that forms the core of 
      various forms of Buddhism. It is not intended to deal with Buddhist 
      doctrine and practice as a whole, as we are more interested in a specific 
      aspect of them; but in order to fit this specific aspect of Buddhism into 
      its general framework it may be pertinent to set out, very briefly, the 
      main points of the system of mental discipline known as the Noble 
      Eightfold Path. Here are the various aspects of this Path:</P>
      <P>1. RIGHT UNDERSTANDING, a knowledge of the true nature of existence;</P>
      <P>2. RIGHT THOUGHT, free from sensuality, ill-will, and cruelty;</P>
      <P>3. RIGHT SPEECH, speech which is free from falsity, gossip, harshness, 
      and idle babble;</P>
      <P>4. RIGHT ACTION, or the avoidance of killing, stealing, and sexual  
      misconduct;</P>
      <P>5. RIGHT LIVELIHOOD, abstaining from a livelihood that brings harm to 
      other beings;</P>
      <P>6. RIGHT EFFORT, or the training of the will;</P>
      <P>7. RIGHT MINDFULNESS, the perfection of the faculty of attention; and
      </P>
      <P>8. RIGHT CONCENTRATION, the cultivation of higher mental states with a 
      view to direct knowledge of the Unconditioned, the ultimate reality beyond 
      the relative universe.</P>
      <B>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      </B>
      <P>The particular phase of this Noble Eightfold Path in which we are 
      interested, as you can see, is the seventh step, right mindfulness; but 
      the first step – right understanding, especially in the sense of 
      self-understanding – and the sixth, right effort or the training of the 
      will, are also of special interest in this context.</P>
      <P>In some lines of mental development the expansion of the field of 
      attention is the aim, while in other forms the field is narrowed and the 
      awareness is thereby intensified.</P>
      <P>The expansion of awareness and the intensification of awareness are 
      opposite but complementary modes of mindfulness, and both involve the 
      development of the normal faculty of attention. It is by training the 
      attention, by directing and controlling it, that awareness can be expanded 
      to cover a broader field, or, on the other hand intensified to confine it 
      to a single idea.</P>
      <P>Of the two, perhaps, the concentration of the attention on to a single 
      point is of greater importance, for all mental development requires a 
      sharpened awareness.</P>
      <P>Compare the fuzzy, dull awareness of the dream state with the sharpened 
      awareness of the normal waking state. In a dream you experience sensations 
      from the outside world but you misinterpret them. Your feet are cold, 
      perhaps, because the rug across the foot of the bed has slipped off; but 
      instead of correctly interpreting the sensation of coldness, you dream 
      that you are walking on a cold street without your shoes. Or a dog barks 
      nearby and you dream you are being pursued by a pack of hungry wolves. 
      These misinterpretations, we are told, are bound up with your various 
      undischarged emotional accumulations and your various complexes, and the 
      external stimuli – the cold feet and the dog’s bark – are used as the 
      means of discharging your emotional accumulations or of giving expression 
      to your complexes, up to a point at least.</P>
      <P>In waking life you are not guilty of such gross misinterpretations as 
      you are during sleep. When the rug falls off and your feet become cold, 
      you reach down and pull the rug back into place. When the dog barks, 
      perhaps it brings to mind some childhood story of a boy being pursued by a 
      pack of wolves; but because you are awake and not dreaming you 
      nevertheless realize that the sound you have just heard is nothing more 
      than a dog’s bark.</P>
      <P>However, while you do not make the gross misinterpretations when in the 
      waking state that you do during, sleep, you are nevertheless guilty of 
      some degree of misinterpretation, greater or less according to the extent 
      to which your thought processes are dominated by your emotions and your 
      psychological complexes.</P>
      <P>While the concentration of mental energy on a single point is necessary 
      in certain circumstances, a diffuse or widespread distribution of 
      attention is of value in other circumstances, and for an all-round mental 
      development it should be possible to bring the mind into either state with 
      equal facility.</P>
      <P>As an example of the restricted scope of awareness, you well know the 
      kind of situation in which you are in the process of writing a letter when 
      the telephone rings in another room. On your way to answer the telephone 
      you put down your pen without giving any special attention to this small 
      act, and afterwards, when you go to take up the pen to continue writing, 
      you have great difficulty in finding it because you are unable to remember 
      where you put it. Unless you make a special effort of mindfulness, the 
      simple task of attending both to the act of putting the pen down and to 
      the act of walking towards the telephone is too much for you, because the 
      scope of your normal awareness is too confined to embrace these two very 
      simple things at the same time. This is an obvious example of the need for 
      an expansion of the scope of consciousness.</P>
      <P>In the ordinary course of workaday life, there is little or no time for 
      the practice of exercises in mental development unless these practices are 
      woven into the general fabric of everyday life. If, however, you find the 
      time occasionally to slow down whatever you are doing – perhaps for only a 
      few minutes, an hour, or a day, according to circumstances – in order to 
      give to it your fullest possible attention, then this deliberately 
      increased awareness will help to establish a general all-round mindfulness 
      during the busier periods of your life.</P>
      <P>Under ideal conditions, you should be able to become fully aware of 
      whatever you are doing all your normal waking life. Of course, this 
      continual alertness is normally beyond you. To become fully aware of 
      everything you do throughout your waking life is much more than you can 
      ordinarily achieve, and the more you try to develop this enlarged 
      awareness the more you realize your inadequacies.</P>
      <P>However, if your efforts along the lines of right mindfulness do 
      nothing other than make you more aware of your own unawareness, they are 
      thereby fulfilling a very important purpose. You come to realize the 
      automatic and mechanical nature of much that you do, and you begin to see 
      that you have hitherto been largely caught up in the unthinking drift of 
      life. Only when you begin to become aware of all this can you start your 
      fight to become free from the unthinking drift.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>In your ordinary life, no doubt, you meet a succession of problems. 
      Maybe you are short of money, or your domestic responsibilities are too 
      heavy for you, or the people in the flat upstairs are noisy.</P>
      <P>A philosophy of some kind would help you to deal with your problems, of 
      course, but only up to a point, for your problems. are mainly practical 
      ones and not philosophical ones. To be of any real use, a philosophy must 
      be developed into a policy and this policy must be organized to become a 
      technique.</P>
      <P>Whatever your philosophy and whatever policy and technique you develop 
      from it, it is safe to say that it must embody not only increased 
      mindfulness, but also some form of self-discipline, to be of any real use. 
      Without self-discipline, no form of mental culture can achieve very much.</P>
      <P>Self-discipline must be used side by side with the development of 
      mindfulness. You must recognize, of course, that self-discipline alone is 
      of limited value, but coupled with the cultivation of awareness it becomes 
      of much greater value as a part of the technique of living.</P>
      <P>Self-discipline is the effort to act and to think along certain 
      pre-determined lines and to avoid acting and thinking along contrary 
      lines.</P>
      <P>There is a sharp distinction between discipline which is self-imposed 
      and discipline which is imposed from outside. You will find that a 
      discipline imposed on you from outside sometimes raises a resistance 
      within you, and you will often tend to resent it. This is so when the 
      discipline is harsh and strict, of course, but it may also be so when it 
      is mild and easy-going. The resentment depends not only on the harshness 
      of the actual discipline to which you must submit, but also on your 
      unwillingness to submit to it.</P>
      <P>Thus if you are forced to submit to a light discipline with which you 
      disagree, you will feel rebellious and indeed you may actually rebel 
      against it, even though, viewed dispassionately, it is not harsh. On the 
      other hand, if you were willingly and knowingly to undertake a very strict 
      discipline – if, for example, you were to enter a religious order or 
      voluntarily to join the army – you would tend to conform to it without 
      resentment. And you would do so because, taking on the discipline 
      willingly and knowingly, you would up to a point transform it from an 
      external discipline to a self-discipline.</P>
      <P>So an external discipline can become either an occasion for resentment 
      and rebellion or else a means of developing your own mental resources, 
      according to your own attitude towards it.</P>
      <P>However, discipline of this kind is not really what we are interested 
      in our present consideration, and we mention it only to bring out the 
      difference between an externally-imposed discipline and the type of 
      discipline which is self-imposed.</P>
      <P>You might take on a self-imposed discipline for any of a number of 
      reasons. You might start your daily work very early and continue until 
      very late in order to make money. You might undertake a strict and 
      unappetizing diet because you want to become slender and more attractive. 
      Or you might take on a rigid routine of training because you want to win a 
      foot-race. In each of these the self-imposed discipline is not an end in 
      itself – it is only a way of achieving an end.</P>
      <P>However, whether it is meant in that way or not, your self-discipline 
      achieves more than it was intended to do; it does more than make you more 
      money, or slim your figure, or win your race, for it builds up in your 
      mental structure qualities which in themselves will increase your capacity 
      for happiness.</P>
      <P>If a discipline is imposed on you by others or by circumstances, this 
      externally-imposed discipline is generally concerned with your outer 
      actions rather than with the mental processes which lead up to them. 
      Self-imposed discipline, on the other hand, may be concerned with your 
      outer actions and their effects, or it may be concerned with the desires 
      and emotions which influence your outer actions: but in either case your 
      inner mental processes and motives are of primary importance, at least in 
      the present context.</P>
      <P>At the same time it must be recognized that you can help to control 
      your desires and emotions by controlling their outer manifestations. For 
      example, you may tend to gaze longingly at something you desire but cannot 
      have, and this tends to strengthen the desire as well as the feeling of 
      frustration; but if you refuse to gaze at it – if you turn your vision 
      away from it, even though you cannot turn your interest away – you are 
      doing something, however little, towards controlling the desire and 
      reducing the sense of frustration.</P>
      <P>Again, you tend to raise your voice when annoyed, and the louder voice 
      is the effect of the feeling of annoyance; but if by an effort of will you 
      keep your voice at its normal level you are doing a certain amount towards 
      the control of the annoyance itself.</P>
      <P>The point of this is that the external manifestations of desires and 
      emotions are integral parts of these desires and emotions, and by 
      inhibiting their outer effects you are helping to weaken their inner 
      causes – provided of course you do so mindfully. While it is true that 
      these things work primarily from the inside outwards, it is true also that 
      to some extent they work from the outside inwards.</P>
      <P>Now let us consider the manner in which you can best apply 
      self-discipline in your daily life. Perhaps the biggest problem in any 
      form of mental culture is not the problem of mastering its principles but 
      that of applying them. One system may be based. on psychological theories, 
      another on philosophical or religious concepts; one may be clear-cut and 
      another vague and indefinite; but in most cases the greater difficulty is 
      found not in understanding the principles involved, but in using the 
      practices in the routine of everyday life.</P>
      <P>If you lead a too-busy life, with responsibilities and duties bearing 
      down on you, you may feel that your endeavours to develop your own mental 
      potentialities are thwarted by all these external pressures. But if you 
      could miraculously be freed from your problems and frustrations you would 
      also be deprived of the very best opportunities for mindfulness, 
      self-discipline, and other forms of mental culture. Your philosophy and 
      policy of life are worth nothing to you if you cannot weave them into the 
      fabric of your daily living. If, however, they are at all exacting and if 
      they demand from you any degree of self-discipline, it is admittedly not 
      easy to do this.</P>
      <P>There is, however, a method whereby you can apply self-discipline in 
      the routine of your everyday life and which involves little if any 
      expenditure of valuable time.</P>
      <P>At this point, however, I must make it clear that this method of 
      self-discipline which I am about to place before you is not a traditional 
      Buddhist method; it is a system which I have worked out and applied to my 
      own life. In my early acquaintance with Buddhist ideals and the principles 
      of a similar kind, I found that it was quite easy to talk about them when 
      life was flowing smoothly, but quite as difficult to apply them – or even 
      to call them to mind – when problems arose. For this reason I searched for 
      some way to turn my philosophy into a policy and this policy into a 
      technique. As a result I evolved what I call the self-contract method of 
      self-discipline.</P>
      <P>In using this method, you take in band some adverse tendency which you 
      wish to correct, some habit you wish to break, or some habit you wish to 
      form, and at the same time you select some small pleasure in which you 
      normally indulge.</P>
      <P>You then make a sort of pact or contract with yourself to the effect 
      that, soon after each occasion on which you fail to control the adverse 
      tendency or habit, you will deny yourself the small pleasure you have 
      selected.</P>
      <P>To take a concrete example, let us assume that you are absent-minded. 
      This, of course, is simply a lack of all-round mindfulness, for although 
      particular forms of mindfulness have certain specialized functions, a 
      general all-round mindfulness is essential for efficient living.</P>
      <P>If you lack this all-round mindfulness, you will find yourself 
      mislaying small things such as your keys, or your reading glasses, or your 
      pencil. You will have to search all your pockets or empty out your handbag 
      to find your railway ticket. You will carefully write someone’s telephone 
      number on a slip of paper and then just as carelessly lose it.</P>
      <P>In this you will have a great deal in common with most other people. 
      Most of us lack all-round mindfulness and therefore most of us would 
      benefit by some self-training in this respect. </P>
      <P>Let us assume, then, that you wish to correct this adverse tendency – 
      this lack of all-round mindfulness. Let us assume also that you smoke 
      cigarettes.</P>
      <P>You therefore make a contract with yourself along these lines: &quot;I 
      resolve that after each time I neglect to be mindful in small matters I 
      will go without a cigarette for at least two hours.&quot;</P>
      <P>Now you will note that this is not merely a resolution to form a new 
      habit; it is something more. If you make a simple resolution without a 
      self-imposed deprivation it is likely to fail, either because you will 
      forget it, or because you will soon decide that absent-mindedness is not 
      such a bad fault after all, or, more likely, because there are too many 
      other matters demanding your attention.</P>
      <P>With a self-imposed deprivation, however, the contract which you make 
      with yourself has a great deal more force than a simple resolution, by 
      virtue of the self-imposed deprivation.</P>
      <P>At first sight, the deprivation may seem to be a form of 
      self-punishment. This is not its function, however, for it must never be 
      severe enough to be felt as a punishment, and if it were to be felt as a 
      punishment it would tend to defeat its own purpose.</P>
      <P>You must regarded the deprivation, not as a penalty, but purely as an 
      aid to mindfulness, a help in breaking free from the unthinking drift of 
      life, and a device to give force to your resolution. As such, it must 
      never be allowed to become irksome or unduly restrictive; it must always 
      remain flexible and readily modified, for once you make it too difficult 
      you will tend to throw it aside and forget all about it.</P>
      <P>All that you require your self-discipline to do is to exert a gentle 
      and fairly continuous pressure in order to give you greater awareness of 
      your habits, desires, and reactions to circumstances.</P>
      <P>To make the self-contract system of discipline work you must begin by 
      forming a new habit. This new habit is that of mentally pausing each time 
      you are about to indulge in the small pleasure – whatever it may be – that 
      you have selected as the basis for your self-contract.</P>
      <P>If it happens to be cigarette-smoking, as your hand is about to open 
      the packet your mind must learn to pause to consider whether or not your 
      self-contract allows you a cigarette at this time.</P>
      <P>If you have agreed with yourself to have your<I> </I>tea or coffee 
      without sugar after an occasion of lack of mindfulness, then you must 
      train yourself to think back each time before reaching for the sugar 
      basin.</P>
      <P>If you like to eat chocolates and have made a pact to deprive yourself 
      of them after being absent- minded, then you must form the habit of 
      pausing to think back before eating them.</P>
      <P>It is, in fact, possible to set off one habit against another and so 
      develop greater control over both, but in any case the deprivation must be 
      regarded mainly as an aid to mindfulness and must therefore remain 
      flexible. In another system of self-discipline, perhaps, you might be 
      required to make a more exacting imposition on yourself; but since the 
      method we are discussing is primarily a means of handling small and 
      apparently insignificant failings without interfering with the busy 
      workaday routine, a rigid and severe system of self-discipline would be 
      inappropriate.</P>
      <P>If you yourself decide to take on this system of mental culture, you 
      would of course have to adapt it to your own requirements and your own 
      mode of life. This would probably apply particularly to the self-imposed 
      deprivations that you would use, and these will depend on your likes and 
      dislikes.</P>
      <P>Perhaps you neither smoke cigarettes, nor have sugar in your tea or 
      coffee, nor eat chocolates. But however austere your life may be there 
      must be some small pleasure that you enjoy – or even some small activity 
      that you carry out – with some degree of regularity; and whatever it is 
      you can use it as a basis for the self-contract method of self-discipline.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>As opposed to self-deprivation, the idea of self-rewarding is sometimes 
      suggested as a basis for a system of discipline. In general, however, 
      self-appointed rewards do not work as well as self-imposed deprivations.</P>
      <P>For example, if you already eat whatever you wane whenever you want it, 
      by rewarding yourself with something you like to eat you will find 
      yourself over-eating. Or if you already smoke whenever you feel like it, 
      by rewarding yourself with an extra cigarette you will find yourself 
      smoking when you do not really want to do so, and so you will be effecting 
      little or nothing. Only if you are already restricting your eating and 
      smoking will a self-rewarding basis in these things be effective.</P>
      <P>However, you may sometimes offset a self-imposed deprivation by a 
      self-appointed reward, so that one cancels the other. Everyone’s life and 
      circumstances vary from everyone else’s, and a system that fails in one 
      person’s case may work in another’s.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>What has been written above forms a general introduction to mindfulness 
      combined with self-discipline as a basis for mental culture; and with this 
      basis, fortified by an increasing understanding of life – of the ways in 
      which living beings act and react – you can lay the foundation for an 
      efficient technique of living.</P>
      <P>In order to help you to build on this foundation, I have compiled a 
      course which is designed to extend over a period of a year. It consists of 
      a series of sections one for each month, on various aspects of mental 
      culture, each with a basic exercise in either mindfulness, 
      self-understanding, or self-discipline. The course is called &quot;A Technique 
      of Living&quot;, and this section forms the introduction to it.</P>
      <P>In the main but not entirely, the practices are based on Buddhist 
      psychological principles. The practices do not however, include exercises 
      which require an appreciable amount of time, nor are the principles 
      involved of a particularly profound nature.</P>
      <P>If you wish to take on what is loosely called meditation and to study 
      Buddhist principles in their deeper forms, a good deal of literature is 
      available on the subject; but such practices and study do not lie within 
      the scope of this course. All of the practices in this course are designed 
      to be woven into the fabric of the workaday routine.</P>
      <P>Although one month is given to each section of the course, you will 
      almost certainly find that a month is too short to establish it as a 
      well-founded habit, and you will probably need to repeat the series during 
      the following year. In fact, there is no reason why you should not 
      continue with the practices in sequence indefinitely on a yearly cycle.</P>
      <P>While each one of the twelve lessons is assigned to one particular 
      month, you may commence the course at any time of the year.</P>
      <P>In taking on any system of self-training, the main problem, as already 
      stated, is not the matter of understanding its principles but that of 
      applying its practices; and even then, once you have trade a start, there 
      is always the possibility that you will discontinue it.</P>
      <P>If you are practising it alone, you may tend to lose interest. If, 
      however, you can form a discussion-group with three or four friends with 
      similar interests, the opportunity to compare notes and to discuss 
      progress and mutual problems will provide a good incentive to continue 
      with the practices. </P>
