      UNDERSTANDING</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>YOU’ll agree, no doubt, that one of the most important things in your 
      mental life is self-understanding. You’ll agree also that most of us have 
      much too little self-understanding and therefore need some sort of 
      training along these lines. And, further, you’ll realize that we all 
      possess a natural and inherent tendency towards self-deceit. </P>
      <P>It seems that each of us in the ordinary way has a &quot;sense of ego&quot;, an 
      unreasoned conviction that he a distinct ego or self, unique and separate 
      from the rest of life. </P>
      <P>In some cases, you find a person whose sense of ego is so strong that 
      he finds it necessary at all costs to feel the rightness of everything he 
      does and the rightness of everything he says, as well as the rightness of 
      everything he possesses. When he can feel this rightness (and too often it 
      is a false rightness), then he feels superior. When he can feel this 
      rightness, he feels inferior and inadequate; and thus he develops various 
      complexes and neurotic trends.</P>
      <P>Because of this false need to feel a false rightness, he must 
      continuously deceives himself in various subtle ways; he must pretend to 
      himself that his motives are better than they are, and he must repress all 
      unwelcome knowledge about himself and about all things that are his.</P>
      <P>All this, just to keep his sense of ego intact.</P>
      <P>How on the other hand there are those who have learnt honestly to 
      recognize their own deficiencies and just as honestly to evaluate their 
      own virtues. These few have made some progress in self-understanding. </P>
      <P>Most of us, however, stand somewhere between these two extremes. While 
      we are not entirely free from self-deceit, we haven attained tocomplete 
      self-understanding; we need, therefore, to develop and to practice some 
      kinds of psychological techniques directed towards an increase in 
      self-knowledge.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties we find is that we treasure some of irrational 
      loves and hatreds; we cling to our emotional biases and try not to lose 
      our complexes. Because we have grown up with them we have become attached 
      to them. In some way or other, these irrational loves and hatreds, biases, 
      and complexes, seems to provide a barrier against something we prefer not 
      to face. This barrier has been called the &quot;dread of enlightenment&quot;.</P>
      <P>This dread of enlightenment is to be found to a greater or less extent 
      in all of us except the few who have attained a considerable degree of 
      self honesty. Thus it is probable that, in common with the majority of 
      people, you tend to resist the process of self-analysis because it demand 
      that you let go of these treasured evils. You resist the process of 
      disentangling the web of attachments.</P>
      <P>Why is it so? Why do you prefer self-deceit to self-knowledge? Not only 
      do these irrationalities give you a barrier against mental factors that 
      you don wish to face, but they also give you a kind of individual 
      character, a sort of distinction that helps to build up your sense of 
      being different from others.</P>
      <P>Another reason is that you want to retain unaltered all those concepts 
      connected with all the things you love. If you subject any of your 
      emotional-laden concepts to the scrutiny of self-analysis you might have 
      to alter it, and in altering it you might need to apply effort. It is much 
      more comfortable to leave things as they are.</P>
      <P>It is much the same with the things you hate or dislike; if you subject 
      your concepts of these things to the strong clear light of 
      self-examination you might have to prove yourself wrong, and to relinquish 
      your hates and dislikes requires a great deal of adjustment. Again, it is 
      more comfortable to leave things as they are.</P>
      <P>Self-analysis may sometimes turn out to be temporarily very painful. 
      What, then, is the point of it all? If you can be just as happy without 
      self-understanding, why bother?</P>
      <P>This, of course, is like saying since you are quite comfortable in your 
      dark cave, why bother to build a house with windows? Once your mind 
      becomes firmly established in its habit, the general trend of awareness 
      becomes less acute and your whole mentality becomes less adaptable. It 
      tends to become more lethargic and to resist change. </P>
      <P>Then you think more emotionally – that is to say, more subjectively and 
      less objectively. You become disturbed with less cause, your judgment is 
      more like to be impaired, you lose your poise more readily, and your 
      self-control crumbles easily. All this, when you prefer self-ignorance to 
      self-understanding.</P>
      <P>What is needed, then, in order to break down self-deceit and to 
      increase self-understanding? Buddhism offers a principle of right 
      mindfulness.</P>
      <P>You’ll find this principle of right mindfulness to be simple enough in 
      its general concept; it’s primarily the development or cultivation of the 
      ordinary normal faculty of attention; it’s applied to many different field 
      of experience, but in particular in needs to be directed inwardly. In this 
      sense, mindfulness can be described mainly as self-observation.</P>
      <P>While simple enough in its general concept as the cultivation of 
      attention, there are so many filed of experience to which you can apply 
      mindfulness that the whole sphere of mindfulness becomes very 
      comprehensive.</P>
      <P>For example, ordinary everyday activities – those of work, family life, 
      and leisure, for example – offer a broad scope for increased 
      self-understanding. With regard to your ordinary actions, the Buddhist 
      system states that you must have a clear comprehension of your own motives 
      and purposes. Without this clear comprehension you may be caught in the 
      unthinking drift.</P>
      <P>You know, of course, your own motives behind many of the things you do. 
      But it may be, with some other thins you do, that you do them merely 
      because other people do them. If so, on self-examination, you’ll find that 
      you do these things largely to gain the approval of the people with whom 
      you associate. The mind feels a need to retain a sense of importance and 
      superiority, and to keep this sense of importance and superiority intact 
      it must employ self-deceit in various forms. And to discover your real 
      motives, you must learn to break through this self-deceit. The clear 
      comprehension of motive, then, once of the major aspects of 
      self-understanding.</P>
      <P>It maybe that you have a clear comprehension of your overall motive in 
      life, of your ultimate purpose, or it may be that you have no sense of 
      purpose and perhaps no ultimate purpose at all; yet some sense of purpose 
      is necessary for progress. Mindfulness in the form of self-observation is 
      a forward step in the process of gaining a purpose of life and of becoming 
      aware of what that purpose is. </P>
      <P>You, in common with mankind as a whole have inherited an emotional 
      jungle, a profuse and tangled growth of greeds and hatreds existing side 
      by side with more noble tendencies. It’s a natural tendency – even though 
      poor psychology – to try to ignore the vicious elements of the mind, and 
      this is how self-deceit arises.</P>
      <P>In its early stages, self-deceit is a refusal to recognise these 
      vicious elements of the mind; but at a more advanced stage it may become a 
      complete inability – much more than a conscious refusal – to recognise 
      them. Sometimes the mind plays tricks on itself in order to keep undamaged 
      its sense of rightness and superiority, and these tricks serve to hide its 
      real motives and desires. </P>
      <P>Sometimes the mind twists and distorts the meanings of experience; it 
      avoids thoughts which offend it and which show it up to itself in an 
      unfavourable light, and it diverts its attention from unwanted thoughts to 
      those which bring out its pleasant aspects.</P>
      <P>Psychology knows these tricks as the mental mechanisms, such as the 
      mechanisms of avoidance, divertance, and fixation.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of self-observation is concerned with the sensations as 
      they’re perceived through the various sense organs as they’re received in 
      the mind with special regard to their pleasure-pain content.</P>
      <P>The point about sensation in relation to its pleasure-pain content is 
      that it’s at this level that attachment has its origin; and attachment is 
      a major cause of unhappiness. All things in the world change; all things 
      arise and pass away; and the more you become attached to anything at all 
      the more you will suffer when you lose it. </P>
      <P>To control attachment, therefore, you must keep watch at the door of 
      sensation. As you become more critically aware of all your experiences at 
      the level of sensation, you learn to prevent the pleasure in one and the 
      pain in another from taking control. That is, instead of being controlled 
      by your pleasures and pains, you learn to pass through them without being 
      swept away by them. It’s when you allow your pleasures and pains at the 
      sensational level to dominate you that you become swept away by your 
      emotions, pleasant and painful; and you’re then fully enmeshed in the web 
      of attachment. And then you’re incapable of objective reasoning and wise 
      decisions. </P>
      <P>You can see, then, that it is desirable to train yourself to keep a 
      critical watch on your experiences at the level of sensation, and just as 
      critically to evaluate the pleasure and pains at this level. You can 
      extend this objective self-observation, then, to the factors that go to 
      make up your mental state. </P>
      <P>According to the Buddha-doctrine, there are three basic mental factors 
      that retard the mind’s progress. One of these is called selfish desire. It 
      exists in various forms such as greed and possessiveness, and it may be 
      either intense on the one hand or mild and unobtrusive on the other. Then 
      there is aversion, which we find also in the guise of anger, hatred, and 
      resentment, and irritability. And the third is called delusion; this also 
      appears in different forms, principally as self-assertion and self-deceit.</P>
      <P>The observation of the mental state is a form of mindfulness whose 
      objective is to shine the full light of consciousness on to theses &quot;roots 
      of evil,&quot; as they are called, and on to all mental factors derived from 
      them and allied with them. These include not only such factors as envy, 
      conceit, and stinginess, but also rigidity of mind, morbid remorse, and 
      restlessness or agitation. </P>
      <P>When, by self-examination, you become aware of these tendencies, you 
      are of course more able to deal with them, and the very realisation that 
      they exist will often act as a controlling factor. </P>
      <P>However, it’s desirable to discover and uncover not only your adverse 
      and retardant mental elements, but also your good qualities, because these 
      need to be nurtured and developed as instruments of progress. </P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>You can see, then, that the principle of mindfulness can be of value to 
      you in various ways; it can help you to avoid the traps laid for you by 
      your own pleasures and pains, and it can help you to evaluate your 
      progress in breaking down the retardant elements in your own mind and in 
      developing the progressant elements. </P>
      <P>While development along such lines is largely a matter of 
      self-observation, and while this is of the utmost importance, it can well 
      be supplemented by observation directed outwardly. That is to say, the 
      observation of other people, together with the understanding that comes 
      from this observation, can be of great value in the task of observing 
      yourself.</P>
      <P>In fact, this works both ways; as you observe your own behaviour and 
      learn to know your own motives better, you see this behaviour reflected in 
      other people, and their motives become more transparent to you. In the 
      same way, as you learn to interpret other people’s behaviour in terms of 
      their motives (sometimes hidden from them), so your own motives become 
      more transparent to yourself. </P>
      <P>So you see that the Buddhist approach to self-understanding is by way 
      of mindfulness, directed primarily internally, and secondarily externally; 
      or in other words by the critical observation of yourself and the 
      penetrating but kindly observation of others. </P>
      <B>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">Practical work</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PRACTICE OF INWARDLY DIRECTED MINDFULNESS</P>
      </B>
      <P>While the extravert directs hi attention mainly to the external world 
      around him, one who is introverted tends to neglect this objective 
      observation of his external world. He is concerned, not so much with what 
      is happening, but with his own emotional reactions as well as his own 
      likes and dislikes of what is happening. </P>
      <P>This form of introversion brings with it subjective thinking, and 
      carried to extremes it becomes pathological. Objective thinking, with its 
      clear evaluation of facts and conditions, becomes impossible when 
      emotional thinking of this kind takes over. </P>
      <P>Now in view of this it may appear strange that Buddhism advises a kind 
      of introversion – an &quot;inward turning&quot; – as part of the technique of right 
      mindfulness; but it is an introversion of a completely different sort. It 
      is a process in which the mind is trained to turn inward on itself, but in 
      an objective manner instead of in the emotional way of the other kind of 
      introversion. </P>
      <P>Your practical work for this month, therefore, consists of forming the 
      habit of objective and unemotional self-observation, taking in your mental 
      processes as a whole. </P>
      <P>In other exercises in this series you take specific retardant 
      tendencies and watch for their appearance. For example, in the Third Month 
      you look for false valuations, in the Sixth Month for undue anxiety, and 
      in the Seven Month for irritability and resentment, while in the Eighth 
      Month you watch for self-assertive tendencies. </P>
      <P>During this moth, however, the work is not so much the observation of 
      specific retardant elements; it is more a matter of watching for that 
      subjective type of thought that is governed by emotional bias and 
      prejudice. It’s a process of replacing one type of introversion by 
      another, of replacing emotional thinking by self-analysis. </P>
      <P>Assuming that you are working on a self-contract basis, at the end of 
      each day, or at some convenient time, you can think back to see whether 
      your introvert tendencies have taken a constructive and analytical form, 
      or whether you have allowed yourself or become emotionally dominated. You 
      can then enforce your self-contract accordingly. </P>
