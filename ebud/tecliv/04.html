      </B>
      <P>FROM certain viewpoints it can be said that the evolution of the mind 
      consists largely in the intensification of awareness on the one hand, and, 
      on the other, the expansion of awareness.</P>
      <P>Let’s consider it in this way. In some situations awareness needs to be 
      intensified but not expanded. If you’re carrying out a difficult repair on 
      a delicate piece of mechanism, such as a watch, your consciousness needs 
      to be concentrated and you need to be aware of only a limited range of 
      sense-impressions, covering only those relevant to the work in hand and 
      excluding all others. That is to say, your awareness must be intensified 
      but not expanded.</P>
      <P>In other circumstances your consciousness needs to take in a very broad 
      field of sense-impressions. If you’re driving a car in heavy traffic, for 
      example, it is very necessary to be conscious of a large range of 
      sense-impressions without generally concentrating on any one of them. You 
      need to be aware of the car ahead, of pedestrians crossing the road, of 
      vehicles coming towards you or darting out of side streets, and of 
      anything and everything that could conceivably constitute a hazard. You 
      may have a chattering passenger or a back-seat driver, or perhaps a 
      restless child in the car.</P>
      <P>All these factors and sometimes others as well demand that you spread 
      your attention over a broad sphere of awareness: your awareness needs to 
      be expanded, not concentrated. It must be intensified in a certain sense 
      as well as expanded, also, in that you must keep at a high pitch of 
      alertness, but it is not intensified with regard to any one object or at 
      any one point to the exclusion of others.</P>
      <P>Now while some things that you do demand some degree of alertness or 
      awareness, either in a concentrated form or in an expanded or diffuse 
      form, there are many other activities that you carry out with little or no 
      awareness. These activities are largely the things that you do by habit.</P>
      <P>In any habit, your awareness tends to sink to a lower level, and 
      because of this you give little or no thought to the purpose of the 
      activity or the exact manner in which you carry it out. It takes on a 
      mechanical character.</P>
      <P>In many cases this mechanical nature of a habitual activity is a good 
      thing, for it leaves you free to devote your awareness to more important 
      activities. It is true also that if too many of your general activities 
      are based on habits, both of thought and of action, your whole life tends 
      to sink into the unthinking drift; but in its sphere habit has a real 
      function. That function is to set the consciousness or awareness free for 
      more important things.</P>
      <P>When you set out to work on the problem of breaking a bad habit – a 
      habit that gives rise to adverse consequences – you must first realise 
      that you probably retain some of your habits, good and bad, largely 
      because they yield some form of satisfaction; and this is true, very 
      often, even if they also cause dissatisfaction of another sort.</P>
      <P>Before you begin to use self-discipline on a habit, then, it may be as 
      well to make some attempt to analyse it in order to find out whether or 
      not it yields any satisfaction, and then to find the nature of the 
      satisfaction it yields, a satisfaction that in some cases may not be 
      apparent on the surface. And if you are successful in doing so, it may 
      then be necessary to find a way to gain the same satisfaction in another 
      way.</P>
      <P>In this matter it is not possible to do much more than generalise. The 
      main point is that you may I find that self-discipline alone is not always 
      adequate in attempting to break a bad habit, and in many cases it is 
      necessary to develop an increasing mindfulness of your own mind – its 
      hidden motives, its half-recognized greeds, hatreds, and delusions – in 
      order to clear a field in which self-discipline can work more effectively.</P>
      <P>In any form of mental culture it is generally better to work for an 
      all-round improvement in the mental operations as a whole than to devote 
      too large an effort to one isolated characteristic. There are exceptions, 
      of course, as for example when that characteristic , is so bad that it 
      justifies concentrated effort.</P>
      <P>In any case, no single trait can rightly be considered on its own; it 
      must be considered in relation to or as a part of the whole mental 
      structure considered as a totality.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>Many of your habitual activities have no special moral significance and 
      play little part in strengthening or weakening the mental functions.</P>
      <P>In driving a car, for example, your habitual response to situations 
      encountered on the road – traffic signals, a dog darting across the 
      street, and so on – have no moral significance. But sometimes, perhaps, 
      you habitually respond to traffic jams by impatience, or you thoughtlessly 
      become angry with pedestrians who foolishly wander into the road without 
      looking. Impatience and anger are habitual responses which need to be 
      dealt with, not only because they are of an adverse or retardant nature in 
      themselves, but also simply because they are habitual.</P>
      <P>There are other examples of unmindful or habitual responses which may 
      need to be handled, largely because they are habitual. There is the habit 
      of complaining about the weather, about the rising cost of living, and 
      about what other people do or fail to do. The point is that when you 
      complain about these things it may be that you do so as an automatic or 
      mechanical release for your adverse emotions. In the present context, it 
      is in the mechanical or habitual nature of these complaints that the fault 
      lies; your complaining may be justified, or it may not, but that’s another 
      matter of secondary importance from the present viewpoint.</P>
      <P>You need some sort of release for these emotions, of course; but 
      habitual and unthinking releases are retardant because they come about 
      without mindfulness, and because your mind is then in a rut.</P>
      <P>The thing to do is to try to develop an awareness, a watchful attitude 
      towards your own responses, and to try, whenever the situation allows it, 
      to act in a manner directly opposite to the old mechanical way. If you 
      want to raise your voice in anger, try to speak quietly. If you feel a 
      tendency to turn away without speaking, try to make a courteous reply. If 
      you feel a desire to strike out verbally or otherwise, try to react in a 
      kindly way.</P>
      <P>In all such situations, the thing to do is to react in a manner 
      directly contrary to the automatic, mechanical, or habitual response. This 
      will help to weaken and break down the adverse mental factors involved and 
      also make the mind keener. </P>
      <P>Building up new habits involves the use of increased awareness or 
      attentiveness. One habit worth cultivating in most cases is the habit of 
      observation, and this forms the subject of the practical work for this 
      period.</P>
      <B>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">Practical work</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">OUTWARD OBSERVATION</P>
      </B>
      <P>Mindfulness has many aspects. That is to say, there are many things 
      towards which you may direct increased attention and many directions in 
      which you may cultivate greater awareness. From the Buddhist viewpoint, 
      the chief value of mindfulness lies in directing the attention inwardly 
      and in cultivating a penetrating awareness of the physical and mental 
      phenomena that together constitute your own &quot;current of existence&quot;, your 
      own self.</P>
      <P>However, from the viewpoint of greater efficiency in the workaday 
      routine, there is generally some scope for increased mindfulness with 
      regard<SUP>,</SUP> to external things as well as for inwardly-directed 
      attention. Some of us need to cultivate a penetrating awareness not only 
      of our own mental state but also of the things around us.</P>
      <P>This applies more to the introvert than to the extraverted type of man 
      or woman. If you are naturally an extravert, you will tend to have an 
      inherent tendency to take notice of things around you and of events going 
      on in the external world; you will have an acute power of observation 
      together with a retentive memory for all such things.</P>
      <P>You may then conclude that you have no need for increased 
      outwardly-directed mindfulness. But this practice, although primarily one 
      in which. the attention is directed to things and happenings outside you, 
      doesn’t stop there; it is meant to be linked up with self-observation as 
      well. In other words, you can use your observational powers to take notice 
      of your own emotional reactions to things and happenings around you as 
      well as of the things and happenings themselves.</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, you tend to be a little too introverted, and if 
      you feel that your powers of external observation need to be developed, 
      you may feel that the cultivation of attention towards external things 
      would help you, not only towards greater efficiency in your workaday life, 
      but towards a better standard of general mindfulness. It is quite possible 
      that an increased attentiveness towards your outer environment would 
      reflect itself in a greater awareness – and thus in a greater control – of 
      your emotional biases and faulty perceptions.</P>
      <P>To undertake this practice, then, you make up your mind to observe the 
      various objects in your immediate environment in greater detail and with 
      greater care. If your powers of observation are already good, your primary 
      objective would be to pay special attention to your own emotional 
      reactions to the things, people, and events that affect you.</P>
      <P>Some things will stimulate your desires and start trains of thought in 
      your mind. Some people will irritate you and arouse resentment and other 
      forms of aversion. And some events will bring out your self-assertive 
      tendencies.</P>
      <P>The three basic mental factors that most retard progress, according to 
      Buddhist psychology, are selfish desire, aversion, and self-assertion; and 
      to deal with them the essential step is to become aware of them.</P>
      <P>If your powers of observation are already well developed, you can give 
      primary attention to your own reactions. If, on the other hand, your 
      powers of observation are not as good as you would like them to be, you 
      should use this practice to improve them. In that case you can make the 
      detailed observation of external matters your primary aim in this 
      practice.</P>
      <P>In any case, it will help considerably if, whenever you can, you slow 
      down your own activities in order to observe or to perceive things more 
      carefully. For most of the time you will probably be unable to do this, 
      but if you set out to slow down when you can, you will establish better 
      habits of observation which will carry over into the more hurried periods.</P>
      <P>At first, perhaps, you would do well to restrict your increased 
      observation to one small sphere; for example, to the people you meet in 
      the course of the day’s work and other activities. At some convenient time 
      recall several people and jot down the colours of their hair and eyes, 
      their facial characteristics, and some details of the clothing they wear. 
      Or if you prefer if, take the houses you pass on your way to the, railway 
      station and set out to observe them in greater detail; then, later on, see 
      if you can describe them in yourself in detail.</P>
      <P>It is worthwhile to take an occasional walk with the specific objective 
      of observing the details which you normally miss.</P>
      <P>The essence of this practice is pure observation; it is not meant to be 
      a form of memory training, although, of course, the memory will benefit. 
      There are systems which employ various tricks of mental association; the 
      rhyming and alliteration of words, acid the building up of vivid and 
      sometimes ludicrous mental images as aids in memory-training; but these 
      tricks – useful and beneficial as they are – should play no part in the 
      present practice. You are, in this connection, interested in pure 
      observation as an aim in itself and not as a memory aid.</P>
      <P>Apply the self-contract method of self-discipline to the practice, and 
      when you find you have neglected to use an opportunity for pure 
      observation impose on yourself some small penalty.</P>
