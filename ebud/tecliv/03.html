      </B>
      <P>IF you think back, you’ll most likely find that many of the values you 
      now place on things have been established, in part at least, by outside 
      influences; by your parents, for example, and by your teachers, and by the 
      books you were given to read in your earlier years. Added to these are the 
      entertainments you enjoyed then and those you enjoy now, the opinions of 
      your friends, and the vicious and continuous blare of advertisements. Thus 
      very little of your thinking is really your own.</P>
      <P>As a result of all this, you are saddled with many false valuations, 
      valuations which are not your own because you haven’t arrived at them by a 
      process of independent thinking. They may be good valuations in some sense 
      or other or they may not, but they have been imposed on you from outside 
      and have not been developed within you by your own thought.</P>
      <P>To examine your own valuations and, where desirable, to break free from 
      them – assuming, of course, that there’s a need to do so – you must exert 
      a sustained effort of mindfulness.</P>
      <P>The first work of mindfulness in this connection is to make you aware 
      of your false valuations, in order to help you to realise what is of real 
      value and what is useless mental baggage. As the realisation of false 
      valuations takes hold, new valuations of things tend to take their place 
      as a natural process.</P>
      <P>You will agree that what you most highly value will largely determine 
      what you most ardently strive for, and conversely, what you most ardently 
      strive for is an indication of what you most highly value.</P>
      <P>The infantile mind arrives at its beliefs and opinions by imitating 
      others, or else by the impact of authority (and often of spurious 
      authority), but it is only the most mature mind that evaluates things by 
      the process of independent thinking.</P>
      <P>In the same way, while the infantile mind formulates its code of values 
      by superficial and immediate considerations, the mature mind takes a 
      long-range view of all things, and penetrates to the ultimate values of 
      things, as distinct from their present effects.</P>
      <P>The process of revaluation is a slow one, for most of the ideals of the 
      world around us run counter to the true values that we seek.</P>
      <P>You will usually find that the opinions of those around you, your 
      obligations to your dependents, and your need to conform – outwardly at 
      least – to other people’s standards, all act as obstacles to the inner 
      process of correcting your scale of values. You find that you are forced 
      to spend time in many ways on things that, left to yourself, you would 
      consider insignificant, while you may unwillingly have to give too little 
      time to things of greater ultimate value.</P>
      <P>Often you may be led into valueless byways because of economic 
      necessity or social pressure; and this fact you must generally accept, 
      because it’s easier to adapt yourself to the world than to adapt the world 
      to yourself. Often, too, there are some futile activities you may take on 
      in the search for excitement or in an endeavour to escape from boredom; 
      and these too, although futile by ultimate standards, are sometimes useful 
      in providing an immediate purpose. But when such activities and interests 
      grow out of proportion they retard your progress simply because of the 
      time and energy they consume.</P>
      <P>From the Buddhist viewpoint many such false valuations arise from 
      craving, from that incessant thirst for personal gratification that 
      springs from ignorance. With craving and ignorance at the root of all 
      personal life, false valuations are inevitable, and to break down these 
      false valuations it is necessary to attack them at the deeper levels of 
      the mind.</P>
      <P>Now the basic ignorance, in the Buddhist sense, is the inability to 
      know the true nature of existence, just as blindness is not merely not 
      seeing but the inability to see. This basic ignorance is ultimately found 
      to be the root of all suffering, and the whole of the Buddha-way is a 
      course of self-training directed towards knowing, knowing in its fullest 
      sense.</P>
      <P>Stating this in another way, the final aim of the Buddha-way is 
      enlightenment, the breaking down of ignorance.</P>
      <P>One of the characteristics of existence as emphasized by the 
      Buddha-doctrine is that of impermanence. It needs no profound thought to 
      show that all things arise, last a longer or shorter time, and finally 
      pass out of existence; and to labour the point may seem unnecessary. But 
      do you really accept this fact of impermanence? Does it affect your 
      valuations of things? Or does it pass over your head? Perhaps you do 
      accept it up to a point, but generally it needs a tremendous emotional 
      jolt to bring it right home.</P>
      <P>To the extent that you accept the fact of impermanence you relinquish 
      some of your futile valuations because you realise their futility.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out that the harder you grasp a handful of water 
      the more of it slips through your fingers, for the best way to hold water 
      in the hand is to hold it loosely. And in the same way, the best way to 
      hold anything in the mind is to hold it loosely. Thus, slowly, you learn 
      to grasp things a little less tightly; but for a long time you continue to 
      grasp, and thus continue to lose.</P>
      <P>If only you could stop grasping, if only you could relinquish the wish 
      that the transient would become permanent, then you could enjoy the 
      pleasure while it lasts and be ready for the next experience when it 
      comes, whether it be one of happiness or of sorrow. By one approach to 
      life you increase its unsatisfactoriness by seeking to prolong your 
      pleasures, while by the other way you leave yourself free to gain the 
      fullest value from every experience.</P>
      <P>Whatever experience life brings to you, whether bitter or sweet, it has 
      some value if you use it skilfully, and you can use it skilfully only if 
      you take it when it comes and accept its imperfections.</P>
      <P>The Buddha-doctrine points out that, within personal life, everything 
      is imperfect, everything is ultimately unsatisfactory. Nowhere within the 
      sphere of personal life is permanent happiness to be found, and only by 
      attaining to the &quot;existence beyond existence&quot;, only by breaking free from 
      the bondage of selfhood, can permanent freedom from suffering be found.</P>
      <P>The more comfortable are your external conditions, the less incentive 
      is there to make an effort towards the final enlightenment. The more 
      comfortably you pad out the walls of the cell of your own personal life, 
      the less you will feel its shocks and jolts. But is this comfortable 
      upholstery of any ultimate value? A padded cell is still a cell, and all 
      the padding can never give you freedom.</P>
      <P>Not only so, but the padding eventually wears thin, and the question 
      arises: which requires less effort – to keep on repadding the cell, or to 
      fight your way to freedom? It has been said:</P>
      <P><I>&quot;The wise man obtains liberation by a hundredth part of the 
      suffering that a foolish man endures in the pursuit of riches.&quot;</I></P>
      <P>The Buddha-doctrine affirms that there is no permanent freedom from 
      suffering and unsatisfactoriness within the bondage of personal life, and 
      that while you are perpetuating the delusion of selfhood you are 
      perpetuating suffering.</P>
      <P>Further, the Buddha-doctrine emphasises that the self is a delusion, 
      and that life is one indivisible whole. Thus everything you gain at the 
      expense of another’s loss is of no ultimate value; the gain is transitory 
      and eventually becomes a burden to carry. If you gain by knowingly 
      depriving another of something, you eventually become the real loser. 
      Every self-centred valuation carries within itself the seeds of sorrow.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, often very difficult to detect the self-centred 
      valuation behind your desires and actions. If you’re influenced by a 
      possessive valuation, in which your aim is to possess more and more 
      property or material objects, the element of self is quite obvious in the 
      motive, but the same possessive valuation might apply just as definitely 
      but much less obviously in your attachment to your own children in the 
      guise of love. In this guise it can cause more unhappiness than when it 
      applies to material things.</P>
      <P>This same possessive valuation is often at the back of love problems, 
      for many love problems are not so much concerned with love in its higher 
      meaning as with possessiveness, at least in part.</P>
      <P>Then there is what we can call the aesthetic valuation. Here, when 
      applying a penetrating self-analysing mindfulness, you might find that 
      your high appreciation of art, music, or one of these finer and less 
      mundane things, is really a means of bolstering up your own self-esteem. 
      No doubt this appreciation of finer things really exists, but its virtues 
      are often vitiated when it is used as a means of asserting your own 
      superiority.</P>
      <P>The same may be said of the intellectual valuation, in which scientific 
      knowledge, an intellectual grasp of a subject, or a love of hair-splitting 
      argument provides a means of self-assertion.</P>
      <P>It may be just the same with a religious valuation or a highly moral 
      valuation – there may be a good deal of self present in the form of 
      self-righteousness.</P>
      <P>Even when there’s a predominance of altruism in the major valuation, it 
      may be possible to find an element of self-interest in the shape of a 
      desire for admiration or thanks, or perhaps a feeling of self-approval.</P>
      <P>In the process of revaluation, then, from the Buddhist viewpoint, you 
      must first adopt a philosophy which emphasises fundamentals rather than 
      superficialities and places ultimate effects higher than immediate ones; 
      then you must recognise and assess your own dominant valuation; and 
      finally you must progressively move the point of interest away from 
      self-interest and towards the interests of life as a whole.</P>
      <P>In order to work from the inside outwards, you must gradually work on 
      your valuations of things in general. This means that you must become 
      increasingly aware of your false values, and, with this increased 
      awareness, you must progressively discard these false values.</P>
      <P>In time, then, you’ll find that many things which previously aroused 
      your anger, resentment, possessiveness, and other adverse emotions will 
      then fail to do so. You will then move your focus of interest away from 
      the things that arouse these retardant emotions, away from the emotions 
      that retard your progress.</P>
      <P>This, of course, will in general be a long and continuous process, and 
      one that involves many readjustments of the values you now place on all 
      sorts of things.</P>
      <B>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">Practical Work</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PRACTICE OF ALL-ROUND MINDFULNESS</P>
      </B>
      <P>We can use various synonyms for mindfulness. We can speak of it as 
      expanded awareness and intensified awareness, as increased attentiveness, 
      and in a certain sense as presence of mind. Lack of mindfulness, 
      similarly, can be referred to as unawareness, inattentiveness, and absence 
      of mind.</P>
      <P>In this last-mentioned expression – absence of mind – we can each 
      recognise lack of mindfulness both in ourselves and in others. Putting 
      aside for the present the more profound aspects of mindfulness, let us 
      consider its application to the more mundane and superficial matters of 
      the workaday life.</P>
      <P>You are familiar with a situation in which you ate writing a letter 
      when the telephone rings in the next room. On your way to answer the 
      telephone you put your pen down somewhere – but where? When you return to 
      your letter-writing you’re unable to remember where you put your pen, and 
      you have to waste time in searching for it. You may feel that this kind of 
      absentmindedness is unimportant except for the exasperation and 
      inconvenience it causes; but the point is that if you have too little 
      mindfulness to observe where you put your pen you must also have too 
      little to make much progress on the path of self-development.</P>
      <P>You may consider that the example just given doesn’t apply to you. 
      However, you would probably find a number of minor situations in your own 
      life in which you could profitably employ greater presence of mind. This 
      increased mindfulness will give you greater efficiency, but this is only 
      its secondary objective; its primary aim is to increase your inner 
      alertness.</P>
      <P>For a period of a month or longer, then, set out to develop a greater 
      degree of all-sound mindfulness in the small routine activities of your 
      life. To do this it will be helpful if you slow down these activities 
      whenever you can and do them more deliberately and attentively; this 
      slowing-down will help to establish more mindful patterns of thought and 
      action which – if continued over a long enough period – will extend or 
      infiltrate into other activities, activities which must of necessity be 
      carried out more hurriedly.</P>
      <P>It is helpful if you increase your awareness of your actions by 
      verbalisation. For example, as you put your pen down, say to yourself &quot;I 
      put my pen on top of the book-case.&quot; Os having bought a bus ticket and put 
      it in your pocket, say, &quot;The ticket is in my left-hand side pocket.&quot; This 
      form of verbalisation assists in the general development of all-round 
      mindfulness. It would be pointless to try to apply it to too many things, 
      but it’s especially useful in relation to the few small activities in 
      which you happen to be absentminded.</P>
      <P>One way in which you can apply the self-contract method to this 
      discipline is to make a mental note of each time you act absent-mindedly. 
      For each occasion of absent-mindedness mentally note one point; and, when 
      you reach a total of, say, ten points, make the next twenty-four hours a 
      discipline day.</P>
      <P>You will need to define just what you yourself mean by a discipline 
      day. It may mean that you’ll smoke only half your usual number of 
      cigarettes, or that you’ll go without sugar in your tea, or that you’ll 
      eat no sweet biscuits during the twenty-four hours.</P>
      <P>The exact nature of the pact you make with yourself is unimportant, so 
      long as you use it to increase your general level of awareness.</P>
