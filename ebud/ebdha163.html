    <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nowadays, there is a proliferation of books on the
    Buddha's Teachings. Studying these books would inevitably result in imbibing some of the
    views and interpretations of the various writers on what the Buddha actually taught, which
    would result in some wrong views. On the other hand, there are some meditation teachers
    who advise their students not to study at all but to only meditate. In effect, what they
    are suggesting is for their students to listen to them only. Avoiding the two extremes, we
    should practise the middle path taught by the Buddha - investigate His discourses <a
    name="(1)" href="#1.">(1)</a> and practise the Noble Eightfold Path, as He advised. The
    importance of the Buddha's discourses for the practice of the Dhamma, whether by lay
    people or by monks, can hardly be exaggerated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha warned of the future when people would refuse
    to listen to His discourses (Suttas). <a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/samyutta/sn20-7.html">Samyutta Nikaya Sutta
    20.7</a> reads: &quot;... in the future, those Suttas uttered by the Tathagata, deep,
    profound in meaning, transcending the world, concerning emptiness (sunyata or illusory
    nature of existence): to these when uttered they will not listen, will not give a ready
    ear, will not want to understand, to recite, to master them. But those discourses made by
    poets, mere poetry, a conglomeration of words and phrases, alien (outside the Buddha's
    Teachings), the utterances of disciples: to these when uttered they will listen, will give
    a ready ear, will want to understand, to recite, to master them. Thus it is, monks, that
    the Suttas uttered by the Tathagata, deep profound in meaning, transcending the world,
    concerning emptiness, will disappear. Therefore, monks, train yourselves, thus: To these
    very Suttas will we listen, give a ready ear, understand, recite and master them.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Instead of the Suttas themselves, many prefer to study
    other books or listen to others' teachings, which may be inconsistent with the
    Sutta-Vinaya. The resulting damage is two-fold:</font> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- The Suttas will disappear, and <br>
      - People will gain wrong understanding of the Dhamma. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong>NIKAYA</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Suttas are contained in the Sutta Pitaka,
    within which are 5 collections or nikayas. Of these, the first 4 are the earliest:</font></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Digha Nikaya consists of 3 books on the
        long discourses (34 Suttas) of the Buddha,</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Majjhima Nikaya comprises 3 books
        containing the Buddha's middle length discourses (152 Suttas),</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Samyutta Nikaya contains about 2000 short
        discourses in 5 books, and</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Anguttara Nikaya contains about 2000 short
        discourses in 5 books.</font></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Khuddaka Nikaya, the fifth, is a minor or smaller
    collection. Although termed &quot;smaller&quot;, it is in fact the largest as more and
    more books have been added to it over the years. It has grown to 15 books in the Thai and
    Sri Lankan versions. In 1956, the Sangha Council in Burma added another 3 books, which are
    not the Buddha's own words. These 3 additions are Questions of King Milinda, Petakopadesa
    and Nettipakarana. This is how the Khuddaka Nikaya grew from a minor collection to become
    a major collection! In the future, say in 500 or 1000 years' time, this would definitely
    create more confusion. Out of the 18 books now, probably only 6 are reliable in that they
    do not contradict the earliest 4 Nikayas. These 6 reliable books are the Dhammapada, Sutta
    Nipata, Theragatha, Therigatha, Itivuttaka and Udana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As Buddhists, we should be familiar with the Suttas and if
    possible obtain our own copies. It is a sad fact that whereas we rarely find Muslims
    without the Quran or Christians without the Bible, yet we find many Buddhists without the
    Nikayas.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong>DHAMMA-VINAYA IS OUR
    TEACHER</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Nowadays, the Buddha's Teachings are referred
    to as Tipitaka or Tripitaka, although they were called &quot;Dhamma-Vinaya&quot; by the
    Buddha in the discourses. In Anguttara Nikaya Sutta 4.180, the Buddha specifically refers
    to Dhamma as the Suttas (discourses). Vinaya is the disciplinary code of monks and nuns.
    In the Nikayas, He also refers to the Suttas as &quot;Saddhamma&quot; which means
    &quot;true Dhamma&quot;.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The true Dhamma is embodied in the discourses
    of the Buddha found in the earliest 4 Nikayas: are generally accepted by all schools of
    Buddhism to be the original Teachings of the Buddha, unlike other books (e.g. Mahayana
    Sutras, Abhidhamma, etc.) which are controversial because they contain some contradictions
    with the 4 Nikayas. The earliest 4 Nikayas are very consistent and contains the flavour of
    liberation from suffering.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Mahaparinibbana Sutta (<a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/digha/dn16.html">Digha Nikaya Sutta 16</a>),
    which details the demise of the Buddha, the Buddha advised the monks to take the
    Dhamma-Vinaya as their Teacher after He passed away. This is a very important statement
    the significance of which has been overlooked by many Buddhists. Because many Buddhists
    have not heard this advice or grasped its significance, they search far and wide for a
    teacher; a teacher they can be proud of and brag about his attainments, etc. Some even
    travel halfway round the world or more in such a search.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">These people create personality cults based
    on the teacher's perceived goodness rather than on the Dhamma-Vinaya itself. In some
    cases, after many years, their master passes away leaving them high and dry. Despite the
    passage of time, the followers have not made much progress and have failed to taste the
    essence of the Dhamma. They would feel empty. As such, we must always remember that the
    Dhamma-Vinaya is our Teacher.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Again, in Digha Nikaya Sutta 26, the Buddha
    said: &quot;Monks, be a lamp unto yourselves, be a refuge unto yourselves, with no other
    refuge. Take the Dhamma as your lamp, take the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other
    refuge.&quot; In other words, we should depend solely on ourselves and on the Buddha's
    words.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's Words Take Precedence</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Let us consider what happened after the
    Buddha's demise. About 100 years after the Buddha passed into Nibbana, conflict arose
    among the monks. The 2nd Sangha Council was consequently called to resolve these
    differences. Ten points were disputed; one of which concerned whether we should always
    follow the advice of our Teacher. In this case, it was decided that if a monk's teachings
    or instructions were in accordance with the Buddha's Teachings (i.e. the earliest 4
    Nikayas and Vinaya), then his words should be followed. However, if his instructions
    contradicted the Buddha's Teachings, they should be ignored.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, the 2nd Sangha Council's ruling on this
    matter was very clear and definite: the Buddha's words take precedence over any monk's
    words. Buddhists should, therefore, become familiar with the Suttas so that they can judge
    whether the instructions of monks or some other teachers are in accordance with the
    Buddha's Teachings. This is why Buddhists should always remember the Dhamma-Vinaya is
    their Teacher.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Refuge only in the Buddha, Dhamma and
    Sangha</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Suttas, the Buddha calls monks
    kalyanamitta (good friend). A monk is a good friend who introduces you to the Buddha's
    Teachings and encourages one in the spiritual path. It is you, however, who have to take
    the 3 refuges (i.e. dependence) in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. But nowadays, people
    have added a 4th refuge (i.e. refuge in a monk or a teacher) which contradicts the
    Buddha's Teachings. This is made very clear in the Suttas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For instance, in Majjhima Nikaya Suttas 84 &amp; 94, there
    was an Arahant who taught very impressively and one person asked to take refuge in him.
    The Arahant replied that refuge could not be taken in him but only in the Buddha, Dhamma
    and Sangha. The person then asked where the Buddha was and said he wanted to go and take
    refuge in Him. The Arahant explained that the Buddha had passed into Nibbana, but even so
    people should still take refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. This shows we always
    acknowledge the Buddha as our Teacher, now embodied in His Teachings (Dhamma-Vinaya). The
    Dhamma is His discourses. The Sangha is the community of monastics who are Noble (Ariya).</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">World-Renowned Teacher can have Wrong Views</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As it is very difficult to distinguish between Ariya and
    non-Ariya, we cannot rely on hearsay alone. Recommendations that such and such is a very
    famous monk who has many high attainments, etc., are very unreliable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the Buddha stated in the Anguttara Nikaya Sutta 5.88,
    it is possible that a world-renowned monk of very senior status, with a huge following of
    lay and monastic disciples, and who is highly learned in the scriptures, can have wrong
    views. The Buddha gave us this warning for the future (i.e. nowadays) as he saw and knew
    that even such monks could not be relied upon. Therefore, only the Suttas and Vinaya can
    be relied on and made our Teacher. Other people can be no more than good friends.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Anguttara Nikaya Sutta 4.180, the Buddha taught the
    great authorities. He advised that when any monk taught that such and such were the
    Teachings of the Buddha, we should, without scorning or welcoming his words compare those
    words with the Suttas and Vinaya. If they are not in accordance with the Suttas and
    Vinaya, we should reject them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again, this illustrates how a strong grasp of the
    Sutta-Vinaya is a reliable guide to what the Buddha actually taught. This knowledge
    enables us to distinguish between a teacher who teaches the true Dhamma and another who
    has wrong views.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Significance of Saddhamma</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Samyutta Nikaya Sutta 16.13, the Buddha warned that the
    true Dhamma would remain unadulterated for 500 years after his passing into Nibbana.
    Thereafter, it will become very difficult to distinguish the true Teachings from the
    false. Why? Because although many of these books contain a lot of Dhamma, some adhamma
    (i.e. what is contrary to the Dhamma) are added here and there. These alterations
    scattered throughout the text are only noticeable if one is sharp and very well versed in
    the earliest 4 Nikayas. Otherwise, one would find it very difficult to distinguish the
    later books from the earlier ones.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Analogy to Gold Trading</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this same Sutta, the Buddha likened this situation to
    gold trading. He said that at that time people still wanted to buy gold because only pure
    gold was being sold in the market. But one day, He said people would make counterfeit gold
    of such quality that it would be indistinguishable from real gold. Under these
    circumstances, people will become wary. They will be reluctant to buy gold because they
    are afraid what they buy may be counterfeit gold. In the same way, the Buddha said in the
    future the Dhamma would become polluted. When that happens, it will be very difficult to
    distinguish the true Dhamma from the false and people will lose interest in the Dhamma.
    Therefore, we must take the trouble to find out what is the true Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Importance of Right View</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why is it very important to ensure that we study only the
    true Dhamma? Well, we know that the spiritual path out of Samsara (round of rebirths) as
    taught by the Buddha is the Ariyan Eightfold Path. <a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/majjhima/mn117.html">Majjhima Nikaya Sutta 117</a>
    states that the Ariyan Eightfold Path always starts with Right View. Without Right View
    one has not entered upon the Path. According to this Sutta, Right View will lead to Right
    Thought, and that will lead to Right Speech. Right Speech will lead to Right Action. Right
    Action, in turn, will lead to Right Livelihood, which leads to Right Effort. Finally,
    Right Effort will be the basis for Right Mindfulness which leads to Right Concentration.
    In this way, based on Right View, the factors of the Ariyan Eightfold Path are cultivated
    and developed one by one.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Samyutta Nikaya Sutta 45.1.8 also states that a person
    with Right View understands the 4 Ariyan Truths. If a person fully understands the 4
    Ariyan Truths he will become an Arahant or a Pacceka Buddha, or even a Sammasambuddha.
    Even a shallow understanding of the 4 Ariyan Truths will enable one to become an Ariya, a
    noble one. Right View is the entry to the Sotapanna (first level Ariya) stage. Anguttara
    Nikaya Suttas 9.29 &amp; 10.63 and <a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/samyutta/sn13-1.html">Samyutta Nikaya Sutta
    13.1</a> confirm that the Sotapanna is endowed with Right View. Clearly, the first thing
    one must aquire in the practice of the Ariyan Eightfold Path is Right View. Right View is
    extremely important.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong>BENEFITS OF LISTENING
    TO DHAMMA</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Tthe Buddha called his disciples savakas
    (listeners or hearers), stressing the importance of listening to the Suttas. The Suttas
    and Vinaya illustrate numerous instances of people becoming Sotapanna, first stage of
    Ariyahood, by listening to the Buddha's discourses (e.g. Majjhima Nikaya Suttas 56 &amp;
    91). Today, we are very fortunate to have the Buddha's discourses, exactly as He spoke
    them, contained in the earliest 4 Nikayas. Reading the Suttas is just like sitting next to
    the Buddha and listening to Him. It is wise not to waste this rare opportunity to
    investigate deeply into the earliest 4 Nikayas.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In Digha Nikaya Sutta 14, the Buddha stated
    that 6 Buddhas<a name="(2)" href="#2.">(2)</a> appeared over 91 world-cycles. That is to
    say, on average, a Buddha appears once in over 10 world-cycles. The Buddha gave a simile
    to illustrate the unimaginably long time span of a world cycle (Samyutta Nikaya 15.1.5).
    Rare, indeed, is a Sammasambuddha. We are blessed to live in the age of the Dhamma! This
    is as good as living during the Buddha's time. In fact, had we lived then, we could not
    have familiarised ourselves with as many Suttas as we can now, when the discourses (about
    5000) are available in book form.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In addition, had we lived then, we might not
    have heard so many discourses unless we were prepared to accompany the Buddha on His
    travels. Remember, He seldom spent much time in one locality - at most, 4 months during
    the rainy season before setting off again, either alone or accompanied by His disciples.
    How many Suttas can we expect to hear in 4 months? Definitely not as many as are available
    to us in the 4 Nikayas now.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Sotapanna Attained by Listening to
    Dhamma</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In <a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/anguttara/an5-202.html">Anguttara Nikaya Sutta
    5.202</a>, the 5 advantages of hearing the Dhamma are enumerated. One of them is the
    attainment of Right View. Since attaining Right View is synonymous with attaining
    Ariyahood, it is clear that hearing Dhamma can make one an Ariyan disciple.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Majjhima Nikaya Sutta 43 states that 2
    conditions are needed for the arising of Right View:</font></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Listening to the Dhamma, and</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Paying proper attention or thorough
        consideration (yoniso manasikara)</font></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This is the second confirmation that the
    Sotapanna stage is attained by listening to the dhamma.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In Samyutta Nikaya Sutta 46.4.8, the Buddha
    gave another confirmation. He said that when one listens to the Dhamma attentively, the 5
    hindrances (nivarana) do not exist and the 7 factors of enlightenment (bojjhanga) are
    complete. These are the conditions to become an Ariya. Therefore, if we listen to the
    Dhamma with proper attention (yoniso manasikara) we can become Ariyas.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Anguttara Nikaya Sutta 10.75 tells about the
    person who is saved by Dhamma: &quot;...for he has listened (savanena), he has done much
    learning (bahusacca), he has penetrated view, he wins partial release.... the ear for
    Dhamma (dhammasota) saves this person.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The word Sotapanna, for instance, consists of
    sota meaning &quot;stream&quot; or &quot;ear&quot; and apanna meaning &quot;entered
    upon&quot;. Normally, Sotapanna is translated as &quot;stream-entry&quot; but it can also
    mean &quot;ear-entry&quot; - in the sense of the ear being penetrated by the Dhamma. A
    close study of the Suttas suggests that the latter translation is possibly more correct
    because the Buddha's disciples were called savakas or listeners (of the Dhamma), and He
    generally referred to them as &quot;Ariyan disciples&quot; in the Suttas (e.g. Anguttara
    Nikaya Suttas 4.58 &amp; <a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/anguttara/an5-41.html">5.41</a>).</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Samyutta Nikaya Sutta 55.6.5 explains the 4
    factors necessary to attain Sotapanna (Sotapattiyangani):</font></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Associating with true persons, i.e. persons
        who understand the true Dhamma,</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Listening to the true Dhamma,</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Paying proper attention or thorough
        consideration (yoniso manasikara), and</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Practising Dhamma in accordance with the
        Dhamma, i.e. living your life according to the Dhamma - for instance, keeping the
        precepts, etc.</font></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When one considers these factors, it is seen
    that attaining Sotapanna is closely linked with listening to the Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Sotapanna &amp; Sakadagamin Do Not
    Need Perfect Concentration</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In Anguttara Nikaya Suttas 3.85 &amp; 9.12,
    the Buddha said that Sotapanna and Sakadagamin (first and second stage Ariyas) have
    Perfect Sila (morality). The third stage Anagamin has Perfect Sila and Perfect Samadhi
    (concentration). The fourth stage Arahant has Perfect Sila, Perfect Samadhi and Perfect
    Panna (wisdom).</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">These 2 Suttas indicate that the attainment
    of the Anagamin and the Arahant stages must have Perfect Concentraion, which is always
    defined as the 4 jhanas or one-pointedness of mind by the Buddha in the Suttas (e.g.
    Samyutta Nikaya Suttas 45.1.8 &amp; 45.3.8). This is why most Anagamins are reborn in the
    4th jhana plane. Some, however, are reborn in the arupa jhana plane (Anguttara Nikaya
    Sutta 4.172), which shows that Anagamins generally have the 4 jhanas or more, as do all
    Arahants. It is interesting to note that the Sotapanna and Sakadagamin do not have Perfect
    Samadhi, i.e. they do not need jhana. The difference between these two attainments is that
    the Sakadagamin has reduced lust, hatred and delusion compared with the Sotapanna.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The reduction of lust, hatred and delusion
    requires a certain amount of Samadhi because these defilements are connected to the 5
    hindrances (attainment of Perfect Samadhi results in the abandonment of the hindrances, <a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/digha/dn2.html">Digha Nikaya Sutta 2</a>). Two
    of these hindrances are sensual desire (similar to lust), and ill will (related to
    hatred). Therefore, if a person's lust, hatred and delusion are reduced, he or she has a
    certain, but not perfect, level of Samadhi. Unlike the Sakadagamin, the Sotapanna has not
    reduced lust, hatred and delusion. This further corroborates the point that the Sotapanna
    stage is attained by listening to the Dhamma with proper attention (yoniso manasikara).</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">And we do find in the Suttas and Vinaya that
    many who came to listen to the Buddha teach for the first time attained Sotapanna stage.
    Also, Samyutta Nikaya Sutta 55.1.2 states that the characteristics of the Sotapanna are
    unshakeable confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, as well as Perfect Sila
    (virtue). There in no mention of meditation.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Sotapanna Stage Relatively Not
    Difficult to Attain</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Anguttara Nikaya Sutta 3.9.85 states that
    despite having Perfect Virtue, Ariyas can still have minor transgressions of the precepts.
    For instance, Samyutta Nikaya Sutta 55.3.4 mentions the demise of a Sakyan named Sarakani,
    after which the Buddha proclaimed that Sarakani had already attained the Sotapanna stage.
    This annoyed a number of the people as Sarakani was known to have failed in his training
    and had taken to drink.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">According to the commentaries, &quot;failed
    in his training&quot; meant that Sarakani had been a monk and disrobed. The people were
    angry because the Buddha called Sarakani a Sotapanna even though the latter had taken to
    drink.<a name="(3)" href="#3.">(3)</a> This seemed to indicate that people knew Sarakani
    was quite a heavy drinker. They found it hard to believe that he was a Sotapanna. This
    incident goes to show that the state of Sotapanna is not as difficult to attain as many
    people think. The only problem is that they do not make enough effort to study the
    discourses, which is our best guide or teacher (as advised by the Buddha) for Right View.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Majjhima Nikaya Sutta 14 tells how a cousin
    of the Buddha, Mahanama, came to see the Buddha and said that he had learnt the Dhamma for
    a long time and knew that greed, hatred and delusion were defilements. Yet, he said that
    sometimes he could not control his mind when it was invaded by these defilements. He asked
    the Buddha whether this was because there were some qualities that he had not cultivated.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha replied that even if an Ariyan
    disciple had seen with wisdom that greed, hatred and delusion were wrong, he might still
    be attracted by sensual pleasures unless he had attained piti (delight) and sukha
    (happiness). Piti and sukha are factors of the Jhana state. Jhana may be translated as a
    &quot;state of mental incandescence&quot; when the mind becomes bright because of
    satipatthana (intense mindfulness/recollection)<a name="(4)" href="#4.">(4)</a> and
    concentration.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Unless we have attained one-pointedness of
    mind and experienced the bliss which is higher than sensual pleasure, we cannot help but
    be attracted to sensual pleasures. The commentaries stated that Mahanama was already a
    Sakadagamin at that time. Thus, this Sutta shows that there can be Ariyans who have not
    attained jhana and who can be influenced by greed, hatred and delusion. Again, this
    proves, in this context, that the Sotapanna stage is not as high as some people think.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">No Liberation without Knowledge of
    Dhamma &amp; Jhana</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha struggled with the utmost effort
    to attain liberation. For 6 years he tried all ways practised by various teachers but
    without success. According to <a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/majjhima/mn36.html">Majjhima Nikaya Sutta 36</a>,
    he sought for an alternative way to liberation and recalled his attainment of jhana when
    he was young under the rose-apple tree. Then following on that memory, came the
    realisation &quot;That is the path to enlightenment.&quot; He thought, &quot;Why am I
    afraid of that pleasure (born of jhana) that has nothing to do with sensual pleasures and
    unwholesome states?&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Thereafter, he attained the 4 jhanas. With
    the concentrated mind which was &quot;purified, bright, unblemished, rid of
    imperfections...,&quot; he directed it to the knowledge of his manifold past lives. Only
    when he attained the psychic powers and recalled his past lives &quot;with their aspects
    and particulars,&quot; that all the Dhamma he learnt from Kassapa Buddha<a name="(5)"
    href="#5.">(5)</a> were recalled. Subsequently, he directed his mind to knowledge of the
    passing away and reappearance of beings. Thereafter, he contemplated on the 4 Ariyan
    Truths and attained liberation.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, His disciples required
    only several days to attain liberation because of the Dhamma knowledge taught to them by
    the Buddha - Venerable Sariputta took 14 days, Maha Kassapa 8 days, and Maha Moggallana
    only 7 days. External sect ascetics without knowledge of the Dhamma, however, do not
    attain liberation even though they attain jhana. But when some of them who had already
    attained jhana heard the Dhamma, they immediately attained liberation.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">However, when we hear the same Dhamma (sutta)
    now, we fail to attain liberation due to not possessing jhana. This shows that both
    knowledge of the Dhamma and attainment of jhana are necessary for the full liberation
    (Arahanthood), in addition to the other factors of the Ariyan Eightfold Path.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Five Occasions to Attain Ariyahood</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Anguttara Nikaya Sutta 5.3.26 is very
    interesting. It describes the 5 occasions when a person attains Ariyahood. These are:</font></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Listening to the Dhamma: it brings joy,
        especially if one has an affinity for the Dhamma. This will naturally calm the mind and
        make it peaceful and tranquil. A tranquil mind easily becomes concentrated. With a
        concentrated mind, insight will arise.</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Teaching the Dhamma: To teach the Dhamma,
        one needs to understand and reflect on the Dhamma. From here, joy also arises which will
        lead successively to tranquility, concentration and insight.</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Repeating Dhamma: Although not common
        nowadays, it was quite common during the Buddha's time when books did not exist. At that
        time, the Dhamma was preserved and passed on to the next generation by people who
        memorised them through regular recitation. If monks are going to pass on the Dhamma, they
        have to be very familiar with the Dhamma. Thus, monks spent a lot of time reciting the
        Dhamma.<br>
        <br>
        In fact, in those days, it was the monks' duty to repeat and recite the Dhamma. This
        constant repetition will make you very familiar with it. The first time you read, listen
        to or recite the Sutta, you will have a certain level of understanding. With greater
        repetition, your understanding becomes deeper and deeper. The similar sequence of joy,
        tranquility, concentration and insight follows.</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Reflecting on the Dhamma: This involves
        contemplating, thinking and pondering on the Dhamma in its various aspects, validity and
        relevance to our daily lives. In this way, insight will arise through the same sequence of
        events.</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">During Meditation: According to the Suttas,
        this involves reflecting on the concentration sign (samadhi nimitta), which is rightly
        grasped and penetrated. The same sequence of joy, tranquility, concentration and insight
        follows.</font></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It is crucial to note that out of these 5
    occasions, only 1 is during meditation and the other 4 are out of meditation: listening,
    teaching, repeating and reflecting on the Saddhamma. One should, by now, see the
    importance of knowing the Saddhamma found in the earliest 4 Nikayas.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In these 5 occasions, the depth of insights
    depends on our perfection of the Noble Eightfold Path. For instance, deep insights are
    possible with Perfect Concentration (jhana) supported by the other 7 factors of the Noble
    Eightfold Path. In this case, high attainments like Anagamin or Arahant can be expected.
    Concentration short of jhanas yields shallow insights. The result may be Sotapanna or
    Sakadagamin. This is clear from Anguttara Nikaya Suttas 3.85 &amp; 9.12 mentioned earlier.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Importance of Listening to Dhamma</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Earlier it was mentioned that one of the 2
    conditions needed for the arising of Right View is listening to the Dhamma. This same
    Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya Sutta 43) states that after Right View is attained, 5 other
    important conditions are needed to support Right View for the final Liberation,
    Arahanthood. They are:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Morality (sila),<br>
      Listening to the Dhamma (dhammasavana),<br>
      Discussion of the Dhamma (dhammasakacca),<br>
      Tranquilisation of mind (samatha), and<br>
      Contemplation (vipassana)<a name="(6)" href="#6.">(6)</a></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Samatha and Vipassana are the 2 necessary
    ingredients of the Buddha's way of meditation. Besides meditation, one has to do the other
    3 things. It is obvious that by meditation alone, one cannot become an Arahant. On top of
    Right View, meditation has to be supported by moral conduct, listening to the Dhamma, and
    discussing the Dhamma. Indeed, a sound knowledge of the Suttas and practice of all the
    Ariyan Eightfold Path are of paramount importance.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The above Sutta, together with the earlier
    mentioned Samyutta Nikaya Sutta 45.1.8 prove the necessity of listening to the Dhamma from
    the first step (i.e. to attain Right View), until the very last step (i.e to attain
    Arahanthood).</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In Samyutta Nikaya Sutta 38.16, it is said
    that even after persons renounce and become monks, it is difficult to find one who
    practises in accordance with the Dhamma. But <a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/digha/dn16.html">Digha Nikaya Sutta 16</a> says
    that if monks were to live the holy life perfectly according to Dhamma-Vinaya, the world
    would not lack for Arahants. Now to practise the Dhamma perfectly, one has to be perfectly
    knowledgeable about the Buddha's instructions in the Suttas.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Nowadays, some laypeople practise meditation
    without studying the Suttas and become presumptuous of their attainments. Their pride
    increases while their attachments do not decrease. If they are practising according to the
    Dhamma their defilements and unwholesome qualities, including pride, should certainly not
    increase.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">As stated in Anguttara Nikaya Sutta 8.2.19,
    &quot;... in this Dhamma-Vinaya there is a gradual training, a gradual practice, a gradual
    progress, with no abruptness (na ayatakena), such as a penetration of knowledge
    (annapativedha).&quot; Adherence to the Buddha's instructions in the Suttas and Vinaya
    (Vinaya is for monks and nuns only) is very important to ensure that we practise the
    correct (and therefore shortest) Path. Once we see that there is a very clear and definite
    Path out of the distressful round of rebirths as shown to us by the Buddha, we will turn
    away from the worldly path and follow the Ariyan Path according to the Buddha's
    discourses.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Anguttara Nikaya Sutta 7.67 gives the parable
    of the carpenter's adze-handle. In this parable the Buddha said that a carpenter, while
    inspecting the handle of his adze, sees thereon the marks of his fingers and thumb.
    However, he knows not how much of the adze-handle was worn away that day, the previous
    day, or at any time. Yet, he knows when the wearing away has reached its limit. Similarly,
    in the practice of the holy life a monk does not know how much defilements have been worn
    away that day, the previous day or at any time, yet knows just when the wearing away
    reaches its limit. This parable implies that a monk cannot accurately say what spiritual
    level he is at. He can only be sure once he has attained Arahanthood.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Samyutta Nikaya Sutta 56.4.9,
    once a person has attained understanding of the 4 Ariyan Truths (i.e. attained Right View)
    he would no more gaze at the face of a monk and think &quot;Surely this Reverend is one
    who knowing knows and seeing sees!&quot; In other words, the perennial search in ignorance
    for a Teacher figure has ended. He realises that the Teacher is here before him - the
    Suttas (and Vinaya for monastics)! But, if he needs a good friend (kalyanamitta) to assist
    him, he would now know how to look for a suitable one.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Monks, train yourselves thus: To these
      very Suttas will we listen, give a ready ear, understand, recite and master them.&quot;</font></p>

    <hr width="25%" noshade align="center">
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong>BRIEF SUGGESTIONS ON
    HOW TO APPROACH THE NIKAYAS</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It is recommended that one starts off by
    investigating the Anguttara Nikaya, followed by the Samyutta Nikaya. These are the 2 most
    important Nikayas because they contain the most Suttas and, therefore, the most
    information. Thereafter, study the Digha Nikaya and, lastly, the Majjhima Nikaya (being
    probably the most difficult to understand). It is not essential to learn Pali and study
    the original Pali texts, although that is the best. Existing translations, although not
    perfect, are good enough for one to get a solid understanding. However, if one can check
    the Pali dictionary for some of the translations which are doubtful, that will be good.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In studying the 4 Nikayas for the first time,
    one would find some Suttas difficult to understand. However, one should plod on and as one
    studies more Suttas, one begins to understand those earlier problematical Suttas. This is
    similar to assembling a jigsaw puzzle. In the beginning one cannot see the overall
    picture. Only when more pieces are assembled can the picture begin to form. The entire 4
    Nikayas should be studied again and again to get a good understanding.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Although other books (e.g. the Commentaries
    and Subcommentaries) may be helpful, they are not recommended (except for scholars)
    because they consume too much time. Besides, they have been found to contain some opinions
    which are not consistent with the earliest 4 Nikayas. Having studied the earliest 4
    Nikayas, it is better to utilise your time for meditation, and put the Dhamma into
    practise etc.. However, some people may not be able to make a thorough study of the
    Nikayas, yet they can acquire the wholesome and potentially liberating habit of regularly
    reading from the Nikayas and reflecting on what they have read.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Remember, not to study is one extreme and
    studying too much is another. Avoiding the extremes, we should (as the Buddha advised)
    investigate the Buddha's words found in the earliest 4 Nikayas, and put forth earnest
    effort according to those words in the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path until its
    perfection.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;For many a long day, monks, have you
      experienced the death of a mother, of son, of daughter, have you experienced the ruin of
      relatives, of wealth, the calamity of disease. Greater is the flood of tears shed by you
      crying and weeping over one and all of these, as you fare on, run on this many a long day,
      united with the disliked, separated from the liked, than are the waters in the four
      oceans.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Why is that? Incalculable is the beginning,
      monks, of this faring on. The earliest point is not revealed of the running on, the faring
      on of beings covered by ignorance, fettered by craving. Thus far enough is there, monks,
      for you to be repelled by all the things of this world, enough to lose all passion for
      them, enough to be liberated therefrom.&quot;</font></p>

      four archers... before they reach the ground.' As to that what do you think, monks? Would
      this be enough for him to be called a swift man, possessed of supreme speed?&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Even, Lord, if he caught and brought
      the arrows shot by only one of the four archers... before they reached the ground, it
      would be enough for him to be called a swift man, possessed of supreme speed. What more to
