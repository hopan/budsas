      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT>n the 
      nineteenth century when Lanka was administered by the British after the 
      leaders of the Central Province handed over the Kingdom under a Treaty 
      called the Udarata Givisuma in 1815. The British Governor agreed solemnly 
      and sincerely and pledged to protect the Buddha and this religion and all 
      its Viharas, devalas and other monuments. </FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The news grandeur of the latest British 
      administration is spread far and wide in England and in several European 
      countries, notably in Germany and France. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Many a historian, archaeologist, scholars 
      particularly the orientalists and Indologists entertained an irresistible 
      desire to visit the &quot;Pearl of the East&quot; and &quot;Drink from its fountain of 
      oriental philosophy&quot;. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Many scholars both Pali and Sanskrit came 
      to Lanka to serve the British in its &quot;Ceylon Civil Service&quot;. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Professor Thomas William Rhys Davids (1843 
      to 1922) came here with his wife Caroline A. F. Rhys Davids (1857 to 
      1942). But the Davids never knew either Pali or Sinhala. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Rhys Davids served in many parts of Lanka 
      in different fields. He was the Private Secretary to the Governor and 
      District Judge of Galla. He first worked for the acting Governor Major 
      General Terrence O'Brien and Governor Sir Herculus Robinson who later 
      became Lord Rosemead. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;His last few years in Sri Lanka were 
      spent in the archaeological service; the excavations of a number of sites 
      in Anuradhapura and the discovery of Sigiriya are among his achievements 
      -&quot; (Ananda W. P. Guruge &quot;From the Living Fountains of Buddhism 
      &quot;Introduction P cxxiii). Commenting on Rhys Davids learning of Pali and 
      Sinhala, Dr. Ananda Guruge states: </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;According to records, Rhys Davids came to 
      know of Pali when he was confronted with texts of Buddhist Vinaya in the 
      course of a trial he conducted as District Judge of Galla. When none in 
      the Court could translate the relevant text, he decided to study Pali, 
      and, again, it was to Ven. Yatramulle Sri Dhammarama that he went for 
      instruction. As he proceeded with his studies, he came in contact with the 
      two best known scholar monks of the time, Ven. Hikkaduve Sri Sumangala 
      Nayaka Thera and Ven. Waskaduve Sri Subhuti Nayaka Thera (Ditto cxxii).
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Earlier, he learnt Sinhala for his 
      examinations from the Venerable Sri Dhammarama. A noteworthy feature in 
      his life was that when he came on his Lanka assignment he was barely 
      twenty-one (21) years. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On his return home in 1872, Rhys Davids 
      continued his studies of Lanka vigorously on Buddhism and Buddhist texts.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With the assistance of Venerable Naranvita 
      (he was referred to as Naranvita Unnanse) he obtained a copy of the 
      Mahavamsa with a manuscript in the India office library in London. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He continued his law studies and was 
      called to the Bar in 1877. With all these new ventures, Rhys Davids 
      primary objective in following the Buddhist way of life and showing this 
      wholesome path to the Western world kept on growing amazingly. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He wrote a Treatise on &quot;the Life and 
      Teachings of the Buddha to the London Society for the Promotion of 
      Christian knowledge. Rhys Davids a son of an English Clergyman, published 
      the book titled &quot;Buddhism&quot;. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Through its quality and popularity, 
      assured for Rhys Davids, a secure place in the pioneering orientalist of 
      the day. Next he translated into English the first volume of Jatakas 
      edited by Fousball in 1880 under the title &quot;Buddhist Birth Stories&quot; and 
      proceeded to translate selected Sittas of the Sutta Pitaka which formed 
      Vol. II of the Sacred Books of the East Series (1881). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The popularity of this work (&quot;Buddhism&quot;) 
      can be gauged from the fact that, by 1914, it has been reprinted in 23 
      editions. It was this book which attracted Mrs. Rhys Davids to Buddhist 
      and Pali Studies.&quot; (Ditto cxxiv). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">By this time, Rhys Davids has translated 
      many a Pali book into English. He became a well-known protagonist of the 
      Teachings of the Buddha in the Western world. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For his translation of the Eastern Wisdom 
      in Western language like English made him a sought after personality. In 
      1881 he was invited to deliver the prestigious Hibbert Lectures. His 
      subject was &quot;The origin and Growth of Religion as illustrated by some 
      points in the History of Indian Buddhism&quot;. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the course of this lectures, Rhys 
      Davids announced his intention to establish the Pali Text Society for the 
      exclusive purpose of translating and publishing Buddhist literature. Rhys 
      Davids said: </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;The sacred books of the early Buddhists 
      have preserved to us the sole record of the only religious movement in the 
      world's history which bears any close resemblance to Christianity; and it 
      is not too much to say that the publication of this unique literature will 
      be no less important for the study of history and specially religious 
      history than the publication of the Vedas has already been&quot;. With his wife 
      Caroline, the Rhys Davids established the Pali Text Society (P.T.S.) of 
      London. The Most Venerable Professor, Dr. Hammalava Saddatissa Mahanayaka 
      Thera of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, while describing Rhys Davids 
      as the &quot;greatest translator of Pali Texts and founder of Pali Text Society 
      (1881) which has edited and translated virtually the whole of the Canon&quot;. 
      (the Tripitaka). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">All the Tripitaka works and their 
      commentaries became novelties to the people. Since, for the first time, 
      the Pali and Sinhala are to be used in Roman character effective and 
      genuine endeavour was made to write Pali and Sinhala in Roman script. 
      Teaming up together with Buddhist scholars, formulated new alphabet for 
      once and for all times for use in the London Pali Text Society 
      Publications. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Accordingly, with the lead given by the 
      London Pali Text Society, the rest of the world accepted its authoritative 
      alphabet for all future publications of Buddhist Texts in Roman character. 
      The following is the Alphabet: Eight vowels; thirty-three consonants, 
      seventeen (17) vowels in combinations, and seventy-five (75) conjunct 
      consonants. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">All these features are found in the Pali 
      Buddhist Texts and have to be written precisely in the manner of 
      pronunciation. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Though, the Pali Text Society is set up in 
      London, the Society never attempted to Anglicise the Buddhist teaching to 
      suit the whims and fancies of some people as it is done particularly in 
      Sri Lanka deliberately and otherwise. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For example, the Buddha's exhortation, 
      &quot;Caratha bhikkhave carikam&quot; is not written with the Anglicised style or 
      &quot;Charatha bhikkhave Charikam&quot; which is totally and absolutely wrong. The 
      CH is used to write a different consonant. Now that the last decade or a 
      little ago, with the dawn of the Internet age, Sri Lanka has become the 
      cynosure of the whole world to obtain the correct and authentic style of 
      presenting Buddha Dhamma to an ever growing audience of readership through 
      the latest media techniques of web sites and home pages. At last, thanks 
      to the &quot;Daily News&quot; the desecration of the wheel symbol - the Dhammacakka 
      by street nameboard painters masquerading as 'artists' were playing pandu 
      with the wheel symbol depicting a cog-wheel. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The &quot;Daily News&quot; Vesak Supplement for 
      Buddhist era 2547 (May 2003) portrayed to the entire world the authentic 
      wheel symbol with authoritative photograph of the symbol form the Bangkok 
      Headquarters of the World Fellowship of Buddhists - the WFB. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The WFB was inaugurated and established in 
      Sri Lanka in 1950 at the Sri Dalada Mandiraya. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The inaugural conference unanimously 
      agreed and accepted the six-colour (The Shadvarna) Buddhist flag presented 
      over a hundred years ago to the Buddhist world, as the international flag 
      of the Buddhists. The same conference accepted that the wheel with eight 
      spokes shall be the symbol of the Buddhists with no single spoke jutting 
      out of the wheel. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Both these sacred objects were printed in 
      the first page of the supplement. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Regrettably, most of the present day 
      products of Sri Lanka Universities, without an exception - write all kinds 
      of nonsense nowadays in the name of Buddha dhamma. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The simple message, such writers give the 
      learned reader is that, he or she has never touched a single Buddhist Text 
      written in English. They read only Sinhala texts and contribute to 
      national dailies hoping to demonstrate their prowess, without realizing 
      that they will cut a sorry figure and ultimately becoming the laughing 
      stock of a world community. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For them, the one and the only way to make 
      a substantial and valuable contribution to Buddhist literature is to be 
      armed with a fine knowledge of the subject is to read all about the 
      subject in English publications of the Archaeological department, the 
      Central Cultural Fund, the Department of the Buddhist Encyclopedia and 
      authors like the Venerable Narada Maha Thera, the Venerable Dr. Hammaluva 
      Saddhatissa Mahanayake Thera, the Venerable Dr. Walpola Rahula Thera, the 
      Venerable Piyadassi Maha Thera, Dr. Ananda W. P. Guruge, Dr. Roland Silva.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Today, Sri Lanka's Ministries of 
      Education, Cultural Affairs, Buddha Sasana, Tertiary Education, Local 
      Government, the Ministry in charge of Provincial Councils have a bounden 
      historical duty to perform in formulating one single way of presenting 
      Buddha Dhamma not only to the outside world but first to the Sri Lankan 
      people in Sri Lanka. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The ceasefire situation has brought the 
      communities together culturally and spiritually. They embrace each other 
      in pursuance of peace and harmony. They stand on the premise of religion.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So far the Sinhala people does not seem to 
      know the absence of the &quot;W&quot; sound in Sinhala. The Sinhala has only the 
      &quot;VA&quot; sound. So it is in Pali language too. While the Sinhala people have 
      forgotten, it or are ignorant of it, their Tamil brethern have without 
      effortless ease maintained their village names in style. All village names 
      beyond Anuradhapura are written with &quot;VA&quot; sound. For instance, Vavuniya, 
      Velanai, Vasavilan, Valikamam, Vannarponnai, Vaddukoddai, Varani are some 
      of the village names. Despicably indeed, when Northern villager retains 
      Valikamam as their village name, the Southerner still has the survile 
      tendency to ape the West and flaunt Weligama for their village. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This situation calls for a standardisation 
      by the authorities without delay sooner it is done the better. Back to 
      Rhys Davids and the Pali Text Society, the credit must be showered to the 
      husband-wife duo whose pioneering efforts to learn Sinhala and Pali and 
      Buddhist realizing the efficacy of the Buddha word they made an earnest 
      endeavour to propagate the sublime teaching throughout the globe. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Rhys and Caroline Davids gave the lead 
      for others to follow.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Dhammapada which was first translated 
      by German scholar Max Muller, has today become the companion of those who 
      turn to the Buddha to follow his Dhamma for freedom and emancipation.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The turning point began with the following 
      utterance by Rhys Davids: </FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;... Buddhist or not Buddhist, I have 
        examined every one of the great religious systems of the world, and in 
        none of them have I found anything to surpass in beauty and 
        comprehensiveness, the Noble Eightfold Path of the Buddha. I am content 
        to shape my life according to that Path&quot;.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;... I consider it no exaggeration to 
        say that the Buddha's greatness still shines today like the sun that 
        blots out the glory of lesser lights, and his Ancient Path, still 
        beckons the very pilgrim to the heaven of Nirvana's Security and Peace. 
        And as the old saying goes 'Some run swiftly; some walk; some creep 
        painfully; but all who keep on will reach the goal.'...&quot;</FONT></P>
