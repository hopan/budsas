    <h3><font color="#000080">1. Introduction</font></h3>
    <p>The standpoint adopted here is primarily that of
    Therav�da Buddhism. But most of what is said will be
    applicable to most other Buddhist traditions. The Therav�da
    tradition, also called the Southern school of Buddhism, is
    based on texts maintained in the Pali language which are the
    oldest of the existing Canons of Buddhism and reputed to be
    the closest to the teaching of the Buddha himself. </p>
    <p>There is no place for God in the Mahayana traditions of
    Buddhism as well, and indeed some of the early Indian
    Mahayana philosophers have denounced god-worship in terms
    which are even stronger than those expressed in the Theravada
    literature. Some later Mahayana schools which flourished
    outside India ascribed some degree of divinity to a
    transcendent Buddha, considering living Buddhas to a be a
    manifestation of this �dhi-buddha. But even here it cannot
    be said that the Buddha was converted into a Divinity
    comparable to the God of the monotheistic religions. <a
    name="chap2"></a> </p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">2. Buddhism as a Non-Theistic
    Religion</font></h3>
    <p>Buddhism is unique amongst the religions of the world
    because it does not have any place for God in its
    soteriology. Indeed most Asian religions (with the possible
    exception of some extremely devotional forms of Hinduism) are
    essentially non-theistic, in that God does not occupy the
    central place that is accorded to him in monotheistic
    religious traditions. But Buddhism goes beyond most of these
    other religions in that it is positively anti-theistic
    because the very notion of God conflicts with some principles
    which are fundamental to the Buddhist view of the world and
    the role of humans in it (see section 5 below). </p>
    <p>However Buddhism is not atheistic in the sense that modern
    secularism, rationalism, humanism, etc. could be regarded to
    be atheistic (although it has much in common with them).
    Buddhism is not concerned primarily with refuting the notion
    of God (as some atheistic writers have done). It is
    principally concerned with developing a method of escape from
    the worldly ills. This involves undertaking a method of
    mental discipline and a code of conduct which is sufficient
    to satisfy the most demanding of spiritual requirements.
    Indeed only very little of the Buddha's voluminous discourses
    deal directly with the question of God. He was more
    interested in expounding a way to personal salvation, and to
    improve the weal of mankind both in this world and in the
    worlds to come. It is this task that informs most of the
    discourses of the Buddha which later came to be compiled into
    the various Canons of Buddhism. </p>
    <p>The Buddha did not take an ambiguous or agnostic position
    on the question of God as he is sometimes represented as
    having taken by theistically inclined writers. The Buddha has
    stated his position on God in clear and unequivocal terms. <a
    name="chap3"></a> </p>
    <h3><font color="#000080"><b>3. The Notion of God</b></font></h3>
    <p>It is first of all necessary to establish what is meant by
    the term &quot;God&quot;. This term is used to designate a
    Supreme Being endowed with the qualities of omnipotence and
    omniscience, who is the creator of the universe with all its
    contents, and the chief law-giver for humans. God is
    generally considered as being concerned with the welfare of
    his human creatures, and the ultimate salvation of those who
    follow his dictates. God is therefore a person of some kind,
    and the question whether such an entity exists or not is
    fundamental to all theistic systems. </p>
    <p>In contrast to this notion of a personal God some modern
    theologians have interpreted the term &quot;God&quot; as
    representing some kind of abstract principle of good (or
    &quot;ground of being&quot;). This view was first developed
    in the ancient Indian Upanishads where God is equated with an
    abstract principle (Brahman). The ancient Indian philosophers
    could entertain such a view because they also had a theory of
    karma which really does away with the need for a personal
    God. Buddhists too have a theory of karma, which is different
    from that of the Hindus, and which even more unequivocally
    dispenses with the need for a Deity. The use of the term
    &quot;God' to denote an abstract reality by monotheistic
    theologians who have no theory of karma is difficult to
    justify; one suspects that this is merely a device to explain
    away the contradictions that arise from the notion of a
    personal God. In fact the actual practice of theistic
    religion proceeds as if God is a real person of some kind or
    other. </p>
    <p>Just as Buddhism rejects the notion of a Supreme God it
    also rejects the notion of an abstract God-principle
    operating in the universe. The notion of Brahman (in the
    neuter) is not discussed at all in the Buddhist texts, and
    even in India it may well be a post-Buddhist development
    resulting from the attempt to reconcile the belief in God(s)
    with the powerful critique of the Buddha. It is therefore the
    attitude of Buddhism to the notion of a supreme personal God
    animating the Universe that we must consider. </p>
    <p>Buddhism speaks of the existence of category of beings
    called devas. This term is generally translated as
    &quot;gods&quot; (with a simple `g' and in the plural). The
    term deva literally means a shining or radiant being, and
    describes their physical appearance rather than their
    supernatural powers (as the translation &quot;gods&quot;
    seems to imply). To prevent confusion with the notion of a
    supreme personal God we shall refer to these beings of
    Buddhist cosmology as devas. Many other religions also
    postulate the existence of non-human beings who are referred
    to as `gods' or `angels' if they are considered to be in a
    better position than humans (with respect to their material
    conditions of existence). Buddhist cosmology recognises 32
    planes of existence some of the higher planes being either
    states of meditative abstraction or actual domains for the
    devas. Generally we have direct experience of only two of
    these 32 planes (those of humans and animals). Planes of
    existence below these two realms are also said to exist and
    are characterised by greater degrees of suffering and
    discomfort. The actual physical location of these planes need
    not concern us here because the dimensions of the Buddhist
    universe are even greater than those envisaged by modern
    astronomy and will contain enough places to accommodate all
    these planes of existence. </p>
    <p>We can easily dispose of the devas in the context of the
    Buddhist attitude to God because the devas are essentially
    irrelevant to the human situation. Beings are born in the
    deva-worlds because of particular karmic factors they have
    accumulated, and after these karmic factors are exhausted
    they could revert to any of the other planes of existence
    depending on their unexpended karma. The devas are not
    particularly endowed with special powers to influence others,
    and far from saving anyone else they themselves are not
    &quot;saved&quot;. Salvation in Buddhism comes only from full
    enlightenment, which could be best accomplished from the
    human plane of existence. </p>
    <p>The Vedic and Brahmanical religion of the Buddha's day
    postulated a large number of gods, many of them
    personifications of natural forces. However Brahmanical
    theology had advanced to the point that one of these gods was
    considered to be superior to all others, and was even
    considered to be the creator-god (Ishvara). This supreme god
    could then be considered as the equivalent to the single God
    of the monotheistic religions which emerged in the Middle
    East. </p>
    <p>Different names have been given to the supreme god in the
    Brahmanical and later Hindu literature, but in Buddhist texts
    the supreme god is referred to as Mah�-Brahm� (or simply
    Brahm�) who was the chief of a class of gods called the
    Brahm�s. Brahm� of the Buddhist texts may be considered to
    be the equivalent of the God of the three monotheistic
    religions that was to emerge in the middle east. The first of
    these was Judaism which promoted one its gods Yahweh as the
    one God sometime about the 6th century BCE. Next Christianity
    adopted the same god under the name of Jehovah who is
    represented as the &quot;Father&quot; of Jesus. Finally Islam
    adopted the name of Allah for their only God. To get the
    Buddha's views on God we must therefore consider his views on
    Brahm�. </p>
    <p>One popular misconception of Buddhism must be dismissed at
    this point. This is view that the Buddha is some kind of God
    figure. In the Theravada tradition the Buddha is regarded as
    a supremely enlightened human teacher who has come to his
    last birth in sams�ra (the Buddhist cycle of existence).
    Even Mahayana traditions which tend to think in terms of
    transcendental Buddhas do not directly make a claim for
    Buddha as God. Thus the Buddha cannot be considered as
    playing a God-like role in Buddhism.&nbsp;<a name="chap4"></a>
    </p>
    <h3><font color="#000080"><b>4. The Buddhist View of God</b></font></h3>
    <p>In the Buddhist texts Mah� Brahm� is represented as
    claiming the following attributes for himself: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;I am Brahm�, the Great Brahm�, the Supreme
        One, the Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of
        all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of all appointing
        to each his place, the Ancient of days, the Father of all
        that is and will be.&quot; (D�gha Nik�ya, II, 263).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Buddha dismisses all these claims of Mah� Brahm� as
    being due to his own delusions brought about by ignorance. He
    argues that Mah�-Brahm� is simply another deva, perhaps
    with greater karmic force than the other gods, but
    nonetheless a deva and therefore unenlightened and subject to
    the sams�ric process as determined by his karma. In such
    suttas as the Brahmaj�la sutta and the Agga��a Sutta the
    Buddha refutes the claims of Maha Brahm� and shows him to be
    subject to karmic law (i.e. cosmic law). Even though
    long-lived Mah� Brahm� will be eliminated in each cycle of
    inevitable world dissolution and re-evolution. In the
    Khevadda Sutta Mah� Brahm� is forced to admit to an
    inquiring monk that he is unable to answer a question that is
    posed to him, and advises the monk to consult the Buddha.
    This clearly shows the Brahm� acknowledges the superiority
    of the Buddha. </p>
    <p>The Buddhist view is that gods may lead more comfortable
    lives and be addicted to all the sense pleasures, but in
    terms of wisdom might be inferior to humans. They are even
    represented as coming to receive instruction from monks and
    even lay persons. Later on with the Hindu revival and
    proliferation of God-cults the Buddhists were increasingly
    vocal against the pretensions of God and his retinue of
    lesser gods. N�garjun� the Indian Buddhist philosopher of
    the 2nd century CE expressed a commonly shared Buddhist view
    when he wrote: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The gods are all eternal scoundrels <br>
        Incapable of dissolving the suffering of impermanence. <br>
        Those who serve them and venerate them <br>
        May even in this world sink into a sea of sorrow. <br>
        We know the gods are false and have no concrete being; <br>
        Therefore the wise man believes them not <br>
        The fate of the world depends on causes and conditions <br>
        Therefore the wise man many not rely on gods. </p>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Mah�paj�p�ramit�sh&amp;acirc;stra [Lamotte
                trans. I, p.141]</p>
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the West a number of &quot;arguments&quot; have been
    adduced to prove or disprove the existence of God. Some of
    these were anticipated by the Buddha. One of the most popular
    is the &quot;first cause&quot; argument according to which
    everything must have a cause, and God is considered the first
    cause of the Universe. The Buddhist theory of causation says
    that every thing must have preconditions for its existence,
    and this law must also extend to &quot;God&quot; should such
    an entity exist. But while the &quot;first cause&quot; claims
    that God creates everything, it exempts God from the ambit of
    this law. However if exemptions are made with respect to God
    such exemptions could be made with respect to other things
    also hereby contradicting the principle of the first cause. </p>
    <p>But the argument which the Buddha most frequently uses is
    what is now called the &quot;argument from evil&quot; which
    in the Buddhist sense could be stated as the argument from
    dukkha (suffering or unsatisfactoriness). This states that
    the empirical fact of the existence of dukkha cannot be
    reconciled with the existence of an omnipotent and omniscient
    being who is also all good. The following verses from the
    Bh�ridatta Jataka bring this out clearly: </p>

    <p>The Buddha argues that the three most commonly given
    attributes of God, viz. omnipotence, omniscience and
    benevolence towards humanity cannot all be mutually
    compatible with the existential fact of dukkha. </p>
    <p>From the Buddhist standpoint the classic theistic
    statement that &quot;God created man in his (i.e God's)
    image&quot; has actually to be reversed. It is man who has
    created God in his (i.e. man's) image! And as man's own image
    changes so does that of his God. Thus in the present time
    with the rise of feminism there is an attempt to change the
    gender of God from a man to a woman (or perhaps even to a
    neuter). To liberate himself mankind has to shed his
    delusions, and one of these is the existence of God. <a
    name="chap5"></a> </p>
    <h3><font color="#000080"><b>5. The God-Concept and Buddhist
    Principles</b></font></h3>
    <p>Quite apart from explicit statements refuting the God-idea
    there is a fundamental incompatibility between the notion of
    God and basic Buddhist principles. We have already mentioned
    that God cannot be reconciled with the Buddhist notion of
    causality which is contained in the theory of &quot;dependent
    origination&quot; which is one of the discoveries of the
    Buddha during his enlightenment. Certainly nothing like this
    theory has been propounded prior to the Buddha. </p>
    <p>A fundamental Buddhist belief is that all phenomena
    without exemption (including all animate beings) have three
    essential characteristics. These are dukkha (explained
    above), anicca (impermanence), and anatta (insubstantiality,
    &quot;no-soul&quot;). The attributes of God are not
    consistent with these universal marks of existence. Thus God
    must be free from dukkha; he must be eternal (and hence not
    subject to anicca); finally he must have a distinct
    unchanging identity (and therefore lack the characteristic of
    anatta). </p>
    <p>Another concomitant of the God-idea that is fundamentally
    incompatible with Buddhism is the belief that God acts as the
    final judge and could determine if individuals go to heaven
    or hell. According to Buddhism the destination of individuals
    is determined by the karmic law which cannot be interfered by
    any external process. Only individuals can effect their
    karmic destinies; even a Buddha cannot &quot;pardon&quot; or
    otherwise interfere with the karmic process. In Buddhism
    there is simply no place for a God even if one were to exist.
    </p>
    <p>There is also no place for the notion of vicarious
    salvation, or atonement for human sins by a
    &quot;suffering&quot; God. The Buddha affirms that &quot;by
    oneself is kamma done and by oneself is kamma undone&quot;.
    According to Buddhism no one (and this includes gods or God)
    can save another. This is a cardinal principle of the Buddha
    which cannot be reconciled with the declared attributes and
    actions of God. </p>
    <p>The Buddhist path to salvation is based on deeds
    (including mental culture through &quot;meditation&quot;) not
    prayer. God appears to Buddhists to be a vain being expecting
    all others to pray to him and worship him. Indeed such prayer
    seems to be the most decisive factor in a person's salvation,
    not necessarily any good or bad deeds by him. But as
    mentioned above in Buddhism it is volitional action with
    determines the karma of an individual. </p>
    <p>There is no doubt some similarities in the moral codes of
    Buddhism and some theistic religions. Things like compassion
    are inculcated in all religions. But in Buddhism this does
    not arise from a heavenly dictate and there is no limitation
    in the exercise of these virtues as occurs in some theistic
    religion.&nbsp;<a name="chap6"></a> </p>
    <h3><font color="#000080"><b>6. The Persistence of the
    God-Idea</b></font></h3>
    <p>The Buddha's refutation of the God-concept was formulated
    some 2500 years ago, perhaps at the very time that the idea
    of a single supreme God was mooted in India and in the Middle
    East. With the rise of modern science, and the discovery of
    natural causes for phenomena which were formerly ascribed to
    the action of God, some philosophers have restated the basic
    fallacies of the God-hypothesis using modern science and
    logic (and not the Buddha's dhamma) as their point of
    departure. Yet many people in the world formally subscribe to
    the notion of God. What is the Buddhist explanation for this
    phenomenon? </p>
    <p>There are many causes for the persistence of the God-idea.
    Some of these are induced by social and other factors. These
    include the institutionalisation of theistic religion, the
    use of vast economic resources to propagate it including the
    mass media, and the legal right given to parents to impose
    their religions on their children. There is also the
    attractiveness of vicarious salvation, or salvation through
    prayer or forgiveness which permits the committing of many
    moral crimes for which the doer does not &quot;pay&quot;. We
    shall not consider these here. From the Buddhist point of
    view the root causes are ignorance and fear, with fear itself
    ultimately the product of ignorance. Atheistic materialism
    has failed to dislodge the God-idea not because of any
    deficiency of its arguments when compared to those put
    forward by the theists, but because it too has not been able
    to eliminate ignorance. </p>
    <p>The ignorance (avijj�) that is meant here cannot be
    eliminated by formal education and the propagation of
    scientific knowledge. After all some leading scientists are
    themselves completely deluded by theistic suppositions. The
    progress of science has resulted only in a minor diminution
    in the power of theistic religion, and in any case
    theologians have become adept at &quot;reinterpreting&quot;
    dogma while the general followers continue to do what they
    have always done. </p>
    <p>The Buddha himself grasped the overpervading nature of
    ignorance because of his titanic struggle to liberate
    himself. He even initially displayed some reluctance to
    propagate his knowledge because of the formidable nature of
    the task. Nonetheless he proclaimed his knowledge out of
    compassion for the world because he felt that at least a few
    &quot;with little dust in their eyes&quot; would be able to
    benefit fully from his ideas. From the Buddhist point of view
    the persistence of theism, with all its evil consequences
    seen in history, is a necessary consequence of the
    persistence of ignorance. </p>
    <p>While intellectual and scientific knowledge is not the
    sole (or even essential) constituent of wisdom (pa���) it
    could in the modern world with high levels of educational
    attainment be a good basis for it. But what is really
    required is the cultivation of the mind (bh�van�,
    sam�dhi). This is usually referred to as
    &quot;meditation&quot; even though this term is quite
    inadequate to convey the full implications of what is meant.
    Many modern-day &quot;meditation teachers&quot; do not give
    instruction in Buddhist mental culture, and even some of
    those who claim to do so may take a literal view of a few
    classic Buddhist texts on the subject. The Buddhist path
    requires a correct balance between three components: wisdom,
    morality and mental culture. Progress in all these three
    areas must be made simultaneously, and exclusive
    concentration on any one these, especially
    &quot;meditation&quot; of a highly stylised form, is not the
    balanced path. The Buddha has asked all his disciples to go
    to the Dhamma as their guide rather than to specific
    teachers. The Buddha's final instruction to his followers was
    to &quot;work out your own salvation with diligence&quot;
    with the Buddha's teaching (the dhamma) as the only guide. </p>
