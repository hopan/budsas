<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>(...) Let us now consider Right Speech. What a wonderful
    thing is speech, for just a word can change a man's whole
    outlook towards good. and evil. Are we not really fortunate
    in this gift which is denied to animals? Yet how few of us
    care to use it for our own and others' welfare. Much trouble
    and misunderstanding could be avoided if only people would be
    more thoughtful and gentle in what they say and more accurate
    and sincere in what they write.</p>
    <p>Speech is a gift of great value since through it we can
    express thoughts and ideas which can be shared with others.
    But if the tongue, which is boneless and pliable, is allowed
    to become unruly, it can play havoc. Is it not responsible
    for much strife and trouble from squabbles between families
    to wars between nations? If man could but tame his tongue,
    would not the world be a far better place to live in?</p>
    <p>Speech should not be dominated by unwholesome thoughts --
    by greed, anger, jealousy, pride, selfishness and so on. Much
    talk certainly prevents calmness and right thinking, and a
    glib tongue leads to all four types of wrong talk. Says the
    Buddha: &quot;Monks, there are these five disadvantages and
    dangers in garrulous speech: the glib talker utters
    falsehoods, slanders, speaks harsh and idle words, and after
    death is reborn in an evil state of existence.&quot; [1]</p>
    <p>1. In the context of right speech, the first virtue is to <font
    color="#000080"><em><strong>abstain from falsehood and speak
    the truth</strong></em></font>. Such a person, as the <i>Metta
    sutta</i> says, is straight, nay transparently straight <i>(uju,
    suju)</i> [2].<i> </i>He is sincere, upright and dependable.
    He does not stray from the truth to win fame, or to please
    another. He may seem strict, but 'truth is one, for there is
    no second&quot; [3]. 'The Buddha did not say one thing one
    day and the contrary the next.' [4] 'Because he speaks as he
    acts and acts as he speaks, he is called Tathagata.' [5] The
    Master is also known'as <i>Saccanama, </i>'he whose name is
    Truth'.</p>
    <p>The Buddha was so emphatic with regard to this evil of
    lying, that his first lesson to little Rahula, the
    seven-year-old novice, [6] seems to have been on the
    worthlessness of falsehood (we know that children of tender
    age, wittingly or not, often speak falsely).</p>
    <p>Once the Blessed One visited little Rahula. The latter got
    a seat ready and water for washing the feet. The Master
    washed his feet and sat down. Little Rahula paid obeisance to
    the Blessed One and sat at one side. Then the Master, having
    poured a little water into a vessel, said:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>- Do you, see, Rahula, this little quantity of water
        left in the vessel ?</p>
        <p>- Yes, venerable sir.</p>
        <p>- Even so, Rahula, insignificant is the recluseship of
        those who are not ashamed to lie.</p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Then the Master having thrown away the water addressed the
    novice:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left">- Do you note, Rahula, that little
        quantity of water thrown away?</p>
        <p align="left">- Yes, venerable sir.</p>
        <p align="left">- Even so, Rahula, discarded, indeed, is
        the recluseship of those who are not ashamed to lie.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Then the Master overturned the water vessel and addressed
    the novice:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>- Do you, Rahula, see this vessel that has been
        overturned?</p>
        <p>- Yes, venerable sir.</p>
        <p>- Even so, Rahula, overturned, indeed, is the
        recluseship of those who are not ashamed to lie.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Then the Master having uprighted the vessel addressed the
    novice:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>- Do you, Rahula, see this water vessel that is void,
        empty?</p>
        <p>- Yes, venerable sir.</p>
        <p>- Even so, Rahula, void and empty is the recluseship
        of those who are not ashamed to lie ... Even so, Rahula
        (citing the simile of a king's elephant) of anyone who is
        not ashamed to lie, I say that there is no evil that he
        cannot do. Wherefore, Rahula, thus, indeed, should you
        train yourself: 'Not even for fun will I tell a
        lie.&quot; [7]</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>2. <font color="#000080"><em><strong>Slander or
    tale-bearing</strong></em></font> <i>(pisunavaca) </i>is the
    next evil that the tongue can commit. The Pali word means
    literally 'breaking up of fellowship'. To slander another is
    most wicked for it entails making a false statement intended
    to damage someone's reputation. The slanderer often commits
    two crimes simultaneously, he says what is false because his
    report is untrue and then he back-bites.</p>
    <p>In Sanskrit poetry the back-biter is compared to a
    mosquito which though small is noxious. It comes singing,
    settles on you, draws blood and may, if a female, give you
    malaria. Again the talebearer's words may be sweet as honey,
    but his mind is full of poison.</p>
    <p>Let us then avoid tale-bearing and slander. which distroy
    friendships. Instead of causing trouble let us speak words
    that make for peace and reconciliation. [8] Instead of sowing
    the seed of dissension, let us bring peace and friendship to
    those living in discord and enmity. 'Be united; wrangle not,'
    said the Buddha. &quot;Concord alone is commendable' <i>(samavayo
    eva sadhu)</i> [9]<i> </i>was inscribed by Asoka on stone.
    Since we depend on one another, we must learn to live
    together in peace, friendship and.harmony.</p>
    <p>3. The next virtue is to <font color="#000080"><em><strong>abstain
    from harsh words</strong></em></font> and be pleasant and
    courteous. What we say can bring gain or loss, praise or
    blame, good repute or ill, misery or happiness. A gentle word
    can melt the hardest heart, while a harsh word can cause
    untold agony.</p>
    <p>We should think twice before we speak ill of anyone, for
    it is an attempt to damage his character, his good name. But
    it does not matter if, when praising another, we slightly
    overpaint the picture, for this does not lead to
    unpleasantness and heart-burning., As the Buddha says: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>'In man's mouth a hatchet grows<br>
            With which fools will cut themselves<br>
            When they utter evil words. [10]</p>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the Buddha's day a festival called 'Simpletons' Holiday
    <i>(Balamakkhatta) </i>was sometimes held in which only the
    simple minded took part. For a week they smeared their bodies
    with ashes and cowdung and wandered about abusing and
    shouting coarsely at people. Even friends, relatives,
    ascetics and monks were not spared. People would fling them a
    few coppers to be rid of them. The devout followers of the
    Buddha besought the Master not to enter the city until the
    festival was over. Then the Buddha said: 'Foolish and
    uninstructed dolts are offensive like that, but the wise
    cultivate mindfulness and attain the Deathless <i>Nibbana.</i>
    [11]</p>
    <p>Man's speech often indicates his character. A harsh word,
    an unpleasant gesture, a crooked smile, may turn a
    good-natured man into a criminal, a friend into a foe.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>'Speak not harshly to anyone,<br>
            For those accosted will retort;<br>
            Painful is vindictive talk,<br>
            You may receive blows in exchange. [12]</p>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>One of the past stories of the Bodhisatta tells how he
    weaned his otherwise good mother from harsh speech. It is
    said that she was rude and ill-tongued, but that her son,
    aware of the weakness, did not want to hurt her by speaking
    too plainly. One day the Bodhisatta, who was then king of
    Benares, went to a park with his mother and retainers. On the
    way a blue jay screeched so discordantly that all covered
    their ears and cried: 'What a harsh call, what a screech!
    Don't let us hear that again.' Now it happened later that
    when the Bodhisatta was strolling in the pleasance with his
    mother and retainers, an Indian cuckoo called so sweetly that
    the people were happy and hoped that it would sing again.</p>
    <p>This was the moment for which the Bodhisatta had
    been,waiting. He said: 'Mother dear, the jay's cry was
    dreadful and we covered our ears rather than listen to it. No
    one delights in a coarse language. Though dark and without
    beauty the cuckoo won the love and attention of all with its
    pleasing call. One's speech, therefore, should be friendly
    and restrained, calm and full of meaning....' Thus exhorted
    by her son, the mother became refined in speech and elegant
    in manners. [13]</p>
    <p>Pleasant and courteous speech attracts and is an asset to
    society, yet how often is beauty marred by rude talk. 'The
    language of the heart, the language which couies from the
    heart, is always simple, graceful and full of power.' [14]</p>
    <p>4. The fourth and last virtue concerned with right speech
    is to <font color="#000080"><em><strong>abstain from
    frivolous talk or gossip</strong></em></font> which brings no
    profit to anyone, anywhere. People are too fond of idle talk,
    of maliciously disparaging others. The papers in their gossip
    columns are just as bad. Men and women with time on their
    hands indulge in endless chatter, amusing themselves at the
    expense of others. As J. L. Hollard says: 'Gossip is always a
    personal confession either of malice or imbecility. It is a
    low, frivolous and too often a dirty business in which
    neighbours are made enemies for life'. The Buddha's golden
    advice is: 'When, monks, you have gathered together there are
    two things to be done, either talk about the <i>Dhamma </i>(the
    Doctrine) or keep nobly silent '. [15]</p>
    <p>The Buddha was very critical of idle chatter, scandal and
    rumour for they disturb serenity and concentration. 'Better
    than a thousand sentences -- a mere jumble of meaningless
    words -- is one sensible phrase on hearing which one is
    pacified.&quot; [16]</p>
    <p>A sage is sometimes called by the Pali word <i>muni</i>
    which means one who keeps silent. Yes, 'silence is golden' so
    do not speak unless you are sure you can improve on silence.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>'Much talking is a source of danger,<br>
            Through silence misfortune is avoided.<br>
            The talkative parrot in a cage is shut,<br>
            While birds that cannot talk fly freely.' [17]</p>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>'One does not become a wise man just by talking a lot;
    [18] neither is he versed in the doctrine <i>(Dhammadhara) </i>because
    he speaks much.' [19] And lest one should misunderstand the
    silence of the <i>muni, </i>the Buddha also says: 'To keep
    silent does not turn a foolish ignoramus into a sage, <i>(muni)</i>&quot;<i>
    </i>[20]</p>
    <p>In conclusion let us listen to the discourse on 'Good
    Speech': [21]</p>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>'The good say: <br>
            1. Noble speech is apt,<br>
            2. Speak the <em>Dhamma</em> not <em>a-dhamma</em>:
            [22]<br>
            3. Say what is pleasant, not unpleasant;<br>
            4. Speak what is true, not lies.<br>
            Speak only words that do not bring remorse<br>
            Nor hurt another. That is good speech, indeed.<br>
            Truth is immortal speech, it is an ancient law.<br>
            In truth, weal and <i>Dhamma </i>the sages are
            established.<br>
            The Buddha's words of peace to <i>Nibbana lead,<br>
            </i>To suffering's end. Such words are good indeed.'</p>
