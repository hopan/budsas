      <td width="100%"><em><b><font face="Times New Roman">I know how reticent
        monks are to talk about themselves, but I cannot help but begin by
        asking about your own Jàtaka story. How did you wind up as a Buddhist
        monk living in England?</font></b></em>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, where does it all begin? I suppose
        around the age of six or seven I started to recognize something of what
        death was about: that we all die. I remember talking to my brother about
        it and he said, &quot;Oh, don't think about it, it will be all
        right.&quot; Now he is a businessman and I'm a monk. (Laughs.) I
        remember even then not feeling interested in the general flow of
        society; feeling, &quot;Well, what are we doing here? Just passing the
        time.&quot; You wonder where it all begins…</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">After graduating from university
        (English and American literature at Warwick) I thought I owed it to
        myself, having done 18 years of schooling, to just move out of the
        program and see the wider view of things. I spent about four years
        traveling around. This was the sixties and seventies, so things were
        pretty wild. After awhile I thought, &quot;Well no, this isn't it. I
        need to find some proper way of cultivating clarity.&quot; So the only
        intuition I had was-&quot;go to the East.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>So you hit the road and went to
        India?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I went to India when I was twenty-four
        with the thought, &quot;Well, you'll find it here somewhere.&quot; But,
        I just got very ill; so I escaped India. I had a Traveler's Guide to the
        World which had one paragraph about Thailand in it. Thailand sounded
        like it was cool and friendly, while India was very chaotic and wild.
        So, I jumped on a plane to Thailand. After only one day in Bangkok I
        took a train to Ayutthaya (ancient capital) and found myself wandering
        among the ruins-colossal Buddhist remains, big pagodas, gigantic Buddha
        statues. And I thought to myself, &quot;Well, what's this?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">A few days later I was in Chiang Mai. I
        saw a sign in English saying, &quot;Meditation Classes Being
        Taught.&quot; I thought, &quot;That must be part of what it's about.
        Learn to focus, get your mind together. I'll do that. I went to one
        meditation class and there was a monk teaching in this vihàra
        [monastery]. He was an English monk. He was sitting by a window which
        didn't have any glass in it. He had an oil lamp beside him. I noticed
        that flying ants were coming in through the window and crawling all over
        him as he was talking. He was very carefully picking them off his skin,
        occasionally out of his mouth, without getting upset. To me it looked so
        irritating but it didn't seem to bother him. We only did about 15
        minutes of meditation; and just in that time the obvious realization
        came, &quot;Hey, there's all this thinking, and there's a silence that's
        not thinking, a silence that's attending to this. What's that?&quot; I
        thought, &quot;I must investigate that.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>So you got a taste of…what?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some awareness, some silence, some
        quality of attention. I mean, whenever you put it into words it doesn't
        quite work, does it? You find you're in a different key than you were
        before: before you were very much in the music and now, somehow, the
        music's happening but you're not moving with it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So I talked to the monk afterwards and
        said, &quot;I'd like to do more of this.&quot; But I recognized that I
        was not going to do this while staying in a cheap hotel with five other
        guys smoking dope and playing guitars. So I asked, &quot;Can I come and
        stay in your monastery?&quot; A couple of days later I just packed up
        and hitchhiked a couple hundred miles down the road to where he was
        living and wandered in. He gave me a kuñi [meditation hut] and came
        down the next day to give me some teaching instructions. He was teaching
        the Burmese satipaññhàna [mindfulness] method.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Did you take to meditation from
        the start?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, I did. I was really interested in
        the mind and in exploring. It wasn't a decision, really; it was innate.
        I'd always been interested in it, but I hadn't had a framework. Within
        about a week I started to piece things together: &quot;Well, you know,
        this is not bad. You're in this little hut. They're pretty nice. They
        bring you food. And you get to work on clearing your mind.&quot; I felt
        happy. I recognized that whatever you do in life, basically you want to
        feel you're doing something with purpose and you want to be happy. I
        wasn't really missing out on much by being in the monastery. I didn't
        need much. I'd come from a working class background, which means that
        you work hard your whole life. Working class people have to activate a
        lot of effort and energy and attention and aggravation to get the four
        requisites [food, shelter, clothing, and medicine] together-and there at
        the monastery that was just laid on. It was simple, but laid on. So I
        thought, &quot;I'd like to do more of this.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>So you stayed on?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I actually had to leave Thailand to get
        a new visa. I thought I'd have a look around while I was out, so I
        traveled around Indonesia for a while-but with an increasing sense of
        nibbidà, or world-weariness. I was doing all the things you're supposed
        to do to make life enjoyable. I was going to some very beautiful
        countryside, to mountains, beaches, and lakes. But it just was not
        connecting; it wasn't sinking in. It was like looking at everything
        through a glass. I was somewhere else. I ended up living in Bali, where
        everybody was hanging out. But I just couldn't go through that whole
        scene anymore. There was no energy for it. I found that all I wanted to
        do was meditate-sit and walk. I thought, &quot;This is crazy, doing it
        in this place.&quot; So I went back to Thailand. It was a very
        instructive excursion.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">After three days at the monastery I
        shaved my head and became a sàmaõera, a ten-precept novice monk. It's
        a much less highly calibrated discipline than full ordination, but the
        basic stuff is there. Then I got into meditation. After about six months
        or so there were other Westerners who had turned up, and they were all
        interested in becoming bhikkhus [monks]. I was happy where I was. But
        the others would say, &quot;You've been here longest. You should become
        a bhikkhu before us.&quot; I said, &quot;No, no, I'm fine.&quot; I
        didn't like the idea of being somebody.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">However...I was living in a very
        secluded part of the monastery, and both the teacher and I felt it would
        be good to go on alms-round because that's part of what being a monk,
        even a novice, is about. So I began going out every day on piõóapàta-alms-round.
        And that was really tremendous. I suddenly got the whole social aspect
        of it, which is very potent. We'd go out early in the morning. People
        were just getting up, getting themselves together. They'd come out with
        bowls of rice to put food in our bowls. The people were eager, concerned
        to make sure they got their rice in your bowl. I could see that there
        was a tremendous focus of attention. You create something for people.
        You set up their day. If a monk didn't go by, they would be very upset.
        So you're part of some greater meaning than the personal. The fact of
        being that kind of focus is an incredible spur to practice.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Can you say more about why that's
        so? Is it a feeling of gratitude for what you've been given, or the
        service you're providing to the people?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's partly gratitude, but it's not
        exactly that. It's more like recognizing you're part of something very
        big that's gone on for thousands of years and is holding a society
        together in some form. It's holding people's minds together, giving them
        a sense of direction. It's certainly not given to one personally:
        &quot;Hey, I like you. Here's some food.&quot; People don't even look at
        you. They just see the robe, the bowl. You don't say anything. It would
        be very inappropriate to start conversing. But bearing the sign of the
        monk you realize that somehow you've stepped into something very, very
        big. These people are born and will die with that sign in their mind.
        They grow up as toddlers with that sign in their mind. When they're in
        trouble, that sign in their mind will come back to them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the West, my experience had been of
        being very much out of context. You're one fragment with a bunch of
        other fragments around you. The bonding is minimal, perfunctory, and
        mostly out of functional necessity. Suddenly you are part of something
        whole. And it is carrying people's values. As a monk your values are
        simple things: Rather than get angry, I'll calm down. Rather than cheat,
        I'll be honest. Rather than kill, I'll refrain. Very simple stuff. And
        yet, you're carrying that for a society in some way. So you think,
        &quot;My bit in this situation is to be worthy of alms by carrying the
        sign of goodness.&quot;<br>
        It's not an obligation. Nobody's asking, nobody's checking up. It's a
        real level of connectedness in which something…is transformed. You get
        to points in your meditation where your mind could go flaky-but it
        doesn't. It comes back into the good because of that connection to
        goodness. There are times when you could just think, &quot;Oh, forget
        it.&quot; But you say, &quot;No, keep going.&quot; It's intuitive. It's
        something you feel in your heart.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>How did you wind up accepting
        full ordination?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The specific cause was a response to the
        local community. Twice a year the monastery hosted hundreds of women to
        come to the monastery and meditate. They would all wear white, take the
        eight precepts, and sleep wherever a spare patch of floor could be
        found-there just weren't enough kuñis. And they would do a ten-day
        meditation retreat. Now, aspects of the feminine play a big part in
        monastic culture-either through women themselves or through the
        receptive and suffusive elements of Dhamma practice. The feminine offers
        a key to transformation. My own ordination was a good case in point.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Thai women stepped forward, very
        eager to offer support-making that offering meant a lot to them. For a
        Westerner to go forth was regarded as significant and impressive because
        it's not part of our culture, not something we would do as a matter of
        course. So the women were very keen to sponsor a Westerner to become a
        bhikkhu. They thought, &quot;You've got so much. You've got education,
        and money, and so many other things. And you're giving it all up.&quot;
        And I felt, &quot;Well, they've given so much. I'll do it, for
        them.&quot; So the result was that everyone was uplifted. Like the
        Buddha, a monk &quot;leaves home&quot; to take up the holy life-but
        sponsorship is a later development. It connects the &quot;Going
        Forth&quot; to the society-a very &quot;feminine&quot; thing. Anyway, I
        was a bhikkhu. I stayed where I was and continued to practice
        meditation, but I also joined in more with the community life of the
        Sangha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the most inspiring things about
        being a bhikkhu was that once a fortnight we would go to the pàñimokkha
        recitation. We'd sit in a hall listening to one monk recite the training
        rules at high speed. (It takes about forty-five minutes nonstop.) We'd
        just sit there, with our hearts open, listening. And at that time I felt
        this incredible sense of bonding with all these humans; and also with
        people like the Buddha, Sàriputta, and all the people who have been
        doing very much the same thing for 2500 years. They all listened to and
        lived according to these rules being recited. The recitation is a chance
        to acknowledge one's own failings or weaknesses, and incline towards
        clearing the effects and doing better. You feel again that you're part
        of the human need, the human urge to do good, which is an urge as basic
        as our more sensual urges. Because it's low volume, we don't normally
        hear it. But I think the urge is intrinsic: we want to do good.<br>
        <br>
        <em><b>So, except for what circumstance would you still be there to this
        day?</b></em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, my father died, so I went back to
        England to see my mother and sort out any family affairs. You know, my
        own personal stuff. And at that time Ajahn Sumedho was living in London.
        I had met him briefly in Thailand on one of my visits to another
        monastery. He struck me as someone with some accomplishment. His
        presence was peaceful; it was gentle; it was warm and spacious; it was
        resonant. So when I found out he was in Britain, I thought I would go
        see him. He was staying in a little place in London near Hampstead
        Heath, and I went down there and stayed a few days. There were two other
        monks there as well. I liked what they were doing. They were forest
        monks-whereas the place I had been trained was more a city monastery.
        And they brought with them a sense of fuller application to things like
        making robes, to a whole way of living. I found that interesting. So I
        thought, &quot;While I'm in Britain, I'll stay a bit longer-three months
        ought to do it.&quot; (Laughs.) That was 22 years ago.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Was it distracting to your life
        as a monk to have to deal with the social newness of what you were doing
        in the English culture?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you go back to the idea of receiving
        alms-food: I recognized that I was part of something big, a ripple in a
        pond. My experience in meditation was revealing a lot of the
        difficulties-hindrances, confusions, wrong views-that needed to get
        worked out in a wider, social context. So living with a group of monks
        and engaging was very helpful. It helped to open things up, work things
        out, take things in; to feel the sense of a larger sphere. English
        culture wasn't really a problem because it places a high value on
        non-intrusion. People don't tend to come in on you unless they're
        invited. And there's a place for monasteries in the culture.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>It still must have been quite a
        change for you. You mentioned the sense of connecting to a long social
        tradition in Thailand, and this would have been very different in
        England.</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ajahn Sumedho is a very gifted teacher,
        in that he talks about Buddhism from the perspective of what's happening
        now. Where are we at now? How are we mindful of what's happening now?
        How do we find harmony? He teaches from the earth up, rather than from
        the sky down. He set a good example for us. People could relate to the
        goodness of what we were about. Then the vinaya [guidelines for the
        monastic life] helped to guide the connections between bhikkhus and the
        society, and the sanctuary of the monastery provided the situation for
        meeting.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">After living in London we moved to a
        derelict house in Chithurst, West Sussex, which we had to work together
        to rebuild. That was more of a challenge, really, because all I'd ever
        done before was formal practice. Here we had to do a lot of manual work,
        we had to talk with people. We didn't have much time for formal
        practice. And because English people generally didn't know what bhikkhus
        were all about, we'd often have to be more forthcoming to warm them up
        and make them feel okay and not nervous.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>In a lot of what you've been
        saying you've indicated the importance you give to human relatedness,
        the value of other human beings. This also seems reflected in how much
        people seem to want to be around you and in the care you give them. What
        do you see as the place of relationship in your path?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, we're all bobbing around in the
        pond... Maybe awareness of relationship begins there. I think how we
        relate to others is a key issue nowadays: the instruction to be our own
        refuge, to go into solitude, etc., has to be balanced against the
        Buddha's frequent use of dialogue to teach, his having disciples live
        and work with their teachers, and his establishing the Sangha [the
        monastic community]. Nowadays, a perception of &quot;the other&quot; can
        bring up anxiety, fear of judgment, competition, etc., and the teacher
        as &quot;The Other&quot; can be the implacable judge, the parent for
        whom one was never good enough. All this clogs up Dhamma practice. So I
        try to enter the practice field with the group and stay connected and
        responsive-action and speech follow from there. And silence...in a
        shared silence Dhamma seems to spread by osmosis. I enjoy group
        practice; maybe that comes across.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>What would you say about the
        relationship between what has come to be called formal
        practice-intensive meditation in a retreat environment-and what has come
        to be called everyday life?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are different forms for Dhamma
        practice. Or perhaps you can think of it like Chinese boxes-one is
        inside another, which is inside another. In my situation, I'm coming out
        of meditation into a more open form, but another formal training, which
        is the vinaya. The vinaya is continually steering and nudging:
        &quot;Don't go here; things are done in this way; be aware of what
        you're doing now.&quot; I've got that happening all the time-not just at
        the level of a precept, but in observance and manner. &quot;That's not
        the way to treat your bowl.&quot; Or, &quot;That's not the way to talk
        in this context: softening the voice would have a better effect. That's
        not the way to walk in; come in more gently.&quot; And as a mendicant, I
        learn to let go into insecurity. These things offer a great advantage
        for cultivating the Dhamma.<br>
        It is more perilous for a lay meditator who is on a formal retreat and
        then comes out into a situation which has no training guidelines.
        They've just got to work it out themselves. They come out of a situation
        where the skin is being peeled off; they come out all pink and
        sensitive, and suddenly they're in the circus and they have to perform.
        Insecurity has to be denied. So in the last decade or so, people are
        addressing more the issue of daily life context. Having experienced some
        of the uncovering that occurs on a meditation retreat, the questions
        become, &quot;How do we practice in relationship? What is right
        livelihood?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Actually this is pretty much the way the
        process unfolded for the Buddha and his early followers. He taught the
        meditation and the Dhamma first, and then the vinaya evolved from that.
        You can see the same sort of things happening for the lay community
        here. After some practice, people begin to see, &quot;We've got to have
        precepts. We've got to set standards. As teachers we have to be
        honorable. That has to be very clear.&quot; So a kind of vinaya culture,
        more or less, starts to happen. There's a natural interest in it.<br>
        <b><br>
        <em>So you see some evolution in the Western lay person's encounter with
        the Dhamma?</em></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Oh yes, there is now a much wider field
        of corroboration. There is inquiry into things like, &quot;How do we
        have families? How do we raise children? What constitutes a lay
        vinaya?&quot; It's not just a set of precepts or a code. It's a culture,
        a Buddhist culture. The culture of awakening. We have a Buddhist school
        now in Britain. Alms-food gets offered on the streets. There are people
        who've grown up as Buddhists and are familiar with these things.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><b>Is it the meditation practice
        that is so transformative, or is it the core values of the entire
        Buddhist tradition?</b><br>
        </em><br>
        In certain respects the culture and the meditation practice are
        happening on different levels, although they overlap in the personal
        context. To integrate the two is the major practice. The culture is
        carried &quot;externally&quot; by the society (though it doesn't always
        live up to its ideals). When you're in a social context you are often
        dealing with functional requirements, language, and a conventional
        reality, which is not set up for Awakening. And we're often relating
        through the convention of personality. So establishing some sound norms
        for these connections is basic sanity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">With meditation, you're getting nearer
        to the core. Meditation practice is intimate. It's really taking you
        past the ideals and the socialization of values. In the meditation
        practice you get back to something primary: &quot;I feel this. I know
        this.&quot; So, it's a place of release. It's the place of encountering
        hindrances intimately, and of firing up the enlightenment factors.
        Aspects of Buddhist &quot;culture&quot;-patience, generosity, letting
        go, for example-really support that penetration. Then, as you calm down
        and get closer to a core experience, the convention of personality
        starts to unfold into energetic patterns-patterns that are ephemeral but
        kammically potent when they're held onto. Buddhist values are a
        crucible; but if you just put the material in it and don't heat it
        up-you won't get the gold.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">With meditation you develop samàdhi
        [concentration]. You're getting past thinking, getting underneath sense
        contact, getting to an experience of your body which is different. You
        experience yourself more like an energetic sphere of sensitivity than as
        a six-foot tall vertebrate who's a man or a woman. You're coming to
        something much more primary. The mind itself becomes different. If you
        meditate properly, the mind is much more sensitive. It is there, in the
        pond, part of what's going on. In samàdhi you don't get the sense of
        the mind being some separate thing that thinks and decides. You realize
        that thinking and deciding are part of the ripple. You can undo that and
        become more intuitive, more attuned to sensitivities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I see samàdhi as essentially a
        deconstruction of the mind. From that, one can come back<br>
        to dealing with things in terms of conventional entities, duties,
        responsibilities, time, place, and so forth. When you're in a more
        constructed state, you use mindfulness and the clarity that has arisen,
        and then some stored guidelines which act as your conventional guides.
        But in the context of a lot of kammic activity the mind is much more
        likely to be in a stressed or tense state, and on the level of social
        construction you often have to deal with all sorts of emotional
        strangulation.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The course you're teaching here
        at BCBS (Barre Center for Buddhist Studies), on energy or viriya,
        addresses this issue. How are you approaching the subject?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">From my own experience over the years,
        as well as working with others, I have come to realize just how damaged
        we all tend to be, both physically and emotionally. As such, many people
        haven't got the resources to apply themselves to Dhamma. It's rather
        like lifting weights. You come in and you haven't warmed up. You try and
        lift a weight, and you just rip a muscle. It's not that you don't want
        to lift the weight. It's not that you aren't trying. The body just isn't
        primed for it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">People's bodies are pretty damaged
        energetically. They've sat in chairs all their lives; they've been wired
        to unnatural energy for decades. People often find it difficult to even
        know where their bodies are. Their mind has abstracted itself from the
        body. So when you meditate, you're in this kind of disembodied
        experience-a frantic mind is pumping out thoughts, but you're not
        getting any energy from the body. You meditate and meditate, but you're
        basically cut off, disembodied. So it's not just a matter of effort.
        It's a matter of accessing the resource of balanced energy in the body.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The other issue is emotional. We do
        sharing and devotional practices because often people's emotional
        energies are out of whack. They feel isolated, fragmented, alone,
        competitive. Everybody's looking at each other, perhaps feeling annoyed
        because somebody is sniffing or rustling. You know, you're in your own
        little box. It's like going out on the freeway, and everybody's in their
        little box driving along. In that sort of situation people's emotional
        experience is not extensive, it's not unfolding, it's very much folded
        up with personal interest and personal protection. Often people find
        devotional practices help to restore a quality of natural connectedness
        and emotional resonance.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When these two bases of body and heart
        are restricted, I don't know where you get the energy to practice.
        Perhaps its just idealism, or will power; but people run out of that.
        Because of it's restraint and discipline, Theravada Buddhism can seem
        heartless, cerebral, world denying, and body denying-a very cramped
        thing. But when you read the texts, you find the Buddha talking a lot
        about joy, bliss, rapture, tranquility, vitality. So people have to tap
        into this field, this pool of uplifting energy, and they can only do
        this by healing some of the damage done by our modern world. So I teach
        body and heart practices to open them into this field of energy.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>You have often mentioned
        returning to the suttas [texts]. Is this important only for teachers, or
        for all practitioners?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">My own personal interest has been in
        trying to look into the suttas and to get past the cultural accretions.
        I think an interest in what the Buddha said naturally develops from
        living and practicing in this tradition.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It might start with a simple curiosity,
        &quot;What did the Buddha say on mindfulness? Well, let's have a
        look-Oh, the Satipatthàna Sutta.&quot; And that leads you on to,
        &quot;What does he mean by feeling? What does he mean by citta
        [mind]?&quot; You start to check the Pali against the English. So often
        you think you understand, but you're not getting the entirety of it. You
        find that citta and &quot;mind&quot; don't exactly relate. So you have
        to investigate that. For me it's been very much a process of, &quot;What
        do I need to know?&quot; And then I can check a scripture and see what
        the Buddha said, which isn't always the most populist
        &quot;Buddhist&quot; message.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I still think meditation is the leading
        edge. But you need right view to know where to apply that. And certainly
        right view is enhanced by some accurate study. So you owe it to yourself
        to go back to the Buddha. You'd be foolish not to try to get as close as
        you can to the Master.</font></p>
