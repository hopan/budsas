    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;In Christian literature of the lighter sort we
    sometimes come across the expression &quot;Little Devil
    DOUBT.&quot; This personage is not known to Buddhists, but
    another little devil can be still more devastating. He is an
    ugly little Mara, named CONCEIT. Unlike his big brother
    Pride, who is not lacking in dignity, Conceit is a mean,
    slinking little devil, lurking in dark corners and always
    ready to rush out and nip our heels. Doubt is slain when the
    disciple wins the stream: Conceit being a manifestation of
    Pride, remains a menace to the very end. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Pride in all its forms, devolves from self-esteem,
    which is in reality &quot;ego-worship.&quot; It stems, so
    they say, from Greed, the first of the Roots of evil. The
    thought here is rather subtle: when the ordinary person
    thinks of greed he thinks first of what one puts into one's
    tummy --that second helping of plum-pudding, or the
    consumption of a pound of candies in a single evening. The
    commentators of old were much more drastic. Greed is
    &quot;delight in one's own possessions.&quot; Hence we can be
    greedy about anything to which we have affixed the label
    &quot;mine.&quot; My car, my table, my cat, my best beloved.
    The Greedy aspect of Conceit is recognized when we realize we
    are &quot;taking delight&quot; in our own good qualities or
    capacities. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Conceit can arise from the most trivial cause. One
    completes a piece of work, and having made a good job of it,
    one is naturally pleased. There's no harm in that: we all
    know the difference between a worker whose only interest is
    his pay-packet, and the man who takes pride in his work. The
    trouble arises when we begin to make comparisons -- &quot;X.
    couldn't have done it half as well.&quot; That may be quite
    true, but it is dangerous to think that because one's skill
    is superior in a single instance that one is therefore a
    better person. That is &quot;Superiority Conceit,&quot; and
    it has its counterpart in the &quot;Inferiority Conceit&quot;
    of the unsuccessful person, and the &quot;Equality
    Conceit&quot; of the man who says &quot;I'm as good as
    you.&quot; With the underlying implication &quot;And a good
    deal better!&quot; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;A feeling of superiority is a very pleasant mental
    state, but it is essentially <strong><i>akusala</i></strong>
    -- unhealthy and unskilled, highly dangerous in its results. </p>
    <p>Any conceit that arises in connection with the practice of
    Dhamma is much to be deplored. This sometimes occurs when
    students are making good progress in their studies. Some
    queer experience or flash of &quot;insight&quot; is assumed
    to be a sign of virtue or an advance towards Higher
    Consciousness, and the student, instead of checking up on his
    experience with a wise teacher, jumps to the conclusion that
    he is half-way to being an Arahant. We do well to remember
    that no two people have exactly the same experience in regard
    to meditation practice. This was recognized in the Buddha's
    own day: Sariputta was revered for his wisdom, and Moggallana
    for his psychic powers, but both were venerated as
    &quot;Great Beings.&quot; </p>
    <p>Conceit is very prone to arise when one is praised for
    some particular work or mental quality. Within limits praise
    from a knowledgeable person is stimulating and encouraging;
    some people who are modest or diffident by nature can only
    work well when they are appreciated. The trouble is that too
    much praise, particularly if it borders on flattery,
    stimulates the sense of &quot;I&quot;-ness. The ego sticks
    out its chest and feels two inches taller; it has a delicious
    feeling of security and believes itself to be invulnerable! </p>
    <p>This is the nasty sort of pride that the ancient Greeks
    called <strong><i>hubris</i></strong>; it was looked upon as
    an insult to the gods, and when the Olympians found a man
    suffering from it they unloosed Nemesis, the goddess of
    revenge, who brought him to death or destruction. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;The cultivation of humility is not easy; there's a
    temptation to indulge in mock-modesty, and untruthfully
    disclaim any real achievement, and still worse to be
    conceited about not being conceited. It is wiser, I think, to
    tackle Conceit at its first uprising; if one can do that,
    then Humility will develop in the natural course of events. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;For our comfort we find that much can be done to
    curb the activities of this persistent Mara. Pride has been
    aptly described as the &quot;giant weed.&quot; We may grub up
    a few roots in this life-span, but the thing has already gone
    to seed and will appear in the future. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&quot;One year's seeds, Seven years weeds, &quot;
    say the old gardeners. If we acquire the habit of eradicating
    conceit in this life, the habit will travel on in our
    sankharas and bear good fruit in future lives. </p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><em><strong>&nbsp;Methods:</strong></em></font>
    &nbsp; </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>(1) Recognize Conceit whenever he pops up and <strong><i>name</i></strong>
        him. This as readers will remember is the advise given by
        Nyanaponika Thera in his valuable articles in
        &quot;Sangha.&quot; Mara, like Satan, hates to be
        recognized. This practice is doubly effective because it
        &quot;keeps one on one's toes,&quot; and induces a real
        dislike of the tendency. </p>
        <p>(2) Get back to the first two &quot;steps&quot; of the
        Noble Eightfold Path: (a) Right Understanding of the
        mental quality or capacity involved: to see according to
        reality &quot;This (quality) is not mine; I am not this;
        there is no self in it&quot;; (b) Right Aspiration
        towards the expunging of Conceit. In the Discourse on
        Expunging (Majjh. Nik. I.8) we read &quot;Now I say that
        the arising of thoughts is very helpful in regard to
        skilled states of mind. Therefore the thought should
        arise 'Others may be harmful; as to this we will not be
        harmful' and so on for all our evil propensities. Others
        may be conceited; but we as to this will not be
        conceited.'&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The method of analysis is also helpful. &quot;I&quot; am
    being praised for some real or imagined virtue, say
    generosity. Generosity is non- greed (<strong><i>alobha</i></strong>)
    one of the Good Roots, and as such appears in the list of
    dharmas given in the Abhidharma philosophy. According to
    Mahayana &quot;All dharmas are empty of own-being&quot; --
    that is to say they are non- existent. Therefore
    &quot;I&quot; am being praised for something which doesn't
    exist. This is so absurd that it knocks the bottom out of my
    conceit. </p>
    <p>Alternatively &quot;I&quot; am the result of past kamma.
    My talents are not due to my own virtue, but have arisen on
    account of the skilled actions performed by vanished
    personalities whose kammic descendant &quot;I&quot; am.
    Therefore it is silly of me to be conceited about qualities
    which are not in any real sense &quot;mine.&quot; </p>
    <p>Again and again in the suttas we find the expression
    &quot;Thus must you train...&quot; This is Buddhist mental
    culture: it is Right or Supreme Effort to put down unskilled
    mental states and prevent them rising in the future, and
    furthermore to encourage the arising of skilled states. </p>
    <p>A word of warning may not be out of place here. It is
    inadvisable to dwell too much on our so-obvious faults. By
    unwisely reflecting on them we encourage them to root
    themselves still more firmly in our unconscious (i.e our <i>sankharas</i>).
    Instead remember the advice of Paul the Apostle
    &quot;Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are
    honest... whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are
    of good report; if there be any virtue, if there be any
    praise, <i>think on these things</i>.&quot; We as Buddhists
    have the Buddha Dhamma to think about -- &quot;lovely in the
    beginning, lovely in the middle, lovely in the ending.&quot;
    This as Dr. Henn Collins has pointed out is the true
    philosopher's stone whose alchemy will transmute the base
    metal of our ordinary consciousness into the gold of
    Enlightenment. </p>

    <p>Few of us are free from Pride in one form or another. We
    know that in the interests of spiritual development it must
    be killed out. We are taught as much, and accept the teaching
    without question. But the method by which Pride may be
    eliminated is a problem not easy to solve, and the indirect,
    sweeping precepts of the sages are of little practical help
    to us. It is all very well saying: &quot;Kill out this, and
    kill out that,&quot; but what we want to know is, how may we
    go about it? </p>
    <p>In the first place: what <strong><i>is</i></strong> Pride?
    </p>
    <p>Let us call analogy to our aid. Regard pride as a weed,
    propagating itself with alarming fecundity in the garden of
    the mind. Its root is not visible, but the flowering shoots
    are in plain view. Cut down these shoots and either they grow
    again or the roots puts out new ones. The only way to destroy
    it is to dig it up altogether. That root is <strong><i>Self-Esteem</i></strong>.
    From it grow the roots of <strong><i>Conceit, Boastfulness,
    Ambition, Jealousy, Envy and Intolerance</i></strong>. There
    are others, but let us take these six manifestations for the
    sake of discussions. Unbiased, detached self-scrutiny will
    disclose what others may exist in one's own character, and it
    is unlikely that all will be found equally developed. There
    is cause for alarm when we discover them in ourselves. Pride
    is invariably despised when observed in others, yet we
    sometimes boast of possessing it. &quot;I have my pride, you
    know,&quot; is a common assertion. </p>
    <p>Beneath every manifestation of Pride, lies <strong><i>Self-Esteem</i></strong>.
    It is the conviction of superiority over others -- the
    feeling that we are what they are not, or that we can do what
    they cannot do. Successes in early childhood may sow the
    seeds of it. The praise of relatives fosters it. Once
    planted, it grows, and not even the flattening criticism by
    one's own contemporaries in adolescence can stop it. By and
    by it becomes a habit to compare oneself with the people one
    meets or passes in the street, generally to their
    disadvantage. What we know of our own accomplishments is
    measured by what we presume they lack. We think we know our
    friends inside and out, and our judgments are based on a firm
    belief in the infallibility of our perception. There is a
    tendency to group those who are not obviously outstanding
    under the heading of &quot;Ordinary People,&quot; and
    sometimes to place them in the inferior category for no more
    reason than that they look as if they belong there. How often
    we hear the remark: &quot;He seems so ordinary, but when you
    get to know him there's a lot in him!&quot; We are surprised
    to see our spot judgement wrong -- that there really is
    something in that very ordinary-looking person. Can we
    honestly claim to be free of this habit of automatically
    comparing others with our own ideas of ourselves? If so, then
    <strong><i>Self-Esteem</i></strong> is not present. </p>
    <p>It would be bad enough if Pride flourished in no more then
    <strong><i>Self-Esteem</i></strong>, but it must manifest
    itself in every way it can. It strives to show on the
    surface, which is perhaps just as well, for then it becomes
    obvious. <strong><i>Conceit</i></strong>, first shoot of the
    weed Pride, is <strong><i>Self-Esteem</i></strong>
    manifesting in visible form. Not content with merely feeling
    superior to the people around us, we show it in our bearing.
    A glance from some passer-by of the opposite sex may be
    interpreted as a look of approval. The fine figure reflected
    in the shop window as we pass engenders a feeling of warm
    satisfaction. Smart clothes, we believe, do justice to our
    carriage. We may not be so tall as that person over yonder,
    but we have a more distinguished look. No one would pick out
    any one of them in a crowd, but all can see we are different.
    Crude, isn't it? But that is the way <strong><i>Conceit</i></strong>
    affects us, and its crudity is indeed shocking when
    self-analysis brings us face to face with it. Inspired by a
    consciousness of a desire for Truth, our minds turn the
    searchlight of enquiry inwards upon our own characters, and
    then there dawns the realization that <strong><i>Conceit</i></strong>
    has been part of us for as long as we remember. Formerly, we
    would have angrily denied the charge of being conceited. Now
    we see that it is well founded. Our &quot;apartness,&quot;
    our treasured &quot;individuality,&quot; is plainly one of
    its aspects. </p>
    <p><strong><i>Conceit</i></strong> has grown without its
    presence being suspected, and an even more dangerous and
    disgusting shoot has sprung up beside it. This is <strong><i>Boastfulness</i></strong>
    -- <strong><i>Self-Esteem'</i></strong><i>s</i> oral
    manifestation. One of our national conventions is the taboo
    on bragging, and the idea of voicing a plain, undisguised
    boast would shock us as much as it would disgust the
    conventional listener. a very admirable convention too -- but
    it by no means eliminates <strong><i>Boastfulness</i></strong>,
    for there are other ways of boasting, and as long as the <strong><i>desire</i></strong>
    to call attention to oneself exists, that particular
    ramification of Pride is a danger. We can get others to boast
    for us. We can also impress them (particulary our relations)
    that they sing our praises to others. In this way we gain
    more than were it to come from ourselves, and run no risk of
    its incurring disagreeable criticism. We can seek publicity
    and, once gained, declaim it. We may artfully bring a
    conversation round to a point at which we
    &quot;modestly&quot; have to admit to something we are really
    proud of. It takes a certain amount of courage to probe one's
    own secret heart and bring to light some of the many ways in
    which we who sincerely believe ourselves to be guiltless can
    actually indulge in <strong><i>Boastfulness</i></strong>. It
    is one of the most persistent roots of the weed of Pride, and
    the most dangerous because so frequently overlooked. </p>
    <p>There are two kinds of <strong><i>Ambition</i></strong>.
    There is <strong><i>Wrong Ambition</i></strong>, and <strong><i>Right
    Ambition</i></strong>. One is based on <strong><i>Self-Esteem</i></strong>;
    the other is free of any taint of it. <strong><i>Wrong
    Ambition</i></strong> is the desire to excel or succeed in
    order to enhance one's standing -- one's reputation. It is
    the urge to achieve with the object of &quot;putting the
    other chap's eye out!&quot; In its more acceptable, and
    therefore more insidious aspect, it is the will to gain
    admiration and respect -- to become, in fact, a worldly
    &quot;success,&quot; which nearly always means a financial
    success. Confident of our great worth, we cannot be satisfied
    until repeated success have called the attention of others to
    it. We feel that wealth is a concrete recognition of it. </p>
    <p><strong><i>Right Ambition</i></strong>, on the other hand,
    is above itself. It is the will to succeed, not for the
    gratification of self-esteem, but to further achievement for
    its own sake. The painter who strives to express adequately
    the idea inspiring him -- the poet who seeks to express an
    emotion as it has never been expressed -- the craftsman ever
    intent on bettering his achievement -- all are followers of <strong><i>Right
    Ambition</i></strong>. Their &quot;selves&quot; are
    forgotten. They work as instruments, and they feel that in
    the expression of their art is little personal, but rather a
    universal power whose tools they are. Noblest ambition of all
    is the desire to achieve an objective of disinterested
    service to one's fellow creatures, whether human or animal.
    it is sometimes gratifying to learn how many of us have this
    objective. </p>
    <p><strong><i>Jealousy</i></strong> might be defined as the
    resentment felt against another for competing at the same
    level. Note that it is <strong><i>at the same level</i></strong>
    that competition begets jealousy. An admission of inferiority
    by the other will quickly banish the jealousy we may feel
    against him. Those we admit to be our superiors do not arouse
    our jealousy. It is a bestial emotion, but one that
    undoubtedly had its uses in our passage through the lives in
    the Instinctive Mind, for it was an aid to our survival.
    Carried over into the influence of Intellect it has no place,
    and puts a drag on our upward progress. He who is at one
    moment the object of our jealousy, is regarded with affection
    once that jealousy has been smothered. What may has served us
    for the conservation of the means of life when we existed in
    a lower condition is now no more than a vehicle for Pride's
    manifestation, and its redundancy is obvious the moment the
    reason has torn Jealousy's red veil from the perception. We
    know it is useless, and long to rid ourselves of it. We seem
    to succeed, and then conditions come about favorable to its
    reappearance, and the unwelcome pangs are felt again.
    Remember, then, that it is a shoot of <strong><i>Self-Esteem</i></strong>
    and until that root has been killed out the shoot may be
    beaten down only to blossom again. </p>
    <p>We joke about <strong><i>Envy</i></strong>, and are
    inclined to look on it as less despicable than Jealousy, its
    near relative. Think about it -- think over and around it --
    define it to yourself -- get to know it. When the nature of
    an unpleasant thing is known, it is less to be dreaded. With
    all these ramifications of the weed of Pride the same
    approach can be recommended. Define them to yourself. Figure
    out what they are and how much you are subject to their
    influence. <strong><i>Envy</i></strong> can be called the
    resentment felt against another for possessing that which one
    values and does not posses oneself. It may be only a gentle
    resentment sometimes, but is dangerous nevertheless, for it
    may become fierce. Underlying it is the feeling, &quot;Why
    should he have it, and not I?&quot; <strong><i>Self-Esteem</i></strong>
    is outraged. </p>
    <p>Then there is <strong><i>Intolerance</i></strong>.
    Sometimes it is the only form of Pride we are subject to. It
    is often the most robust shoot of the whole plant. It springs
    directly from <strong><i>Self-Esteem</i></strong>, for it is
    a refusal to accept anything that conflicts with our own
    ideas. It is to brand as wrong all that to us is not right. <strong><i>Intolerance</i></strong>
    causes us to condemn a person for doing that with which we
    disagree, but let him do just what we would do ourselves and
    -- here is what is so unreasonable -- a feeling of jealousy
    may be aroused. Pride sweeps us first one way, then another.
    There is no keeping our feet when once in its grasp. Don't
    expect Pride to be in any way &quot;reasonable,&quot; for it
    wilts and disappears in the light of reason, its greatest
    foe. </p>
    <p>We are repeatedly being asked: &quot;Why carry the burden
    of Pride? Throw it aside! It is so much relief to rid
    yourselves of its weight and know the lightness of
    freedom!&quot; We feel inclined to retort: &quot; That's all
    very well, but <strong><i>how</i></strong> can we get rid of
    it? We know we must, but we don't know how to begin!&quot; </p>
    <p>The sickle which can cut down these roots is Reason --
    calm reflection -- Meditation. Make it your task for a few
    weeks to give up half an hour daily for reasoning it out, and
    the results may amaze you. Look at yourself, as it were, from
    outside. Be honest with yourself, in making a searching
    examination to determine how Pride is manifesting through
    you, for fair self-analysis is in itself a powerful weapon to
    use against it. Classify those manifestations. Reason them
    out. Do they make sense? In your everyday life try and form
    the habit of watching with interest to spot each of Pride's
    several shoots as it appears, and once a week spend a
    meditation hour in asking yourself for a detailed report of
    every one noted. Form a picture in your mind of the perfect
    character, and compare your own character with it. For
    example, say to your self: &quot;Now, I think there was an
    inclination to boast in my remark to Mrs. So-and-so at tea
    yesterday. How would the Ideal Being have acted under the
    circumstances?&quot; Or again: &quot;Would the Ideal Being
    have considered himself superior in bearing to those ugly
    people I passed in such-and-such a street? Of course not! He
    would have been above that.&quot; The power of standing apart
    from, and criticizing, the Ego who is subject to Pride,
    allows you to find satisfaction in adverse criticism from
    others. Whereas formerly you felt bitter if ridiculed or put
    &quot;in the wrong,&quot; it now amuses you, for you see what
    good medicine it is for the Self you desire to set free. When
    others treat you with intolerance, welcome it, for they are
    doing you a favor by striking direct at your own intolerance.
    Seek those things which formerly aroused in you the pangs of
    Envy or Jealousy. Find pleasure in feeling that other self
    hurt by them, knowing that the wounds are suffered by the
    false Ego -- Pride -- and not by the real You. It will not be
    long before the pain is gone, and then you will have a good
    laugh at the memory of that squirming demon who fled
    surprised and vanquished. </p>
    <p>We who are subject to Conceit dread ridicule. Cease to
    dread it. When we see the wicked caricatures, or witness
    those vivid mimicries of ourselves, it is for us to welcome
    them, for they are aiding us materially in the conquest of
    Pride. So also, to hear ourselves belittled is an antidote
    for Boastfulness. When we do, there is no need to hide a
    raging heart behind a sickly smile. Once we have learned the
    trick of standing apart from ourselves these things can no
    longer hurt. </p>
    <p>But beat down the shoots of Pride as we may, we cannot be
    free from the weed until the root has gone. It is right to
    prevent the shoots from thriving. Destroy them by all means.
    But Pride will persist in making its appearance until <i>Self-Esteem</i>
    is rooted out -- and to accomplish that is the hardest job of
    all! </p>
    <p>Here is a tip that may perhaps be of service. Try and form
    the habit of supposing every passer-by on whom the thoughts
    rest to be possessed of at least one attribute superior to
    your own. Think to yourself: &quot;This creature isn't much
    to look at, but I'll bet she is far more even-tempered than I
    am!&quot; Look at that rather foppish young man whose
    appearance used to annoy you, and think: &quot;All the same,
    in a pinch he would show far greater physical courage than
    I.&quot; Cease to regard the large, loud-mouthed person as
    empty-headed, and think instead: &quot;He's probably far
    cleverer with his hands than I.&quot; We are all learning our
    lessons in Life's school-room. Some are more advanced than us
    in one thing, and behind us in others. The person who cannot
    resist the temptation to gratify the senses may nevertheless
    be a good angel to others in need of help. The thief may be
    an actual hero. If we consistently regard others as
    possessing at least one of those desirable characteristics we
    ourselves are striving for, we are actually admitting our
    inferiority, and <strong><i>Self-Esteem</i></strong> suffers
    a staggering blow. Remember that <strong><i>Self-Esteem</i></strong>
    is a habit, and just as a habit must be acquired, so may it
    be abandoned. We are not born with it. We cultivate it by
    regarding ourselves as superior to others in some particular
    thing -- later in more things -- ultimately in everything.
    Kill it out by recognizing the superiority of others in some
    way. Credit them with that superiority, even though you don't
    know they possess it. <strong><i>Self-Esteem</i></strong>
    will die for lack of nourishment, and one day will come the
    first joyful realization that there is no Him nor Her nor
    You, but that we are all one. You need not fear going too far
    and acquiring an &quot;inferiority complex.&quot; Your eyes
    will be open, and what you will find is True Humility. </p>
