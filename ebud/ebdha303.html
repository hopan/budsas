      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">W</FONT>hen we started out this voyage 
      together, I invited you to join me on the journey of a mystic, to set foot 
      in a boat unfamiliar to you, a vessel whose dimensions none of you knew, 
      and to let it drift out to sea without really knowing where you were 
      going; to face the unknown with an open heart, without any apparent 
      support, with no promise of anything. Just the way ahead, the way within, 
      an internal voyager who leaves the pleasures of the world, and dives down 
      deep into the recesses of his or her own heart-body-mind, alone.<P>As we 
      embarked on that inner journey, we resolved to use right mindfulness as 
      our compass, to bring careful attention, astute observation and clear 
      seeing to the witness of the present moment; and to be ready to meet any 
      hindrance or obstacle that should arise in our path with that awakened 
      awareness and purity of presence. Such a practice asks of us a deep 
      commitment, perseverance and &quot;fanatical patience&quot;, to constantly come 
      back, time and time again to this moment.</P>
      <P>We live in a society in which we&#39;re so used to being satisfied quickly, 
      getting what we want, and being in control of things. But it just doesn&#39;t 
      work in this practice. We have to have the faith, the willingness to 
      surrender to the present moment, and in so doing, to be annihilated, to be 
      burned, to go into the fire of the mind without wanting it not to hurt and 
      just to sit there. We enter into a spiritual holocaust.</P>
      <P>I find that a very poignant expression because most of my relatives 
      were killed during World War II. My father told me the story of how my 
      grandfather was given the chance to save himself because he was a builder 
      and his skills were needed. But, he chose to go with his family. He went 
      to his death holding his little granddaughter in his arms. I consider that 
      act of courageous surrender for the love of one&#39;s family incredibly 
      heroic.</P>
      <P>Recently I read the diaries of Ettie Hillesum, a brilliant young Dutch 
      woman who died in Auschwitz. She was only 29. While sharing her very 
      intimate moments of prayer and struggle through a life torn apart in 
      monstrous ways, she traces the journey of the mystic that each one of us 
      has undertaken, the way beyond all mental and physical affliction into the 
      realm of the timeless, the deathless: <I><B>I have looked at our 
      destruction, our miserable end, straight in the eye and accepted it into 
      my life. And I continue to grow from day to day, even with death staring 
      me in the face. For my life has become extended by death... Living and 
      dying, sorrow and joy, the blisters on my feet and the jasmine behind the 
      house, the persecution, the unspeakable horrors - it is all as one in me, 
      and I accept it all as one mighty whole.</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>Ettie exhorts us not to waste energy on fear of death, or the refusal 
      to acknowledge its inevitability, to accept death into our lives not 
      through resignation or bitterness but by <B><I>bowing to the inevitable... 
      by looking death straight in the eye... sustained by the certain knowledge 
      that ultimately they cannot rob us of anything that matters.</P>
      <P>We must surrender all that is dearest to us in the enjoyment of the 
      senses and go through a dark night in which we live without their help and 
      comfort. Then when this is accomplished, we have to sacrifice even our 
      thoughts and our choices, and undergo a still darker night - deprived of 
      our familiar supports. This is a kind of death... and when all has been 
      strained away, our emptiness will be filled with a new presence</I>. --
      </B>&quot;An Interrupted Life and Letters from Westerbork&quot; by Ettie Hillesum, 
      translated by Arnold J. Pomerans</P>
      <P>In this burning of the &#39;self&#39; or the ego, we too, are asked, with clear 
      presence of mind, with courage and surrender, to give ourselves completely 
      to the unknown. We know nothing about this unknown, this unpredictable 
      moment except that meeting it with full awareness and acceptance is a 
      wholesome thing to do. And as soon as we can step toward this moment, the 
      only moment we have, with heroic surrender, we are tasting peace.</P>
      <P>We are here to learn this same alchemy of the heart. We&#39;re not asked to 
      do anything unwise or harmful, we are not asked to commit suicide or to 
      annihilate ourselves, but just to learn to die to ourselves. It is not a 
      physical death but it is a spiritual dying that brings us fully to life 
      now - moment by courageous moment. For in dying to the present moment, we 
      let go all expectation and hope, all fear and desire, all sense of self 
      and personal history - this kind of death is a true self-emptying; and it 
      is, in fact, our redemption.</P>
      <P>Coming here was an act of courage, to contemplate death and make 
      dedications to our parents, children, friends, who have died in tragic or 
      distressing ways; or to those who live in pain with AIDS, cancer, 
      Alzheimer&#39;s, paralysis, mental illness, or abuse. In the face of such 
      affliction in our own lives or in the lives of our family members and 
      friends, it is natural for us to feel devastating grief, bereavement, such 
      a darkness in the heart that is anything but peaceful. So in the face of 
      such devastating loss and pain, is it possible to know peace? Can we enter 
      the fire of our suffering, and allow it to burn inside of us without being 
      burned?</P>
      <P>Ettie had endured physical and mental abuse of the worst kind. But she 
      did not allow herself to indulge in hatred or resentment for her abusers, 
      nor did she did lose her dignity as a human being even when there was 
      nothing in her world to hope for beyond her suffering. All she could do 
      was take refuge in herself.</P>
      <P>This way of responding to life and death resonate with the teachings of 
      the Buddha. In the suttas, we read the Buddha&#39;s instructions to his 
      disciples in times of calamity or distress, and the ways that they used 
      the Dhamma to transform their suffering, through insight knowledge and 
      understanding.</P>
      <P>We see an example of this in Venerable Ananda. He was an experienced 
      bhikkhu who had long been devoted to the Triple Gem, serving as the 
      Buddha&#39;s personal attendant and frequently called upon to give discourses 
      on the teachings. But after the Venerable Sariputta passed away, Ananda 
      lamented his death so deeply that he felt &quot;almost as if he had fallen into 
      an abyss&quot;. And while he was in this state, he could not even find the 
      strength in Dhamma to bear his overwhelming feeling of loss. It was only 
      when the Blessed One consoled him and asked him if Sariputta&#39;s death could 
      take away Ananda&#39;s virtue, wisdom, liberation or knowledge of liberation 
      that Ananda&#39;s grief was assuaged.</P>
      <P>Like Ananda, we must realise that our own suffering, the loss of our 
      loved ones, even facing our own extinction, does not diminish the noble 
      qualities in us. We must bring forth the reflection on the inevitability 
      of death, <I><B>All that is mine beloved and pleasing will become 
      otherwise, will become separated from me</B></I> (Dasadhamma Sutta, AN 10) 
      and seek refuge in ourselves, in no one else, to be our own <I><B>island 
      and refuge</B>.</I> (SN 47:13).</P>
      <P>In the story of Kisagotami, this teaching is beautifully brought to 
      life. She had married into a wealthy family, in spite of her poverty and 
      unattractive appearance and finally won the acceptance of her in-laws when 
      she bore a little son. Suddenly, the child died. Nothing could be more 
      tragic for Kisagotami. She refused to accept that her little son was dead. 
      In her desperation, she came to see the Buddha, cradling the infant in her 
      arms, believing that the Blessed One could revive him.</P>
      <P>The Buddha asked her to procure a small quantity of mustard seeds from 
      a house where no one had ever died. When she could find no household that 
      had been spared death&#39;s unremitting hand, the insight into the 
      impermanence of all conditioned phenomena arose in her mind. And so, 
      Kisagotami was able to go beyond <I><B>the death of sons</B></I>, beyond 
      sorrow. (SN.&nbsp;5)</P>
      <P>One of the most heart-rending accounts of how personal tragedy can lead 
      to insight into anicca and spiritual awakening concerns the beautiful 
      young Patacara, who also lived at the time of the Buddha. Born to a 
      wealthy merchant family of Savatthi, she eloped at a young age with her 
      lover to avoid a marriage arranged by her over-protective parents. Fearing 
      the wrath of Patacara&#39;s father, the young couple settled in a remote area.</P>
      <P>On two different occasions Patacara became pregnant, and both times, in 
      spite of her husband&#39;s unwillingness to accompany her, the head-strong 
      young woman secretly set off on her own for Savatthi, hoping that the 
      birth of her child would soften her parents&#39; hearts and bring about a 
      reconciliation. Each time, her husband pursued and found her. On the first 
      occasion, the child&#39;s birth en route precipitated their return before 
      reaching Savatthi.</P>
      <P>But the second journey led to a sries of calamitous events. First, 
      Patacara had to endure the hardship of bearing her child in a raging storm 
      without shelter or support. The next morning she discovered her husband&#39;s 
      body; he had died from snake-bite while looking for materials to protect 
      them from the storm. Then, as she struggled on alone in the direction of 
      Savatthi, her new born was snatched up in the talons of a hawk and carried 
      away, and within moments, her firstborn son accidentally drowned in the 
      swollen currents of a river they were trying to cross. And finally, when 
      she reached Savatthi, exhausted and stricken with grief, Patacara learned 
      that her parents and brother had just perished in a fire that destroyed 
      the family home.</P>
      <P>By the time Patacara appeared before the Blessed One, she was nearly 
      mad with grief and despair. Recognising her readiness to hear the Dhamma, 
      and out of compassion for her, the Buddha taught her about the dangers of 
      samsara:</P>
      <B><I>
      <P>Do not be troubled any more. You have come to one who is able to be 
      your shelter and refuge. It is not only today that you have met with 
      calamity and disaster, but throughout this beginning-less round of 
      existence, weeping over the loss of sons and others dear to you, you have 
      shed more tears than the waters of the four oceans.</P>
      <P>The four oceans contain but a little water<BR>
      Compared to all the tears we have shed,<BR>
      Smitten by sorrow, bewildered by pain.<BR>
      Why, O woman are you still heedless?</I><BR>
      -- </B><I>Dhammapada Commentary 2:268; Buddhist Legends, 2:255 (quoted in 
      Great Disciples of the Buddha, edited by Bhikkhu Bodhi)</P>
      </I>
      <P>She soon realised with penetrating insight the nature of all 
      conditioned things, that they arise, they cease, and in their cessation 
      there is peace.</P>
      <P>After her acceptance into the bhikkhuni order, we learn of Patacara&#39;s 
      deepening realisations through her poetry. She vividly compares the 
      streams of water flowing down a slope to the different life-spans of human 
      beings. Some streams drain into the sand very soon on the descent, others 
      more slowly, while some reach the bottom of the slope and then sink into 
      the earth. And so with beings of this realm, some live only a few years, 
      some to mid-life, and others even to old age, but each one eventually 
      succumbs to death. (Therigatha 112-116)</P>
      <P>The final moment of her awakening is portrayed in a memorable poem:</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>Then I took a lamp</B><BR>
      <B>and went into my cell,</B><BR>
      <B>checked the bed,</B><BR>
      <B>and sat down on it.</B><BR>
      <B>I took a needle</B><BR>
      <B>and pushed the wick down.</B><BR>
      <BR>
      <B>When the lamp went out,</B><BR>
      <B>my mind was freed.</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>From this seeing into the true essence of all conditioned phenomena, we 
      realise three universal qualities: in the arising of all conditions, we 
      see anicca, impermanence, that which is death-bound or has the sign of 
      death, and which ultimately points us toward the signless or deathless. 
      These temporal conditions also dissolve and pass away; thus we know the 
      dukkha of being propelled by desire, the unsatisfactoriness of the 
      conditioned realm, and we are brought to the knowledge of the timeless, 
      the desireless. Finally, in the cessation of these transient conditions 
      there is peace, emptiness, no self to be found, anatta.</P>
      <P>We are also urged to contemplate our kamma and the relentless wheel of 
      samsara. At one time the Blessed One asks a man lamenting his father&#39;s 
      death: <I><B>For which father are you grieving, the father of this life, 
      or the last life, or the life before that. For if one wanted to grieve, 
      then it would be just as well to grieve for the other fathers too. </B>--</I><B>
      </B>Jataka&nbsp;352</P>
      <P>As you contemplate these teachings, ask yourselves: Who is it that 
      dies? Who is abused? Who grieves? What are we identified with - the body, 
      feelings, perceptions, mental fabrications, thoughts, and memories? Where 
      is our true refuge? Is there shelter in that which is impermanent? As soon 
      as we identify with and attach to desire, to the conditioned, then we are 
      seeking safety, refuge in things that die, not in the deathless.</P>
      <P>There are two kinds of death for the living, one that leads to death 
      and one that leads to peace, to enlightenment. When we carry around a lot 
      of wreckage in the mind, we are not putting down the burden. We are 
      identifying with and caught in self-view, &quot;I am an abused person&quot; or &quot;a 
      grief-stricken person&quot;, or &quot;Five of my friends have died from AIDS and I 
      just can&#39;t face life.&quot; That&#39;s a death that leads to death.</P>
      <P>But if we can meet the present moment with mindfulness and wise 
      reflection, we can begin to put down that burden, surrender it, and allow 
      ourselves to receive the next moment with purity of mind, letting the 
      conditions that arise and our attachment to them die. That kind of death 
      leads to enlightenment.</P>
      <P>If we are not aware, we are as if dead, and we live in fear of death. 
      As Socrates said, <I><B>Those who love wisdom practice dying all the time 
      and death to them is the least terrible thing in the world.</B></I> The 
      fearless mind is the mind of the mystic voyager, the mind that sees life 
      the way it really is, holding each moment in its gaze, witnessing this 
      arising and ceasing of tempest, of agony, of fear, of the darkest night 
      and turning each one to the light to be redefined and revealed to us, and 
      then to end, to cease.</P>
      <P>This practice is not to condone our suffering, but to question our 
      assumptions, to allow moral indignation when there are wrongs, to accept 
      our humanity. So we feel the pain of illness, the burden of stigma, the 
      loss of the loved, the fear of death, and yet, we fully receive life with 
      merciful awareness. No matter how much suffering life brings us, we can 
      always return to that still point of knowing, to a serene abiding in the 
      centre of life&#39;s storms, a safe harbour.</P>
      <P>And like Patacara, Kisagotami or Ettie, in dying to our pain, to our 
      grief, to our hatred, to our fear... letting them go at their own rhythm, 
      not forcibly, not trying to control or get rid of them, we begin to see 
      them as natural conditions arising due to causes. We know their nature, 
      their origin, their ending, and the way to their dissolution. Rather than 
      something dark and to be feared, death becomes a resurrection, an inner 
      illumination, like &quot;the sun awakening the lotus&quot;.</P>
      <P>By coming here, you may have expected that you would figure out how to 
      get rid of the terrible grief or fear that you&#39;re feeling, or how to 
      overcome death. Actually, it&#39;s not about getting rid of anything. We enter 
      the eternal just by dropping our illusions and our assumptions, offering 
      ourselves to the moment, and standing at the brink of the world with the 
      courage not to cling to anything or anyone.</P>
      <P>What would it be like if we never got old? What if we never got sick, 
      or if we never died? Could we really love each other if we were here 
      forever? Through our own mortality we learn to love, through our darkest 
      suffering, we are taken beyond suffering, and being exposed to our own 
      extinction, we can realise that within us which is indestructible.</P>
      <P>Trusting each moment, even in the midst of the most terrifying 
      conditions, we awaken in ourselves the possibility to live with complete 
      trust. We grow more vulnerable and, at the same time, more fearless, not 
      taking refuge in sorrow. We learn how to live, and how to die, and how to 
      embrace our joy and our pain.</P>
      <P>We heard of the atrocities happening in Kosova, with so many innocent 
      people being mutilated to death. It seems to go on in every generation, 
      every century. Purity and wholesomeness are so needed in this world. Be 
      earth, air, fire, water, the elements. Be that mystic traveller diving for 
      the pearls of wisdom in your heart. Then your actions can spring from an 
      awakened awareness, each moment of pure seeing conditioning the next. This 
      purity of view is able to contemplate defilement in the mind, to know 
      sorrow as that which takes us to suffering; to understand that which is 
      noble in the mind and, to be totally committed to it.</P>
      <P>This then is our pilgrimage, not just during the retreat, but even when 
      you leave this sanctuary and go back to your daily lives, sustain that 
      ardour and that total commitment to free yourselves, and to bless the 
      world.</P>
      <P>As Ettie wrote: <I><B>You must be able to bear your sorrow, even if it 
      seems to crush you. You will be able to stand up again, for human beings 
      are so strong, and your sorrow must become an integral part of yourself. 
      You mustn&#39;t run away from it. Do not relieve your feeling through hatred. 
      Give your sorrow all the space and shelter in yourself that is its due, 
      for if everyone bears grief honestly and courageously, the sorrow that now 
      fills the world will abate.</B></I> </P>
