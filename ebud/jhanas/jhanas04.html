        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In this chapter we will survey the higher states of
        jhana. First we will discuss the remaining three jhanas
        of the fine-material sphere, using the descriptive
        formulas of the suttas as our starting point and the
        later literature as our source for the methods of
        practice that lead to these attainments. Following this
        we will consider the four meditative states that pertain
        to the immaterial sphere, which come to be called the
        immaterial jhanas. Our examination will bring out the
        dynamic character of the process by which the jhanas are
        successively achieved. The attainment of the higher
        jhanas of the fine-material sphere, we will see, involves
        the successive elimination of the grosser factors and the
        bringing to prominence of the subtler ones, the
        attainment of the formless jhanas the replacement of
        grosser objects with successively more refined objects.
        From our study it will become clear that the jhanas link
        together in a graded sequence of development in which the
        lower serves as basis for the higher and the higher
        intensifies and purifies states already present in the
        lower. We will end the chapter with a brief look at the
        connection between the jhanas and the Buddhist teaching
        of rebirth. </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>The Higher Fine-material
        Jhanas</strong></font> </p>
        <p>The formula for the attainment of the <strong>second
        jhana</strong> runs as follows: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>With the subsiding of applied thought and
            sustained thought he enters and dwells in the second
            jhana, which has internal confidence and unification
            of mind, is without applied thought and sustained
            thought, and is filled with rapture and happiness
            born of concentration (M.i,181; Vbh. 245) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The second jhana, like the first, is attained by
        eliminating the factors to be abandoned and by developing
        the factors of possession. In this case however, the
        factors to be abandoned are the two initial factors of
        the first jhana itself, applied thought and sustained
        thought; the factors of possession are the three
        remaining jhana factors, rapture, happiness and
        one-pointedness. Hence the formula begins &quot;with the
        subsiding of applied thought and sustained thought,&quot;
        and then mentions the jhana's positive endowments. </p>
        <p>After achieving the five kinds of mastery over the
        first jhana, a meditator who wishes to reach the second
        jhana should enter the first jhana and contemplate its
        defects. These are twofold: one, which might be called
        the defect of proximate corruption, is the nearness of
        the five hindrances, against which the first jhana
        provides only a relatively mild safeguard; the other
        defect, inherent to the first jhana, is its inclusion of
        applied and sustained thought, which now appear as gross,
        even as impediments needing to be eliminated to attain
        the more peaceful and subtle second jhana. </p>
        <p>By reflecting upon the second jhana as more tranquil
        and sublime than the first, the meditator ends his
        attachment to the first jhana and engages in renewed
        striving with the aim of reaching the higher stage. He
        directs his mind to his meditation subject -- which must
        be one capable of inducing the higher jhanas such as a
        kasina or the breath -- and resolves to overcome applied
        and sustained thought. When his practice comes to
        maturity the two kinds of thought subside and the second
        jhana arises. In the second jhana only three of the
        original five jhana factors remain -- rapture, happiness,
        and one-pointedness. Moreover, with the elimination of
        the two grosser factors these have acquired a subtler and
        more peaceful tone. [1] </p>
        <p>Besides the main jhana factors, the canonical formula
        includes several other states in its description of the
        second jhana. &quot;Internal confidence&quot;
        (ajjhattamsampasadanam), conveys the twofold meaning of
        faith and tranquillity. In the first jhana the
        meditator's faith lacked full clarity and serenity due to
        &quot;the disturbance created by applied and sustained
        thought, like water ruffled by ripples and wavelets&quot;
        (Vism. 157; PP.163). But when applied and sustained
        thought subside, the mind becomes very peaceful and the
        meditator's faith acquires fuller confidence. </p>
        <p>The formula also mentions unification of mind (cetaso
        ekodibhavam), which is identified with one-pointedness or
        concentration. Though present in the first jhana,
        concentration only gains special mention in connection
        with the second jhana since it is here that it acquires
        eminence. In the first jhana concentration was still
        imperfect, being subject to the disturbing influence of
        applied and sustained thought. For the same reason this
        jhana, along with its constituent rapture and happiness,
        is said to be born of concentration (samadhijam):
        &quot;It is only this concentration that is quite worthy
        to be called 'concentration' because of its complete
        confidence and extreme immobility due to absence of
        disturbance by applied and sustained thought&quot;
        (Vism.158; PP.164). </p>
        <p>To attain the <strong>third jhana</strong> the
        meditator must use the same method he used to ascend from
        the first jhana to the second. He must master the second
        jhana in the five ways, enter and emerge from it, and
        reflect upon its defects. In this case the defect of
        proximate corruption is the nearness of applied and
        sustained thought, which threaten to disrupt the serenity
        of the second jhana; its inherent defect is the presence
        of rapture, which now appears as a gross factor that
        should be discarded. Aware of the imperfections in the
        second jhana, the meditator cultivates indifference
        towards it and aspires instead for the peace and
        sublimity of the third jhana, towards the attainment of
        which he now directs his efforts. When his practice
        matures he enters the third jhana, which has the two
        jhana factors that remain when the rapture disappears,
        happiness and one-pointedness, and which the suttas
        describe as follows: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>With the fading away of rapture, he dwells in
            equanimity, mindful and discerning; and he
            experiences in his own person that happiness of which
            the noble ones say: 'Happily lives he who is
            equanimous and mindful' -- thus he enters and dwells
            in the third jhana. (M.i,182; Vbh.245) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The formula indicates that the third jhana contains,
        besides its two defining factors, three additional
        components not included among the jhana factors:
        equanimity, mindfulness and discernment. Equanimity is
        mentioned twice. The Pali word for equanimity, upekkha,
        occurs in the texts with a wide range of meanings, the
        most important being neutral feeling -- that is, feeling
        which is neither painful nor pleasant -- and the mental
        quality of inner balance or equipoise called
        &quot;specific neutrality&quot; (tatramajjhattata -- see
        Vism.161; PP.167). The equanimity referred to in the
        formula is a mode of specific neutrality which belongs to
        the aggregate of mental formations (sankharakkhandha) and
        thus should not be confused with equanimity as neutral
        feeling. Though the two are often associated, each can
        exist independently of the other, and in the third jhana
        equanimity as specific neutrality co-exists with
        happiness or pleasant feeling. </p>
        <p>The meditator in third jhana is also said to be
        mindful and discerning, which points to another pair of
        frequently conjoined mental functions. Mindfulness
        (sati), in this context, means the remembrance of the
        meditation object, the constant bearing of the object in
        mind without allowing it to float away. Discernment
        (sampajanna) is an aspect of wisdom or understanding
        which scrutinizes the object and grasps its nature free
        from delusion. Though these two factors were already
        present even in the first two jhanas, they are first
        mentioned only in connection with the third since it is
        here that their efficacy becomes manifest. The two are
        needed particularly to avoid a return to rapture. Just as
        a suckling calf, removed from its mother and left
        unguarded, again approaches the mother, so the happiness
        of jhana tends to veer towards rapture, its natural
        partner, if unguarded by mindfulness and discernment
        (Dhs. A.219). To prevent this and the consequent loss of
        the third jhana is the task of mindfulness and
        discernment. </p>
        <p>The attainment of the <strong>fourth jhana</strong>
        commences with the aforesaid procedure. In this case the
        meditator sees that the third jhana is threatened by the
        proximity of rapture, which is ever ready to swell up
        again due to its natural affinity with happiness; he also
        sees that it is inherently defective due to the presence
        of happiness, a gross factor which provides fuel for
        clinging. He then contemplates the state where equanimous
        feeling and one-pointedness subsist together -- the
        fourth jhana -- as far more peaceful and secure than
        anything he has so far experienced, and therefore as far
        more desirable. Taking as his object the same counterpart
        sign he took for the earlier jhana, he strengthens his
        efforts in concentration for the purpose of abandoning
        the gross factor of happiness and entering the higher
        jhana. When his practice matures the mind enters
        absorption into the fourth jhana: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with
            the previous disappearance of joy and grief, he
            enters and dwells in the fourth jhana, which has
            neither-pain-nor-pleasure and has purity of
            mindfulness due to equanimity. (M.i,182; Vbh.245) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The first part of this formula specifies the
        conditions for the attainment of this jhana -- also
        called the neither-painful-nor-pleasant liberation of
        mind (M.i, 296) -- to be the abandoning of four kinds of
        feeling incompatible with it, the first two signifying
        bodily feelings, the latter two the corresponding mental
        feelings. The formula also introduces several new terms
        and phrases which have not been encountered previously.
        First, it mentions a new feeling,
        neither-pain-nor-pleasure (adukkhamasukha), which remains
        after the other four feelings have subsided. This kind of
        feeling also called equanimous or neutral feeling,
        replaces happiness as the concomitant feeling of the
        jhana and also figures as one of the jhana factors. Thus
        this attainment has two jhana factors: neutral feeling
        and one-pointedness of mind. Previously the ascent from
        one jhana to the next was marked by the progressive
        elimination of the coarser jhana factors, but none were
        added to replace those which were excluded. But now, in
        the move from the third to the fourth jhana, a
        substitution occurs, neutral feeling moving in to take
        the place of happiness. </p>
        <p>In addition we also find a new phrase composed of
        familiar terms, &quot;purity of mindfulness due to
        equanimity&quot; (upekkhasatiparisuddhi). The Vibhanga
        explains: &quot;This mindfulness is cleared, purified,
        clarified by equanimity&quot; (Vbh. 261), and Buddhaghosa
        adds: &quot;for the mindfulness in this jhana is quite
        purified, and its purification is effected by equanimity,
        not by anything else&quot; (Vism.167; PP.174). The
        equanimity which purifies the mindfulness is not neutral
        feeling, as might be supposed, but specific neutrality,
        the sublime impartiality free from attachment and
        aversion, which also pertains to this jhana. Though both
        specific neutrality and mindfulness were present in the
        lower three jhanas, none among these is said to have
        &quot;purity of mindfulness due to equanimity.&quot; The
        reason is that in the lower jhanas the equanimity present
        was not purified itself, being overshadowed by opposing
        states and lacking association with equanimous feeling.
        It is like a crescent moon which exists by day but cannot
        be seen because of the sunlight and the bright sky. But
        in the fourth jhana, where equanimity gains the support
        of equanimous feeling, it shines forth like the crescent
        moon at night and purifies mindfulness and the other
        associated states (Vism. 169; PP.175). </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>The Immaterial Jhanas </strong></font></p>
        <p>Beyond the four jhanas lie four higher attainments in
        the scale of concentration, referred to in the suttas as
        the &quot;peaceful immaterial liberations transcending
        material form&quot; (santa vimokkha atikammarupe aruppa,
        M.i,33). In the commentaries they are also called the
        immaterial jhanas, and while this expression is not found
        in the suttas it seems appropriate in so far as these
        states correspond to jhanic levels of consciousness and
        continue the same process of mental unification initiated
        by the original four jhanas, now sometimes called the
        fine-material jhanas. The immaterial jhanas are
        designated, not by numerical names like their
        predecessors, but by the names of their objective
        spheres: <strong>the base of boundless space</strong>, <strong>the
        base of boundless consciousness</strong>, <strong>the
        base of nothingness</strong>, and <strong>the base of
        neither-perception-nor-non-perception</strong>. [2] They
        receive the designation &quot;immaterial&quot; or &quot;
        formless&quot; (arupa) because they are achieved by
        surmounting all perceptions of material form, including
        the subtle form of the counterpart sign which served as
        the object of the previous jhanas, and because they are
        the subjective correlates of the immaterial planes of
        existence. </p>
        <p>Like the fine-material jhanas follow a fixed sequence
        and must be attained in the order in which they are
        presented. That is, the meditator who wishes to achieve
        the immaterial jhanas must begin with the base of
        boundless space and then proceed step by step up to the
        base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. However,
        an important difference separates the modes of progress
        in the two cases. In the case of the fine-material
        jhanas, the ascent from one jhana to another involves a
        surmounting of jhana factors. To rise from the first
        jhana to the second the meditator must eliminate applied
        thought and sustained thought, to rise from the second to
        the third he must overcome rapture, and to rise from the
        third to the fourth he must replace pleasant with neutral
        feeling. Thus progress involves a reduction and
        refinement of the jhana factors, from the initial five to
        the culmination in one-pointedness and neutral feeling. </p>
        <p>Once the fourth jhana is reached the jhana factors
        remain constant, and in higher ascent to the immaterial
        attainments there is no further elimination of jhana
        factors. For this reason the formless jhanas, when
        classified from the perspective of their factorial
        constitution as is done in the Abhidhamma, are considered
        modes of the fourth jhana. <strong>They are all
        two-factored jhanas, constituted by one-pointedness and
        equanimous feeling</strong>. </p>
        <p>Rather than being determined by a surmounting of
        factors, the order of the immaterial jhanas is determined
        by a surmounting of objects. Whereas for the lower jhanas
        the object can remain constant but the factors must be
        changed, for the immaterial jhanas the factors remain
        constant while the objects change. The base of boundless
        space eliminates the kasina object of the fourth jhana,
        the base of boundless consciousness surmounts the object
        of the base of boundless space, the base of nothingness
        surmounts the object of base of boundless consciousness,
        and the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception
        surmounts the objects the object of the base of
        nothingness. </p>
        <p>Because the objects become progressively more subtle
        at each level, the jhana factors of equanimous feeling
        and one-pointedness, while remaining constant in nature
        throughout, become correspondingly more refined in
        quality. Buddhaghosa illustrates this with a simile of
        four pieces of cloth of the same measurements, spun by
        the same person, yet made of thick, thin, thinner and
        very thin thread respectively (Vism. 339; PP.369). Also,
        whereas the four lower jhanas can each take a variety of
        objects -- the ten kasinas, the in-and-out breath, etc.
        -- and do not stand in any integral relation to these
        objects, the four immaterial jhanas each take a single
        object inseparably related to the attainment itself. The
        first is attained solely with the base of boundless space
        as object, the second with the base of boundless
        consciousness, and so forth. </p>
        <p>The motivation which initially leads a meditator to
        seek the immaterial attainments is a clear recognition of
        the dangers inherent in material existence: it is in
        virtue of matter that injuries and death by weapons and
        knives occur that one is afflicted with diseases, subject
        of hunger and thirst, while none of this takes place on
        the immaterial planes of existence (M.i,410). Wishing to
        escape these dangers by taking rebirth in the immaterial
        planes, the meditator must first attain the four
        fine-material jhanas and master the fourth jhana with any
        kasina as object except the omitted space kasina. By this
        much the meditator has risen above gross matter, but he
        still has not transcended the subtle material form
        comprised by the luminous counterpart sign which is the
        object of his jhana. To reach the formless attainments
        the meditator, after emerging from the fourth jhana, must
        consider that even that jhana, as refined as it is, still
        has an object consisting in material form and thus is
        distantly connected with gross matter; moreover, it is
        close to happiness, a factor of the third jhana, and is
        far coarser than the immaterial states. The meditator
        sees the base of boundless space, the first immaterial
        jhana, as more peaceful and sublime than the fourth
        fine-material jhana and as more safely removed from
        materiality. </p>
        <p>Following these preparatory reflections, the meditator
        enters the fourth jhana based on a kasina object and
        extends the counterpart sign of the kasina &quot;to the
        limit of the world-sphere, or as far as he likes.&quot;
        Then, after emerging from the fourth jhana, he must
        remove the kasina by attending exclusively to the space
        it has been made to cover without attending to the kasina
        itself. Taking as his object the space left after the
        removal of the kasina, the meditator adverts to it as
        &quot;boundless space&quot; or simply as &quot;space,
        space,&quot; striking at it with applied and sustained
        thought. As he cultivates this practice over and over,
        eventually the consciousness pertaining to the base of
        boundless space arises with boundless space as its object
        (Vism. 327-28; PP.355-56). </p>
        <p>A meditator who has gained mastery over the base of
        boundless space, wishing to attain as well the second
        immaterial jhana, must reflect upon the two defects of
        the first attainment which are its proximity to the
        fine-material jhanas and its grossness compared to the
        base of boundless consciousness. Having in this way
        developed indifferent to the lower attainment, he must
        next enter and emerge from the base of boundless space
        and then fix his attention upon the consciousness that
        occurred there pervading the boundless space. Since the
        space taken as the object by the first formless jhana was
        boundless, the consciousness of that space also involves
        an aspect of boundlessness, and it is to this boundless
        consciousness that the aspirant for the next attainment
        adverts. He is not to attend to it merely as boundless,
        but as &quot;boundless consciousness&quot; or simply as
        &quot;consciousness.&quot; He continues to cultivate this
        sign again and again until the consciousness belonging to
        the base of boundless consciousness arises in absorption
        taking as its object the boundless consciousness
        pertaining to the first immaterial state (Vism. 331-32;
        PP.360-61). </p>
        <p>To attain the next formless state, the base of
        nothingness, the meditator who has mastered the base of
        boundless consciousness must contemplate its defects in
        the same twofold manner and advert to the superior
        peacefulness of the base of nothingness. Without giving
        any more attention to the base of boundless
        consciousness, he should &quot;give attention to the
        present non-existence, voidness, secluded aspect of that
        same past consciousness belonging to the base consisting
        of boundless space&quot; (Vism. 333; PP.362). In other
        words, the meditator is to focus upon the present absence
        or non-existence of the consciousness belonging to the
        base of boundless space, adverting to it over and over
        thus: &quot;There is not, there is not&quot; or
        &quot;void, void&quot;. When his efforts fructify there
        arises in absorption a consciousness belonging to the
        base of nothingness, with the non-existence of the
        consciousness of boundless space as its object. Whereas
        the second immaterial state relates to the consciousness
        of boundless space positively, by focusing upon the
        content of that consciousness and appropriating its
        boundlessness, the third immaterial state relates to it
        negatively, by excluding that consciousness from
        awareness and making the absence or present non-existence
        of that consciousness its object. </p>
        <p>The fourth and final immaterial jhana, the base of
        neither-perception-nor-non-perception, is reached through
        the same preliminary procedure. The meditator can also
        reflect upon the unsatisfactoriness of perception,
        thinking: &quot;Perception is a disease, perception is a
        boil, perception is a dart ... this is peaceful, this is
        sublime, that is to say,
        neither-perception-nor-non-perception&quot; (M.ii,231).
        In this way he ends his attachment to the base of
        nothingness and strengthens his resolve to attain the
        next higher stage. He then adverts to the four mental
        aggregates that constitute the attainment of the base of
        nothingness -- its feeling, perception, mental formations
        and consciousness -- contemplating them as
        &quot;peaceful, peaceful,&quot; reviewing that base and
        striking at it with applied and sustained thought. As he
        does so the hindrances are suppressed, the mind passes
        through access and enters the base of
        neither-perception-nor-non-perception. </p>
        <p>This jhana receives its name because, on the one hand,
        it lacks gross perception with its function of clearly
        discerning objects, and thus cannot be said to have
        perception; on the other, it retains a very subtle
        perception, and thus cannot be said to be without
        perception. Because all the mental functions are here
        reduced to the finest and most subtle level, this jhana
        is also named the attainment with residual formations. At
        this level the mind has reached the highest possible
        development in the direction of pure serenity. It has
        attained the most intense degree of concentration,
        becoming so refined that consciousness can no longer be
        described in terms of existence or non-existence. Yet
        even this attainment, from the Buddhist point of view, is
        still a mundane state which must finally give way to
        insight that alone leads to true liberation. </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>The Jhanas and Rebirth</strong></font>
        </p>
        <p>Buddhism teaches that all sentient beings in whom
        ignorance and craving still linger are subject to rebirth
        following death. Their mode of rebirth is determined by
        their kamma, their volitional action, wholesome kamma
        issuing in a good rebirth and unwholesome kamma in a bad
        rebirth. As a kind of wholesome kamma the attainment of
        jhana can play a key role in the rebirth process, being
        considered a weighty good kamma which takes precedence
        over other lesser kammas in determining the future
        rebirth of the person who attains it. </p>
        <p>Buddhist cosmology groups the numerous planes of
        existence into which rebirth takes place into three broad
        spheres each of which comprises a number of subsidiary
        planes. The sense-sphere (kamadhatu) is the field of
        rebirth for evil deeds and for meritorious deeds falling
        short of the jhanas; the fine-material sphere
        (rupadhatu), the field of rebirth for the fine-material
        jhanas; and the immaterial sphere (arupadhatu), the field
        of rebirth for the immaterial jhanas. </p>
        <p>An unwholesome kamma, should it become determinative
        of rebirth, will lead to a new existence in one of the
        four planes of misery belonging to the sense-sphere: the
        hells, the animal kingdom, the sphere of afflicted
        spirits, or the host of titans. A wholesome kamma of a
        subjhanic type produces rebirth in one of the seven happy
        planes in the sense-sphere, the human world or the six
        heavenly worlds. </p>
        <p>Above the sense-sphere realms are the fine-material
        realms, into which rebirth is gained only through the
        attainment of the fine-material jhanas. The sixteen
        realms in this sphere are hierarchically ordered in
        correlation with the four jhanas. Those who have
        practiced the first jhana to a minor degree are reborn in
        the Realm of the Retinue of Brahma, to a moderate degree
        in the Realm of the Ministers of Brahma, and to a
        superior degree in the Realm of the Great Brahma. [3]
        Similarly, practicing the second jhana to a minor degree
        brings rebirth in the Realm of Minor Lustre, to a
        moderate degree in the Realm of Infinite Lustre, and to a
        superior degree the Realm of Radiant Lustre. [4] Again,
        practicing the third jhana to a minor degree brings
        rebirth in the Realm of Minor Aura, to a moderate degree
        in the Realm of Infinite Aura, and to a superior degree
        in the Realm of Steady Aura. [5] </p>
        <p>Corresponding to the fourth jhana there are seven
        realms: the Realm of Great Reward, the Realm of
        Non-percipient Beings, and the five Pure Abodes.[6] With
        this jhana the rebirth pattern deviates from the former
        one. It seems that all beings who practice the fourth
        jhana of the mundane level without reaching any
        supramundane attainment are reborn in the realm of Great
        Reward. There is no differentiation by way of inferior,
        moderate or superior grades of development. The Realm of
        Non-percipient Beings is reached by those who, after
        attaining the fourth jhana, then use the power of their
        meditation to take rebirth with only material bodies;
        they do not acquire consciousness again until they pass
        away from this realm. The five Pure Abodes are open only
        to non-returners (anagamis), noble disciples at the
        penultimate stage of liberation who have eradicated the
        fetters binding them to the sense-sphere and thence
        automatically take rebirth in higher realms, where they
        attain arahatship and reach final deliverance. </p>
        <p>Beyond the fine-material sphere lie the immaterial
        realms, which are four in number -- the base of boundless
        space, the base of boundless consciousness, the base of
        nothingness, and the base of
        neither-perception-nor-non-perception. As should be
        evident, these are realms of rebirth for those who,
        without having broken the fetters that bind them to
        samsara, achieve and master one or another of the four
        immaterial jhanas. Those mediators who have mastery over
        a formless attainment at the time of death take rebirth
        in the appropriate plane, where they abide until the
        kammic force of the jhana is exhausted. Then they pass
        away, to take rebirth in some other realm as determined
        by their accumulated kamma. [7] </p>
        <p><em><strong>Notes:<br>
        </strong></em>[1] Based on the distinction between
        applied and sustained thought, the Abhidhamma presents a
        fivefold division of the jhanas obtained by recognizing
        the sequential rather than simultaneous elimination of
        the two kinds of thought. On this account a meditator of
        duller faculties eliminates applied thought first and
        attains a second jhana with four factors including
        sustained thought, and a third jhana identical with the
        second jhana of the fourfold scheme. In contrast a
        meditator of sharp faculties comprehends quickly the
        defects of both applied and sustained thought and so
        eliminates them both at once. <br>
