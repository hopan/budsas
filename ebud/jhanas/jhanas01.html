        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>The Doctrinal Context of
        Jhana </strong></font></p>
        <p>The Buddha says that just as in the great ocean there
        is but one taste, the taste of salt, so in his doctrine
        and discipline there is but one taste, the taste of
        freedom. The taste of freedom that pervades the Buddha's
        teaching is the taste of spiritual freedom, which from
        the Buddhist perspective means freedom from suffering. In
        the process leading to deliverance from suffering,
        meditation is the means of generating the inner awakening
        required for liberation. The methods of meditation taught
        in the Theravada Buddhist tradition are based on the
        Buddha's own experience, forged by him in the course of
        his own quest for enlightenment. They are designed to
        re-create in the disciple who practices them the same
        essential enlightenment that the Buddha himself attained
        when he sat beneath the Bodhi tree, the awakening to the
        Four Noble Truths. </p>
        <p>The various subjects and methods of meditation
        expounded in the Theravada Buddhist scriptures -- the
        Pali Canon and its commentaries -- divide into two
        inter-related systems. One is called the development of
        serenity (samathabhavana), the other the development of
        insight (vipassanabhavana). The former also goes under
        the name of development of concentration
        (samadhibhavana), the latter the development of wisdom
        (pannabhavana). The practice of serenity meditation aims
        at developing a calm, concentrated, unified mind as a
        means of experiencing inner peace and as a basis for
        wisdom. The practice of insight meditation aims at
        gaining a direct understanding of the real nature of
        phenomena. Of the two, the development of insight is
        regarded by Buddhism as the essential key to liberation,
        the direct antidote to the ignorance underlying bondage
        and suffering. Whereas serenity meditation is recognized
        as common to both Buddhist and non-Buddhist contemplative
        disciplines, insight meditation is held to be the unique
        discovery of the Buddha and an unparalleled feature of
        his path. However, because the growth of insight
        presupposes a certain degree of concentration, and
        serenity meditation helps to achieve this, the
        development of serenity also claims an incontestable
        place in the Buddhist meditative process. Together the
        two types of meditation work to make the mind a fit
        instrument for enlightenment. With his mind unified by
        means of the development of serenity, made sharp and
        bright by the development of insight, the meditator can
        proceed unobstructed to reach the end of suffering,
        Nibbana. </p>
        <p>Pivotal to both systems of meditation, though
        belonging inherently to the side of serenity, is a set of
        meditative attainments called the jhanas. Though
        translators have offered various renderings of this word,
        ranging from the feeble &quot;musing&quot; to the
        misleading &quot;trance&quot; and the ambiguous
        &quot;meditation,&quot; we prefer to leave the word
        untranslated and to let its meaning emerge from its
        contextual usages. From these it is clear that the jhanas
        are states of deep mental unification which result from
        the centering of the mind upon a single object with such
        power of attention that a total immersion in the object
        takes place. The early suttas speak of four jhanas, named
        simply after their numerical position in the series: the
        first jhana, the second jhana, the third jhana and the
        forth jhana. In the suttas the four repeatedly appear
        each described by a standard formula which we will
        examine later in detail. </p>
        <p>The importance of the jhanas in the Buddhist path can
        readily be gauged from the frequency with which they are
        mentioned throughout the suttas. The jhanas figure
        prominently both in the Buddha's own experience and in
        his exhortation to disciples. In his childhood, while
        attending an annual ploughing festival, the future Buddha
        spontaneously entered the first jhana. It was the memory
        of this childhood incident, many years later after his
        futile pursuit of austerities, that revealed to him the
        way to enlightenment during his period of deepest
        despondency (M.i, 246-47). After taking his seat beneath
        the Bodhi tree, the Buddha enter the four jhanas
        immediately before direction his mind to the threefold
        knowledge that issued in his enlightenment (M.i.247-49).
        Throughout his active career the four jhanas remained
        &quot;his heavenly dwelling&quot; (D.iii,220) to which he
        resorted in order to live happily here and now. His
        understanding of the corruption, purification and
        emergence in the jhanas and other meditative attainments
        is one of the Tathagata's ten powers which enable him to
        turn the matchless wheel of the Dhamma (M.i,70). Just
        before his passing away the Buddha entered the jhanas in
        direct and reverse order, and the passing away itself
        took place directly from the fourth jhana (D.ii,156). </p>
        <p>The Buddha is constantly seen in the suttas
        encouraging his disciples to develop jhana. The four
        jhanas are invariably included in the complete course of
        training laid down for disciples. [1] They figure in the
        training as the discipline of higher consciousness
        (adhicittasikkha), right concentration (sammasamadhi) of
        the Noble Eightfold Path, and the faculty and power of
        concentration (samadhindriya, samadhibala). Though a
        vehicle of dry insight can be found, indications are that
        this path is not an easy one, lacking the aid of the
        powerful serenity available to the practitioner of jhana.
        The way of the jhana attainer seems by comparison
        smoother and more pleasurable (A.ii,150-52). The Buddha
        even refers to the four jhanas figuratively as a kind of
        Nibbana: he calls them immediately visible Nibbana,
        factorial Nibbana, Nibbana here and now (A.iv,453-54). </p>
        <p>To attain the jhanas, the meditator must begin by
        eliminating the unwholesome mental states obstructing
        inner collectedness, generally grouped together as the
        five hindrances (pancanivarana): sensual desire, ill
        will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry and
        doubt.[2] The mind's absorption on its object is brought
        about by five opposing mental states -- applied thought,
        sustained thought, rapture, happiness and one pointedness
        [3] -- called the jhana factors (jhanangani) because they
        lift the mind to the level of the first jhana and remain
        there as its defining components. </p>
        <p>After reaching the first jhana the ardent meditator
        can go on to reach the higher jhanas, which is done by
        eliminating the coarser factors in each jhana. Beyond the
        four jhanas lies another fourfold set of higher
        meditative states which deepen still further the element
        of serenity. These attainments (aruppa), are the base of
        boundless space, the base of boundless consciousness, the
        base of nothingness, and the base of
        neither-perception-nor-non-perception.[4] In the Pali
        commentaries these come to be called the four immaterial
        jhanas (arupajhana), the four preceding states being
        renamed for the sake of clarity, the four fine-material
        jhanas (rupajhana). Often the two sets are joined
        together under the collective title of the eight jhanas
        or the eight attainments (atthasamapattiyo). </p>
        <p>The four jhanas and the four immaterial attainments
        appear initially as mundane states of deep serenity
        pertaining to the preliminary stage of the Buddhist path,
        and on this level they help provide the base of
        concentration needed for wisdom to arise. But the four
        jhanas again reappear in a later stage in the development
        of the path, in direct association with liberating
        wisdom, and they are then designated the supramundane
        (lokuttara) jhanas. These supramundane jhanas are the
        levels of concentration pertaining to the four degrees of
        enlightenment experience called the supramundane paths
        (magga) and the stages of liberation resulting form them,
        the four fruits (phala). </p>
        <p>Finally, even after full liberation is achieved, the
        mundane jhanas can still remain as attainments available
        to the fully liberated person, part of his untrammeled
        contemplative experience. </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>Etymology of Jhana</strong></font>
        </p>
        <p>The great Buddhist commentator Buddhaghosa traces the
        Pali word &quot;jhana&quot; (Skt. dhyana) to two verbal
        forms. One, the etymologically correct derivation, is the
        verb jhayati, meaning to think or meditate; the other is
        a more playful derivation, intended to illuminate its
        function rather than its verbal source, from the verb
        jhapeti meaning to burn up. He explains: &quot;It burns
        up opposing states, thus it is jhana&quot; (Vin.A. i,
        116), the purport being that jhana &quot;burns up&quot;
        or destroys the mental defilements preventing the
        developing the development of serenity and insight. </p>
        <p>In the same passage Buddhaghosa says that jhana has
        the characteristic mark of contemplation (upanijjhana).
        Contemplation, he states, is twofold: the contemplation
        of the object and the contemplation of the
        characteristics of phenomena. The former is exercised by
        the eight attainments of serenity together with their
        access, since these contemplate the object used as the
        basis for developing concentration; for this reason these
        attainments are given the name &quot;jhana&quot; in the
        mainstream of Pali meditative exposition. However,
        Buddhaghosa also allows that the term &quot;jhana&quot;
        can be extended loosely to insight (vipassana), the paths
        and the fruits on the ground that these perform the work
        of contemplating the characteristics of things the three
        marks of impermanence, suffering and non-self in the case
        of insight, Nibbana in the case of the paths and fruits. </p>
        <p>In brief the twofold meaning of jhana as
        &quot;contemplation&quot; and &quot;burning up&quot; can
        be brought into connection with the meditative process as
        follows. By fixing his mind on the object the meditator
        reduces and eliminates the lower mental qualities such as
        the five hindrances and promotes the growth of the higher
        qualities such as the jhana factors, which lead the mind
        to complete absorption in the object. Then by
        contemplating the characteristics of phenomena with
        insight, the meditator eventually reaches the
        supramundane jhana of the four paths, and with this jhana
        he burns up the defilements and attains the liberating
        experience of the fruits. </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>Jhana and Samadhi</strong></font>
        </p>
        <p>In the vocabulary of Buddhist meditation the word
        &quot;jhana&quot; is closely connected with another word,
        &quot;samadhi&quot; generally rendered by
        &quot;concentration.&quot; Samadhi derives from the
        prefixed verbal root sam-a-dha, meaning to collect or to
        bring together, thus suggesting the concentration or
        unification of the mind. The word &quot;samadhi&quot; is
        almost interchangeable with the word &quot;samatha,&quot;
        serenity, though the latter comes from a different root,
        sam, meaning to become calm. </p>
        <p>In the suttas samadhi is defined as mental
        one-pointedness, (cittass'ekaggata M.i,301) and this
        definition is followed through rigorously in the
        Abhidhamma. The Abhidhamma treats one-pointedness as a
        distinct mental factor present in every state of
        consciousness, exercising the function of unifying the
        mind on its object. From this strict psychological
        standpoint samadhi can be present in unwholesome states
        of consciousness as well as in wholesome an neutral
        states. In its unwholesome forms it is called &quot;wrong
        concentration&quot; (micchasamadhi), In its wholesome
        forms &quot;right concentration&quot; (sammasamadhi). </p>
        <p>In expositions on the practice of meditation, however,
        samadhi is limited to one-pointedness of mind
        (Vism.84-85; PP.84-85), and even here we can understand
        from the context that the word means only the wholesome
        one-pointedness involved in the deliberate transmutation
        of the mind to a heightened level of calm. Thus
        Buddhaghosa explains samadhi etymologically as &quot;the
        centering of consciousness and consciousness concomitants
        evenly and rightly on a single object ... the state in
        virtue of which consciousness and its concomitants remain
        evenly and rightly on a single object, undistracted and
        unscattered&quot; (Vism.84-85; PP.85). </p>
        <p>However, despite the commentator's bid for
        consistency, the word samadhi is used in the Pali
        literature on meditation with varying degrees of
        specificity of meaning. In the narrowest sense, as
        defined by Buddhaghosa, it denotes the particular mental
        factor responsible for the concentrating of the mind,
        namely, one-pointedness. In a wider sense it can signify
        the states of unified consciousness that result from the
        strengthening of concentration, i.e. the meditative
        attainments of serenity and the stages leading up to
        them. And in a still wider sense the word samadhi can be
        applied to the method of practice used to produce and
        cultivate these refined states of concentration, here
        being equivalent to the development of serenity. It is in
        the second sense that samadhi and jhana come closest in
        meaning. The Buddha explains right concentration as the
        four jhanas (D.ii,313), and in doing so allows
        concentration to encompass the meditative attainments
        signified by the jhanas. However, even though jhana and
        samadhi can overlap in denotation, certain differences in
        their suggested and contextual meanings prevent
        unqualified identification of the two terms. First behind
        the Buddha's use of the jhana formula to explain right
        concentration lies a more technical understanding of the
        terms. According to this understanding samadhi can be
        narrowed down in range to signify only one mental factor,
        the most prominent in the jhana, namely, one-pointedness,
        while the word &quot;jhana&quot; itself must be seen as
        encompassing the state of consciousness in its entirety,
        or at least the whole group of mental factors
        individuating that meditative state as a jhana. </p>
        <p>In the second place, when samadhi is considered in its
        broader meaning it involves a wider range of reference
        than jhana. The Pali exegetical tradition recognizes
        three levels of samadhi: preliminary concentration
        (parikammasamadhi), which is produced as a result of the
        meditator's initial efforts to focus his mind on his
        meditation subject; access concentration
        (upacarasamadhi), marked by the suppression of the five
        hindrances, the manifestation of the jhana factors, and
        the appearance of a luminous mental replica of the
        meditation object called the counterpart sign
        (patibhaganimitta); and absorption concentration
        (appanasamadhi), the complete immersion of the mind in
        its object effected by the full maturation of the jhana
        factors.[5] Absorption concentration comprises the eight
        attainments, the four immaterial attainments, and to this
        extent jhana and samadhi coincide. However, samadhi still
        has a broader scope than jhana, since it includes not
        only the jhanas themselves but also the two preparatory
        degrees of concentration leading up to them. Further,
        samadhi also covers a still different type of
        concentration called momentary concentration
        (khanikasamadhi), the mobile mental stabilization
        produced in the course of insight contemplation of the
        passing flow of phenomena. </p>
