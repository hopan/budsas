    <blockquote>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All noble persons, as we saw, acquire supramundane
        jhana along with their attainment of the noble paths and
        fruits. The noble ones at each of the four stages of
        liberation, moreover, have access to the supramundane
        jhana of their respective fruition attainments, from the
        fruition attainment of stream-entry up to the fruition
        attainments of arahatship. It remains problematic,
        however to what extent they also enjoy the possession of
        mundane jhana. To determine an answer to this question we
        will consult an early typology of seven types of noble
        disciples, which provides a more psychologically oriented
        way of classifying the eight noble individuals. A look at
        the explanation of these seven types will enable us to
        see the range of jhanic attainment reached by the noble
        disciples. On this basis we will proceed to assess the
        place of mundane jhana in the early Buddhist picture of
        the arahat, the perfected individual. </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>Seven Types of Disciples
        </strong></font></p>
        <p>The sevenfold typology is originally found in the
        Kitagiri Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya (M.i,477-79) and is
        reformulated in the Puggalapannatti of the Abhidhamma
        Pitaka. This typology classifies the noble persons on the
        paths and fruits into seven types:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>1. the faith-devotee (saddhanusari),<br>
            2. the one liberated by faith (saddhavimutta),<br>
            3. the body-witness (kayasakkhi), <br>
            4. the one liberated in both ways
            (ubhatobhagavimutta),<br>
            5. the truth-devotee ( dhammanusari),<br>
            6. the one attained to understanding (ditthipatta),
            and<br>
            7. the one liberated by wisdom (pannavimutta).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The seven types may be divided into three general
        groups, each defined by the predominance of a particular
        spiritual faculty, The first two types are governed by a
        predominance of faith, the middle two by a predominance
        of concentration, and the last three by a predominance of
        wisdom. To this division, however, certain qualifications
        will have to made as we go along. </p>
        <p>1. <strong>The faith-devotee</strong> is explained the
        sutta thus: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Herein, monks, some person has not reached with
            his own (mental) body those peaceful immaterial
            deliverances transcending material form: nor after
            seeing with wisdom, have his cankers been destroyed.
            [1] But he has a certain degree of faith in the
            Tathagata, a certain degree of devotion to him, and
            he has these qualities -- the faculties of faith,
            energy, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom. This
            person, monks, is called a faith-devotee. (M.i,479) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The Puggalapannatti (p 182) defines the faith-devotee
        from a different angle as a disciple practicing for the
        fruit of stream-entry in whom the faculty of faith is
        predominant and who develops the noble path led by faith.
        It adds that when he is established in the fruit he
        becomes one liberated by faith. Although the sutta
        excluded the &quot;peaceful immaterial attainments,&quot;
        i.e. the four immaterial jhana, from the faith-devotee's
        equipment, this implies nothing with regard to his
        achievement of the four lower mundane jhanas. It would
        seem that the faith-devotee can have previously attained
        any of the four fine-material jhanas before reaching the
        path, and can also be a dry-insight worker bereft of
        mundane jhana. </p>
        <p>2. <strong>The one liberated by faith</strong> is
        strictly and literally defined as a noble disciple at the
        six intermediate levels, from the fruit of stream-entry
        through to the path of arahatship, who lacks the
        immaterial jhanas and has a predominance of the faith
        faculty. </p>
        <p>The Buddha explains the one liberated by faith as
        follows: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Herein, monks, some person has not reached with
            his own (mental) body those peaceful immaterial
            deliverances transcending material form; but having
            seen with wisdom, some of his cankers have been
            destroyed, and his faith in the Tathagata is settled,
            deeply rooted, well established. This person, monks,
            is called one liberated by faith. (M.i,478) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>As in the case of the faith-devotee, the one liberated
        by faith, while lacking the immaterial jhanas, may still
        be an obtainer of the four mundane jhanas as well as a
        dry insight worker. </p>
        <p>The Puggalapnnatti states (pp.184-85) that the person
        liberated by faith is one who understands the Four Noble
        Truths, has seen and verified by means of wisdom the
        teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata, and having seen
        with wisdom has eliminated some of his cankers. However,
        he has not done so as easily as the ditthipatta, the
        person attained to understanding, whose progress is
        easier due to his superior wisdom. The fact that the one
        liberated by faith has destroyed only some of this
        cankers implies that he has advanced beyond the first
        path but not yet reached the final fruit, the fruit of
        arahatship. [2] </p>
        <p>3. <strong>The body-witness </strong>is a noble
        disciple at the six intermediate levels, from the fruit
        of stream-entry to the path of arahatship, who has a
        predominance of the faculty of concentration and can
        obtain the immaterial jhanas. The sutta explanation
        reads: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>And what person, monks is a body-witness? Herein,
            monks, some person has reached with his own (mental)
            body those peaceful immaterial deliverances
            transcending material form, and having seen with
            wisdom, some of his cankers having been destroyed.
            This person, monks, is called a body-witness.
            (M.i,478) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The Puggalapannatti (p. 184) offers a slight variation
        in this phrasing, substituting &quot;the eight
        deliverances&quot; (atthavimokkha) for the sutta's
        &quot;peaceful immaterial deliverances&quot; (santa
        vimokkha aruppa). These eight deliverances consist of
        three meditative attainments pertaining to the
        fine-material sphere (inclusive of all four lower
        jhanas), the four immaterial jhanas, and the cessation of
        perception and feeling (sannavedayitanirodha) -- the last
        a special attainment accessible only to those
        non-returners and arahats who have also mastered the
        eight jhanas. [3] The statement of the Puggalapannatti
        does not mean either that the achievement of all eight
        deliverances is necessary to become a body-witness or
        that the achievement of the three lower deliverances is
        sufficient. What is both requisite and sufficient to
        qualify as a body-witness is the partial destruction of
        defilements coupled with the attainment of at least the
        lowest immaterial jhana. Thus the body witness becomes
        fivefold by way of those who obtain any of the four
        immaterial jhanas and the one who also obtains the
        cessation of perception and feeling. </p>
        <p>4. <strong>One who is liberated in both ways </strong>is
        an arahat who has completely destroyed the defilements
        and possesses the immaterial attainments. The
        commentaries explain the name &quot;liberated in both
        ways&quot; as meaning &quot;through the immaterial
        attainment he is liberated from the material body and
        through the path (of arahatship) he is liberated from the
        mental body&quot; (MA.ii,131). The sutta defines this
        type of disciple thus: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>And what person, monks, is liberated in both ways?
            Herein, monks, someone has reached with his own
            (mental) body those peaceful immaterial deliverances
            transcending material form, and having seen with
            wisdom, his cankers are destroyed. This person,
            monks, is called liberated in both ways. (M.i,477) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The Puggalapannatti (p.184) gives basically the same
        formula but replaces &quot;immaterial deliverances&quot;
        with &quot;the eight deliverances.&quot; The same
        principle of interpretation that applied to the
        body-witness applies here: the attainment of any
        immaterial jhana, even the lowest, is sufficient to
        qualify a person as both-ways liberated. As the
        commentary to the Visuddhimagga says: &quot;One who has
        attained arahatship after gaining even one [immaterial
        jhana] is liberated both ways&quot; (Vism.T.ii,466). This
        type becomes fivefold by way of those who attain
        arahatship after emerging from one or another of the four
        immaterial jhanas and the one who attains arahatship
        after emerging from the attainment of cessation
        (MA:iii,131). </p>
        <p>5. <strong>The truth-devotee</strong> is a disciple on
        the first path in whom the faculty of wisdom is
        predominant. The Buddha explains the truth-devotee as
        follows: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Herein, monks, some person has not reached with
            his own (mental) body those peaceful immaterial
            deliverances transcending material form; nor, after
            seeing with wisdom, have his cankers been destroyed.
            But the teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata are
            accepted by him through mere reflection, and he has
            these qualities -- the faculties of faith, energy,
            mindfulness, concentration and wisdom. This person,
            monks, is called a truth-devotee. (M.i,479) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The Puggalapannatti (p.185) defines the truth-devotee
        as one practicing for realization of the fruit of
        stream-entry in whom the faculty of wisdom is
        predominant, and who develops the path led by wisdom. It
        adds that when a truth-devotee is established in the
        fruit of stream-entry he becomes one attained to
        understanding, the sixth type. The sutta and Abhidhamma
        again differ as to emphasis, the one stressing lack of
        the immaterial jhanas, the other the ariyan stature.
        Presumably, he may have any of the four fine-material
        jhanas or be a bare-insight practitioner without any
        mundane jhana. </p>
        <p>6. <strong>The one attained to understanding</strong>
        is a noble disciple at the six intermediate levels who
        lacks the immaterial jhanas and has a predominance of the
        wisdom faculty. The Buddha explains: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>And what person, monks, is the one attained to
            understanding? Herein, monks someone has not reached
            with his own mental body those peaceful immaterial
            deliverances transcending material form, but having
            seen with wisdom some of his cankers are destroyed,
            and the teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata have
            been seen and verified by him with wisdom. This
            person, monks, is called the one attained to
            understanding. (M.i,478) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The Puggalapannatti (p.185) defines the one attained
        to understanding as a person who understands the Four
        Noble Truths, has seen and verified by means of wisdom
        the teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata, and having
        seen with wisdom has eliminated some of his cankers. He
        is thus the &quot;wisdom counterpart&quot; of the one
        liberated by faith, but progresses more easily than the
        latter by virtue of his sharper wisdom. Like his
        counterpart, he may possess any of the four mundane
        jhanas or may be a dry-insight worker. </p>
        <p>7. <strong>The one liberated by wisdom</strong> is an
        arahat who does not obtain the immaterial attainments. In
        the words of the sutta: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>And what person, monks, is the one liberated by
            wisdom? Herein, monks, someone has not reached with
            his own (mental) body those peaceful material
            deliverances transcending material form, but having
            seen with wisdom his cankers are destroyed. This
            person, monks, is called one liberated by wisdom.
            (M.i,477-78) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The Puggalapannatti's definition (p.185) merely
        replaces &quot;immaterial deliverance&quot; with
        &quot;the eight deliverances.&quot; Though such arahats
        do not reach the immaterial jhanas it is quite possible
        for them to attain the lower jhanas. The sutta commentary
        in fact states that the one liberated by wisdom is
        fivefold by way of the dry-insight worker and the four
        who attain arahatship after emerging from the four
        jhanas. </p>
        <p>It should be noted that the one liberated by wisdom is
        contrasted not with the one liberated by faith, but with
        the one liberated in both ways. The issue that divides
        the two types of arahat is the lack or possession of the
        four immaterial jhanas and the attainment of cessation.
        The person liberated by faith is found at the six
        intermediate levels of sanctity, not at the level of
        arahatship. When he obtains arahatship, lacking the
        immaterial jhanas, he becomes one liberated by wisdom
        even though faith rather that wisdom is his predominant
        faculty. Similarly, a meditator with predominance of
        concentration who possesses the immaterial attainments
        will still be liberated in both ways even if wisdom
        rather than concentration claims first place among his
        spiritual endowments, as was the case with the venerable
        Sariputta. </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>Jhana and the Arahat </strong></font></p>
        <p>From the standpoint of their spiritual stature the
        seven types of noble persons can be divided into three
        categories. The first, which includes the faith-devotee
        and the truth-devotee, consists of those on the path of
        stream-entry, the first of the eight noble individuals.
        The second category, comprising the one liberated by
        faith, the body-witness and the one attained to
        understanding, consists of those on the six intermediate
        levels, from the stream-enterer to one on the path of
        arahatship. The third category, comprising the one
        liberated in both ways and the one liberated by wisdom,
        consists only of arahats. [4] </p>
        <p>The ubhatobhagavimutta, &quot;one liberated in both
        ways,&quot; and the pannavimutta &quot;one liberated by
        wisdom,&quot; thus form the terms of a twofold typology
        of arahats distinguished on the basis of their
        accomplishment in jhana. The ubhatobhagavimutta arahat
        experiences in his own person the &quot;peaceful
        deliverances&quot; of the immaterial sphere, the
        pannavimutta arahat lacks this full experience of the
        immaterial jhanas. Each of these two types, according to
        the commentaries, again becomes fivefold -- the
        ubhatobhagavimutta by way of those who possess the
        ascending four immaterial jhanas and the attainment of
        cessation, the pannavimutta by way of those who reach
        arahatship after emerging from on of the four
        fine-material jhanas and the dry-insight mediator whose
        insight lacks the support of mundane jhana. </p>
        <p>The possibility of attaining the supramundane path
        without possession of a mundane jhana has been questioned
        by some Theravada scholars, but the Visuddhimagga clearly
        admits this possibility when it distinguishes between the
        path arisen in a dry-insight mediator and the path arisen
        in one who possesses a jhana but does not use it as a
        basis for insight (Vism.666-67; PP.779). Textual evidence
        that there can be arahats lacking mundane jhana is
        provided by the Susima Sutta (S.ii, 199-23) together with
        is commentaries. When the monks in the sutta are asked
        how they can be arahats without possessing supernormal
        powers of the immaterial attainments, they reply:
        &quot;We are liberated by wisdom&quot; (pannavimutta kho
        mayam). The commentary glosses this reply thus: &quot;We
        are contemplatives, dry-insight meditators, liberated by
        wisdom alone&quot; (Mayam nijjhanaka sukkhavipassaka
        pannamatten'eva vimutta ti, SA.ii,117). The commentary
        also states that the Buddha gave his long disquisition on
        insight in the sutta &quot;to show the arising of
        knowledge even without concentration&quot; (vina pi
        samadhimevam nanuppattidassanattham, SA.ii,117). The
        subcommentary establishes the point by explaining
        &quot;even without concentration&quot; to mean &quot;even
        without concentration previously accomplished reaching
        the mark of serenity&quot; (samathalakkhanappattam
        purimasiddhamvina pi samadhin ti), adding that this is
        said in reference to one who makes insight his vehicle
        (ST.ii,125). </p>
        <p>In contrast to the pannavimutta arahats, those arahats
        who are ubhatobhagavimutta enjoy a twofold liberation.
        Through their mastery over the formless attainments they
        are liberated from the material body (rupakaya), capable
        of dwelling in the very life in the meditations
        corresponding to the immaterial planes of existence;
        through their attainment of arahatship they are liberated
        from the mental body (namakaya), presently free from all
        defilements and sure of final emancipation from future
        becoming. Pannavimutta arahats only possess the second of
        these two liberations. </p>
        <p>The double liberation of the ubhatobhagavimutta arahat
        should not be confused with another double liberation
        frequently mentioned in the suttas in connection with
        arahatship. This second pair of liberations, called
        cetovimutti pannavimutti, &quot;liberation of mind,
        liberation by wisdom,&quot; is shared by all arahats. It
        appears in the stock passage descriptive of arahatship:
        &quot;With the destruction of the cankers he here and now
        enters and dwells in the cankerless liberation of mind,
        liberation by wisdom, having realized it for himself with
        direct knowledge.&quot; That this twofold liberation
        belongs to pannavimutta arahats as well as those who are
        ubhatobhagavimutta is made clear by the Putta Sutta,
        where the stock passage is used for two types of arahats
        called the &quot;white lotus recluse&quot; and the
        &quot;red lotus recluse&quot;: </p>

            <p>How, monks, is a person a white lotus recluse
            (samanapundarika)? Here, monks, with the destruction
            of the cankers a monk here and now enters and dwells
            in the cankerless liberation of mind, liberation by
            wisdom, having realized it for himself with direct
            knowledge. Yet he does not dwell experiencing the
            eight deliverances with his body. Thus, monks, a
            person is a white lotus recluse. </p>
            <p>And how, monks, is a person a red lotus recluse
            (samanapaduma)? Here, monks, with the destruction of
            the cankers a monk here and now enters and dwells in
            the cankerless liberation of mind, liberation by
            wisdom, having realized it for himself with direct
            knowledge. And he dwells experiencing the eight
            deliverances with his body. Thus, monks, a person is
            a red lotus recluse. (A.ii,87) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Since the description of these two types coincides
        with that of pannavimutta and ubhatobhagavimutta the two
        pairs may be identified, the white lotus recluse with the
        pannavimutta, the red lotus recluse with the
        ubhatobhagavimutta. Yet the pannavimutta arahat, while
        lacking the experience of the eight deliverances, still
        has both liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom. </p>
        <p>When liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom are
        joined together and described as &quot;cankerless&quot;
        (anasava), they can be taken to indicate two aspects of
        the arahat's deliverance. Liberation of mind signifies
        the release of his mind from craving and its associated
        defilements, liberation by wisdom the release from
        ignorance: &quot;With the fading away of lust there is
        liberation of mind, with the fading away of ignorance
        there is liberation by wisdom&quot; (A.i,61). &quot;As he
        sees and understands thus his mind is liberated from the
        canker of sensual desire, from the canker of existence
        from the canker of ignorance&quot; (M.i,183-84) -- here
        release from the first two cankers can be understood as
        liberation of mind, release from the canker of ignorance
        as liberation by wisdom. In the commentaries
        &quot;liberation of mind&quot; is identified with the
        concentration factor in the fruition attainment of
        arahatship, &quot;liberation by wisdom&quot; with the
        wisdom factor. </p>
        <p>Since every arahat reaches arahatship through the
        Noble Eightfold Path, he must have attained supramundane
        jhana in the form of right concentration, the eighth
        factor of the path, defined as the four jhanas. This
        jhana remains with him as the concentration of the
        fruition attainment of arahatship, which occurs at the
        level of supramundane jhana corresponding to that of his
        path. Thus he always stands in possession of at least the
        supramundane jhana of fruition, called the
        &quot;cankerless liberation of mind.&quot; However, this
        consideration does not reflect back on his mundane
        attainments, requiring that every arahat possess mundane
        jhana. </p>
        <p>Although early Buddhism acknowledges the possibility
        of a dry-visioned arahatship, the attitude prevails that
        jhanas are still desirable attributes in an arahat. They
        are of value not only prior to final attainment, as a
        foundation for insight, but retain their value even
        afterwards. The value of jhana in the stage of
        arahatship, when all spiritual training has been
        completed, is twofold. One concern the arahat's inner
        experience, the other his outer significance as a
        representative of the Buddha's dispensation. </p>
        <p>On the side of inner experience the jhanas are valued
        as providing the arahat with a &quot;blissful dwelling
        here and now&quot; (ditthadhammasukhavihara). The suttas
        often show arahats attaining to jhana and the Buddha
        himself declares the four jhanas to be figuratively a
        kind of Nibbana in this present life (A.iv.453-54). With
        respect to levels and factors there is no difference
        between the mundane jhanas of an arahat and those of a
        non-arahat. The difference concerns their function. For
        non-arahats the mundane jhanas constitute wholesome
        kamma; they are deeds with a potential to produce
        results, to precipitate rebirth in a corresponding realm
        of existence. But in the case of an arahat mundane jhana
        no longer generates kamma. Since he has eradicated
        ignorance and craving, the roots of kamma, his actions
        leave no residue; they have no capacity to generate
        results. For him the jhanic consciousness is a mere
        functional consciousness which comes and goes and once
        gone disappears without a trace. </p>
        <p>The value of the jhanas, however, extends beyond the
        confines of the arahat's personal experience to testify
        to the spiritual efficacy of the Buddha's dispensation.
        The jhanas are regarded as ornamentations of the arahat,
        testimonies to the accomplishment of the spiritually
        perfect person and the effectiveness of the teaching he
        follows. A worthy monk is able to &quot;gain at will
        without trouble or difficulty, the four jhanas pertaining
        to the higher consciousness, blissful dwellings here and
        now.&quot; This ability to gain the jhanas at will is a
        &quot; quality that makes a monk an elder.&quot; When
        accompanied by several other spiritual accomplishments it
        is an essential quality of &quot;a recluse who graces
        recluses&quot; and of a monk who can move unobstructed in
        the four directions. Having ready access to the four
        jhanas makes an elder dear and agreeable, respected and
        esteemed by his fellow monks. Facility in gaining the
        jhanas is one of the eight qualities of a completely
        inspiring monk (samantapasadika bhikkhu) perfect in all
        respects; it is also one of the eleven foundations of
        faith (saddha pada). It is significant that in all these
        lists of qualities the last item is always the attainment
        of arahatship, &quot;the cankerless liberation of mind,
        liberation by wisdom,&quot; showing that all desirable
        qualities in a bhikkhu culminate in arahatship.[5] </p>
        <p>The higher the degree of his mastery over the
        meditative attainments, the higher the esteem in which an
        arahat monk is held and the more praiseworthy his
        achievement is considered. Thus the Buddha says of the
        ubhatobhagavimutta arahat: &quot;There is no liberation
        in both ways higher and more excellent than this
        liberation in both ways&quot;(D.ii,71). </p>
        <p>The highest respect goes to those monks who possess
        not only liberation in both ways but the six abhinnas or
        &quot;super-knowledges&quot;: the exercise of psychic
        powers, the divine ear, the ability to read the minds of
        others, the recollection of past lives, knowledge of the
        death and rebirth of beings, and knowledge of final
        liberation. The Buddha declares that a monk endowed with
        the six abhinnas, is worthy of gifts and hospitality,
        worthy of offerings and reverential salutations, a
        supreme field of merit for the world (A.iii,280-81). In
        the period after the Buddha's demise, what qualified a
        monk to give guidance to others was endowment with ten
        qualities: moral virtue, learning, contentment, mastery
        over the four jhanas, the five mundane abhinnas and
        attainment of the cankerless liberation of mind,
        liberation by wisdom (M.iii,11-12). Perhaps it was
        because he was extolled by the Buddha for his facility in
        the meditative attainments and the abhinnas that the
        venerable Mahakassapa assumed the presidency of the first
        great Buddhist council held in Rajagaha after the
        Buddha's passing away. </p>
        <p>The graduation in the veneration given to arahats on
        the basis of their mundane spiritual achievements implies
        something about the value system of early Buddhism that
        is not often recognized. It suggests that while final
        liberation may be the ultimate and most important value,
        it is not the sole value even in the spiritual domain.
        Alongside it, as embellishments rather than alternatives,
        stand mastery over the range of the mind and mastery over
        the sphere of the knowable. The first is accomplished by
        the attainment of the eight mundane jhanas, the second by
        the attainment of the abhinnas. Together, final
        liberation adorned with this twofold mastery is esteemed
        as the highest and most desirable way of actualizing the
        ultimate goal. </p>

        <p><em><strong>Notes:<br>
        </strong></em>[1] The cankers (asava) are four powerful
        defilements that sustain samsara; sensual desire, desire
        for existence, wrong views and ignorance. <br>
        [2] The Visuddhimagga, however says that arahats in whom
        faith is predominant can also be called &quot;liberated
        by faith&quot; (Vism.659; PP.770). Its commentary points
        out that this statement is intended only figuratively, in
        the sense that those arahats reach their goal after
        having been liberated by faith in the intermediate
        stages. Literally, they would be &quot;liberated by
        wisdom&quot;. (Vism.T.ii,468) <br>
        [3] The first three emancipations are: one possessing
        material form sees material forms; one not perceiving
        material forms internally sees material forms externally;
        and one is released upon the idea of the beautiful. They
        are understood to be variations on the jhanas attained
        with color kasinas. For the attainment of cessation, see
        PP.824-833. <br>
        [4] It should be noted that the Kitagiri Sutta makes not
        provision in its typology for a disciple on the first
        path who gains the immaterial jhanas. Vism.T.(ii,466)
        holds that he would have to be considered either a
        faith-devotee or a truth-devotee, and at the final
        fruition would be one liberated in both ways. <br>
