        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>The Way of Wisdom</strong></font>
        </p>
        <p>The goal of the Buddhist path, complete and permanent
        liberation from suffering, is to be achieved by
        practicing the full threefold discipline of morality
        (sila), concentration (samadhi), and wisdom (panna). The
        mundane jhanas, comprising the four fine-material jhanas
        and the four immaterial jhanas, pertain to the stage of
        concentration, which they fulfill to an eminent degree.
        However, taken by themselves, these states do not ensure
        complete deliverance, for they are incapable of cutting
        off the roots of suffering. The Buddha teaches that the
        cause of suffering, the driving power behind the cycle of
        rebirths, is the defilements with their three unwholesome
        roots -- greed, hatred and delusion. Concentration of the
        absorption level, no matter to what heights it is
        pursued, only suppresses the defilements, but cannot
        destroy their latent seeds. Thence bare mundane jhana,
        even when sustained, cannot by itself terminate the cycle
        of rebirths. To the contrary, it may even perpetuate the
        round. For if any fine-material or immaterial jhana is
        held to with clinging, it will bring about a rebirth in
        that particular plane of existence corresponding to its
        own kammic potency, which can then be followed by rebirth
        in some lower realm. </p>
        <p>What is required to achieve complete deliverance from
        the cycle of rebirths is the eradication of the
        defilements. Since the most basic defilement is ignorance
        (avijja), the key to liberation lies in developing its
        direct opposite, namely wisdom (panna). </p>
        <p>Since wisdom presupposes a certain proficiency in
        concentration it is inevitable that jhana comes to claim
        a place in its development. This place, however, is not
        fixed and invariable, but as we will see allows for
        differences depending on the individual mediator's
        disposition. </p>
        <p>Fundamental to the discussion in this chapter is a
        distinction between two terms crucial to Theravada
        philosophical exposition, &quot;mundane&quot; (lokiya)
        and &quot;supramundane&quot; (lokuttara). The term
        &quot;mundane&quot; applies to all phenomena comprised in
        the world (loka) -- to subtle states of consciousness as
        well as matter, to virtue as well as evil, to meditative
        attainments as well as sensual engrossments. The term
        &quot;supramundane,&quot; in contrast, applies
        exclusively to that which transcends the world, that is
        the nine supramundane states: Nibbana, the four noble
        paths (magga) leading to Nibbana, and their corresponding
        fruits (phala) which experience the bliss of Nibbana. </p>
        <p>Wisdom has the specific characteristic of penetrating
        the true nature of phenomena. It penetrates the
        particular and general features of things through direct
        cognition rather than discursive thought. Its function is
        &quot;to abolish the darkness of delusion which conceals
        the individual essences of states&quot; and its
        manifestation is &quot;non-delusion.&quot; Since the
        Buddha says that one whose mind is concentrated knows and
        sees things as they are, the proximate cause of wisdom is
        concentration (Vism. 438; PP.481). </p>
        <p>The wisdom instrumental in attaining liberation is
        divided into two principal types: insight knowledge
        (vipassananana) and the knowledge pertaining to the
        supramundane paths (magganana). The first is the direct
        penetration of the three characteristics of conditioned
        phenomena -- impermanence, suffering and non-self. [1] It
        takes as its objective sphere the five aggregates
        (pancakkhandha) -- material form, feeling perception,
        mental formations and consciousness. Because insight
        knowledge takes the world of conditioned formations as
        its object, it is regarded as a mundane form of wisdom.
        Insight knowledge does not itself directly eradicate the
        defilements, but serves to prepare the way for the second
        type of wisdom, the wisdom of the supramundane paths,
        which emerges when insight has been brought to its
        climax. The wisdom of the path, occurring in four
        distinct stages ( to be discussed below ), simultaneously
        realizes Nibbana, fathoms the Four Noble Truths, and cuts
        off the defilements. This wisdom is called
        &quot;supramundane&quot; because it rises up from the
        world of the five aggregates to realize the state
        transcendent to the world, Nibbana. </p>
        <p>The Buddhist disciple, striving for deliverance,
        begins the development of wisdom by first securely
        establishing its roots -- purified moral discipline and
        concentration. He then learns and masters the basic
        material upon which wisdom is to work -- the aggregates,
        elements, sense bases, dependent arising, the Four Noble
        Truths, etc. He commences the actual practice of wisdom
        by cultivating insight into the impermanence, suffering
        and non-self aspect of the five aggregates. When this
        insight reaches its apex it issues in supramundane
        wisdom, the right view factor of the Noble Eightfold
        Path, which turns from conditioned formations to the
        unconditioned Nibbana and thereby eradicates the
        defilements. </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>The Two Vehicles</strong></font>
        </p>
        <p>The Theravada tradition recognizes two alternative
        approaches to the development of wisdom, between which
        practitioners are free to choose according to their
        aptitude and propensity. These two approaches are the
        vehicle of <strong>serenity</strong> (samathayana) and
        the vehicle of <strong>insight</strong> (vipassanayana).
        The meditators who follow them are called, respectively,
        the samathayanika,&quot; one who makes serenity his
        vehicle,&quot; and the vipassanayanika, &quot;one who
        makes insight his vehicle, &quot; Since both vehicles,
        despite their names, are approaches to developing
        insight, to prevent misunderstanding the latter type of
        meditator is sometimes called a suddhavipassanayanika,
        &quot;<strong>one who makes bare insight his vehicle</strong>,&quot;
        or a sukkhavipassaka, &quot;a dry-insight worker.&quot; </p>
        <p>Though all three terms appear initially in the
        commentaries rather than in the suttas, the recognition
        of the two vehicles seems implicit in a number of
        canonical passages. </p>
        <p>The <strong>samathayanika</strong> is a meditator who
        first attains access concentration or one of the eight
        mundane jhanas, then emerges and uses his attainment as a
        basis for cultivating insight until he arrives at the
        supramundane path. In contrast, the vipassanayanika does
        not attain mundane jhana prior to practicing insight
        contemplation, or if he does, does not use it as an
        instrument for cultivating insight. Instead, without
        entering and emerging from jhana, he proceeds directly to
        insight contemplation on mental and material phenomena
        and by means of this bare insight he reaches the noble
        path. For both kinds of meditator the experience of the
        path in any of its four stages always occurs at a level
        of jhanic intensity and thus necessarily includes
        supramundane jhana under the heading of right
        concentration (samma samadhi), the eighth factor of the
        Noble Eightfold Path. </p>
        <p>The classical source for the distinction between the
        two vehicles of serenity and insight is the Visuddhimagga
        where it is explained that when a meditator begins the
        development of wisdom &quot;if firstly, his vehicle is
        serenity, [he] should emerge from any fine-material or
        immaterial jhana except the base consisting of
        neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and he should
        discern, according to characteristic, function, etc. the
        jhana factors consisting of applied thought, etc. and the
        states associated with them&quot; (Vism. 557; PP679-80).
        Other commentarial passages allow access concentration to
        suffice for the vehicle of serenity, but the last
        immaterial jhana is excluded because its factors are too
        subtle to be discerned. The meditator whose vehicle is
        pure insight, on the other hand, is advised to start
        directly by discerning material and mental phenomena,
        beginning with the four elements, without utilizing a
        jhana for this purpose (Vism. 558; PP.680). Thus the
        samathayanika first attains access concentration or
        mundane jhana and then develops insight knowledge, by
        means of which he reaches the supramundane path
        containing wisdom under the heading of right view, and
        supramundane jhana under the heading of right
        concentration. The vipassanayanika, in contrast, skips
        over mundane jhana and goes directly into insight
        contemplation. When he reaches the end of the progression
        of insight knowledge he arrives at the supramundane path
        which, as in the previous case, brings together wisdom
        with supramundane jhana. This jhana counts as his
        accomplishment of serenity. </p>
        <p>For a meditator following the vehicle of serenity the
        attainment of jhana fulfills two functions: first, it
        produces a basis of mental purity and inner collectedness
        needed for undertaking the work of insight contemplation;
        and second, it serves as an object to be examined with
        insight in order to discern the three characteristics of
        impermanence, suffering and non-self. Jhana accomplishes
        the first function by providing a powerful instrument for
        overcoming the five hindrances. As we have seen, for
        wisdom to arise the mind must first be concentrated well,
        and to be concentrated well it must be freed from the
        hindrances, a task accomplished pre-eminently by the
        attainment of jhana. Though access concentration will
        keep the hindrances at bay, jhana will ensure that they
        are removed to a much safer distance. </p>
        <p>In their capacity for producing concentration the
        jhanas are called the basis (pada) for insight, and that
        particular jhana a meditator enters and emerges from
        before commencing his practice of insight is designated
        his padakajjhana, the basic or foundational jhana.
        Insight cannot be practiced while absorbed in jhana,
        since insight meditation requires investigation and
        observation, which are impossible when the mind is
        immersed in one-pointed absorption. But after emerging
        form the jhana the mind is cleared of the hindrances, and
        the stillness and clarity that then result conduce to
        precise, penetrating insight. </p>
        <p>The jhanas also enter into the samathayanika's
        practice in second capacity, that is, as objects for
        scrutinization by insight. The practice of insight
        consists essentially in the examination of mental and
        physical phenomena to discover their marks of
        impermanence, suffering and non-self. The jhanas a
        meditator attains provide him with a readily available
        and strikingly clear object in which to seek out the
        three characteristics. After emerging from a jhana the
        meditator will proceed to examine the jhanic
        consciousness and to discern the way it exemplifies the
        three universal marks. This process is called
        sammasananana, &quot;comprehension knowledge,&quot; and
        the jhana subject to such treatment is termed
        sammasitajjhana, &quot;the comprehended jhana&quot;
        (Vism. 607-11; PP.706-10). Though the basic jhana and the
        comprehended jhana will often be the same, the two do not
        necessarily coincide. A meditator cannot practice
        comprehension on a jhana higher than he is capable of
        attaining, but one who uses a higher jhana as his
        padakajjhana can still practice insight comprehension on
        a lower jhana which he has previously attained and
        mastered. The admitted difference between the
        padakajjhana and the sammasitajjhana leads to discrepant
        theories about the supramundane concentration of the
        noble path, as we will see. </p>
        <p>Whereas the sequence of training undertaken by the
        samathayanika meditator is unproblematic, the <strong>vipassanayanika</strong>'s
        approach presents the difficulty of accounting for the
        concentration he uses to provide a basis for insight.
        Concentration is needed in order to see and know things
        as they are, but without access concentration or jhana,
        what concentration can he use? The solution to this
        problem is found in a type of concentration distinct from
        the access and absorption concentrations pertaining to
        the vehicle of serenity, called &quot;<strong>momentary
        concentration</strong>&quot; (khanika samadhi). Despite
        its name, momentary concentration does not signify a
        single moment of concentration amidst a current of
        distracted thoughts, but a dynamic concentration which
        flows from object to object in the ever-changing flux of
        phenomena, retaining a constant degree of intensity and
        collectedness sufficient to purify the mind of the
        hindrances. Momentary concentration arises in the
        samathayanika simultaneously with his post-jhanic
        attainment of insight, but for the vipassanayanika it
        develops naturally and spontaneously in the course of his
        insight practice without his having to fix the mind upon
        a single exclusive object. Thus the follower of the
        vehicle of insight does not omit concentration altogether
        from his training, but develops it in a different manner
        from the practitioner of serenity. Without gaining jhana
        he goes directly into contemplation on the five
        aggregates and by observing them constantly from moment
        to moment acquires momentary concentration as an
        accompaniment of his investigations. This momentary
        concentration fulfills the same function as the basic
        jhana of the serenity vehicle, providing the foundation
        of mental clarity needed for insight to emerge. </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>Supramundane Jhana</strong></font>
        </p>
        <p>The climax in the development of insight is the
        attainment of the supramundane paths and fruits. Each
        path is a momentary peak experience directly apprehending
        Nibbana and permanently cutting off certain defilements.
        These defilements are generally grouped into a set of ten
        &quot;fetters&quot; (samyojana) which keep beings chained
        to the round of rebirths. The first path, called the path
        of <strong>stream-entry</strong> (sota patti) because it
        marks the entry into the stream of the Dhamma, eradicates
        the first three fetters -- The false view of self, doubt,
        and clinging to rites and rituals. The disciple who has
        reached stream-entry has limited his future births to a
        maximum of seven in the happy realms of the human and
        heavenly worlds, after which he will attain final
        deliverance. But an ardent disciple may progress to still
        higher stages in the same life in which he reaches
        stream-entry, by making an aspiration for the next higher
        path and again undertaking the development of insight
        with the aim of reaching that path. </p>
        <p>The next supramundane path is that of the <strong>once-returner</strong>
        (sakadagami). This path does not eradicate any fetters
        completely, but it greatly attenuates sensual desire and
        ill will. The once-returner is so called because he is
        bound to make an end of suffering after returning to this
        world only one more time. The third path, that of the <strong>non-returner</strong>
        (anagami) utterly destroys the sensual desire and ill
        will weakened by the preceding path. The non-returner is
        assured that he will never again take rebirth in the
        sense-sphere; if he does not penetrate higher he will be
        reborn spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there reach
        final Nibbana. The highest path, the path of <strong>arahatship</strong>,
        eradicate the remaining five fetters -- desire for
        existence in the fine-material and immaterial spheres,
        conceit, restlessness and ignorance. The arahat has
        completed the development of the entire path taught by
        the Buddha; he has reached the end of rebirths and can
        sound his &quot;lion's roar&quot;: &quot;Destroyed is
        birth, the holy life has been lived, what was to be done
        has been done, there is nothing further beyond
        this.&quot; </p>
        <p>Each path is followed immediately by the supramundane
        experience of fruition, which results from the path,
        comes in the same four graded stages, and shares the
        path's world-transcending character. But whereas the path
        performs the active function of cutting off defilements,
        fruition simply enjoys the bliss and peace that result
        when the path has completed its task. Also, where the
        path is limited to a single moment of consciousness, the
        fruition that follows immediately on the path endures for
        two or three moments. And while each of the four paths
        occurs only once and can never be repeated, fruition
        remains accessible to the noble disciple at he
        appropriate level. He can resort to it as a special
        meditative state called fruition attainment
        (phalasamapatti) for the purpose of experiencing nibbanic
        bliss here and now (Vism. 699-702; PP.819-24). </p>
        <p>The supramundane paths and fruits always arise as
        states of jhanic consciousness. They occur as states of
        jhana because they contain within themselves the jhana
        factors elevated to an intensity corresponding to that of
        the jhana factors in the mundane jhanas. Since they
        possess the jhana factors these states are able to fix
        upon their object with the force of full absorption.
        Thence, taking the absorptive force of the jhana factors
        as the criterion, the paths and fruits may be reckoned as
        belonging to either the first, second, third or fourth
        jhana of the fourfold scheme, or to the first, second,
        third, fourth or fifth jhana of the fivefold scheme. </p>
        <p>The basis for the recognition of a supramundane type
        of jhana goes back to the suttas, especially to the
        section of &quot;The Great Discourse on the Foundations
        of Mindfulness&quot; where the Buddha defines right
        concentration of the Noble Eightfold Path by the standard
        formula for the four jhanas (D.ii,313). However, it is in
        the Abhidhamma that the connection between the jhanas,
        paths and fruits comes to be worked out with great
        intricacy of detail. The Dhammasangani, in its section on
        states of consciousness, expounds each of the path and
        fruition states of consciousness as occasions, first, of
        one or another of the four jhanas in the fourfold scheme,
        and then again as occasions of one or another of the five
        jhanas in the fivefold scheme (Dhs.74-86). Standard
        Abhidhammic exposition, as formalized in the synoptical
        manuals of Abhidhamma, employs the fivefold scheme and
        brings each of the paths and fruits into connection with
        each of the five jhanas. In this way the eight types of
        supramundane consciousness -- the path and fruition
        consciousness of stream-entry, the once-returner, the
        non-returner and arahatship -- proliferate to forty types
        of supramundane consciousness, since any path or fruit
        can occur at the level of any of the five jhanas. It
        should be noted, however, that there are no paths and
        fruits conjoined with the immaterial attainments, the
        reason being that supramundane jhana is presented solely
        from the standpoint of its factorial constitution, which
        for the immaterial attainment and the fifth jhana is
        identical -- equanimity and one-pointedness. </p>
        <p>The fullest treatment of the supramundane jhanas in
        the authoritative Pali literature can be found in the
        Dhammasangani read in conjunction with its commentary,
        the Atthasalini. The Dhammasangani opens its analysis of
        the first wholesome supramundane consciousness with the
        words: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>On the occasion when one develops supramundane
            jhana which is emancipating, leading to the
            demolition (of existence), for the abandonment of
            views, for reaching the first plane, secluded from
            sense pleasures ... one enters and dwells in the
            first jhana. (Dhs. 72) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The Atthasalini explains the word lokuttara, which we
        have been translating &quot;supramundane,&quot; as
        meaning &quot;it crosses over the world, it transcends
        the world, it stands having surmounted and overcome the
        world.&quot; It glosses the phrase &quot;one develops
        jhana&quot; thus: &quot;One develops, produces,
        cultivates absorption jhana lasting for a single
        thought-moment.&quot; This gloss shows us two things
        about the consciousness of the path: that it occurs as a
        jhana at the level of full absorption and that this
        absorption of the path lasts for only a single
        thought-moment. The word &quot;emancipating&quot;
        (niyyanika) is explained to mean that this jhana
        &quot;goes out&quot; from the world, from the round of
        existence, the phrase &quot;leading to demolition&quot;
        (apacayagami) that it demolishes and dismantles the
        process of rebirth (Dhs.A.259). </p>
        <p>This last phrase points to a striking difference
        between mundane and supramundane jhana. The
        Dhammasangani's exposition of the former begins: &quot;On
        the occasion when one develops <em><strong>the path for
        rebirth in the fine-material sphere</strong></em> ... one
        enters and dwells in the first jhana&quot; [my italics].
        Thus, with this statement, mundane jhana is shown to
        sustain the round of rebirths; it is a wholesome kamma
        leading to renewed existence. But the supramundane jhana
        of the path does not promote the continuation of the
        round. To the contrary, it brings about the round's
        dismantling and demolition, as the Atthasalini shows with
        an illustrative simile: </p>
        <p>The wholesome states of the three planes are said to
        lead to accumulation because they build up and increase
        death and rebirth in the round. But not this. Just as
        when one man has built up a wall eighteen feet high
        another might take a club and go along demolishing it, so
        this goes along demolishing and dismantling the deaths
        and rebirths built up by the wholesome kammas of the
        three planes by bringing about a deficiency in their
        conditions. Thus it leads to demolition. [2] </p>
        <p>Supramundane jhana is said to be cultivated &quot;for
        the abandoning of views.&quot; This phrase points to the
        function of the first path, which is to eradicate the
        fetters. The supramundane jhana of the first path cuts
        off the fetter of personality view and all speculative
        views derived from it. The Atthasalini points out that
        here we should understand that it abandons not only wrong
        views but other unwholesome states as well, namely,
        doubt, clinging to rites and rituals, and greed, hatred
        and delusion strong enough to lead to the plane of
        misery. The commentary explicates &quot;for reaching the
        first plane&quot; as meaning for attaining the fruit of
        stream-entry. </p>
        <p>Besides these, several other differences between
        mundane and supramundane jhana may be briefly noted.
        First, with regard to their object, the mundane jhanas
        have as object a conceptual entity such as the
        counterpart sign of the kasinas or, in the case of the
        divine abodes, sentient beings. In contrast, for the
        supramundane jhana of the paths and fruits the object is
        exclusively Nibbana. With regard to their predominant
        tone, in mundane jhana the element of serenity prevails,
        while the supramundane jhana of the paths and fruits
        brings serenity and insight into balance. Wisdom is
        present as right view and serenity as right
        concentration, both function together in perfect harmony,
        neither one exceeding the other. </p>
        <p>This difference in prevailing tone leads into a
        difference in function or activity between the two kinds
        of jhana. Both the mundane and supramundane are jhanas in
        the sense of closely attending (upanijjhana), but in the
        case of mundane jhana this close attention issues merely
        in absorption into the object, an absorption that can
        only suppress the defilement temporarily. In the
        supramundane jhana, particularly of the four paths, the
        coupling of close attention with wisdom brings the
        exercise of four functions at a single moment. These four
        functions each apply to one of the Four Noble Truths. The
        path penetrates the First Noble Truth by fully
        understanding suffering; it penetrates the Second Noble
        Truth by abandoning craving, the origin of suffering; it
        penetrates the Third Noble Truth by realizing Nibbana,
        the cessation of suffering; and it penetrates the fourth
        Noble Truth by developing the Noble Eightfold Path that
        leads to the end of suffering. Buddhaghosa illustrates
        this with the simile of a lamp, which also performs four
        tasks simultaneously: it burns the wick, dispels
        darkness, makes light appear, and consumes oil (Vism.690;
        PP.808). </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>The Jhanic Level of the
        Path and Fruit </strong></font></p>
        <p>When the paths and fruits are assigned to the level of
        the four or five jhanas, the question arises as to what
        factor determines their particular level of jhanic
        intensity. In other words, why do the path and fruit
        arise for one meditator at the level of the first jhana,
        for another at the level of the second jhana, and so
        forth? The commentaries present three theories concerning
        the determination of the jhanic level of the path,
        apparently deriving from the lineages of ancient teachers
        (Vism. 666-67; PP.778-80. Dhs.A.271-74). The first holds
        that it is the basic jhana, i.e. the jhana used as a
        basis for the insight leading to emergence in immediate
        proximity to the path, that governs the difference in the
        jhanic level of the path. A second theory says that the
        difference is governed by the aggregates made the objects
        of insight on the occasion of insight leading to
        emergence. A third theory holds that it is the personal
        inclination of the meditator that governs the difference.
        </p>
        <p>According to the first theory the path arisen in a
        dry-insight meditator who lacks jhana, and the path
        arisen in one who possesses a jhana attainment but does
        not use it as a basis for insight, and the path arisen by
        comprehending formations after emerging from the first
        jhana, are all paths of the first jhana only. When the
        path is produced after emerging from the second, third,
        fourth and fifth jhanas (of the fivefold system) and
        using these as the basis for insight, then the path
        pertains to the level of the jhana used as a basis -- the
        second, third, fourth of fifth. For a meditator using an
        immaterial jhana as basis the path will be a fifth jhana
        path. Thus in this first theory, when formations are
        comprehended by insight after emerging from a basic
        jhana, then it is the jhana attainment emerged from at
        the point nearest to the path, i.e. just before insight
        leading to emergence is reached, that makes the path
        similar in nature to itself. </p>
        <p>According to the second theory the path that arises is
        similar in nature to the states which are being
        comprehended with insight at the time insight leading to
        emergence occurs. Thus if the meditator, after emerging
        from a meditative attainment, is comprehending with
        insight sense-sphere phenomena or the constituents of the
        first jhana, then the path produced will occur at the
        level of the first jhana. On this theory, then, it is the
        comprehended jhana (sammasitajjhana) that determines the
        jhanic quality of the path. The one qualification that
        must be added is that a meditator cannot contemplate with
        insight a jhana higher than he is capable of attaining. </p>
        <p>According to the third theory, the path occurs at the
        level of whichever jhana the meditator wishes -- either
        at the level of the jhana he has used as the basis for
        insight or at the level of the jhana he has made the
        object of insight comprehension. In other words, the
        jhanic quality of the path accords with his personal
        inclination. However, mere wish alone is not sufficient.
        For the path to occur at the jhanic level wished for, the
        mundane jhana must have been either made the basis for
        insight or used as the object of insight comprehension. </p>
        <p>The difference between the three theories can be
        understood through a simple example. [3] If a meditator
        reaches the supramundane path by contemplating with
        insight the first jhana after emerging from the fifth
        jhana, then according to the first theory his path will
        belong to the fifth jhana, while according to the second
        theory it will belong to the first jhana. Thus these two
        theories are incompatible when a difference obtains
        between basic jhana and comprehended jhana. But according
        to the third theory, the path becomes of whichever jhana
        the meditator wishes, either the first or the fifth. Thus
        this doctrine does not necessarily clash with the other
        two. </p>
        <p>Buddhaghosa himself does not make a decision among
        these three theories. He only points out that in all
        three doctrines, beneath their disagreements, there is
        the recognition that the insight immediately preceding
        the supramundane path determines the jhanic character of
        the path. For this insight is the proximate and the
        principal cause for the arising of the path, so whether
        it be the insight leading to emergence near the basic
        jhana or that occurring through the contemplated jhana or
        that fixed by the meditator's wish, it is in all cases
        this final phase of insight that gives definition to the
        supramundane path. Since the fruition that occurs
        immediately after the path has an identical constitution
        to the path, its own supramundane jhana is determined by
        the path. Thus a first jhana path produces a first jhana
        fruit, and so forth for the remaining jhanas. </p>
