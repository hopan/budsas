        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The attainment of any jhana comes about through a
        twofold process of development. On one side the states
        obstructive to it, called its factors of abandonment,
        have to be eliminated, on the other the states composing
        it, called its factors of possession, have to be
        acquired. In the case of the first jhana the factors of
        abandonment are the five hindrances and the factors of
        possession the five basic jhana factors. Both are alluded
        to in the standard formula for the first jhana, the
        opening phrase referring to the abandonment of the
        hindrances and the subsequent portion enumerating the
        jhana factors: </p>
        <p>Quite secluded from sense pleasures, secluded from
        unwholesome states of mind, he enters and dwells in the
        first jhana, which is accompanied by applied thought and
        sustained thought with rapture and happiness born of
        seclusion. (M.i,1818; Vbh.245) </p>
        <p>In this chapter we will first discuss the five
        hindrances and their abandonment, then we will
        investigate the jhana factors both individually and by
        way of their combined contribution to the attainment of
        the first jhana. We will close the chapter with some
        remarks on the ways of perfecting the first jhana, a
        necessary preparation for the further development of
        concentration. </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>The Abandoning of the
        Hindrances</strong></font> </p>
        <p>The five hindrances (pancanivarana) are <em><strong>sensual
        desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and
        worry, and doubt</strong></em>. This group, the principal
        classification the Buddha uses for the obstacles to
        meditation, receives its name because its five members
        hinder and envelop the mind, preventing meditative
        development in the two spheres of serenity and insight.
        Hence the Buddha calls them &quot;obstructions,
        hindrances, corruptions of the mind which weaken
        wisdom&quot;(S.v,94). </p>
        <p>The hindrance of sensual desire (kamachanda) is
        explained as desire for the &quot;five strands of sense
        pleasure,&quot; that is, for pleasant forms, sounds,
        smells, tastes and tangibles. It ranges from subtle
        liking to powerful lust. The hindrance of ill will
        (byapada) signifies aversion directed towards
        disagreeable persons or things. It can vary in range from
        mild annoyance to overpowering hatred. Thus the first two
        hindrances correspond to the first two root defilements,
        greed and hate. The third root defilement, delusion, is
        not enumerated separately among the hindrances but can be
        found underlying the remaining three. </p>
        <p>Sloth and torpor is a compound hindrance made up of
        two components: sloth (thina), which is dullness, inertia
        or mental stiffness; and torpor (middha), which is
        indolence or drowsiness. Restlessness and worry is
        another double hindrance, restlessness (uddhacca) being
        explained as excitement, agitation or disquietude, worry
        (kukkucca) as the sense of guilt aroused by moral
        transgressions. Finally, the hindrance of doubt
        (vicikiccha) is explained as uncertainty with regard to
        the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha and the training. </p>
        <p>The Buddha offers two sets of similes to illustrate
        the detrimental effect of the hindrances. The first
        compares the five hindrances to five types of calamity:
        sensual desire is like a debt, ill will like a disease,
        sloth and torpor like imprisonment, restless and worry
        like slavery, and doubt like being lost on a desert road.
        Release from the hindrances is to be seen as freedom from
        debt, good health, release from prison, emancipation from
        slavery, and arriving at a place of safety (D.i,71-73).
        The second set of similes compares the hindrances to five
        kinds of impurities affecting a bowl of water, preventing
        a keen-sighted man from seeing his own reflection as it
        really is. Sensual desire is like a bowl of water mixed
        with brightly colored paints, ill will like a bowl of
        boiling water, sloth and torpor like water covered by
        mossy plants, restlessness and worry like water blown
        into ripples by the wind, and doubt like muddy water.
        Just as the keen-eyed man would not be able to see his
        reflection in these five kinds of water, so one whose
        mind is obsessed by the five hindrances does not know and
        see as it is his own good, the good of others or the good
        of both (S.v,121-24). Although there are numerous
        defilements opposed to the first jhana the five
        hindrances alone are called its factors of abandoning.
        One reason according to the Visuddhimagga, is that the
        hindrances are specifically obstructive to jhana, each
        hindrance impeding in its own way the mind's capacity for
        concentration. </p>
        <p>The mind affected through lust by greed for varied
        objective fields does not become concentrated on an
        object consisting in unity, or being overwhelmed by lust,
        it does not enter on the way to abandoning the
        sense-desire element. When pestered by ill will towards
        an object, it does not occur uninterruptedly. When
        overcome by stiffness and torpor, it is unwieldy. When
        seized by agitation and worry, it is unquiet and buzzes
        about. When stricken by uncertainty, it fails to mount
        the way to accomplish the attainment of jhana. So it is
        these only that are called factors of abandonment because
        they are specifically obstructive to jhana.(Vism.146:
        PP.152) </p>
        <p>A second reason for confining the first jhana's
        factors of abandoning to the five hindrances is to permit
        a direct alignment to be made between the hindrances and
        the jhanic factors. Buddhaghosa states that the
        abandonment of the five hindrances alone is mentioned in
        connection with jhana because the hindrances are the
        direct enemies of the five jhana factors, which the
        latter must eliminate and abolish. To support his point
        the commentator cites a passage demonstrating a
        one-to-one correspondence between the jhana factors and
        the hindrances: one-pointedness is opposed to sensual
        desire, rapture to ill will, applied thought to sloth and
        torpor, happiness to restlessness and worry, and
        sustained thought to doubt (Vism. 141; PP.147).[1] Thus
        each jhana factor is seen as having the specific task of
        eliminating a particular obstruction to the jhana and to
        correlate these obstructions with the five jhana factors
        they are collected into a scheme of five hindrances. </p>
        <p>The standard passage describing the attainment of the
        first jhana says that the jhana is entered upon by one
        who is &quot;secluded from sense pleasures, secluded from
        unwholesome states of mind.&quot; The Visuddhimagga
        explains that there are three kinds of seclusion relevant
        to the present context -- namely, bodily seclusion
        (kayaviveka), mental seclusion (cittaviveka), and
        seclusion by suppression (vikkhambhanaviveka) (Vism. 140;
        PP.145). These three terms allude to two distinct sets of
        exegetical categories. The first two belong to a
        threefold arrangement made up of bodily seclusion, mental
        seclusion, and &quot;seclusion from the substance&quot;
        (upadhiviveka). The first means physical withdrawal from
        active social engagement into a condition of solitude for
        the purpose of devoting time and energy to spiritual
        development. The second, which generally presupposes the
        first, means the seclusion of the mind from its
        entanglement in defilements; it is in effect equivalent
        to concentration of at least the access level. The third,
        &quot;seclusion from the substance,&quot; is Nibbana,
        liberation from the elements of phenomenal existence. The
        achievement of the first jhana does not depend on the
        third, which is its outcome rather than prerequisite, but
        it does require physical solitude and the separation of
        the mind from defilements, hence bodily and mental
        seclusion. The third type of seclusion pertinent to the
        context, seclusion by suppression, belongs to a different
        scheme generally discussed under the heading of
        &quot;abandonment&quot; (pahana) rather than
        &quot;seclusion.&quot; The type of abandonment required
        for the attainment of jhana is abandonment by
        suppression, which means the removal of the hindrances by
        force of concentration similar to the pressing down of
        weeds in a pond by means of a porous pot.[2] </p>
        <p>The work of overcoming the five hindrances is
        accomplished through the gradual training
        (anupubbasikkha) which the Buddha has laid down so often
        in the suttas, such as the Samannaphala Sutta and the
        Culahatthipadopama Sutta. The gradual training is a
        step-by-step process designed to lead the practitioner
        gradually to liberation. The training begins with moral
        discipline, the undertaking and observance of specific
        rules of conduct which enable the disciple to control the
        coarser modes of bodily and verbal misconduct through
        which the hindrances find an outlet. With moral
        discipline as a basis, the disciple practices the
        restraint of the senses. He does not seize upon the
        general appearances of the beguiling features of things,
        but guards and masters his sense faculties so that
        sensual attractive and repugnant objects no longer become
        grounds for desire and aversion. Then, endowed with the
        self-restraint, he develops mindfulness and discernment
        (sati-sampajanna) in all his activities and postures,
        examining everything he does with clear awareness as to
        its purpose and suitability. He also cultivates
        contentment with a minimum of robes, food, shelter and
        other requisites. </p>
        <p>Once he has fulfilled these preliminaries the disciple
        is prepared to go into solitude to develop the jhanas,
        and it is here that he directly confronts the five
        hindrances. The elimination of the hindrances requires
        that the meditator honestly appraises his own mind. When
        sensuality, ill will and the other hindrances are
        present, he must recognize that they are present and he
        must investigate the conditions that lead to their
        arising: the latter he must scrupulously avoid. The
        meditator must also understand the appropriate antidotes
        for each of the five hindrances. The Buddha says that all
        the hindrances arise through unwise consideration
        (ayoniso manasikara) and that they can be eliminated by
        wise consideration (yoniso manasikara). Each hindrance,
        however, has its own specific antidote. Thus wise
        consideration of the repulsive feature of things is the
        antidote to sensual desire; wise consideration of
        loving-kindness counteracts ill will; wise consideration
        of the elements of effort, exertion and striving opposes
        sloth and torpor; wise consideration of tranquillity of
        mind removes restlessness and worry; and wise
        consideration of the real qualities of things eliminates
        doubt (S.v,105-106). </p>
        <p>Having given up covetousness [i.e. sensual desire]
        with regard to the world, he dwells with a heart free of
        covetousness; he cleanses his mind from covetousness.
        Having given up the blemish of ill will, he dwells
        without ill will; friendly and compassionate towards all
        living beings, he cleanses his mind from the blemishes of
        ill will. Having given up sloth and torpor, he dwells
        free from sloth and torpor, in the perception of light;
        mindful and clearly comprehending, he cleanses his mind
        from sloth and torpor. Having given up restlessness and
        worry, he dwells without restlessness; his mind being
        calmed within, he cleanses it from restlessness and
        worry. Having given up doubt, he dwells as one who has
        passed beyond doubt; being free from uncertainty about
        wholesome things, he cleanses his mind from doubt .... </p>
        <p>And when he sees himself free of these five
        hindrances, joy arises; in him who is joyful, rapture
        arises; in him whose mind is enraptured, the body is
        stilled; the body being stilled, he feels happiness; and
        a happy mind finds concentration. Then, quite secluded
        from sense pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states of
        mind, he enters and dwells in the first jhana, which is
        accompanied by applied thought and sustained thought,
        with rapture and happiness born of seclusion. (D.i,73-74)
        [3] </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>The Factors of the First
        Jhana</strong></font> </p>
        <p>The first jhana possesses five component factors:
        applied thought, sustained thought, rapture, happiness
        and one-pointedness of mind. Four of these are explicitly
        mentioned in the formula for the jhana; the fifth,
        one-pointedness, is mentioned elsewhere in the suttas but
        is already suggested by the notion of jhana itself. These
        five states receive their name, first because they lead
        the mind from the level of ordinary consciousness to the
        jhanic level, and second because they constitute the
        first jhana and give it its distinct definition. </p>
        <p>The jhana factors are first aroused by the meditator's
        initial efforts to concentrate upon one of the prescribed
        objects for developing jhana. As he fixes his mind on the
        preliminary object, such as a kasina disk, a point is
        eventually reached where he can perceive the object as
        clearly with his eyes closed as with them open. This
        visualized object is called the learning sign
        (uggahanimitta). As he concentrates on the learning sign,
        his efforts call into play the embryonic jhana factors,
        which grow in force, duration and prominence as a result
        of the meditative exertion. These factors, being
        incompatible with the hindrances, attenuate them, exclude
        them, and hold them at bay. With continued practice the
        learning sign gives rise to a purified luminous replica
        of itself called the counterpart sign (patibhaganimitta),
        the manifestation of which marks the complete suppression
        of the hindrances and the attainment of access
        concentration (upacarasamadhi). All three events-the
        suppression of the hindrances, the arising of the
        counterpart sign, and the attainment of access
        concentration -- take place at precisely the same moment,
        without interval (Vism. 126; PP.131). And though
        previously the process of mental cultivation may have
        required the elimination of different hindrances at
        different times, when access is achieved they all subside
        together: </p>
        <p>Simultaneously with his acquiring the counterpart sign
        his lust is abandoned by suppression owing to his giving
        no attention externally to sense desires (as object). And
        owing to his abandoning of approval, ill will is
        abandoned too, as pus is with the abandoning of blood.
        Likewise stiffness and torpor is abandoned through
        exertion of energy, agitation and worry is abandoned
        through devotion to peaceful things that cause no
        remorse; and uncertainty about the Master who teaches the
        way, about the way, and about the fruit of the way, about
        the way, and about the fruit of the way, is abandoned
        through the actual experience of the distinction
        attained. So the five hindrances are abandoned. (Vism.
        189; PP.196) </p>
        <p>Though the mental factors determinative of the first
        jhana are present in access concentration, they do not as
        yet possess sufficient strength to constitute the jhana,
        but are strong enough only to exclude the hindrances.
        With continued practice, however, the nascent jhana
        factors grow in strength until they are capable of
        issuing in jhana. Because of the instrumental role these
        factors play both in the attainment and constitution of
        the first jhana they are deserving of closer individual
        scrutiny. </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>Applied Thought
        (vitakka)</strong></font> </p>
        <p>The word vitakka frequently appears in the texts in
        conjunction with the word vicara. The pair signify two
        interconnected but distinct aspects of the thought
        process, and to bring out the difference between them (as
        well as their common character), we translate the one as
        applied thought and the other as sustained thought. </p>
        <p>In both the suttas and the Abhidhamma applied thought
        is defined as the application of the mind to its object
        (cetaso abhiniropana), a function which the Atthasalini
        illustrates thus: &quot;Just as someone ascends the
        king's palace in dependence on a relative of friend dear
        to the king, so the mind ascends the object in dependence
        on applied thought&quot; (Dhs.A.157). This function of
        applying the mind to the object is common to the wide
        variety of modes in which the mental factor of applied
        thought occurs, ranging from sense discrimination to
        imagination, reasoning and deliberation and to the
        practice of concentration culminating in the first jhana.
        Applied thought can be unwholesome as in thoughts of
        sensual pleasure, ill will and cruelty, or wholesome as
        in thoughts of renunciation, benevolence and compassion
        (M.i,116). </p>
        <p>In jhana applied through is invariably wholesome and
        its function of directing the mind upon its object stands
        forth with special clarity. To convey this the
        Visuddhimagga explains that in jhana the function of
        applied thought is &quot;to strike at and thresh -- for
        the meditator is said, in virtue of it, to have the
        object struck at by applied thought, threshed by applied
        thought&quot; (Vism.142;PP148). The Milindapanha makes
        the same point by defining applied thought as absorption
        (appana): &quot;Just as a carpenter drives a
        well-fashioned piece of wood into a joint, so applied
        thought has the characteristic of absorption&quot;
        (Miln.62). </p>
        <p>The object of jhana into which vitakka drives the mind
        and its concomitant states is the counterpart sign, which
        emerges from the learning sign as the hindrances are
        suppressed and the mind enters access concentration. The
        Visuddhimagga explains the difference between the two
        signs thus: </p>
        <p>In the learning sign any fault in the kasina is
        apparent. But the counterpart sign appears as if breaking
        out from the learning sign, and a hundred times, a
        thousand times more purified, like a looking-glass disk
        drawn from its case, like a mother-of-pearl dish well
        washed, like the moon's disk coming out from behind a
        cloud, like cranes against a thunder cloud. But it has
        neither color nor shape; for if it had, it would be
        cognizable by the eye, gross, susceptible of
        comprehension (by insight) and stamped with the three
        characteristics. But it is not like that. For it is born
        only of perception in one who has obtained concentration,
        being a mere mode of appearance (Vism. 125-26; PP.130) </p>
        <p>The counterpart sign is the object of both access
        concentration and jhana, which differ neither in their
        object nor in the removal of the hindrances but in the
        strength of their respective jhana factors. In the former
        the factors are still weak, not yet fully developed,
        while in the jhana they are strong enough to make the
        mind fully absorbed in the object. In this process
        applied thought is the factor primarily responsible for
        directing the mind towards the counterpart sign and
        thrusting it in with the force of full absorption. </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>Sustained Thought
        (vicara)</strong></font> </p>
        <p>Vicara seems to represent a more developed phase of
        the thought process than vitakka. The commentaries
        explain that it has the characteristic of &quot;continued
        pressure&quot; on the object (Vim. 142; PP.148). Applied
        thought is described as the first impact of the mind on
        the object, the gross inceptive phase of thought;
        sustained thought is described as the act of anchoring
        the mind on the object, the subtle phase of continued
        mental pressure. Buddhaghosa illustrates the difference
        between the two with a series of similes. Applied thought
        is like striking a bell, sustained thought like the
        ringing; applied thought is like a bee's flying towards a
        flower, sustained thought like its buzzing around the
        flower; applied thought is like a compass pin that stays
        fixed to the center of a circle, sustained thought like
        the pin that revolves around (Vism. 142-43; PP.148-49). </p>
        <p>These similes make it clear that applied thought and
        sustained thought functionally associated, perform
        different tasks. Applied thought brings the mind to the
        object, sustained thought fixes and anchors it there.
        Applied thought focuses the mind on the object, sustained
        thought examines and inspects what is focused on. Applied
        thought brings a deepening of concentration by again and
        again leading the mind back to the same object, sustained
        thought sustains the concentration achieved by keeping
        the mind anchored on that object. </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>Rapture (piti)</strong></font>
        </p>
        <p>The third factor present in the first jhana is piti,
        usually translated as joy or rapture.[4] In the suttas
        piti is sometimes said to arise from another quality
        called pamojja, translated as joy or gladness, which
        springs up with the abandonment of the five hindrances.
        When the disciple sees the five hindrances abandoned in
        himself &quot;gladness arises within him; thus gladdened,
        rapture arises in him; and when he is rapturous his body
        becomes tranquil&quot; (D.i,73). Tranquillity in turn
        leads to happiness, on the basis of which the mind
        becomes concentrated. Thus rapture precedes the actual
        arising of the first jhana, but persists through the
        remaining stages up to the third jhana. </p>
        <p>The Vibhanga defines piti as &quot;gladness, joy,
        joyfulness, mirth, merriment, exultation, exhilaration,
        and satisfaction of mind&quot; (Vbh. 257). The
        commentaries ascribe to it the characteristic of
        endearing, the function of refreshing the body and mind
        or pervading with rapture, and the manifestation as
        elation (Vism.143; PP.149). Shwe Zan Aung explains that
        &quot;piti abstracted means interest of varying degrees
        of intensity, in an object felt as desirable or as
        calculated to bring happiness.&quot;[5] </p>
        <p>When defined in terms of agency, piti is that which
        creates interest in the object; when defined in terms of
        its nature it is the interest in the object. Because it
        creates a positive interest in the object, the jhana
        factor of rapture is able to counter and suppress the
        hindrance of ill will, a state of aversion implying a
        negative evaluation of the object. </p>
        <p>Rapture is graded into five categories: minor rapture,
        momentary rapture, showering rapture, uplifting rapture
        and pervading rapture.[6] Minor rapture is generally the
        first to appear in the progressive development of
        meditation; it is capable of causing the hairs of the
        body to rise. Momentary rapture, which is like lightning,
        comes next but cannot be sustained for long. Showering
        rapture runs through the body in waves, producing a
        thrill but without leaving a lasting impact. Uplifting
        rapture, which can cause levitation, is more sustained
        but still tends to disturb concentration, The form of
        rapture most conductive to the attainment of jhana is
        all-pervading rapture, which is said to suffuse the whole
        body so that it becomes like a full bladder or like a
        mountain cavern inundated with a mighty flood of water.
        The Visuddhimagga states that what is intended by the
        jhana factor of rapture is this all-pervading rapture
        &quot;which is the root of absorption and comes by growth
        into association with absorption&quot; (Vism.144; PP.151)
        </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>Happiness (sukha)</strong></font>
        </p>
        <p>As a factor of the first jhana, sukha signifies
        pleasant feeling. The word is explicitly defined in the
        sense by the Vibhanga in its analysis of the first jhana:
        &quot;Therein, what is happiness? Mental pleasure and
        happiness born of mind-contact, the felt pleasure and
        happiness born of mind-contact, pleasurable and happy
        feeling born of mind contact -- this is called
        'happiness' &quot; (Vbh.257). The Visuddhimagga explains
        that happiness in the first jhana has the characteristic
        of gratifying, the function of intensifying associated
        states, and as manifestation, the rendering of aid to its
        associated states (Vism. 145; PP.151). </p>
        <p>Rapture and happiness link together in a very close
        relationship, but though the two are difficult to
        distinguish, they are not identical. Happiness is a
        feeling (vedana);, rapture a mental formation (sankhara).
        Happiness always accompanies rapture, so that when
        rapture is present happiness must always be present; but
        rapture does not always accompany happiness, for in the
        third jhana, as we will see, there is happiness but no
        rapture. The Atthasalini, which explains rapture as
        &quot;delight in the attaining of the desired
        object&quot; and happiness as &quot;the enjoyment of the
        taste of what is required,&quot; illustrates the
        difference by means of a simile: </p>
        <p>Rapture is like a weary traveler in the desert in
        summer, who hears of, or sees water of a shady wood. Ease
        [happiness] is like his enjoying the water of entering
        the forest shade. For a man who, traveling along the path
        through a great desert and overcome by the heat, is
        thirsty and desirous of drink, if he saw a man on the
        way, would ask 'Where is water?' The other would say,
        'Beyond the wood is a dense forest with a natural lake.
        Go there, and you will get some.' He, hearing these
        words, would be glad and delighted and as he went would
        see lotus leaves, etc., fallen on the ground and become
        more glad and delighted. Going onwards, he would see men
        with wet clothes and hair, hear the sounds of wild fowl
        and pea-fowl, etc., see the dense forest of green like a
        net of jewels growing by the edge of the natural lake, he
        would see the water lily, the lotus, the white lily,
        etc., growing in the lake, he would see the clear
        transparent water, he would be all the more glad and
        delighted, would descend into the natural lake, bathe and
        drink at pleasure and, his oppression being allayed, he
        would eat the fibers and stalks of the lilies, adorn
        himself with the blue lotus, carry on his shoulders the
        roots of the mandalaka, ascend from the lake, put on his
        clothes, dry the bathing cloth in the sun, and in the
        cool shade where the breeze blew ever so gently lay
        himself down and saw: 'O bliss! O bliss!' Thus should
        this illustration be applied. The time of gladness and
        delight from when he heard of the natural lake and the
        dense forest till he say the water is like rapture having
        the manner of gladness and delight at the object in view.
        The time when, after his bath and dried he laid himself
        down in the cool shade, saying, 'O bliss! O bliss!' etc.,
        is the sense of ease [happiness] grown strong,
        established in that mode of enjoying the taste of the
        object. [7] </p>
        <p>Since rapture and happiness co-exist in the first
        jhana, this simile should not be taken to imply that they
        are mutually exclusive. Its purport is to suggest that
        rapture gains prominence before happiness, for which it
        helps provide a causal foundation. </p>
        <p>In the description of the first jhana, rapture and
        happiness are said to be &quot;born of seclusion&quot;
        and to suffuse the whole body of the meditator in such a
        way that there is no part of his body which remains
        unaffected by them: </p>
        <p>Monks, secluded from sense pleasure ... a monk enters
        and dwells in the first jhana. He steeps, drenches, fills
        and suffuses his body with the rapture and happiness born
        of seclusion, so that there is no part of his entire body
        that is not suffused with this rapture and happiness.
        Just as a skilled bath-attendant or his apprentice might
        strew bathing powder in a copper basin, sprinkle it again
        and again with water, and knead it together so that the
        mass of bathing soap would be pervaded, suffused, and
        saturated with moisture inside and out yet would not ooze
        moisture, so a monk steeps, drenches, fills and suffuses
        his body with the rapture and happiness born of
        seclusion, so that, there is no part of his entire body
        that is not suffused with this rapture and happiness born
        of seclusion. (D.i,74) </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>One-pointedness
        (ekaggata)</strong></font> </p>
        <p>Unlike the previous four jhana factors,
        one-pointedness is not specifically mentioned in the
        standard formula for the first jhana, but it is included
        among the jhana factors by the Mahavedalla Sutta
        (M.i,294) as well as in the Abhidhamma and the
        commentaries. One-pointedness is a universal mental
        concomitant, the factor by virtue of which the mind is
        centered upon its object. It brings the mind to a single
        point, the point occupied by the object. </p>
        <p>One-pointedness is used in the text as a synonym for
        concentration (samadhi) which has the characteristic of
        non-distraction, the function of eliminating
        distractions, non-wavering as its manifestation, and
        happiness as its proximate cause (Vism.85; PP.85). As a
        jhana factor one-pointedness is always directed to a
        wholesome object and wards off unwholesome influences, in
        particular the hindrance of sensual desire. As the
        hindrances are absent in jhana one-pointedness acquires
        special strength, based on the previous sustained effort
        of concentration. </p>
        <p>Besides the five jhana factors, the first jhana
        contains a great number of other mental factors
        functioning in unison as coordinate members of a single
        state of consciousness. Already the Anupada Sutta lists
        such additional components of the first jhana as contact,
        feeling, perception, volition, consciousness, desire,
        decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity and attention
        (M.iii,25). In the Abhidhamma literature this is extended
        still further up to thirty-three indispensable
        components. Nevertheless, only five states are called the
        factors of the first jhana, for only these have the
        functions of inhibiting the five hindrances and fixing
        the mind in absorption. For the jhana to arise all these
        five factors must be present simultaneously, exercising
        their special operations: </p>
        <p>But applied thought directs the mind onto the object;
        sustained thought keeps it anchored there. Happiness
        [rapture] produced by the success of the effort refreshes
        the mind whose effort has succeeded through not being
        distracted by those hindrances; and bliss [happiness]
        intensifies it for the same reason. Then unification
        aided by this directing onto, this anchoring, this
        refreshing and this intensifying, evenly and rightly
        centers the mind with its remaining associated states on
        the object consisting in unity. Consequently possession
        of five factors should be understood as the arising of
        these five, namely, applied thought, sustained thought,
        happiness [rapture], bliss [happiness], and unification
        of mind. For it is when these are arisen that jhana is
        said to be arisen, which is why they are called the five
        factors of possession. (Vism.146;PP.152) </p>
        <p>Each jhana factor serves as support for the one which
        succeeds it. Applied thought must direct the mind to its
        object in order for sustained thought to anchor it there.
        Only when the mind is anchored can the interest develop
        which will culminate in rapture. As rapture develops it
        brings happiness to maturity, and this spiritual
        happiness, by providing an alternative to the fickle
        pleasures of the senses, aids the growth of
        one-pointedness. In this way, as Nagasena explains, all
        the other wholesome states lead to concentration, which
        stands at their head like the apex on the roof of a house
        (Miln. 38-39). </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>Perfecting the First
        Jhana</strong></font> </p>
        <p>The difference between access and absorption
        concentration, as we have said, does not lie in the
        absence of the hindrances, which is common to both, but
        in the relative strength of the jhana factors. In access
        the factors are weak so that concentration is fragile,
        comparable to a child who walks a few steps and then
        falls down. But in absorption the jhana factors are
        strong and well developed so that the mind can remain
        continuously in concentration just as a healthy man can
        remain standing on his feet for a whole day and night
        (Vism.126; PP.131). </p>
        <p>Because full absorption offers the benefit of
        strengthened concentration, a meditator who gains access
        is encouraged to strive for the attainment of jhana. To
        develop his practice several important measures are
        recommended. [8] The meditator should live in a suitable
        dwelling, rely upon a suitable alms resort, avoid
        profitless talk, associate only with spiritually-minded
        companions, make use only of suitable food, live in a
        congenial climate, and maintain his practice in a
        suitable posture. He should also cultivate the ten kinds
        of skill in absorption. He should clean his lodging and
        his physical body so that they conduce to clear
        meditation, balance his spiritual faculties by seeing
        that faith is balanced with wisdom and energy with
        concentration, and he must be skillful in producing and
        developing the sign of concentration (1-3). He should
        exert the mind when it is slack, restrain it when it is
        agitated, encourage it when it is restless or dejected,
        and look at the mind with equanimity when all is
        proceeding well (4-7). The meditator should avoid
        distracting persons, should approach people experienced
        in concentration, and should be firm in his resolution to
        attain jhana (8-10). </p>
        <p>After attaining the first jhana a few times the
        meditator is not advised to set out immediately striving
        for the second jhana. This would be a foolish and
        profitless spiritual ambition. Before he is prepared to
        make the second jhana the goal of his endeavor he must
        first bring the first jhana to perfection. If he is too
        eager to reach the second jhana before he has perfected
        the first, he is likely to fail to gain the second and
        find himself unable to regain the first. The Buddha
        compares such a meditator to a foolish cow who, while
        still unfamiliar with her own pasture, sets out for new
        pastures and gets lost in the mountains: she fails to
        find food or drink and is unable to find her way home
        (A.iv, 418-19). </p>
        <p>The perfecting of the first jhana involves two steps:
        the extension of the sign and the achievement of the five
        masteries. The extension of the sign means extending the
        size of the counterpart sign, the object of the jhana.
        Beginning with a small area, the size of one or two
        fingers, the meditator gradually learns to broaden the
        sign until the mental image can be made to cover the
        world-sphere or even beyond (Vism. 152-53; PP.158-59). </p>
        <p>Following this the meditator should try to acquire
        five kinds of mastery over the jhana: mastery in
        adverting, in attaining, in resolving, in emerging and in
        reviewing. [9] Mastery in adverting is the ability to
        advert to the jhana factors one by one after emerging
        from the jhana, wherever he wants, whenever he wants, and
        for as long as he wants. Mastery in attaining is the
        ability to enter upon jhana quickly, mastery in resolving
        the ability to remain in the jhana for exactly the
        pre-determined length of time, mastery in emerging the
        ability to emerge from jhana quickly without difficulty,
        and mastery in reviewing the ability to review the jhana
        and its factors with retrospective knowledge immediately
        after adverting to them. When the meditator has achieved
        this fivefold mastery, then he is ready to strive for the
        second jhana. </p>
        <p><em><strong>Notes:<br>
        </strong></em>[1] Buddhaghosa ascribes the passage he
        cites in support of the correspondence to the
        &quot;Petaka,&quot; but it cannot be traced anywhere in
        the present Tipitaka, nor in the exegetical work named
        Petakopadesa. <br>
        [2] The other two types of abandoning are by substitution
        of opposites (tadangappahana), which means the
        replacement of unwholesome states by wholesome ones
        specifically opposed to them, and abandoning by
        eradication (samucchedappahana), the final destruction of
        defilements by the supramundane paths. See
        Vism.693-96;PP.812-16. <br>

        hindrances. <br>
        [4] Ven Nanamoli, in his translation of the
        Visuddhimagga, renders piti by &quot;happiness,&quot; but
        this rendering can be misleading since most translators
        use &quot;happiness&quot; as a rendering for sukha, the
        pleasurable feeling present in the jhana. We will render
        piti by &quot;rapture,&quot; thus maintaining the
        connection of the term with ecstatic meditative
        experience. <br>
