    <blockquote>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The jhanas do not arise out of a void but in
        dependence on the right conditions. They come to growth
        only when provided with the nutriments conductive to
        their development. Therefore, prior to beginning
        meditation, the aspirant to the jhanas must prepare a
        groundwork for his practice by fulfilling certain
        preliminary requirements. He first must endeavor to
        purify his moral virtue, sever the outer impediments to
        practice, and place himself under a qualified teacher who
        will assign him a suitable meditation subject and explain
        to him the methods of developing it. After learning these
        the disciple must then seek out a congenial dwelling and
        diligently strive for success. In this chapter we will
        examine in order each of the preparatory steps that have
        to be fulfilled before commencing to develop jhana. </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>The Moral Foundation for
        Jhana</strong></font> </p>
        <p>A disciple aspiring to the jhanas first has to lay a
        solid foundation of moral discipline. Moral purity is
        indispensable to meditative progress for several deeply
        psychological reasons. It is needed first, in order to
        safeguard against the danger of remorse, the nagging
        sense of guilt that arises when the basic principles of
        morality are ignored or deliberately violated. Scrupulous
        conformity to virtuous rules of conduct protects the
        mediator from this danger disruptive to inner calm, and
        brings joy and happiness when the mediator reflects upon
        the purity of his conduct (see A.v,1-7). </p>
        <p>A second reason a moral foundation is needed for
        meditation follows from an understanding of the purpose
        of concentration. Concentration, in the Buddhist
        discipline, aims at providing a base for wisdom by
        cleansing the mind of the dispersive influence of the
        defilements. But in order for the concentration exercises
        to effectively combat the defilements, the coarser
        expressions of the latter through bodily and verbal
        action first have to be checked. Moral transgressions
        being invariably motivated by defilements -- by greed,
        hatred and delusion -- when a person acts in violation of
        the precepts of morality he excites and reinforces the
        very same mental factors his practice of meditation is
        intended to eliminate. This involves him in a crossfire
        of incompatible aims which renders his attempts at mental
        purification ineffective. The only way he can avoid
        frustration in his endeavor to purify the mind of its
        subtler defilements is to prevent the unwholesome inner
        impulses from breathing out in the coarser form of
        unwholesome bodily and verbal deeds. Only when he
        establishes control over the outer expression of the
        defilements can he turn to deal with them inwardly as
        mental obsessions that appear in the process of
        meditation. </p>
        <p>The practice of moral discipline consists negatively
        in abstinence from immoral actions of body and speech and
        positively in the observance of ethical principles
        promoting peace within oneself and harmony in one's
        relations with others. The basic code of moral discipline
        taught by the Buddha for the guidance of his lay
        followers is the five precepts: abstinence from taking
        life, from stealing, from sexual misconduct, from false
        speech, and from intoxicating drugs and drinks. These
        principles are bindings as minimal ethical obligations
        for all practitioners of the Buddhist path, and within
        their bounds considerable progress in meditation can be
        made. However, those aspiring to reach the higher levels
        of jhanas and to pursue the path further to the stages of
        liberation, are encouraged to take up the more complete
        moral discipline pertaining to the life of renunciation.
        Early Buddhism is unambiguous in its emphasis on the
        limitations of household life for following the path in
        its fullness and perfection. Time and again the texts say
        that the household life is confining, a &quot;path for
        the dust of passion,&quot; while the life of homelessness
        is like open space. Thus a disciple who is fully intent
        upon making rapid progress towards Nibbana will when
        outer conditions allow for it, &quot;shave off his hair
        and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the
        home life into homelessness&quot; (M.i,179). </p>
        <p>The moral training for the bhikkhus or monks has been
        arranged into a system called the fourfold purification
        of morality (catuparisuddhisila).[1] The first component
        of this scheme, its backbone, consists in the morality of
        restraint according to the Patimokkha, the code of 227
        training precepts promulgated by the Buddha to regulate
        the conduct of the Sangha or monastic order. Each of
        these rules is in some way intended to facilitate control
        over the defilements and to induce a mode of living
        marked by harmlessness, contentment and simplicity. The
        second aspect of the monk's moral discipline is restraint
        of the senses, by which the monk maintains close
        watchfulness over his mind as he engages in sense
        contacts so that he does not give rise to desire for
        pleasurable objects and aversion towards repulsive ones.
        Third, the monk is to live by a purified livelihood,
        obtaining his basic requisites such as robes food,
        lodgings and medicines in ways consistent with his
        vocation. The fourth factor of the moral training is
        proper use of the requisites, which means that the monk
        should reflect upon the purposes for which he makes use
        of his requisites and should employ them only for
        maintaining his health and comfort, not for luxury and
        enjoyment. </p>
        <p>After establishing a foundation of purified morality,
        the aspirant to meditation is advised to cut off any
        outer impediments (palibodha) that may hinder his efforts
        to lead a contemplative life. These impediments are
        numbered as ten: a dwelling, which becomes an impediment
        for those who allow their minds to become preoccupied
        with its upkeep or with its appurtenances; a family of
        relatives or supporters with whom the aspirant may become
        emotionally involved in ways that hinder his progress;
        gains, which may bind the monk by obligation to those who
        offer them; a class of students who must be instructed;
        building work, which demands time and attention; travel;
        kin, meaning parents, teachers, pupils or close friends;
        illness; the study of scriptures; and supernormal powers,
        which are an impediment to insight (Vism.90-97;
        PP.91-98). </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>The Good Friend and the
        Subject of Meditation</strong></font> </p>
        <p>The path of practice leading to the jhanas is an
        arduous course involving precise techniques and
        skillfulness is needed in dealing with the pitfalls that
        lie along the way. The knowledge of how to attain the
        jhanas has been transmitted through a lineage of teachers
        going back to the time of the Buddha himself. A
        prospective meditator is advised to avail himself of the
        living heritage of accumulated knowledge and experience
        by placing himself under the care of a qualified teacher,
        described as a &quot;good friend&quot; (kalyanamitta),
        one who gives guidance and wise advice rooted in his own
        practice and experience. On the basis of either of the
        power of penetrating others minds, or by personal
        observation, or by questioning, the teacher will size up
        the temperament of his new pupil and then select a
        mediation subject for him appropriate to his temperament.
        </p>
        <p>The various meditation subjects that the Buddha
        prescribed for the development of serenity have been
        collected in the commentaries into a set called the forty
        kammatthana. This word means literally a place of work,
        and is applied to the subject of meditation as the place
        where the meditator undertakes the work of meditation.
        The <em><strong>forty meditation subjects</strong></em>
        are distributed into seven categories, enumerated in the
        Visuddhimagga as follows: <em><strong>ten kasinas, ten
        kinds of foulness, ten recollections, four divine
        abidings, four immaterial states, one perception, and one
        defining</strong></em>.[2] </p>
        <p>A <em><strong>kasina</strong></em> is a device
        representing a particular quality used as a support for
        concentration. The ten kasinas are those of earth, water,
        fire and air; four color kasinas -- blue, yellow, red and
        white; the light kasina and the limited space kasina. The
        kasina can be either a naturally occurring form of the
        element or color chosen, or an artificially produced
        device such as a disk that the meditator can use at his
        convenience in his meditation quarters. </p>
        <p>The <em><strong>ten kinds of foulness</strong></em>
        are ten stages in the decomposition of a corpse: the
        bloated, the livid, the festering, the cut-up, the
        gnawed, the scattered, the hacked and scattered, the
        bleeding, the worm-infested and a skeleton. The primary
        purpose of these meditations is to reduce sensual lust by
        gaining a clear perception of the repulsiveness of the
        body. </p>
        <p>The <em><strong>ten recollections</strong></em> are
        the recollections of the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha,
        morality, generosity and the deities, mindfulness of
        death, mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of breathing,
        and the recollection of peace. The first three are
        devotional contemplations on the sublime qualities of the
        &quot;Three Jewels,&quot; the primary objects of Buddhist
        virtues and on the deities inhabiting the heavenly
        worlds, intended principally for those still intent on a
        higher rebirth. Mindfulness of death is reflection on the
        inevitably of death, a constant spur to spiritual
        exertion. Mindfulness of the body involves the mental
        dissection of the body into thirty-two parts, undertaken
        with a view to perceiving its unattractiveness.
        Mindfulness of breathing is awareness of the in-and-out
        movement of the breath, perhaps the most fundamental of
        all Buddhist meditation subjects. And the recollection of
        peace is reflection on the qualities of Nibbana. </p>
        <p>The <em><strong>four divine abidings</strong></em>
        (brahmavihara) are the development of boundless
        loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and
        equanimity. These meditations are also called the
        &quot;immeasurables&quot; (appamanna) because they are to
        be developed towards all sentient beings without
        qualification or exclusiveness. </p>
        <p>The <em><strong>four immaterial states</strong></em>
        are the base of boundless space, the base of boundless
        consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of
        neither-perception-nor-non-perception. These are the
        objects leading to the corresponding meditative
        attainments, the immaterial jhanas. </p>
        <p>The <em><strong>one perception</strong></em> is the
        perception of the repulsiveness of food. The one defining
        is the defining of the four elements, that is, the
        analysis of the physical body into the elemental modes of
        solidity, fluidity, heat and oscillation. </p>
        <p>The forty meditation subjects are treated in the
        commentarial texts from two important angles -- one their
        ability to induce different levels of concentration, the
        other their suitability for differing temperaments. Not
        all meditation subjects are equally effective in inducing
        the deeper levels of concentration. They are first
        distinguished on the basis of their capacity for inducing
        only access concentration or for inducing full
        absorption; those capable of inducing absorption are then
        distinguished further according to their ability to
        induce the different levels of jhana. </p>
        <p>Of the forty subjects, ten are capable of leading only
        to access concentration: eight recollections -- i.e. all
        except mindfulness of the body and mindfulness of
        breathing -- plus the perception of repulsiveness in
        nutriment and the defining of the four elements. These,
        because they are occupied with a diversity of qualities
        and involve and active application of discursive thought,
        cannot lead beyond access. The other thirty subjects can
        all lead to absorption. </p>
        <p>The ten kasinas and mindfulness of breathing, owing to
        their simplicity and freedom from thought construction,
        can lead to all four jhanas. The ten kinds of foulness
        and mindfulness of the body lead only to the first jhana,
        being limited because the mind can only hold onto them
        with the aid of applied thought (vitakka) which is absent
        in the second and higher jhanas. The first three divine
        abidings can induce the lower three jhanas but the
        fourth, since they arise in association with pleasant
        feeling, while the divine abiding of equanimity occurs
        only at the level of the fourth jhana, where neutral
        feeling gains ascendency. The four immaterial states
        conduce to the respective immaterial jhanas corresponding
        to their names. </p>
        <p>The forty subjects are also differentiated according
        to their appropriateness for different character types.
        Six main character types are recognized -- the greedy,
        the hating, the deluded, the faithful, the intelligent
        and the speculative -- this oversimplified typology being
        taken only as a pragmatic guideline which in practice
        admits various shades and combinations. The ten kind of
        foulness and mindfulness of the body, clearly intended to
        attenuate sensual desire, are suitable for those of
        greedy temperament. Eight subjects -- the four divine
        abidings and four color kasinas -- are appropriate for
        the hating temperament. Mindfulness of breathing is
        suitable for those of the deluded and the speculative
        temperament. The first six recollections are appropriate
        for the faithful temperament. Four subjects --
        mindfulness of death, the recollection of peace, the
        defining of the four elements, and the perception of the
        repulsiveness in nutriment -- are especially effective
        for those of intelligent temperament. The remaining six
        kasinas and the immaterial states are suitable for all
        kinds of temperaments. But the kasinas should be limited
        in size for one of speculative temperament and large in
        size for one of deluded temperament. </p>
        <p>Immediately after giving this breakdown Buddhaghosa
        adds a proviso to prevent misunderstanding. He states
        that this division by way of temperament is made on the
        basis of direct opposition and complete suitability, but
        actually there is no wholesome form of meditation that
        does not suppress the defilements and strengthen the
        virtuous mental factors. Thus an individual mediator may
        be advised to meditate on foulness to abandon lust, on
        loving-kindness to abandon hatred, on breathing to cut
        off discursive thought, and on impermanence to eliminate
        the conceit &quot;I am&quot; (A.iv,358). </p>
        <p><font color="#800080"><strong>Choosing a Suitable
        Dwelling</strong></font> </p>
        <p>The teacher assigns a meditation subject to his pupil
        appropriate to his character and explains the methods of
        developing it. He can teach it gradually to a pupil who
        is going to remain in close proximity to him, or in
        detail to one who will go to practice it elsewhere. If
        the disciple is not going to stay with his teacher he
        must be careful to select a suitable place for
        meditation. The texts mention eighteen kinds of
        monasteries unfavorable to the development of jhana: a
        large monastery, a new one, a dilapidated one, one near a
        road, one with a pond, leaves, flowers or fruits, one
        sought after by many people, one in cities, among timber
        of fields, where people quarrel, in a port, in border
        lands, on a frontier, a haunted place, and one without
        access to a spiritual teacher (Vism. 118-121; PP122-125).
        </p>
        <p>The factors which make a dwelling favorable to
        meditation are mentioned by the Buddha himself. If should
        not be too far from or too near a village that can be
        relied on as an alms resort, and should have a clear
        path: it should be quiet and secluded; it should be free
        from rough weather and from harmful insects and animals;
        one should be able to obtain one's physical requisites
        while dwelling there; and the dwelling should provide
        ready access to learned elders and spiritual friends who
        can be consulted when problems arise in meditation
        (A.v,15). The types of dwelling places commended by the
        Buddha most frequently in the suttas as conductive to the
        jhanas are a secluded dwelling in the forest, at the foot
        of a tree, on a mountain, in a cleft, in a cave, in a
        cemetery, on a wooded flatland, in the open air, or on a
        heap of straw (M.i,181). Having found a suitable dwelling
        and settled there, the disciple should maintain
        scrupulous observance of the rules of discipline, He
        should be content with his simple requisites, exercise
        control over his sense faculties, be mindful and
        discerning in all activities, and practice meditation
        diligently as he was instructed. It is at this point that
        he meets the first great challenge of his contemplative
        life, the battle with the five hindrances. </p>
