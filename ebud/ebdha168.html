  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">A</font>t the risk of
    oversimplification, I would like to propose that each of the world's great religions
    consists of two main aspects, namely that of universal love, which is altruistic and
    selfless on the one hand, and a tribal, institutionalized, or egocentric factor on the
    other. If we are not careful, our religion can become very fundamentalistic and
    intolerant, and we will find ourselves believing that we are the only ones on the true and
    righteous path to salvation, while all others are merely misguided souls. It is a great
    temptation to compete with other religions and rationalize that ours is better rather than
    to work towards peaceful co-existence and cooperation.</font><p><font
    face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, some religions are still hunting for converts using
    crass and destructive ideologies. I'd like to quote a passage from Overseas Missionary
    Fellowship (August-September, 1987). The article is called &quot;Finding True Freedom in
    Thailand&quot;:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For ninety-nine percent of the Thais, bondage to demons
    brings the greatest fear... This is true for animistic tribesmen, prosperous merchants,
    enlightened graduates or stolid farmers... revealed in conversation, TV soap operas,
    adornments to people's person or property... Nothing and no one has been able to remove
    permanently the inner anxiety that man, in manipulating the spiritual forces, can also
    become their victim.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The conclusion you are led to, if you read the article, is
    that the Thais must be saved by Christian missionaries, or that as a tribe, they must be
    saved by US aid! I feel that people who stick with religions or ideologies such as these
    either are or become unable to respect other people, especially the poor, who may be proud
    of their religions and are no less advanced spiritually than these would-be evangelists.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Indeed tribalism in itself should not be a derogatory
    term, but when a world religion or superpower becomes tribal, it can easily degenerate
    into hypocrisy and arrogance and can even lead to racism, as one can see clearly in South
    Africa and elsewhere.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, if we concentrate on the religious aspects of
    universal love, we shall all become more humble, tolerant and truly respectful of other
    beings--not only human, but animal, and all natural phenomena as well. From this, our
    social and economic development will be nonviolent. We will not be cruel to fellow human
    beings or to mother earth. Nor will we plunder our natural resources in the name of
    progress. Forests will be saved, rivers will be free of pollution. And we will realize
    that development can only occur at a pace at which humans and other beings matter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to get rid of tribalism in religious
    institutions, nationalism, and even consumerism and capitalism, the faithful have to
    practice their religion with universal love. While we act individually and locally, we
    must think globally, so that selfishness can slowly become selflessness. Only then can one
    respect other religions and ideologies wholeheartedly. Although you may not agree entirely
    with those of different views and beliefs, you can certainly respect them. Even if they
    are your oppressors you need not hate them because that hatred is also harmful to you.
    Instead of hating an oppressor one should try to understand the oppressive system and try
    one's best to change it with the help of good friends who want to help one to overcome
    suffering and obstacles in the way of cultural and spiritual development--as well as
    social and economic development. If these four aspects of development; the cultural,
    spiritual, social and economic, could be integrated, then there could be real human
    development.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, over the past two centuries, universal love
    in world religions has declined so much that merely institutional religions seem to be, on
    the whole, the norm. Most churches tolerate or support the political status quo no matter
    how oppressive the present regimes may be. (There are of course exceptions). And since the
    rise of capitalism, Protestantism, Catholicism, Buddhism and Hinduism seem to cater to the
    rich, while religious leaders pay lip service to the poor. At best, they offer some social
    welfare to the needy, but there have not been enough prophetic voices to transform the
    social and economic order to be more just and peaceful for all humankind. The rate of
    child malnutrition is on the rise, as is prostitution and sex tourism as well as
    militarism, materialism and consumerism. Some religious leaders have tried to work with
    secular leaders to made the world a more meaningful and peaceful place but so far we have
    been unable to establish widespread basic changes which would ensure basic human rights
    for all and protect people from political and religious exploitation. Tibet, Burma and
    Bangladesh may be extreme cases, but such suffering, to lesser degrees, exists everywhere.
    And as well, the lack of food, shelter, clothing and medicine for the majority of people
    in many countries is appalling--not to mention the suffering caused by polluted air and
    water.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Indeed the rise of the secular intellectual has been a key
    factor in shaping the modern world. Seen through the long perspective of history it is in
    many ways a new phenomenon. It is true that in their earlier incarnations as priests,
    scribes and soothsayers, intellectuals have guided society from the very beginning;
    however, their moral and ideological innovations were limited by the cannons of external
    authority and by the inheritance of tradition. They were not, and could not be, free
    spirits, or adventurers of the mind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With the decline of priestly power since the eighteenth
    century, a new kind of mentor emerged to fill the vacuum and capture the ear of society.
    The secular intellectual might be a deist, a skeptic or an atheist. But they have been
    just as ready as any pontiff or presbyter to tell humankind how to conduct its affairs.
    They have proclaimed, from the start, a special devotion to the interests of humanity and
    an evangelical duty to advance them by their teaching. And they have brought to their
    self-appointed task a far more radical approach than their clerical predecessors as they
    have felt themselves bound by no corpus of revealed religion. The collective wisdom of the
    past, the legacy of tradition, and the prescriptive codes of ancestral experience existed
    to be selectively followed or wholly rejected as his own good sense might decide.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the first time in human history, and with growing
    confidence and audacity, people have arisen and claimed that they could diagnose the ills
    of society and cure them with their own intellects: moreover, that they could devise
    formulae that, if followed, would not only change the structure of society, but the
    fundamental habits of human beings for the better. Unlike their sacerdotal predecessors,
    they were not servants and interpreters of the gods but substitutes. Their hero was
    Prometheus who stole the celestial fire and brought it to earth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the most marked characteristics of the new secular
    intellectuals has been the relish with which they have scrutinized religion and its
    protagonists.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The intellectuals have examined how far these great
    systems of faith have aided or harmed humanity and to what extent these secular popes and
    pastors have lived up to their precepts, of purity and truthfulness, and of charity and
    benevolence. The verdicts they have pronounced on both churches and clergy have been
    harsh.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Over the last two centuries, the influence of religion has
    continued to decline and secular intellectuals have played an ever-growing role in shaping
    our attitudes and institutions. Yet when examining the records of these great
    intellectuals who have shaped the world since the French and Russian revolution right
    through to the cultural revolution in China and the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia, I have
    come to the sad conclusion that the secular high priests, too, have all failed us--whether
    he be a Rousseau, Karl Marx, Tolstoy, Brecht, Bertrand Russell or Mao Tse-Tung.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In particular, if we focus on their moral and judgemental
    credentials as intellectuals fit to tell humankind how to conduct itself, the way these
    secular intellectuals ran their own lives, and their relationships with family, friends
    and associates were, on the whole, appalling--not to mention their sexual and financial
    dealings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One must also ask whether they told us the truth, and how
    their systems stood up to the test of time and praxis. Indeed it seems that they all
    contributed so much to the suffering of humankind, although it is also true that they may
    have helped to create some beautiful literature and sharpened our way of thinking
    somewhat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In my opinion, the secular gods failed because they too
    became intolerant and arrogant. In many cases, ideas and the direction of humanity became
    more important to them than the individual men and women they encountered. They too lacked
    the commitment of personal transformation, although Tolstoy tried but failed. Yet he had a
    direct positive influence on Gandhi and Martin Luther King.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a Thai, I regard my national hero, Phya Anuman
    Rajadhon, whose centenary was recognized by UNESCO last year, as more important than the
    world's leading intellectuals, even though he was not as well-known, nor a great genius.
    He was so humble and so selfless that he regarded himself as an ordinary man who had time
    to respect everyone, and encouraged others to be better than he. Yet, he could live in,
    explore and preserve his national culture, as well as integrate it meaningfully with those
    of our neighbours. I feel that if we know our limits and respect others we will usually
    not go wrong. We should develop individually and socially by understanding and
    appreciating our cultures--including our spiritual traditions and then economic
    development will not result in such a wide gap between the rich and the poor, with neither
    the rich nor the poor being happy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although Buddhism with a capital &quot;B&quot; can be
    tribal in a very negative sense and can legitimize dictatorial regimes or immoral
    multinational corporations, if we were to direct our efforts towards universal love, we
    could spell it with a small &quot;b&quot;. Thus we should try to follow the Buddha, as our
    Christian friends try to follow Christ and our Muslim friends submit their egos entirely
    to God.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first law of buddhism with a small &quot;b&quot;
    should read like this, &quot;Do not be idolatrous about, or bound to, any doctrine, theory
    or ideology, even Buddhist ones. All systems of thought are guiding means; they are not
    absolute truths&quot; (The First Tiep Hien Precept).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This would certainly be in sharp contrast to the dogmatic
    teachings of quite a number of secular intellectuals who contributed to revolutions,
    upheavals and human sufferings in the past.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, writes:
    &quot;If you have a gun, you can shoot one, two, three, five people, but if you have an
    ideology and stick to it, thinking it is the absolute truth, you can kill millions...
    Peace can only be achieved when we are not attached to a view, when we are free from
    fanaticism.&quot; The more you understand this and try to practice it, the more you will
    appreciate the importance of a diversity of religions and beliefs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we are truly of good will, then to unite those of
    different views we must not avoid contact with suffering, but find ways to be with those
    who suffer. We must also avoid accumulating wealth while millions are hungry. These may
    not be high ideals but if we practice them it may result in a consciousness of and a
    precedent for social justice and peace work. However, in order to do so with awareness, we
    should, in the words of Thich Nhat Hanh, &quot;not lose ourselves in dispersion and in our
    surroundings.&quot; We should &quot;learn to practice breathing in order to regain
    composure of the body and mind, to practice mindfulness, and to develop concentration and
    understanding.&quot; This approach to development is nondualistic, in that one must be
    peace to make peace in the world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We should stress the continuity of &quot;inner&quot; and
    &quot;outer,&quot; calling the world our &quot;large self&quot; so that we become it
    actively and care for it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I hope this concept will help guide us in our work on
    social justice and peace issues and will challenge each person to examine his or her
    behavior in relation to the needs of the larger community while freeing him or her from
    limiting patterns. I believe this concept is relevant to the growth of mind, spirit and
    body--the whole of human development.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To me, in order to build understanding and respect between
    people of diverse religions or beliefs, one needs an alternative to living by ideology.
    Socially engaged spirituality must be free from the bondage of ideology. As one person put
    it: &quot;The greatest religious problem today is how to be both a mystic and a militant;
    in other words, how to combine the search for an expansion of inner awareness with
    effective social action, and how to find one's true identity in both.&quot;./.</font></p>
