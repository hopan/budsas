      three or four days on a meditation retreat, most of us are over the worst. 
      We tend to look a lot brighter and happier than when the retreat began. 
      That’s the result of three or four days of looking inwardly and of being 
      with ourselves. However horrible we might feel about ourselves, we get 
      close to that feeling and actually listen to our heart and mind. Then some 
      lovely things happen and we begin to relax. It’s not an easy thing to do 
      but we begin to be more accepting of all the pain, of all the suffering, 
      that we usually tend to put aside.<P>
      We never seem to have the time to be friendly towards ourselves. It 
      doesn’t seem like an important thing to do — to have the time and the 
      space to live in harmony with ourselves. So when we go on retreat what a 
      wonderful opportunity to be able to open up, to be able to listen, and 
      perhaps to understand a bit more profoundly the nature of our mind, the 
      nature of our thoughts, of our feelings and perceptions. We have the 
      chance now to realise that we only feel limited and bound by them because 
      we rarely have the opportunity to pay attention to or investigate and 
      question their reality, their true nature.<P>
      At the beginning of a talk like this, we have a tradition, we 
      acknowledge the Three Refuges: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. When we become a 
      monastic, a homeless one, we trade our home and we get Three Refuges. So 
      we’re not totally homeless. We actually take three very secure refuges and 
      we leave behind all that we suppose to be safe, that which we assume to be 
      protective and secure. We leave behind home, family, money, the control of 
      our lives, the control over the people we live with, the place we actually 
      stay — we let go of all that. And in return, we take the Three Refuges.<P>
      Now, in my experience these refuges do not mean very much at first. I 
      didn’t quite understand what they were about. Several times a year, we 
      have Buddhist festivals and ceremonies. We follow a lovely custom on those 
      days. We meditate through the night and before the all-night vigil we 
      slowly walk around the monastery three times, holding a candle, some 
      incense and some flowers in our hands. Monastics and lay people walk 
      together, silently around the monastery contemplating the Three Refuges, 
      the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. It’s very beautiful and inspiring 
      sight.<P>
      At first I didn’t know what this really meant. I would reflect on the 
      Buddha and just get a blank in my mind; reflect on the Dhamma, another 
      blank; reflect on the Sangha, another blank. I didn’t panic though. I 
      realised that there must be something that I was not doing right and I 
      wasn’t in a hurry to get it right. I felt at that moment that I had a 
      whole lifetime to understand this. So I just relaxed considering that the 
      Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha wasn’t something I had to think about. I knew 
      somehow that those refuges were in the human heart and perhaps as I 
      practised I would come to know what they meant.<P>
      I think what brings many of us to be interested in the practice of 
      meditation is the need to understand ourselves, the need to clarify the 
      confusion we live in. Many of us want to be free; we want to understand, 
      we want to realise, to see for ourselves what it’s all about. We are fed 
      up with books; we’ve read enough; we’ve listened enough; we’ve met enough 
      wise people. We’ve done everything we could to understand and yet that 
      didn’t seem to be sufficient.<P>
      Second-hand knowledge somehow is not really satisfactory. We want to 
      experience for ourselves what all these wise people and all the wise 
      teachings are saying. As long as there’s no realization of the truth of 
      our mind there’s no real understanding. It’s difficult to taste the joy 
      and the freedom of knowing, experiencing the Buddha’s teaching for oneself 
      — what’s known as insight, seeing directly the true nature of our mind and 
      body and realising the freedom experienced when we let go of any 
      attachments.<P>
      At the beginning of the practice, at the beginning of the path, we 
      still tend to look for a form of happiness. We all want to be happy, don’t 
      we? Who wants to be miserable? We all want to be free and to experience 
      pleasure. I certainly didn’t want to come to the monastery to be miserable 
      and experience suffering. When I came, I was quite certain the practice of 
      meditation would make me happier and give me a lot of pleasure. Happiness 
      was pleasure. And that’s something we should take into account.<P>
      The practice is not here to make us suffer. We only suffer because we 
      haven’t practised properly, because we haven’t done what is necessary to 
      let go of ignorance, to let go of our attachments. So it’s important to 
      take this into account. We should not imagine that because we are 
      practising we have to be terribly serious and feel that unless we 
      experience some terrible pain or hardship that somehow something is not 
      quite right.<P>
      That kind of idea made me suffer quite a lot at the beginning of my 
      training. I had the impression that unless I went through some kind of 
      hardship I would not be able to let go. And it’s true that more often than 
      not unless it hurts our ignorance is not acknowledged. If it doesn’t hurt, 
      we can go on forever without really being aware of it. This seems to be 
      our human predicament. Unless something hurts, we don’t really wake up, we 
      don’t open our eyes and look.<P>
      So everyday we recite the Three Refuges as a reminder because out of 
      habit, we tend to take refuge in things like anger and worry. We tend to 
      take refuge in self-pity or pleasure, distraction, obsession with 
      ourselves or wanting to sleep or eat all the time. We take a lot of refuge 
      in food, don’t we? And then we take refuge in feeling guilty about eating. 
      So our tendency is to take refuge in the wrong things, things that makes 
      us unhappy. And if we didn’t have reminders, if we didn’t have skillful 
      means to bring back into consciousness what’s really important in life, we 
      would forget ourselves and never see the way out of suffering.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080">Refuge in the Buddha</FONT></B></P>
      <P ALIGN="justify"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The refuge in the Buddha 
      is the refuge in the knowing. The Buddha knows the world — which in 
      Buddhism does not mean the world of mountains, rivers and trees but the 
      world that arises in our mind and body and the suffering that we create 
      out of ignorance.<P>
      In our daily chanting we say that the Buddha knows the world, he knows 
      the arising of the world, the ending of the world; he knows the way the 
      mind creates the realities we live in, the universe we navigate through. 
      By going through the process, we also begin to see clearly the path that 
      leads us out of suffering. Somebody asked me today, &quot;Who is the one who 
      knows? Who is the one who is aware?&quot; A good question, isn’t it? Because I 
      can’t find anybody being aware, can you? I tried for a long time to find 
      someone who was aware in me. I finally gave up. I remember when I did a 
      meditation retreat with a well-known Burmese teacher, a long time ago, 
      somebody was talking about &quot;Who was the one who knows. Who is it?&quot; One of 
      the assistant teachers said: &quot;A super consciousness.&quot; I really liked that 
      at the time; the one who knows was a super consciousness.<P>
      So I imagined my brain to be lots of little, sort of 
      mini-consciousnesses, with a kind of umbrella on top, a super 
      consciousness. I felt really good; I really got the feeling I knew 
      something about this Buddha, this Buddha mind, the ‘one who knows.’ But 
      unfortunately, the nature of the mind being what it is, after about two or 
      three days I began to question and doubt, because that’s the natural 
      process. As soon as we get an answer, we can be sure we are going to get a 
      doubt. This is the way it goes.<P>
      And ever since I have made peace with the fact that maybe there is 
      nobody who knows. Just knowing — that seemed to be fine. Knowing seems to 
      to be able to carry on functioning with or without my doubts. Without 
      having an answer, I can still take refuge in being the ‘knower,’ being the 
      one who’s aware, who can see.<P>
      Even so, sometimes we can make a big problem out of it. We can create 
      somebody who knows and then get upset because we’ve got somebody who 
      doesn’t know. We get disappointed when we haven’t got somebody who knows 
      in there, inside of us. And maybe we get overjoyed when we find someone 
      who is aware. See, again it’s the swings of pleasure and pain, happiness 
      and unhappiness. But the One who knows is that very factor that balances 
      out those extreme swings of the mind. The ‘One who knows’ is what is 
      called the Middle Way.<P>
      We can see the extremes of the mind, happiness, unhappiness, pleasure 
      and pain, inspiration and despair. We can see hope and depression. We can 
      see praise and blame. We can see agitation, sleepiness, boredom, the whole 
      lot. And that seeing is a balancing factor, because we become aware of our 
      attachments to these moods, these states of mind. Without a refuge in the 
      knowing, in the awakened mind we’d never be able look at the mind; we’d be 
      lost in confusion. So the refuge in knowing is very important.<P>
      Together, the refuges are called the Three Jewels — and they are really 
      like beautiful jewels that we can go back to whenever there is confusion, 
      whenever there is agitation. We can always go back and take refuge in 
      knowing those states. We don’t have to think about them, we don’t have to 
      psychoanalyse ourselves. We can actually go back to the knowing. And what 
      happens then is that we see what the Buddha saw: impermanence. We can see 
      that these states are not worth holding onto because they are 
      insubstantial, not satisfactory. And we get the intriguing feeling that 
      maybe we are not ‘This.’ Maybe it’s got nothing to do with ‘Me.’ Maybe my 
      depression is not ‘My’ depression.<P>
      Wouldn’t it be wonderful to realise that one’s sadness is actually not 
      a personal thing? Because we tend to think that everything that happens to 
      us is personal, we create many problems in our lives: ‘Poor me’; ‘I’m the 
      only one that this happens to’; ‘No one else has this problem, except me.’ 
      Everyone else looks terribly confident, don’t they? Especially if we lack 
      confidence in ourselves. Everyone else seems to be terribly strong and 
      really know what he or she is doing. I used to think like that. I used to 
      look at someone and, if I felt a bit depressed or miserable, I could be 
      quite convinced that they were OK. They were fine. I was the only one who 
      had problems until I realised they, too, had problems.<P>
      Because we are self-centered creatures by nature, everything is ‘my’ 
      problem, ‘my’ life, ‘my’ sorrows, and ‘my’ relationships. ‘My’ melodramas. 
      Everything seems to center around ‘Me.’ Refuge in the Buddha allows us to 
      see this very clearly. And it’s a compassionate refuge. It’s not a refuge 
      that’s critical.<P>
      When we take refuge in mindfulness, we don’t have to criticize or 
      condemn or get angry with ourselves. We can observe the tendency to be 
      critical, angry or demanding towards ourselves. It’s a very compassionate 
      refuge. In fact, that refuge is one of the first lines of our chanting, 
      ‘the Buddha has compassion as vast as the oceans,’ and that’s really what 
      that refuge means. It is a beautiful, compassionate home.<P>
      So we have three homes, three refuges. We have refuge in the Buddha. 
      It doesn’t have a roof, no central heating, but it feels very good. It 
      feels very secure, very reliable — especially when you see how much of our 
      life is so agitated, so unreliable and insecure. As we become more aware, 
      we have a clear view and a clear understanding of what <I>samsara</I> - the 
      endless round of birth and death - is all about. And we are all here to 
      get free from our attachment to it.<P>
      Taking refuge in the Buddha actually keeps us in touch with what is 
      real, what is actually true. That’s one of the reasons we tend to forget 
      about it. The meanings of mindfulness is &quot;recollection,&quot; to remember. We 
      can remember every time we get lost in being silly or in being unkind or 
      in being angry or impatient or stupid. We can also remember that we don’t 
      have to change ourselves. The compassion of that refuge is that in being 
      awake to what is happening, there is no judgement; we don’t have to become 
      somebody who is not angry or who is not stupid. We can actually 
      acknowledge what is happening and accept it in consciousness and in our 
      heart. As soon as we have this clear vision of what’s going on we realise 
      that it’s changing and see clearly the uselessness of struggling to keep 
      things permanent, to keep ourselves as permanent entities. We are 
      constantly changing, so what’s the point being this person that we 
      cherish, pamper and try to make as happy as possible?<P>
      Most of our struggle in life is to create situations where ‘me,’ my 
      personality will never have to face suffering, or endure pain, will never 
      feel embarrassed, ashamed or guilty. That’s why we are so good at 
      forgetting — and we have to learn to remember again. We have to learn to 
      be aware, to have <I>sati</I> (mindfulness) in our heart as a refuge and as a 
      protector — it protects us, it protects the heart.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080">Refuge in Dhamma</FONT></B></P>
      <P ALIGN="justify"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The second refuge, the 
      Dhamma, is very close to the first one. In fact, there is a famous 
      teaching that the Buddha gave to his disciples just before dying. They 
      were anxious about him leaving this world and wondered who was going to be 
      their teacher after the Buddha’s passing away. They were concerned as to 
      who was going to take over and be their guide. And he said: &quot;The Dhamma 
      and the Vinaya will be your guide and your refuge.&quot; On a previous occasion 
      he had also said that: &quot;Who sees the Buddha sees the Dhamma, who sees the 
      Dhamma sees the Buddha.&quot;<P>
      Dhamma and Buddha — there’s no need to have a physical Buddha. We can 
      actually find the Buddha, the one who knows, the one who is aware in our 
      own heart. And as soon as we are aware, mindful, we are in touch with the 
      Dhamma. That’s the beauty of this practice. Sometimes, when we read books 
      about Buddhism, we think we have to read the whole <I>Tipitika</I> before we can 
      get in touch with the Dhamma. We believe that we have to learn the <I>Abhidhamma</I>, perfect the ten 
      <I>paramitas</I>, develop the five powers, get rid of 
      the five hindrances and know the 56 states of consciousness, and so forth. 
      By the end, we can feel so exhausted that we don’t even want to start.<P>
      In fact, today I was reflecting that when in our meditation period we 
      mindfully breathe through our nostrils enduring a little bit of pain, a 
      little bit of sweating or bearing with the heat and the cold, noisy people 
      or boredom, we haven’t got any idea of the amount of things we’re really 
      practising with. We don’t know yet that at those moments we’re perfecting 
      the ten paramitas, that we’re letting go of the hindrances and developing 
      the five powers of concentration, effort, mindfulness, faith, and wisdom. 
      We might not be aware of it but we’re really perfecting many spiritual 
      qualities of the heart. But it doesn’t seem like very much, does it? We’re 
      just breathing in through the nostrils and then breathing out, and then we 
      feel a bit of pain, then it’s gone. Nothing much really? And yet over some 
      years of practise, we begin to see the fruits of our effort and the 
      teachings come alive.<P>
      So the refuge in the Dhamma is not something we have to look for very 
      far. We don’t have to look for the Dhamma somewhere, out there in another 
      country, or in another person, or for a thing that will happen tomorrow or 
      next year.<P>
      The quality of Dhamma is immediacy (<I>sanditthiko</I>) — right here, right 
      now. The Dhamma invites us to &quot;come and see&quot; (<I>ehipassiko</I>) and can be 
      realised when there is awareness and wisdom. It’s not &quot;delayed in time&quot; 
      (<I>akaliko</I>). Each morning we chant those qualities. We don’t have to wait 
      for someone to tell us what it is. We don’t have to read books. We don’t 
      have to have a progressive step-by-step study before we can get in touch 
      with Dhamma.<P>
      The refuge in awareness brings us into the present and in the present 
      there is the Dhamma, there is the truth, there is the way things are. But 
      it can only be seen when there is a clear awareness of the present moment.<P>
      Another meaning of the Dhamma is &quot;that which sustains itself.&quot; Nature 
      sustains itself; it has its cycles and its seasons — it just goes on 
      forever. We can look at the nature of our mind, our human nature and how 
      we function. We also have seasons and cycles, we have our days and nights, 
      our darkness and brightness, we have a rhythm. And because we don’t know 
      that rhythm, we can sometimes drag ourselves to the point of complete 
      exhaustion, sickness or mental stress. We often forget we are part of 
      nature, part of &quot;the way things are.&quot;<P>
      Our intelligence, our capacity for knowledge, tends to alienate us 
      from our nature. We often feel estranged from ourselves because our human 
      nature is not really that exciting. Thoughts are so much more exciting! We 
      think, think, think the most incredible things. Our imagination is really 
      quite creative, especially on retreat. We can really see how the mind is 
      this wonderful creator.<P>
      A famous Thai meditation teacher said once that in Buddhism it’s not a 
      God that creates, it’s ignorance. We create out of ignorance. We create an 
      incredible amount of wonderful things and miserable things — the heavens 
      and hells. We can imagine almost anything. Sometimes we wonder what we 
      have done in the past because our mind can think of the most bizarre 
      things.<P>
      Because of our capacity to think and create mentally, we often don’t 
      acknowledge our physical nature, the rhythm of our body, the rhythm of our 
      mind, the rhythm of our emotions, of our feelings, of our moods, of how we 
      are affected by the world around us, by the moon and the sun, by the day 
      and the night. Many of us don’t seem to appreciate any of that in relation 
      to ourselves. We tend to have a lot of ideas of how things should be, how 
      we would like things to be, how we think things should be, and have very 
      little space for ‘the way things are,’ for what is happening in the 
      moment. In fact, after a while, one can see a really clear pattern in the 
      mind: there is what we think it should be, then there is what we’d like it 
      to be, and finally what is. All three seem to have a bit of a hard time 
      cooperating with each other.<P>
      In my early years, it took me a while to notice this pattern but 
      through the practice, I began to understand that in one moment we can only 
      be aware of so much - which is often not very much. We can think a lot of 
      things but we can actually know only a little. It’s through knowing and 
      investigating that which we are, that understanding deepens.<P>
      When I was still an anagarika, I spent my third Vassa with another nun 
      300 miles from the monastery. It was the Vassa period and we were on 
      retreat for most of the time. In the beginning, whenever I experienced 
      some forms of greed, anger or delusion I would see a recurring pattern of 
      thoughts. At 7:00 pm at night, when we were doing our evening chanting, 
      the suffering that I had undergone through the day would seem to be 
      dispelling, or at least decreasing. And I would suddenly have this amazing 
      ‘insight’ about how I would spend the next day and just how I was going to 
      deal with all my problems.<P>
      I would suddenly know how to handle greed, I knew how to handle 
      hatred; I knew how to handle boredom, restlessness, the lot. I felt fully 
      in control and knew that I would never suffer again. I knew it. I was 
      convinced that I would never suffer again.<P>
      Of course, by 9:30 my insight had blossomed to the point where I had 
      absolutely no doubt that I was enlightened to all my problems. I would go 
      to bed, and 4:00 am would come. You can imagine what happens at 4:00 in 
      the morning! In the early years, it was still quite hard to get up at that 
      time in the morning. The mind can feel drowsy, dull, depressed, awful.<P>
      I would do some yoga exercises as I knew that doing yoga was better 
      than just staying in that negative state. And after the session I would 
      generally feel better. We would do our chanting then would come the 
      morning. We did not have breakfast in those days except for a hot drink 
      and my negativity wouldn’t lift up as quickly as I wanted. I would still 
      be feeling a bit grumpy and miserable. Then would come the meal and that 
      was really quite something. During those three months we had decided to do 
      the one-sitting practice which meant that once we sat down to eat we could 
      not get up and if we did we had to stop eating and that would be it for 
      the day!<P>
      So we made sure that when we sat down we had enough to eat in case we 
      had forgotten something and had to get up again. By the end of the meal, 
      I’d feel terrible again because of course, I had over-eaten. That meant an 
      afternoon of misery, dullness, sleepiness and confusion because the mind 
      was not able to cope with the annoyance of feeling greedy or upset with 
      itself. Every day for a while I would see the same cycle begin again. Of 
      course there were some bright and peaceful spells too!<P>
      But sitting in front of my meal, all my insights had vanished, gone 
      somewhere where I couldn’t find them. At that moment it would be really 
      hard to drag wisdom and mindfulness into being because basically I just 
      wanted what I wanted; I wanted to eat what I wanted and how much I wanted. 
      And that was it!<P>
      Before each meal we did a reflection saying that eating is for the 
      welfare of the body, not for fun, not for pleasure, nor for beautification 
      or fattening and so forth but after chanting it automatically I would 
      forget all about it and start to eat.<P>
      Anyway, by 5:00 pm I would feel better and a little lighter. I had 
      just spent four hours digesting a heavy meal whilst doing walking and 
      sitting meditation; by 6:00 pm there would arise in my mind again the 
      resolve to not do it again, to not budge at all or give into my desires. 
      At that moment my understanding was perfectly clear. By 7:00, I had no 
      doubt. By 9:30 I knew the whole Buddha’s teaching and I knew I could 
      handle it all and I would never suffer again.<P>
      That process went on for quite a while until I realised that it was 
      just my mind. It had nothing to do with reality. It was just the way my 
      mind thought. Now if we believed these thoughts and didn’t look at them as 
      dhammas or felt that ‘this is what I am,’ can we imagine the amount of 
      disappointment we would have every day?<P>
      In fact, every day I felt disappointed with ‘myself’ and would have 
      the feeling that &quot;I’m no good. I can’t do it.&quot; But then I began to see 
      clearly that pattern and, as I realised it was exactly what I was supposed 
      to learn from and to understand, there were no problems.<P>
      As long as we take things personally, we miss the Dhamma and are 
      fooled by what arises in our mind. We fail to see that the things that we 
      are taking personally are not what we are, nor what we think they are. We 
      tend to believe and identify with the constant stream of thoughts, 
      feelings and perceptions of our mind and it’s no wonder that we become 
      neurotic and have to go to psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, faith healers 
      and so on.<P>
      It is a matter of practising with right attitude, with an attitude of 
      compassion and infinite patience, rather than developing and perfecting 
      any particular techniques. Because although we may have done a lot of 
      practice and be an expert in breath meditation, body sweeping and all 
      that, if we are still striving to develop the perfect anapanasati 
      meditator our approach is wrong. Without a correct perspective, we are 
      still caught up with the idea that we have to improve on ‘Me.’<P>
      The immediacy and directness of the experience of Dhamma is something 
      quite extraordinary; it’s another great blessing. We can realise the true 
      nature of our thoughts without any intermediary, without any 
      interpretation. We don’t have to create anything; we can just see thoughts 
      as they are. It is quite a remarkable thing and it’s what attracted me 
      most to this teaching.<P>
      When came to practice I was, in a way, so overjoyed at the simplicity 
      and immediacy of the realisation of the nature of the mind. You did not 
      have to learn too much or get a Ph. D., you didn’t have to start 
      accumulating more knowledge. In the practice of Dhamma, there is a process 
      of letting go, of emptying and freeing ourselves from the burden of 
      knowledge, from the burden of accumulated experiences, from the heaviness 
      of being somebody or carrying a person in the mind.<P>
      I remember that when practising in the world as a lay person — now of 
      course this is not to influence you all to become monks and nuns — I had 
      the feeling that I was always ‘somebody’ practising. I found that very 
      difficult. There was this burden of ‘me’ practising. When I came to the 
      monastery I was ordinary and could forget about feeling special or being 
      somebody going against the stream, some strange creature on the spiritual 
      path, because everybody there was doing the same thing — you were just 
      normal.<P>
      That’s another meaning of Dhamma — &quot;the Norm.&quot; That which is normal, 
      ordinary. Much of our training in the monastery focuses on the ordinary. 
      Daily, we spend periods of time cleaning, sweeping, dusting, walking from 
      one room to the next, doing simple jobs and paying attention to the most 
      mundane things such as opening doors, getting dressed, eating, getting up 
      in the morning, brushing our teeth, putting our shoes on, going to the 
      toilet, going to bed. Simple things like these are not exciting and our 
      mind learns to calm down and be more simple, more ordinary.<P>
      We can’t really get that excited about putting our socks on, or 
      getting up at 4:00 in the morning. We can’t really get fascinated cleaning 
      the toilet somehow. Though I tried hard! I tried to make it really 
      interesting but I couldn’t. Somehow it’s just so ordinary. I cleaned the 
      toilets for a long time at Chithurst Monastery where we all had different 
      morning chores to attend to. We call them chores but they’re not really, 
      they’re just what we do each morning and whatever we make of them. They 
      can be boring. They can be interesting. Or they can be just as they are.<P>
      We can see our mind wanting to make things special. I remember how in 
      the morning, cleaning the toilet, I would decide to clean the sink first 
      and then the toilet second and then the floor third. Perhaps next day I 
      would change the pattern; I would prefer to start cleaning the windows 
      first, or sweep with a different broom. Or I would decide not to mop with 
      this particular mop. I would change my mops. I would find myself really 
      getting hooked on using a particular tool, or getting upset about really 
      trivial things and making a big melodrama about nothing at all. If I had 
      not been living in the monastery, I would never have seen the way the mind 
      can create melodramas out of absolutely nothing.<P>
      To be in touch with the ordinariness of our life is something very 
      difficult for us because we have been conditioned to get our boost of 
      energy through things that are interesting or stimulating. Or, we focus 
      our attention on the next thing — on what’s going to happen next.<P>
      Unless we have guidance and help from wise people, from people who 
      have an understanding of the path, we tend to carry on in our spiritual 
      practice in the same way as before we started. We’re still looking for 
      fascination, for excitement, for something special, for the big bang, for 
      the flashing lights, for the super insight that’s going to solve all ‘my’ 
      problems.<P>
      But I’m afraid it doesn’t work like that. With the practice, there is 
      a change in our relationship with our mind. We let the flux of greed, 
      hatred and delusion flow. We don’t make a problem about it any more. We 
      let the flow of our own mind just take its own course. We stop shaping the 
      flux of our thoughts and feelings into this or that. Being in harmony with 
      Dhamma is making peace with whatever is going on now, with &quot;the way things 
      are,&quot; the Dhamma.<P>
      That doesn’t mean we turn into a cabbage or into a non-entity or that 
      we just sit there and sort of wait and wait and wait for things to happen. 
      Though we can sometimes feel like that. After some years of practice I 
      remember how I could feel really stupid. There were moments when I had 
      totally given up on the idea of ever feeling intelligent again!<P>
      Once I remember crossing the courtyard at Amaravati on one hot sunny 
      afternoon feeling quite miserable and depressed. I had lost the passions 
      of the mind. They didn’t seem to be there any more. There was just a kind 
      of dull state and I was strongly identifying with it. It was awful. I 
      really thought that this mood was what I was and I could hear myself being 
      really upset about it. I thought: &quot;I can’t bear this, it’s impossible. 
      ‘They’ with a capital ‘T’ are turning me into a turnip&quot; (which I thought 
      of as the most pallid, wishy-washy, nothing-looking vegetable!). I did not 
      know who ‘They’ were… I remember meeting on the way one of the teachers of 
      our community. I told him: &quot;I am probably reaping the karma of having 
      hated being a housewife.&quot; I always hated the idea of being a housewife so 
      much so that in the past, before becoming a nun, I resented having to do 
      any cleaning, housework, any washing or dishwashing. Yet I found myself 
      doing just that in my early training at Chithurst. He laughed and replied: 
      &quot;Well, when you really don’t mind that any more, then it means your karma 
      with it is over.&quot;<P>
      That was really a very good insight because I didn’t think that I 
      minded. Yet I felt so despairing and miserable that obviously something in 
      me did mind. So it’s difficult to be ordinary and accept the triviality of 
      our life. That’s why most of the time we feel frustrated, because we think 
      that somehow things are going to be different, or that they should be 
      different, don’t we?<P>
      We sense that life shouldn’t be just getting up in the morning, having 
      breakfast, getting bored, having a cry with one’s spouse, going to the 
      toilet, eating, getting bored at work, coming back, watching television, 
      going to bed, getting up in the morning, and on and on and on, day after 
      day after day. We feel that somehow there must be something else. So we go 
      on a trip and travel around the world — and we find out that even on the 
      other side of the world, we still have to get up, we still have to go to 
      the toilet, we still have to eat, we still get happy and bored with 
      ourselves, we still get annoyed and depressed. We still get the same old 
      ‘me’ — whether we are here, or in California, or in India, or anywhere. To 
      come to terms with that has been the greatest teaching of monastic life.<P>
      Actually, monastic life is externally pretty repetitive and boring. 
      And if we identify with the structure or the routine then it’s the most 
      tedious lifestyle. It’s so monotonous at times, you have no idea! But 
      through accepting the perception and feeling of boredom for example, we 
      realise that it’s actually quite OK.<P>
      It is not so much a matter of getting rid of boredom but of seeing 
      what we are expecting from life. I spent many years expecting from life 
      something it could not give me. That’s why there was a problem. And in the 
      same way if I expect something from the monastic life that it cannot give 
      me, then I’ll be very disappointed, frustrated or in a constant state of 
      conflict.<P>
      So seeing the way things are is a very important realisation because 
      then we can actually work with life as it is rather than expecting or 
      dreaming about it. Expectations are like dreams. And most of our life is 
      like a dream, or like a cloud, and we hope that this cloud will give us 
      something real and substantial. Have you ever been able to shape a cloud? 
      Or a dream? Yet this what we are always trying to do isn’t it? Can we have 
      any control over our dreams? Maybe we can, but most of the time we can’t 
      even remember them or do what we want in them.<P>
      So there’s this dreamlike state that we create out of expectations, 
      out of not understanding the limitations of our mind and body, of our life 
      and the world we live in. Our mind can only do so much. Our body can only 
      do so much. When you’re young, you think your body can do anything, but 
      when you get to middle age, like me, then even sitting can become a 
      challenge. I used to love sitting — I could sit for long periods and 
      really enjoy it. It was a pleasure. But now, sometimes, it’s more an 
      endurance test.<P>
      So we are limited; we are bound by certain restrictions. But if we see 
      them for what they are, then a wonderful thing happens: we can actually 
      work with life as it is. We don’t have to expect something from it 
      anymore; we can actually give to our life. And that’s a great change in 
      the mind. Through the practice we begin to see that we don’t have to ask 
      or get or demand something from life. We can actually give, offer and 
      joyfully respond to it. And this, we can all do.<P>
      The natural process of the realization of Dhamma is the awareness that 
      life is a constant opportunity to give, to be generous, to be kind, to be 
      of service in whatever situation we are in. As we let go we don’t get so 
      caught up and obsessed with ourselves. We can actually be useful. We can 
      help. We can give. We can encourage ourselves and the people around us.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080">Refuge in Sangha</FONT></B></P>
      <P ALIGN="justify"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The refuge in the 
      Sangha, the last one, is the refuge in noble friendship — kalyanamitta. It 
      symbolizes the community of men and women, ordained or living in the 
      world, who have taken refuge in living wisely and compassionately, in 
      accord with the Dhamma. They take refuge in harmlessness, loving-kindness 
      and respect for all living beings. These are people who have a moral 
      conscience. They are aware when they’re not really doing the right thing 
      or acting foolishly or harmfully.<P>
      This refuge symbolises the purity of the human heart. I remember when 
      for the first time I heard of the concept of the ‘Pure Heart.’ I thought 
      that it was a beautiful expression — ‘Pure Heart.’ It felt like a good 
      thing to be — a pure heart. And that’s really what that refuge is: it’s a 
      refuge in that in us which is good, wholesome, compassionate and wise.<P>
      Before I started being interested in Buddhism, I used to go to 
      Christian monasteries to do short retreats by myself. The thing that 
      struck me most in those places — I didn’t know anything about Buddhist 
      monasteries then — was this awesome, pervading feeling of respect for 
      life, for each other. Even the silence seemed to be a kind of 
      acknowledgement of reverence, of honoring the best in human beings. It was 
      very moving. Even though I could not explain what it was, I sensed that 
      people were devoted to something really good, to something really true.<P>
      When I came to Chithurst and met the community for the first time, I 
      had a very similar feeling of meeting human beings totally dedicated to 
      honouring the truth, to being it and living in accordance with it. And so 
      the refuge in Sangha was the first thing that brought me to the monastic 
      life.<P>
      My interest in joining the monastic Sangha came from the need to have 
      a vehicle and a refuge of sanity in myself that would provide some 
      guidance. I realized for example that without an ethical standard to 
      contain and understand the energy of my desires, I was really in trouble. 
      I was always very good at knowing what I should do, what I should be; I 
      was a real expert at creating ideals! But somehow the energy of my desires 
      had very different ideas about that. My self-gratifying habits on the one 
      hand and my yearning for truth on the other didn’t meet, didn’t seem to be 
      very good friends.<P>
      One of the first things that became really clear when I joined the 
      Sangha was that the precepts were my best friends and my best protectors. 
      I never had the feeling that they were imposing themselves on me at all. 
      On the contrary, I knew that they were supporting me and reminding me of 
      being more mindful of when I spoke, when I acted, when I thought or when I 
      ate or even when I slept.<P>
      The training of our body and mind requires an enormous amount of 
      patience and compassion. Our habits are strong and if we have lived a 
      fairly heedless life in the past, we can’t expect to turn instantly into a 
      virtuous person. When we arrive at the monastery we don’t become a saint 
      overnight. And it is not a meditation retreat and the keeping of the 
      precepts for ten days that is going to turn us into one either, is it? But 
      at least we have a situation and a teaching that can help us to look at 
      what is not correct or skilfull in our behaviour and our habits and to 
      make peace with it.<P>
      So we take refuge in the Sangha and use the standards followed by 
      those who have walked the Path and liberated themselves before us. This 
      refuge points to our commitment to virtuous conduct, to a way of life that 
      protects and nurtures peace in the heart and reminds us of our intention 
      to liberate it. If we didn’t have these guidelines, we would easily forget 
      ourselves. And we are very good at that. In fact, that’s what the mind is 
      most intent on and does all the time, it forgets. But when we take refuge 
      in mindfulness, in the Dhamma and in the purity of our intention to free 
      ourselves from delusion, we remember that we have the necessary tools to 
      train the heart and to see clearly the unskilfulness of our habits, of our 
      speech or of our thoughts, etc.<P>
      These refuges may appear as if they were three: <B><I>Buddha, Dhamma, 
      Sangha</I></B>. But actually they are just one. We don’t have one without the 
      other. When there is virtue and the intention to live harmoniously, with 
      compassion and respect for oneself and each other, then there’s a 
      naturally growing awareness, in harmony with the Dhamma, and we are more 
      attuned to the truth. All of them interact and affect each other.<P>
      At first, we don’t know quite what or where these refuges are. They 
      may seem to be just words. You might even feel confused and have no trust 
      in them. But as we practise, as we keep letting go of our attachments to 
      thoughts, feelings, perceptions, they become a growing reality.<P>
      We can actually experience these refuges. They become a part of our 
      life, a part of something that we can go back to, right here, right now. 
      We don’t have to wait. They are always present in our heart. Here, now, in 
      the present. That’s the real beauty of the practice of the Path. It’s that 
      total simplicity, that immediacy, complete in itself. There’s nothing else 
      that you need. Just in taking the Three Refuges, you’ve got all the tools 
      you need for your heart to be free.</FONT></P>
