        answer to this inquiry is multi-layered and complex. It is a tantalising
        issue because it highlights the changing spiritual landscape of
        Australia and provides an insight into just how multicultural we have
        really become.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Cultures that were foreign
        to Anglo-European Australians are now being adopted by some of them -
        though not without some dissenting resistance. This level of resistance
        in Australian society can be seen as a litmus test, used to measure
        future political and religious tolerance in this country.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The story concerning the
        rise of Buddhism in Australia is a compelling tale of a resilient
        religion that has survived despite the odds. How is it possible for a
        2,500-year-old philosophy, which began five hundred years before
        Christianity and one thousand years before the Muslim faith, to be
        relevant to modern life in Australia? Considering all the other ancient
        religions that have faded from contemporary practice, such as the sun
        worshippers of Ancient Egypt, the human sacrifices of the South American
        Mayans and the druids from the Dark Ages of England, Buddhism has
        outlasted them all.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It does not preach the
        dogma of a strange cult, nor seek converts with evangelistic fervour.
        Those Australians who actively convert to Buddhism do so voluntarily,
        and are usually well-educated middle-aged professionals who are
        attracted to a sense of inner peace. This documentary therefore, seeks
        to immerse itself in the substance of this seemingly magnetic Buddhist
        approach. Perhaps it will be like seeing Australia for the first time,
        through ancient eyes.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is interesting to note
        that in spite of the recent increase in Buddhist numbers across
        Australia, Buddhism has actually played a part in Australian history for
        some time. It did not just suddenly arrive in a recent wave of migrants.
        Some anthropologists, in fact, have suggested that Buddhism was possibly
        the earliest non-indigenous religion to reach Australia before white
        settlement.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Between 1405 and 1433 the
        Chinese Ming emperor, Cheng-Ho, sent sixty-two large ships to explore
        southern Asia. Although there is evidence that several ships from that
        armada landed on the Aru Islands to the north of Arnhem Land, it is not
        known whether they reached the mainland.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One unproved hypothesis of
        Professor A.P. Elkin is that the belief of some Northern Territory
        Koorie tribes in reincarnation, psychic phenomena and mental cultivation
        is evidence of early contact with Buddhists. Despite certain rock
        paintings that possibly depict Chinese junks weighing anchor or images
        of the Buddha, actual material evidence remains to be seen (1).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The first documented
        arrival of Buddhists in Australia was in 1848 during the gold rushes,
        when Chinese coolie labourers were brought into the country to work on
        the Victorian gold fields. These workers represented a transient
        population that usually returned home within five years. It was not
        until 1876 that the first permanent Buddhist community was established
        by Sinhalese migrants on Thursday Island. There the ethnic Sri Lankans
        built the first temple in Australia, while they were employed on the
        sugar cane plantations of Queensland.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From the late 1870's
        onwards many Japanese Shinto Buddhists also arrived and were active in
        the pearling industry across northern Australia, establishing other
        Buddhist enclaves in Darwin and Broome. Buddhist cemeteries were kept
        and festivals celebrated. Official government statistics compiled as
        part of a national census in 1891 indicate that, at the time, there were
        slightly more Buddhists in Australia (at 1.2%), than there are today (at
        1.1%) (2).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist numbers would have
        continued to increase if the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 had not
        been introduced to combat the 'yellow peril'. Alfred Deakin, who was
        destined to be Prime Minister three times, drafted the legislation to
        pacify a somewhat xenophobic Caucasian electorate (3). This bill later
        grew to represent the more broadly implemented White Australia Policy.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For the next fifty years
        the benefits of mind training and meditation, as taught by Buddhism,
        would be disregarded as some sort of obscure 'eastern mysticism'. Except
        for some remote surviving pockets of Buddhists (such as Broome and
        Thursday Island), the religion became virtually extinct in Australia.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A small group of committed
        western Buddhists formed the earliest known Buddhist organisation in
        Australia, The Little Circle of the Dharma, in Melbourne in 1925.
        Progress was slow though, until after World War II when local enthusiasm
        for the White Australia Policy began to decline. In 1951 the first
        Buddhist nun visited Australia. Sister Dhammadinna, born in the USA,
        ordained and with thirty years experience in Sri Lanka, came to
        propagate the Theravadin School of Buddhist teaching. She received
        nation-wide media coverage (4).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Inspired by this visit, the
        next year the Buddhist Society of New South Wales was formed under the
        presidency of Leo Berkley, a Dutch-born Sydney businessman. This
        organisation is today the oldest Buddhist group in Australia. Its
        membership was, and still is, compromised mainly of people from
        Anglo-European backgrounds (5).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In 1958 the Buddhist
        Federation of Australia was formed in order to co-ordinate the growing
        Buddhist groups that had sprung up around the country in Western
        Australia, South Australia, Queensland and Victoria.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist presence in
        Australia had depended for the first hundred years on lay people with
        only the occasional visits by ordained members of the Sangha (the
        Buddhist clergy). But in the 1970's the growing number of Buddhists
        created a need for resident monks, and a new phase in Australian
        Buddhism began.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In 1971 the Buddhist
        Society of New South Wales established the Sri Lankan monk, Somaloka, in
        residence at a retreat centre in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. This
        became the first monastery in Australia. A succession of monasteries
        representing different aspects of Buddhism slowly became established
        around Australia; in 1975 at Stanmore in Sydney, in 1978 at Wisemans
        Ferry in country NSW and in 1984 at Serpentine in Western Australia (6).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The charismatic face of
        Buddhism, the Dalai Lama, (who was awarded the Noble Peace Prize in 1989
        and describes himself as 'a simple monk'), has travelled the world
        constantly giving lectures and answering questions in 20,000 seat pop
        concert halls. John Cleese speaks out for him in London, Henri
        Cartier-Bresson records his teachings around France and Adam Yauch of
        the Beastie Boys pop group has even interviewed him in Rome for Rolling
        Stone magazine.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the past few years he
        has opened eleven Offices of Tibet, everywhere from Canberra to Moscow
        and last year alone provided prefaces and forewords for roughly thirty
        books. The 14th Dalai Lama, who holds the titles of Ocean of Wisdom,
        Holder Of The White Lotus and Protector Of The Land Of Snows, has even
        served as the guest editor of French Vogue magazine (7).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The three visits of the
        Dalai Lama to Australia in 1982, 1992 and 1996 were joyful occasions for
        Buddhists of all traditions, and huge crowds of Buddhists and the
        general public gathered to hear him speak. On the third visit, and
        despite virulent Chinese protests, the Dalai Lama met with and was
        photographed with the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard. It was
        now clearly evident at this stage, that Buddhism had become a
        significant minority religion in Australia.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">During this visit local
        celebrities contributed generously to fundraising activities. For
        example, Kate Ceberano, Rachel Berger and Frente were just some of the
        'star-studded cast' to perform at the Dalai Lama Lounge Room. They
        helped to raise $14,000 over three nights. Mushroom Records released a
        benefit album called The Mantra Mix CD, featuring Jenny Morris, Jimmy
        Barnes and Johnny Diesel. One local advertising agency, providing their
        services for nothing, came up with the slogan &quot;You missed Jesus.
        You missed the Buddha. Do not miss the Dalai Lama&quot; (8). When was
        the last time such hype accompanied the visit of a religious leader?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But Australians are not
        alone in their sympathy towards his cause. The issue of Tibetan
        oppression has come to the attention of Hollywood and with two new films
        about his life in the cinematic pipeline, the Dalai Lamas' profile has
        not only moved into the mainstream, but has (much to the horror of the
        Chinese Government) gone global.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The first to be released,
        Seven Years In Tibet, tells the story of Heinrich Harrer, a mountain
        climber and nazi party member who encounters his own sense of
        enlightenment after becoming the tutor to the young Dalai Lama in Tibet
        in the 1940's. The film has attracted healthy attention because it stars
        Brad Pitt.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The other film is Kundun,
        directed by Martin Scorcese. This epic tells the remarkable tale of the
        Dalai Lama from his point of view, from his recognition as the
        reincarnated Buddha of compassion at age two until his escape to India
        at twenty-four. Recently released here in Australia, it was reviewed by
        Channel Nines' Sunday program on June 14th and described as 'the most
        beautiful and important film released this year'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Hollywood's fascination for
        Buddhism extends beyond these two screenplays, with many stars
        expressing interest in the religion itself. In February 1997, the
        karate-kicking action star Steven Seagall was recognised by the Nyingma
        lineage of Tibetan Buddhism as the reincarnation of a 15th century lama.
        Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys pop group has organised two huge benefit
        concerts to publicise the plight of Tibet.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Actor Richard Gere,
        together with Uma Thurmans father, Richard Thurman, has opened Tibet
        House in New York, published books on the subject, and meditates daily.
        Other practitioners that have come to attention include Tina Turner,
        Harrison Ford (whose wife Melissa Mathison wrote Kunduns script), Oliver
        Stone, Herbie Hancock, Courtney Love, composer Philip Glass (who also
        worked on Kundun) and REM's lead singer Michael Stipe.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The momentum of Buddhism's'
        profile is driven by other, more subtle reminders as well. A new makeup
        is being advertised as Zen Blush, a new sitcom is called Dharma and
        Greg, a designer fruit juice container has on its' label &quot;Please
        recycle this bottle. It deserves to be reincarnated too&quot;, and monks
        star in television commercials and news items (9).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Such recent exposure does
        not take away the fact that Australians have been quietly turning to
        Buddhism for some time. The statistics compiled in the 1986, 1991 and
        1996 Commonwealth Government Census support the view that Buddhist
        numbers have been steadily increasing. Between 1986 and 1991 the numbers
        of practitioners rose from 80,387 to 139,847, a growth of 74%. Due
        largely to the decrease in immigration numbers in recent years the
        percentage growth for Buddhists slowed between 1991 and 1996 to 43%,
        from 139,847 to 199,812. This rate of increase is still higher than that
        of any other religion (10).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The three census surveys
        also indicate that of the eight Christian denominations listed in the
        analysis for New South Wales only three show an increase (Baptist,
        Catholic and Orthodox), while five (Anglican, Church Of Christ,
        Lutheran, Presbyterian and Uniting Church) have decreased in numbers.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Does the fluctuating
        demographic between Buddhism and Christianity point towards
        dissatisfaction with traditional Australian religious beliefs? Is
        Buddhism more competitive than Christianity or is one spiritual
        experience simply more meaningful than the other?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of the 199,812 Buddhists
        across Australia today, approximately thirty thousand are
        Anglo-European's who have 'crossed over', by choice, to this alternative
        philosophy. They have turned from 'Christian sinner' to 'Eastern
        Mystic'. The slump in immigration figures from Buddhist countries is
        apparently not enough to stall the continued growth in Australian
        Buddhism, especially now that local support has been established. Back
        in 1938 a Japanese Shinto monk, noting that it took China three
        centuries to adopt Buddhism from India, said introducing it in the West
        would be like holding a lotus to a rock and waiting for it to take root.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When the Age of Aquarius
        spread across the world in the form of the 60's alternative hippie
        counter-culture, there appeared to be no shortage of poets, artists,
        actors, writers and musicians interested in a voyage of inner peace
        through Buddhist philosophy and meditative practices. John Lennon used
        Buddhist mantras' in the lyrics of his music such as Across the
        Universe. Allen Ginsberg used a mantra (Buddhist blessing) to bless the
        ground at Woodstock before the first fans arrived. Zen meditation too,
        first embraced by the Beat poets in the 1950's flourished across first
        world nations as a healthy alternative to LSD-induced enlightenment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">More importantly the
        drug-fuelled 1960's, when the Vietnam War was at its height, feminist
        protestors burnt their bras and man landed on the moon, saw a relaxation
        of traditional middle class values that allowed a greater versatility in
        public consciousness. During this time, people had greater access and
        freedom to experiment with new schools of thought (feminism, civil
        rights, the peace movement, alternative lifestyles etc) without
        suffering as many social ramifications as in the past.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Reverend
        Phillip Hughes, a Melbourne-based religious researcher, &quot;many
        people thought in the 1960's that science itself was not sufficient to
        really explain existence, but then they were not keen to go back to the
        Judeo-Christian tradition with its holy books, miracles and so forth.
        Also the need for a sense of peace has become more apparent&quot; (11).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Potential Buddhists are
        attracted to the Dharma (Buddhist teachings) not only to take refuge
        from a world of chaos and confusion, but also to re-invent their own
        personal sense of a meaningful spirituality in a society of high-tech
        consumerism, commercialism, violence and apathy. Compared to the
        Christian beliefs many Anglo-European Australians grew up with, Buddhism
        does not require its adherents to remain faithful to a specific dogma.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is not a faith. It is
        not technically a religion either, though when discussing systems of
        worship it is easier to work with that label. It is more a psychology
        and a philosophy wrapped around a moral code of mind training.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The founder of Buddhism,
        Siddhartha Gautama (born in 563 B.C.), turned his back on the royal
        family he had been born into, to live life as a simple ascetic monk. At
        the age of thirty-five he became enlightened and 'saw things as they
        really are', having achieved a mental state of absolute egolessness,
        where he no longer felt any sense of narcissism or craving.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">He became the first Buddha
        and was quick to teach his disciples that he was not a god, should not
        be revered and no rituals should be developed around his teachings.
        Heaven and hell, he taught, are not external places that we travel to
        after we die; they do not in fact exist. Rather, both places dwell only
        in the hearts of people. People are either good or bad, pious or evil.
        Paradise exists within our spirit, it is here and now, and not some
        destination in the after-life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation, he believed, is
        the process required for all adherents to achieve Buddhahood. This is
        one of the main differences between Buddhism and other religions.
        Practitioners are offered an ultimate goal, enlightenment itself, which
        is equivalent to the level attained by the Buddha himself. He taught
        that everyone is capable of achieving this, providing equality to all
        his followers (12).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is a radical departure
        for born-Christians to realise when they first start studying the
        principles of Buddhism. The best a faithful Christian could hope to
        achieve with his devotion was entry to heaven as an angel where he is
        still subject to the will of a greater being who could smite him anytime
        at will. The Buddha teaches his disciples too become the same as he,
        which is why he is not a god. In Buddhism there is no pecking order in
        the after life, because that would require the presence of an ego, which
        is the Buddhists life work to gradually eliminate.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism dispenses with the
        notion of a Supreme Being, as does science, and explains the origins and
        workings of the universe in terms of natural law. All of this certainly
        exhibits a scientific spirit. The Buddha advised that we should not
        blindly believe him but rather question, examine, inquire and rely on
        our own experience. This scientific approach of cause and effect was not
        overlooked by Albert Einstein in the 1930's:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The religion of the
        future will be a cosmic religion&quot;, he said, &quot;it should
        transcend a personal God and avoid dogmas and theology. Covering both
        natural and spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising
        from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual, and a
        meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this description. If there is any
        religion that would cope with modern scientific needs it would be
        Buddhism&quot; (13).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">While the antipodean
        blossoming of Buddhism seems to have gone from strength to strength
        since the 1980's, this has not always been the case. It is in the
        Buddhist principle of godlessness that the journalist can find opposing
        and dissenting voices to the Buddhist cause. This theological bone of
        contention is the main source of friction with other religions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On Wednesday, the 18th of
        January 1995, Pope John Paul II arrived in Sydney and attended an
        Interfaith Gathering in the Sydney Domain. Representatives from major
        religions, including Protestant, Orthodox and Coptic Christians, Jewish
        and Muslim were invited to share the platform with him. Notable by its
        absence was Australia's' third largest religion, Buddhism.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The organisers told SBS
        Radio that they were unaware that Buddhism was Australia's' third
        largest religion and besides that there was no national leader of
        Buddhism, so who were they to invite? The Sydney Morning Herald reported
        that &quot;somebody in the State Government had forgotten to invite the
        Buddhists&quot;. This is unlikely, as the New South Wales Government is
        very aware of the presence of Buddhists in this state and often invites
        Buddhist representatives to State functions. A more likely explanation
        is that the Vicar of Rome holds Buddhism in very low esteem as is
        evident from the following extract from his book, Crossing The Threshold
        Of Hope:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Buddhism is in large
        measure an 'atheistic' system. We do not free ourselves from evil
        through the good which comes from God; we liberate ourselves only
        through detachment from the world, which is bad. The fullness of such a
        detachment is not union with God, but what is called nirvana, a state of
        perfect indifference with regard to the world. To save oneself means,
        above all, to free oneself from evil by becoming indifferent to the
        world, which is the source of evil. This is the culmination of the
        spiritual process. Christian mysticism is born of the Revelation of the
        living God. This God opens Himself to union with man, arousing in him
        the capacity to be united with Him, especially by means of the
        theological virtues - faith, hope and above all, love&quot; (14).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Graeme Lyall, Chairman of
        the Buddhist Council of New South Wales, strongly refutes the Catholic
        position. &quot;The Oxford Dictionary defines 'atheism' as 'disbelief in
        the existence of God' &quot;, he said, &quot;the Buddha is described as
        the teacher of 'gods and men', so how can Buddhism be an atheistic
        system? Religious arguments often come down to the use of religious
        language. We must ascertain to what we are referring to when we use the
        term 'God'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What is a 'living God'?
        Anything that is living is subject to death and decay, so why should we
        place ourselves in the hands of something, which, like ourselves, is
        impermanent? If he is referring to the old man with a white beard who
        sits in the sky taking notes in his little black book ready for the day
        of judgement, then he is out of step with modern theological thinking
        and most other theologians.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Modern theologians, such as
        Paul Tillich, suggest that the term 'God' refers to the 'ground of
        being' - the very fact of existence. No Buddhist would argue with this,
        but they may be reluctant to use the term 'God' to describe it&quot;
        (15).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Lay's implication that the
        Pope is out of touch appears to be more than just a knee-jerk defence,
        when you consider that the ranks of Catholics themselves are split on
        the issue. Irish-born Father William Johnston, a Jesuit priest, spoke of
        his sympathy to Buddhism when he visited Sydney in early January 1997.
        Here to attend the Religion, Literature and Arts Conference at the
        Australian Catholic University, Father Johnston spoke of the Christian
        churches need to introduce aspects of Eastern Mysticism - such as
        meditation, yoga and Zen - if they want to increase numbers attending
        weekly services.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Some Catholics are
        very nervous about meditation but there is a lot to learn from it and
        yoga and Zen&quot;, he said. &quot;The Catholic Church has always kept
        meditation very strongly in its religious orders; our problem is that we
        didn't teach it to the laity, who are now looking for it&quot;.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Father Johnston, director
        of the Institute of Oriental Religions at Tokyos' Sophia University, has
        lived in Japan since 1951 and believes Christianity has become 'too
        legalistic', with 'too many do's and don'ts and not enough vision and
        enlightenment' (16).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Besides the Catholic
        Churchs' potentially bilateral reaction to Buddhism, local opposition to
        the arrival of Eastern Mysticism has also occurred in the steel
        manufacturing town of Wollongong, an hours drive south of Sydney. There
        the Anglican Bishop of Wollongong, the Reverend Reg Piper has weighed
        into the debate expressing his annoyance not only at the presence of
        Buddhism, but the presence of a philosophy he sees as evil. The contest
        began when a Taiwan-based Buddhist sect, Fokuangshan, opened a huge
        fifty million-dollar temple just south of the steel city in Berkley. The
        monks there planned to promote their style of 'humanistic' Buddhism,
        which emphasises the 'oneness and co-existence of the global village'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Fokuangshan sect was
        founded in the mid-1960's and has more than one hundred branches
        world-wide (including Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth) with 1.5 million
        members and its own university, several schools, an organ donor bank, a
        retirement home, even a cemetery. This growth is due to its' charismatic
        founding father, the Venerable Hsing Yun. The size of the Wollongong
        temple, called Nan Tien, is second only to their headquarters in Taipei.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Bishop Piper's concerns are
        not shared by other Christian churches such as the local Uniting Church,
        which has adopted a user-friendly approach to the temple. On Tuesday,
        the 18th of June 1996, Bishop Piper appeared on the ABCs' 7.30 Report to
        voice his opposition.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Bishop Piper:</font></i><font face="Times New Roman">
        See when you have the bible view of humankind, generally, if it is
        outside the framework of the truth - the bible terms it as evil.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Reporter:</font></i><font face="Times New Roman">
        Is it a deception?.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Bishop Piper:</font></i><font face="Times New Roman">
        In that respect, yes. While ever it is not based in the truth of Christ,
        it would be a deception. Because Buddhism is basically an atheistic
        religion. There is no god.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Reporter:</font></i><font face="Times New Roman">
        Why is that a problem?.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Bishop Piper:</font></i><font face="Times New Roman">
        Because God has revealed himself through Christ. Christ has been raised
        from the dead. He said he is God. There is no other way to the truth and
        no other way to really live except through Christ.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The growing curiosity about
        Buddhism has so worried Bishop Piper that he has made a video called In
        Search Of Paradise - A Biblical Response To Buddhism. It is to warn all
        Christians of the evil deception of Buddhism, that has arrived to
        convert them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Reverend Shin of the Nan
        Tien temple remains perplexed with Bishop Pipers attitude. &quot;We
        don't convert people to Buddhism or change their religion&quot;, he
        said. &quot; As long as they feel comfortable with any of the practices
        or any of the beliefs and it is good for the society, good for them and
        good for the family, that is the most important thing. Whether they
        decide to become Buddhists or not - that is not our concern&quot; (17).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Local opposition to
        Buddhism also extends beyond the Christian clergy. A survey by the
        Federal Office Of Multicultural Affairs, conducted in 1988, found that
        41% of the general population did not wish to have a Buddhist as a
        workmate. Only Muslims fared worse (18).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Despite this, on Sunday 8th
        February this year Australian Buddhists were delighted to learn they had
        a friend in a high place when the Governor-General, Sir William Deane,
        expressed his support at the opening of the Rahula Community Lodge in
        Canberra (19).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;A report from the
        Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research a couple of
        years ago, showed that over the ten years to 1991 Buddhism was by far
        the largest growing religion in our country: an increase in the order of
        some 300%&quot; he said. &quot;To a significant extent, of course, the
        figures reflect the substantial increase in migration from south-east
        Asia over that period.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But the second largest
        national group were Australian-born Buddhists - many from non-Asian
        cultures attracted by both the philosophy and the practice of Buddhism,
        with its emphasis upon the search for inner peace and understanding. I
        offer my very best wishes for the success of all that you hope to
        achieve in the years ahead as future stages of the centre are completed.
        May all your endeavours prosper and bring joy to those whom they are
        intended to help&quot;.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism continues to
        maintain a steady trickle of recruitment at the grass roots level.
        According to the Venerable Pannyavaro, a monk based in Surry Hills in
        Sydney, young people are still attracted to Buddhism because they are
        looking for an alternative to established Christian churches and they
        can explore Buddhism without feeling obliged to join.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;A lot of young people
        in the twenty to mid-thirty age group are coming because they don't feel
        imposed upon&quot;, he said, &quot; and there are deeper meditative
        techniques they can draw upon&quot;. The Buddhist website he operates
        (http://www.buddhanet.net) gets an average 9,000 'hits' a day. Venerable
        Pannyavaro offers cyber-nirvana at this site in the form of online
        meditation sessions where people can log on, meditate and contemplate
        the infinite (20).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are now more than
        ninety Buddhist temples and organisations in New South Wales, sixty-five
        of them in Sydney. The bulk of the two hundred people who each week
        visit the Buddhist Library, Meditation and Information Centre in
        Camperdown in Sydney are in the thirty to fifty age group. About
        eighty-percent are from a non-Asian background (21).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Much to the horror of the
        Christian clergy (if they ever find out), Buddhism is even being taught
        in one New South Wales primary school during religious scripture
        classes. In early 1995 at Blackheath Primary School a group of parents
        approached the principal, Kate Allan, asking the school to provide
        Buddhist instruction as well as the traditional Catholic and Protestant
        options. Now, forty-five of the schools three hundred and fifty students
        attend classes in Buddhism.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The move came from
        the community&quot;, Allan says. &quot;In the mountains we have quite a
        diverse community and it was the choice of the parents to have these
        classes - it was not something imposed on the whole school&quot; (22).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Answering the question of
        Buddhism's growing popularity in is clearly going to be a rich and
        involved conclusion. This religion seems to have, at first glance, a
        vigorous influence on the world stage. Just when you think you have
        examined the issues thoroughly, you suddenly discover that you are still
        only looking at the tip of the iceberg./.</font></p>
