      The Buddha&#39;s teaching called Paticca-samuppada, usually translated as 
      Dependent Origination, is fundamental to the Dhamma (Truth) awakened to by 
      The Buddha on the night of His Enlightenment. The Buddha is recorded to 
      have said:</P>
      <I>
      <P>One who sees Dependent Origination, sees the Dhamma.<BR>
      One who sees the Dhamma, sees Dependent Origination. </I>-- MN 28. [1]</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the understanding of Dependent Origination is an integral 
      part of the delusion-shattering insight that brings one to the state of 
      &#39;one who has entered the stream&#39; (sotapanna), destined for full 
      Enlightenment within a maximum of seven more lives. It is stated by The 
      Buddha that one who has entered the stream may be considered as possessing 
      five attributes:</P>
      <DIR>
        <P>1. Unshakeable faith in The Buddha, as opposed to other religious 
        leaders. <BR>
        2. Unshakeable faith in the Dhamma, as opposed to other religious 
        beliefs. <BR>
        3. Unshakeable faith in the Sangha, the Enlightened members of the 
        monastic community. <BR>
        4. Very high standard of morality, &#39;dear to the Enlightened Ones&#39;. <BR>
        5. Accurate understanding of Dependent Origination, and its corollary <I>
        Idappaccayata</I> (Causality). -- SN 12, 27; AN 5, 25.</P>
      </DIR>
      <P>Therefore it is fair to say that the correct understanding of Dependent 
      Origination can only be known by the Enlightened Ones, that is by the 
      Streamwinners, Once Returners, Non Returners and Arahants. This goes a 
      long way to answering the question why there is so much difference of 
      opinion on the meaning of Dependent Origination.</P>
      <P>In this essay I will discuss the meaning of the 12 factors that make up 
      the standard description of Dependent Origination. Then I will analyse the 
      nature of the causes linking each pair of neighbouring factors, using a 
      Western model of causality. Having explained what The Buddha meant by 
      Dependent Origination, I will then examine perhaps the most interesting 
      question &quot;Why did The Buddha place such importance on Dependent 
      Origination? What is its purpose?&quot;. In this final section, I will propose 
      that the function of Dependent Origination is threefold:</P>
      <DIR>
        <P>1. To explain how there can be rebirth without a soul. <BR>
        2. To answer the question &quot;What is life?&quot;. <BR>
        3. To understand why there is suffering, and where suffering comes to an 
        end. </P>
      </DIR>
      <P>So let us begin by seeing what The Buddha meant by Dependent 
      Origination.</P>

      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">The Meaning of the Twelve Factors, as 
      Defined by The Buddha</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>It is important for us to understand exactly what The Buddha meant by 
      these twelve terms. Fortunately, when The Buddha taught the Dhamma, He 
      also explained in great detail what He meant by what He said. Admittedly, 
      some terms would be used in slightly different contexts in different 
      suttas. The Nidanasamyutta (SN 12), however, is a collection of suttas 
      that are completely concerned with Paticca-samuppada. The second sutta in 
      this collection is called the Vibhanga Sutta [2]. Vibhanga means the 
      explanation of the terms used. As far as Dependent Origination is 
      concerned, in this sutta The Buddha gives the clearest explanation of what 
      each of these terms mean. Using Bhikkhu Bodhi&#39;s translation of the 
      Vibhanga Sutta, the meaning of these twelve terms will now be explained. 
      Also, with the aid of some other suttas, the meaning of two of the most 
      controversial terms will be clarified.</P>
      <P>First of all, The Buddha said: &quot;What, bhikkhus, is aging-and-death? The 
      aging of the various beings in the various orders of beings, their growing 
      old, brokenness of teeth, greyness of hair, wrinkling of skin, decline of 
      vitality, degeneration of the faculties: this is called aging. The passing 
      away of the various beings from the various orders of beings, their 
      perishing, their break up, disappearance, mortality, death, completion of 
      time, the break up of the aggregates, the laying down of the carcass: this 
      is called death. Thus this aging and this death are together called 
      aging-and-death.&quot; It is quite clear here that The Buddha was talking about 
      death in the usual meaning of the term, not a death in a moment (which is 
      a term that some people mistakenly use). It means the death that you call 
      an undertaker to settle.</P>
      <P>And what, bhikkhus, is birth? The birth of the various beings into the 
      various orders of beings, their being born, descent (into the womb), 
      production (abhinibbatti= rebirth), the manifestation of the aggregates, 
      the obtaining of the sense bases. This is called birth.&quot; The meaning of 
      the term &#39;various orders of beings&#39;, is fully brought out by a passage in 
      another sutta specifically dealing with Dependent Origination, the 
      Mahanidana Sutta (DN 15): &quot;With birth as condition there is aging and 
      death. How that is so, Ananda, should be understood in this way. If there 
      were absolutely and utterly no birth of any kind anywhere - that is, of 
      gods into the state of gods, of celestials into the state of celestials, 
      of spirits, demons, human beings, quadrupeds, winged creatures, reptiles, 
      each into their own state - if there were no birth of beings, of any sort 
      into any state, then, in the complete absence of birth, with the cessation 
      of birth, would aging and death be discerned?&quot; &quot;Certainly not, venerable 
      sir.&quot; [3] Again, it is quite clear here that birth means what we would 
      normally consider it to be: the arising in the human realm of a being in 
      the womb.</P>
      <P>And what, bhikkhus, is existence (bhava)? There are these three kinds 
      of existence: sense-sphere existence, form-sphere existence, 
      formless-sphere existence. This is called existence.&quot; Because this term, 
      bhava, is often misunderstood I will explain its meaning in further 
      detail. The above classification of existence into three realms is 
      sometimes called the tiloka, the three worlds. The kamaloka are the worlds 
      dominated by the five senses. They are the human realm, the animal realm, 
      the realm of ghosts, the hell realms and the deva realms up to, but not 
      including the brahmaloka. The rupaloka are the silent worlds wherein one 
      exists in the jhana attainments. They begin with the brahmaloka and 
      include several other realms based on higher jhanas. The arupaloka are the 
      worlds of pure mind, wherein one exists in one of the four immaterial 
      attainments. The rupaloka and arupaloka are the jhana experience attained 
      at the moment of death that continues for vast periods of time, 
      transcending cataclysms of universes and counted in, sometimes, thousands 
      of aeons.</P>
      <P>To understand the full meaning of bhava one has to go to the Anguttara 
      Nikaya (3, 76), where Venerable Ananda asks The Buddha, &quot;What is bhava?&quot; 
      The Buddha responds by questioning Ananda: &quot;If there was no kamma ripening 
      in the kamaloka, would there be existence in the realm dominated by the 
      five senses?&quot; He then asks the same about the other two realms: &quot;If there 
      was no kamma ripening in the rupaloka, would there be existence in the 
      rupaloka? If there was no kamma ripening in the arupaloka, would there be 
      existence in the arupaloka?&quot; Accordingly, Ananda replies &quot;certainly not&quot; 
      to each question. The Buddha then further explains: &quot;So, Ananda, you can 
      regard kamma (the actions of body, speech and mind) as the field, you can 
      regard consciousness as the seed, and you can regard craving as the 
      moisture. Thus, for beings who are blinded by ignorance and fettered by 
      craving, there is the establishment of the consciousness in this lower 
      realm, in the hinadhatu (ie. the realms dominated by the five senses), 
      (and so forth for the two higher realms of existence). Thus there is in 
      the future more existence (punabbhava), rebirth (abhinibbatti)&quot;. Here The 
      Buddha was giving the simile of plants growing, with kamma as the field, 
      and consciousness as the seed, which is fed by the moisture of craving to 
      explain how bhava is a cause for rebirth (jati).</P>
      <P>And what, bhikkhus, is clinging (sometimes translated as &#39;fuel&#39;)? There 
      are these four kinds of clinging: clinging to sensual pleasures, clinging 
      to (wrong) views, clinging to rules and vows, clinging to a doctrine of 
      self. This is called clinging.</P>
      <P>And what, bhikkhus, is craving? There are these six classes of craving: 
      craving for forms (sights), craving for sounds, craving for odours, 
      craving for tastes, craving for tactile objects, craving for mental 
      phenomena. This is called craving.</P>
      <P>And what, bhikkhus, is feeling (vedana)? [4] There are these six 
      classes of feeling: feeling born of eye-contact, feeling born of 
      ear-contact, feeling born of nose-contact, feeling born of tongue-contact, 
      feeling born of body-contact, feeling born of mind-contact. This is called 
      feeling.</P>
      <P>And what, bhikkhus, is contact? There are these six classes of contact: 
      eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, 
      mind-contact. This is called contact.</P>
      <P>And what, bhikkhus, are the six sense bases? The eye base, the ear 
      base, the nose base, the tongue base, the body base, the mind base. These 
      are called the six sense bases.</P>
      <P>And what, bhikkhus, is name-and-form (nama-rupa)? Feeling, perception, 
      volition (cetana), contact (phassa), and attention (manasikara): this is 
      called name. The four great elements and the form derived from the four 
      great elements: this is called form. Thus this name and this form are 
      together called name-and-form.</P>
      <P>And what, bhikkhus, is consciousness? There are these six classes of 
      consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, 
      tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness. This is 
      called consciousness.</P>
      <P>And what, bhikkhus, are the volitional formations (sankhara)? There are 
      these three kinds of volitional formations: the bodily volitional 
      formation, the verbal volitional formation, the mental volitional 
      formation. These are called the volitional formations.&quot; The meaning of 
      sankhara is sometimes debated because this is a word that does have many 
      meanings in different places. If one wishes to see the word sankhara used 
      as a cause for rebirth, one can go to the Sankharupapatti Sutta (MN 120). 
      Sankharupapatti means &#39;rebirth according to sankhara&#39;. Here, The Buddha 
      talks about how certain beings arise in different realms according to 
      their planned actions of body, speech or mind. These are actions of body, 
      speech and mind, which are accompanied by will (cetana); and it is this 
      kamma which gives rise to future rebirth. This is called sankhara. In 
      another sutta (SN 12, 51) The Buddha talks about how, if a person who has 
      ignorance (avijjagato, who has gone to ignorance) plans a meritorious 
      sankhara (punnam sankharam abhisankaroti), his consciousness goes to a 
      meritorious place. If he plans a demeritorious sankhara (apunnam sankharam 
      abhisankaroti), his consciousness goes to an apunna place, a demeritorious 
      place. If he plans an anenja sankhara (anenja being something in-between), 
      then his consciousness goes to that place accordingly. Again, this shows 
      that there are three types of sankhara - meritorious, demeritorious and 
      in-between - and that sankhara is the working of kamma. In much the same 
      way that kamma can be made by body, speech and mind, so too there are 
      three types of sankhara - body, speech and mind sankhara.</P>
      <P>And what, bhikkhus, is ignorance (avijja)? Not knowing suffering, not 
      knowing the origin of suffering, not knowing the cessation of suffering, 
      not knowing the way leading to the cessation of suffering. This is called 
      ignorance.&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">Causality and the Twelve Factors</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>Alongside Dependent Origination, The Buddha also taught Idappaccayata, 
      Causality. The standard formula of causality is as follows:</P>
      <P>When this is, that is. From the arising of this, that arises.<BR>
      When this is not, that is not. From the ceasing of this, that ceases.</P>
      <I>
      <P>Imasmim sati, idam hoti. Imass uppadadam uppajjati.<BR>
      Imasmim asati, idam na hoti. Imassa nirodha, idam nirujjhati.&quot;</I> -- SN 
      12, 21.</P>
      <P>The first feature of such causality that must be emphasized is that 
      there can be a substantial time interval between a cause and its effect. 
      It is a mistake to assume that the effect follows one moment after its 
      cause, or that it appears simultaneously with its cause. In Buddhist 
      causality, the cause and its effect can be separated by any length of 
      time.</P>
      <P>The above two Pali phrases Imasmim sati, idam hoti, and Imasmim asati, 
      idam na hoti are grammatical constructions called in Pali &#39;locative 
      absolutes&#39;. In Professor A.K. Warder&#39;s Introduction to Pali (page 103), 
      the author states categorically that, in such a grammatical construction, 
      the subordinate action (the cause) can precede or be simultaneous with the 
      main action (the effect). As far as the Pali is concerned, the grammar 
      allows the cause to precede the effect by any length of time interval.</P>
      <P>For example, in the Nidana Samyutta (SN 12, 10) The Buddha states:</P>
      <P>&quot;When birth is, death is. From the arising of birth, death arises.&quot;</P>
      <P>It has been shown already that in the Nidana Samyutta &#39;birth&#39; and 
      &#39;death&#39; are to be understood in their common meanings. It is clear that 
      birth and death do not happen simultaneously. Nor does birth precede death 
      by just one moment. Birth can sometimes precede death by many years - 80, 
      90, 100, even 120 years.</P>
      <P>I have emphasized this point because of the misunderstandings about 
      Dependent Origination presented by some modern authors on the subject. The 
      fact remains that there can be a substantial time interval between a cause 
      and its effect.</P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">On the Meaning of <I>Sanditthika</I> and
      <I>Akalika</I></FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>Some modern writers have suggested that the effect must arise 
      simultaneously with its cause, or arise just one moment after, for this to 
      qualify as a Dhamma which can be &#39;seen here and now&#39; and be &#39;immediate&#39;. 
      They argue that since the Dhamma is sanditthika and akalika, and Dependent 
      Origination is one of the central features of the Dhamma, therefore 
      Dependent Origination must be sanditthika and akalika. But does 
      &#39;sanditthika&#39; mean &#39;seen here and now&#39;? Does &#39;akalika&#39; mean &#39;immediate&#39;? 
      As I will now show, these translations can be misleading.</P>
      <P>The passage in the suttas which gives the clearest indication of the 
      meaning of &#39;sanditthika&#39; is in the Mahadukkhakkhandha Sutta (MN 13). In 
      this sutta, the dangers of sensual pleasures are described by seven 
      examples of consequences to be experienced in this life, and all seven are 
      described as &#39;sanditthika&#39;. This is in contrast to the consequence of 
      sensual pleasures described in the sutta&#39;s next paragraph that are to be 
      experienced after death and are called samparayika. Clearly, sanditthika 
      and samparayika are antonyms (words with opposite meanings). In this 
      context, sanditthika must mean &#39;visible in this life&#39;. Although some Pali 
      words carry slightly different meanings in different contexts, this is 
      rare and it seems reasonable to assume that sanditthika mans &#39;visible in 
      this life&#39; in all other contexts as well.</P>
      <P>Sanditthika and kalika (the opposite of akalika) are used together in a 
      revealing phrase which occurs three times in the suttas (SN 1, 20; SN 4, 
      21; and MN 70). The phrase, with minor variations in each sutta is as 
      follows:</P>
      <P>I don&#39;t run after what is kalika, having abandoned what is sanditthika.<BR>
      I run after what is sanditthika, having abandoned what is kalika.</P>
      <I>
      <P>Naham sanditthikam hitva, kalikam anudhavami.<BR>
      Kalikam hitva, sanditthikam anudhavami.</P>
      </I>
      <P>In these three contexts, sanditthika and kalika are clearly direct 
      opposites, antonyms again. Thus it is reasonable to assume that the 
      opposite of kalika, akalika, must be synonymous with sanditthika. That is, 
      sanditthika and akalika have essentially the same meaning. They both refer 
      to that which is &#39;visible in this life&#39;.</P>
      <P>For example, The Buddha encouraged such practices as maranasati, the 
      meditation on death, and many monks, nuns and lay Buddhists practise this 
      method of meditation with liberating results. Maranasati is certainly a 
      part of the Dhamma that is sanditthika and akalika. So, if these two Pali 
      words really did mean &#39;here and now&#39; and &#39;immediate&#39;, maranasati would be 
      next to impossible - one would need to be dead to be able to contemplate 
      death in the &#39;here and now&#39;, &#39;immediately&#39;! Obviously, sanditthika and 
      akalika do not have such a meaning. They both refer to something visible 
      in this life, as opposed to what may only be known after one has died.</P>
      <P>It is because each one of the 12 factors of Dependent Origination can 
      be seen in this life, and their causal relationship can also be seen in 
      this life, that Dependent Origination spanning more than one life 
      qualifies as a Dhamma that is sanditthika and akalika.</P>
      <P>You may not be able to directly see your own death, but you can see 
      death occurring every day in the hospitals, on the television or in the 
      newspapers. You don&#39;t have to wait until some afterlife to understand the 
      truth of death. You have also seen birth, maybe not your own, but that of 
      many others. You can verify the truth of birth in this very life. Then by 
      seeing human beings in their various stages from birth to death, you can 
      verify in this life that birth is the cause of death. This is why the part 
      of Dependent Origination &#39;with birth as a condition, aging and death&#39; is a 
      Dhamma that is sanditthika and akalika, to be seen in this life.</P>
      <P>You cannot see all the 12 factors in this moment, because they do not 
      occur all in one moment. But you can see a manifestation of each factor in 
      this very life. That, also is why Dependent Origination is sanditthika and 
      akalika.</P>
      <P>You can also see in this life the causality that links each pair of 
      neighbouring factors. Through the development of penetrating insight 
      empowered by tranquil meditation, you can see in this life how feeling 
      (vedana) gives rise to craving (tanha). You can similarly witness how 
      craving gives rise to clinging/fuel (upadana). And you can likewise 
      understand in this life how craving and clinging/fuel produces existence 
      (bhava) and birth (jati) in the next life. The way that one sees such 
      causality stretching beyond death may be explained by paraphrasing The 
      Buddha&#39;s simile in the Mahasihanada Sutta (MN 12). One can know from data 
      seen in this life that a person&#39;s conduct will lead them to an unpleasant 
      rebirth in just the same way that one can know that a person walking along 
      a path with no fork must fall into a pit of coals further along that path. 
      Thus, even the causality that links connected factors on either side of 
      death also qualifies as a Dhamma which is sanditthika and akalika, to be 
      seen in this life.</P>
      <P>I have discussed this issue at length here only because the 
      misunderstandings over the meaning of sanditthika and akalika have 
      resulted in a misconceived rejection of The Buddha&#39;s clear intention to 
      let His Dependent Origination span more than one life.</P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">Causality and the Necessary and 
      Sufficient Conditions</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>I have already introduced The Buddha&#39;s formula for causality, 
      Idappaccayata, earlier on in this essay. Here I will show how 
      Idappaccayata relates to what in Western logic we call a &#39;necessary 
      condition&#39; and a &#39;sufficient condition&#39;. This modern analysis of causes 
      throws much light on Idappaccayata and Dependent Origination.</P>
      <P>A necessary condition is a cause without which there would be no 
      effect. For example, fuel is a necessary condition for a fire. Without 
      fuel there can be no fire. The necessary condition is expressed by the 
      second half of Idappaccayata:</P>
      <I>
      <P>When this is not, that is not. From the ceasing of this, that ceases.</P>
      </I>
      <P>A sufficient condition is a cause that must always produce the effect. 
      For example, a fire is a sufficient condition for heat. A fire must cause 
      heat. The sufficient condition is expressed by the first half of 
      Idappaccayata:</P>
      <I>
      <P>When this is, that is. From the arising of this, that arises.</P>
      </I>
      <P>In order to demonstrate the difference between these two types of 
      causes I will use the example just given. Fuel is a necessary condition 
      for fire, because with the ceasing of fuel, the fire ceases. But fuel is 
      not a sufficient condition for fire, because fuel doesn&#39;t always produce 
      fire - some fuel remains unlit. Fire is a sufficient condition for heat, 
      because fire must cause heat. But fire is not a necessary condition for 
      heat, because without fire there can still be heat - heat can be generated 
      from other sources.</P>
      <P>So a necessary condition is a cause without which there would be no 
      effect, and it is expressed by the second half of Idappaccayata. A 
      sufficient condition is a cause that must produce the effect, and it is 
      expressed by the first half of Idappaccayata. Together they make up 
      Buddhist causality.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>The &#39;forward&#39; order of Paticca-samuppada, when analysed, shows that 
      only some of the first 11 factors are a sufficient condition for the 
      factor following. Those factors linked by a sufficient condition, meaning 
      that the following factor must come about sooner or later as a consequence 
      of the preceding factor, are as follows:</P>
      <DIR>
        <I>
        <P>avijja - sankhara <BR>
        vinnana - namarupa <BR>
        namarupa - salayatana <BR>
        salayatana - phassa <BR>
        phassa - vedana <BR>
        tanha - upadana <BR>
        bhava - jati <BR>
        jati - dukkha </P>
      </DIR>
      </I>
      <P>Thus, when there is avijja, there will inevitably occur some kamma 
      formations inclining to rebirth. When there is vinnana, there must be 
      namarupa, salayatana, phassa and vedana. When there is tanha, there will 
      be upadana. Also, bhava is sufficient to produce birth (see AN 3, 76). 
      Then, most importantly, jati must produce dukkha. Having been born one 
      must suffer dukkha. Therefore, the only escape from suffering is to cease 
      being reborn. As Venerable Sariputta said:</P>
      <P>In brief, to be reborn is dukkha, not to be reborn is sukha 
      (happiness). -- (AN 10, 65)</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>It is of interest now to look at the links that are not sufficient 
      conditions:</P>
      <P>Sankhara is not a sufficient condition for rebirth linking 
      consciousness and the stream of consciousness that follows. This is 
      because, having produced many rebirth-inclining kamma formations early on 
      in one&#39;s life, it is possible to make them all null and void (called 
      &#39;ahosi kamma&#39;) with the attainment of arahant, which attainment eliminates 
      the stream of consciousness that would otherwise begin at rebirth.</P>
      <P>The fact that upadana is not a sufficient condition for bhava is 
      similar to sankhara not being a sufficient condition for vinnana. Through 
      the development of the Noble Eightfold Path as far as Full Enlightenment, 
      no new upadana are generated and all previous upadana becomes ineffective 
      in producing a ground for a new existence or bhava. The upadana previous 
      to Full Enlightenment becomes, as it were, &#39;ahosi upadana&#39;.</P>
      <P>Even more obvious, vedana is not a sufficient condition for tanha. 
      Vedana are certainly experienced by arahants, but they never generate 
      tanha. Moreover, for ordinary people, not every vedana produces craving.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>Some Western Buddhists have proposed that the &#39;forward&#39; order of 
      Paticca-samuppada can be halted by &#39;cutting&#39; the process between vedana 
      and tanha. Often I have heard some suggest that rebirth can be avoided 
      through using sati (mindfulness) on vedana to stop it generating tanha and 
      the following factors of Paticca-samuppada. This is, in my understanding, 
      misconceived on two grounds.</P>
      <P>First, the &#39;forward&#39; order of Paticca-samuppada was never intended to 
      demonstrate how the process should be &#39;cut&#39;. The &#39;forward&#39; order is only 
      meant to show how the process continues. The teaching on how the process 
      is &#39;cut&#39;, or rather ceases, is the purpose reserved for the &#39;reverse&#39; 
      order of Paticca-samuppada or &#39;Dependent Cessation&#39;.</P>
      <P>Secondly, even though vedana does not inevitably produce tanha, because 
      it is not a sufficient condition, it is well stated by The Buddha that 
      only when avijja ceases once and for all does vedana never generate tanha 
      ! This means that one doesn&#39;t &#39;cut&#39; the process using sati on vedana. Sati 
      is not enough. The process stops from the cessation of avijja, as 
      Dependent Cessation makes abundantly clear. The cessation of avijja is 
      much more than the practice of sati.</P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">Misreading the Suttas</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>There is a sutta in the Anguttara collection that is often presented as 
      evidence that Dependent Origination does not span more than one life. This 
      sutta is called &#39;Tenets&#39; in the Pali Text Society&#39;s translation (AN 3, 
      61). Some interpret this sutta as stating that vedana is not caused by 
      kamma formations (sankhara) done in a past life. Therefore the link called 
      sankhara in Dependent Origination (which does cause vedana) cannot mean 
      kamma formations of a previous life. I will show below that this 
      conclusion is wrong, as it comes from a misreading of the suttas.</P>
      <P>The relevant part of this sutta presents three theories to explain why 
      one feels pleasant, unpleasant or neutral vedana. The first theory states 
      that everything one feels is due to what one did in the past (sabbam tam 
      pubbe katahetu). The other two theories state that everything one feels is 
      either caused by God or by chance. The Buddha categorically states in this 
      sutta that all three theories are wrong.</P>
      <P>The first theory, the one pertinent to this discussion, that everything 
      that one feels now is due to what one did in the past, is repeated in the 
      Devadaha Sutta (MN 101) where it is said to be a belief of the Jains. The 
      Jains held that all the suffering one experienced in this life was due to 
      bad kamma from a previous life. Indeed, this sutta clarifies this first 
      theory as meaning everything that one feels now is due to what one did in 
      a past life. The Devadaha Sutta disproves this theory.</P>
      <P>So it is true that The Buddha denied that everything that one feels, 
      happiness or suffering or neutral feeling, is due to what one did in a 
      past life (i.e. due to kamma formations of a past life). This should be 
      obvious. Some of what one feels is caused by kamma formations from a past 
      life, some caused by past kamma formations earlier in this life, and some 
      caused by kamma formations being performed now. What The Buddha was 
      denying was that all happiness or suffering or neutral feelings are caused 
      by kamma from a previous life.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out that The Buddha is here referring to the type 
      of feeling, rather than to feeling itself. It is true that whichever one 
      of the three types of feeling that one experiences, happiness or suffering 
      or neutral, is not always due to kamma from a past life. But it is also 
      true that the situation whereby one can experience feeling at all, the 
      fact that vedana exists, is due to kamma from a past life.</P>
      <P>A simile might make this clearer. The situation that you possess a TV 
      on a public holiday is due to you having purchased it on some previous 
      day. Its presence, as it were, is due to kamma from a past day. But 
      whichever one of the three available channels that appears on the screen, 
      Channel Happiness or Channel Suffering or Channel Neutral, is not always 
      due to what you did on some previous day. The content is not all due to 
      kamma from the past.</P>
      <P>In the same way, The Buddha states that the existence of vedana in this 
      life is due to kamma formations done in the previous life. But the 
      particular type of feeling, happiness or suffering or neutral is not 
      always due to kamma from a previous life.</P>
      <P>Once the distinction is made between vedana and the contents of vedana 
      (happiness or suffering or neutral), it is clear that the &#39;Tenets&#39; sutta 
      doesn&#39;t state that vedana is not caused by kamma formations from a 
      previous life. It does not disprove the orthodox understanding of 
      Dependent Origination as spanning three lives.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the latter part of the &#39;Tenets&#39; sutta introduces Dependent 
      Origination from a unique starting point.</P>
      <P>&quot;Depending on the six elements (earth, air, fire, water, space and 
      consciousness) there is the descent of the being to be born into the womb; 
      when there is descent, there is name-and-form; with name-and-form as 
      condition, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition, 
      contact; with contact as condition, feeling.&quot;</P>
      <I>
      <P>Channam dhutanam upadaya gabbhass&#39; vakkanti hoti; okkantiy sati, 
      namarupam; namarupa-paccaya salayatanam; salayatana-paccaya phasso; 
      phassa-paccaya vedana.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>Thus The Buddha is clearly showing the origin of vedana as due to the 
      descent of the being to be born into the womb. This can now be compared to 
      the Mahanidana Sutta (DN 15) and its definition of namarupa:</P>
      <P>It was said &#39;with consciousness as condition there is name-and-form&#39;. 
      How this is so, Ananda, should be understood in this way. If consciousness 
      were not to descend into the mother&#39;s womb, would name-and-form take shape 
      in the womb?&quot; &quot;No, venerable sir.</P>
      <P>namarupa-paccaya vinnann&#39;ti, iti kho pa&#39;etam vuttam. Tad, Ananda, imina 
      p&#39;etam pariyayena veditabbam, yatha namarupa-paccaya vinnanam. vinnanam va 
      hi Ananda matu kucchismim no okkamissattha, api nu kho namarupam matu 
      kucchismim samucchissatha&#39; ti? No h&#39;etam bhante.</P>
      <P>This clearly equates the descent of the being to be born into the womb 
      of &#39;Tenets&#39; with the descent of (rebirth linking) consciousness into the 
      womb of the Mahanidana Sutta. Thus vedana is said in &#39;Tenets&#39; to be caused 
      by the first consciousness arising in this life, whose own cause can only 
      be found in a previous life.</P>
      <P>Thus the sutta in the Anguttara collection which is often presented as 
      evidence that Dependent Origination does not span more than one life, when 
      read accurately and completely, actually clearly proves the opposite. The 
      situation that vedana exists at all is due to avijja and kamma formations 
      from the previous life, and Dependent Origination, as taught by The 
      Buddha, does indeed span more than a single life.</P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">The Purpose of Dependent Origination</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>So far, I have described what Dependent Origination means. I have 
      shown, by quoting from the original texts, that the factor vinnana refers 
      to the stream of consciousness beginning in a life after the avijja and 
      kamma formations that caused the rebirth. I have shown how causality, the 
      link between one factor and the next can involve a substantial interval of 
      time, even extending beyond this life into a future life. In summary, I 
      have shown that Paticca-samuppada, as taught by The Buddha in the suttas, 
      can only mean a process that spans three lives. To believe that 
      Paticca-samuppada must be restricted to a single life, or even to a few 
      moments, is simply untenable in light of reason and facts.</P>
      <P>It is now time to consider the purpose of Dependent Origination. One 
      can gain understanding of a thing, not only by finding out what it is made 
      of, but also by investigating what it does. Now I am going to discuss the 
      function of Paticca-samuppada. I will discuss three purposes of 
      Paticca-samuppada:</P>
      <DIR>
        <P>1. To explain how there can be rebirth without a soul. <BR>
        2. To answer the question &quot;What is life?&quot; <BR>
        3. To understand why there is suffering, and where suffering comes to an 
        end. </P>
      </DIR>
      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">Rebirth Without a Soul</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>One of the most common questions that I am asked is how can there be 
      rebirth when there is no soul to be reborn. The answer to that question is 
      Dependent Origination. Paticca-samuppada shows the empty process, empty of 
      a soul that is, which flows within a life and overflows into another life. 
      It also shows the forces at work in the process, which drive it this way 
      and that, even exercising sway in a subsequent life. Dependent Origination 
      also reveals the answer to how kamma done in a previous life can affect a 
      person in this life.</P>
      <P>Dependent Origination presents two sequences that generate rebirth:</P>
      <DIR>
        <P>1) delusion (avijja) + kamma the stream of consciousness beginning at 
        rebirth (vina). <BR>
        2) craving (tanha) + fuel (updna) existence (bhava) + rebirth into that 
        existence (jti). </P>
      </DIR>
      <P>These are parallel processes. They describe the same operation viewed 
      from two different angles. I will now combine them:</P>
      <P>Deluded kamma and craving produce the fuel which generates existence 
      and rebirth (into that existence), thereby giving rise to the start of the 
      stream of consciousness that is at the heart of the new life.</P>
      <P>It is kamma and craving, both under the sway of delusion, that is the 
      force propelling the stream of consciousness into a new life.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>I will now offer some similes to illustrate this operation. These 
      similes are only approximations and, therefore, will never perfectly match 
      Paticca-samuppda. This is because Dependent Origination is mainly a 
      process describing the flow of the mental consciousness, whilst the 
      similes at my disposal are from the more well known material world. Still, 
      they should help to clarify one&#39;s understanding.</P>
      <P>Someone goes to an airport to fly to another country. If they have 
      enough money for the fare and they have a desire to go to a new country, 
      then they may arrive in that land. If they have the fare but not the 
      desire, or the desire but not the fare, or they lack both, then they will 
      not arrive in the new country. In this simile: the person stands for the 
      stream of consciousness; the airport stands for death; the new country 
      stands for the next life; the fare stands for the person&#39;s accumulated 
      kamma; and their desire to go there stands for craving. With much good 
      kamma and a craving for happiness, or just the craving to be, the stream 
      of consciousness that one thinks of as &#39;me&#39; is propelled into one&#39;s chosen 
      next life. With much bad kamma and a craving for happiness, one cannot 
      reach the happiness one wants, and thus one is propelled into an 
      unsatisfactory next life. With much bad kamma and a craving for 
      punishment, what we recognize in this life as the guilt complex, one falls 
      into a next life of suffering. Then with much good kamma and no craving at 
      all, one goes nowhere. Like the traveller at the airport, they have enough 
      money to go wherever they want first-class, but the delusion has been 
      shattered and the desire that generated all this coming-and-going is no 
      more. They cease at the airport.</P>
      <P>How does one seed produce a new seed? Suppose a seed is planted in a 
      good field, it is fed by moisture carrying essential nutrients, and it 
      grows to maturity producing another seed at its death. There is no soul or 
      self in the seed, yet one seed has evolved into another seed following a 
      process of cause and effect. The original seed and the new seed are 
      completely different. Almost certainly, there isn&#39;t even one molecule of 
      the original seed to be found in the new seed. Even the DNA, though 
      similar, is not the same. It is an example of a well known process which 
      spans a life, but with nothing that one can identify as an essence passing 
      unaltered from the original seed to the new seed. Rebirth, as it were, has 
      happened with no &#39;seed-soul&#39; going across. I mention this example because 
      it is similar to a metaphor of The Buddha:</P>
      <P>Kamma is like the field, craving like the moisture, and the stream of 
      consciousness like the seed. When beings are blinded by delusion and 
      fettered with craving, the stream of consciousness becomes established, 
      and rebirth of a new seed (consciousness) takes place in the future.&quot; 
      (paraphrased from AN 3, 76)</P>
      <P>It is interesting to describe how a recent, real instance of kamma and 
      craving worked together to change bhava, the kind of one&#39;s existence. In 
      the late 1970&#39;s in Britain, many uneconomical coalmines were permanently 
      closed. One particular disused mine was close to a heavily populated area 
      in South Wales. When some of the poor of that area had unwanted kittens, 
      they would cheaply dispose of them by cruelly throwing them down into the 
      abandoned mineshaft. Several years later, some engineers entered that mine 
      to check on its safety. They found a remarkable discovery. Some of the 
      kittens had survived the fall and, in the space of only a few generations, 
      had evolved into a completely new species of cat, blind in their eyes but 
      with enormous ears. Craving and behavioural conditioning (kamma) had been 
      the obvious driving forces that produced the mutation.</P>
      <P>The above examples only begin to give an indication of the process that 
      is Paticca-samuppda. Dependent Origination, after all, is mainly a process 
      that describes the flow of mental consciousness, and this is fundamentally 
      different from material processes. If one can imagine a beach of white 
      sand, then the stretch looks continuous. On closer examination, though, 
      one finds that the beach is made up of an uncountable number of small 
      grains, each close to the next. If one looks even closer, one discovers 
      that the grains aren&#39;t even touching, that each grain is alone. Similarly, 
      when one&#39;s mindfulness has been empowered by jhana meditation, one may see 
      the stream of consciousness in much the same way. Before, it looked like a 
      continuous stretch of unbroken cognition. But now it is revealed as 
      granular, tiny moments of consciousness, uncountable in number, close 
      together but not touching, and each one alone. Having seen the true nature 
      of consciousness, only then can one see how one moment of consciousness 
      influences what follows. Kamma, like a discrete particle of behavioural 
      conditioning, together with craving combine to make the impersonal forces 
      that steer the journey of consciousness, like an aircraft on an automatic 
      super-pilot. Furthermore, when the insight comes, based uniquely on the 
      data of jhana, that the mental consciousness is independent of the body 
      and must clearly survive the death of the body, then one sees with 
      absolute certainty that the forces of kamma and craving that drive mental 
      consciousness now, will continue to drive the mind through and beyond 
      death. Rebirth and its process are seen. Paticca-samuppda is understood.</P>
      <P>The Buddha said to Venerable Ananda at the opening of the Mahnidna 
      Sutta (DN 15): <I>This Dependent Origination, Ananda, is deep and it 
      appears deep.</P>
      </I>
      <P>In my opinion, one needs the experience of jhana to see it clearly. 
      Nevertheless, I hope that the explanation and similes that I have given 
      will help throw some light onto the true nature and purpose of this 
      impersonal process that drives the mind from life to life. At least you 
      can know that when Paticca-samuppda is fully understood, it is also 
      clearly seen how rebirth happens without any soul.</P>

      <P>One of the major difficulties that Buddhists find with the teaching of 
      Anatta is that if there is no soul or self, then what is this? What is it 
      that thinks, wills, feels or knows? What is it that is reading this? In 
      summary, what is life?</P>
      <P>In one of the most profound of all suttas in the Buddhist scriptures, 
      the Kaccnagotta Sutta (SN 12, 15), which was to play a major role in later 
      Buddhist history, The Buddha stated that, for the most part, people&#39;s 
      views on the nature of life fall into one of two extremes. Either they 
      maintain that there is a soul, or they hold that there is nothing at all. 
      Unfortunately, too many Buddhists confuse the teaching of Anatta and side 
      with the view that there is nothing at all.</P>
      <P>The Buddha condemned both extremes with a devastating argument based on 
      experience. It is untenable to maintain that there is a soul because 
      anything that can be meaningfully considered as a soul or self the body, 
      will, love, consciousness or mind - can all be seen as impermanent. As The 
      Buddha put it &quot;One cannot say that there is (a soul), because a cessation 
      (of all that can be a soul) is seen&quot;. On the other hand, it is untenable 
      to maintain that there is nothing at all, because it is obvious that life 
      is! As The Buddha put it &quot;One cannot say that there is nothing, because an 
      arising (of all phenomena) is seen&quot;. Thus, as the Buddhist 
      philosopher-monk Nagarjuna (2nd century CE) was to remind everyone, The 
      Buddha clearly denied the doctrine of absolute emptiness.</P>
      <P>Even today, most people fall into one of these two extremes. Either 
      that there is nothing at all and the mind, love, life is complete 
      illusion, or that there is an eternal soul with God as the corollary. Both 
      are wrong.</P>
      <P>The Kaccanagotta Sutta continues with The Buddha pointing out that 
      there is a middle that has been excluded in this dichotomy of views. There 
      is a third option that avoids both extremes. So what is this &#39;middle&#39; 
      between the extremes of a soul and nothingness? That middle, said The 
      Buddha, is Paticca-samuppda.</P>
      <P>When The Buddha stated that it is untenable to hold that there is a 
      soul or self (or a God) because a cessation is seen, He explained what He 
      meant as: &quot;From the cessation of delusion, kamma formations cease; from 
      the cessation of kamma formations consciousness ceases ... from the 
      cessation of birth, dukkha ceases&quot; [5]. He was referring to the passing 
      away process called Dependent Cessation. This impersonal process is the 
      very thing that we identify as life. Moreover, it includes all the &#39;usual 
      suspects&#39; that masquerade as a soul: the body (part of nmarpa), will (part 
      of the kamma formations, sometimes tanha), love (part of the kamma 
      formations and mostly part of updana, clinging), consciousness (vina) and 
      mind (part of salyatana and often equivalent to vina). These usual 
      suspects are clearly seen in the light of Dependent Cessation as 
      transient, insubstantial, granular and fading away soon after they arise. 
      They are all conditioned. They exist only as long as they are supported by 
      their external causes, which are themselves unstable. When the external 
      supporting causes disappear, so do each of the usual suspects. Because 
      these things do not persist, since they do not continue in being, it is 
      untenable to hold that there is a soul, a self or a God.</P>
      <P>When The Buddha stated that it is also untenable to maintain that all 
      is pure emptiness, void, nothing, because an arising is seen, He explained 
      what He meant as: &quot;From the arising of delusion, kamma formations arise, 
      from kamma formations arises the stream of consciousness in the next life 
      ... from birth arises dukkha!&quot; He was referring to the arising process 
      called Dependent Origination. Again, this impersonal process includes all 
      that we can know as &#39;life&#39;. Because this arising is seen, one cannot say 
      they are not. It is not an illusion. These phenomena are real.</P>
      <P>A simile might help here. In mathematics a point is a concept drawn 
      from the science of life. It describes aspects of real phenomena. Yet a 
      point has no size. It is smaller than any measure that you can suggest, 
      yet it is bigger than nothing. In a sense, one cannot say a point is, 
      because it does not persist, it does not continue in space. Yet one cannot 
      say it is not, as it is clearly different from nothing. The point is 
      similar to the momentary nature of conscious experience. Nothing continues 
      in being therefore it cannot be something. Something arises therefore it 
      cannot be nothing. The solution to this paradox, the excluded middle, is 
      the impersonal process.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>In Advaita Vedanta, one common method is to pursue the enquiry &quot;Who am 
      I?&quot;. That is a loaded question. It carries an implicit premise that has 
      yet to be agreed on. The question &quot;Who am I?&quot; assumes that &#39;I am&#39;, only 
      one doesn&#39;t know what. In the Sabbsav Sutta (MN 2) The Buddha called such 
      enquiries &#39;attending unwisely&#39; (ayonisamanasikra), and in the 
      Mahtanhsankhaya Sutta (MN 38) The Buddha described this as remaining 
      &#39;inwardly perplexed&#39; (kathamkath). In other words, it doesn&#39;t lead to 
      anything penetrating. This enquiry of Advaita Vedanta is said to end with 
      an experience of ultimate reality described as &#39;You are that&#39;, or &#39;Tat 
      tvam asi&#39; in Sanskrit. But such an end-doctrine is plainly begging the 
      question. What is this &#39;That&#39; that you are? The Buddha never circled 
      around the issue in such a fruitless way. For The Buddha would say:</P>
      <I>
      <P>&#39;Patticca-samuppado tvam asi&#39;<BR>
      &#39;You are Dependent Origination&#39;</P>
      </I>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>What was once assumed to be &#39;me&#39;, a self or a soul, or assumed to be an 
      illusion or complete emptiness, is now clearly seen as the impersonal 
      process of Dependent Origination, a causal sequence rolling on from life 
      to life, containing all and anything that can meaningfully be a soul, the 
      &#39;usual suspects&#39; as I call them, but nothing continuing in being.</P>
      <P>So, if you wanted to find out who you are, now you have the answer - 
      Dependent Origination!</P>
      <P>And if you wanted to find out what is life, now you also have the 
      answer - Dependent Origination! Paticca-samuppada - That&#39;s life!</P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">Why Suffering?</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>The main purpose of Paticca-samuppada is to establish the reason why we 
      suffer, and to find a way of eliminating suffering once and for all. To 
      understand this point, we must now take a look at The Buddha&#39;s discovery 
      of Dependent Origination in the context of the story of The Buddha&#39;s life.</P>
      <P>The Bodhisatta (an unenlightened being soon to become Enlightened) sat 
      under the Bodhi Tree on the night of His Enlightenment for the sole 
      purpose of finding a solution to suffering. As a young man, He had been 
      deeply moved by the tragic sights of an old man, a sick man, and a dead 
      man. Realizing that the suffering of old age, sickness and death was the 
      certain destiny of himself as well, He left home in order to find a way 
      out of all suffering. Under the Bodhi Tree, the Bodhisatta entered the 
      jhanas for the first time since He was a small boy. Having thus empowered 
      his mind, He then pursued a method of enquiry called &#39;yonisamanasikra&#39;, 
      which literally means &#39;work of the mind which goes back to the source&#39;. 
      The problem was suffering, in particular the seemingly inescapable 
      suffering associated with old age, sickness and death. Tracing the problem 
      back to the source, the source was seen as birth.</P>
      <I>
      <P>Jatipaccay Dukkha - &#39;Suffering is caused by birth&#39;.</P>
      </I>
      <P>As shown above, birth is a sufficient cause for suffering, that is, 
      birth must give rise to dukkha. Every being that is born will get old, get 
      sick and die, and experience the inescapable dukkha associated with that 
      process. Thus birth is the problem.</P>
      <P>This first link of Paticca-samuppada is rarely given the attention it 
      deserves. It has enormous implications. Before the great insight into 
      Dependent Origination under the Bodhi Tree, the Bodhisatta, like most 
      people, had lived in hope that somehow He could attain perfect happiness 
      in this existence or some future existence. Now He saw that all existence 
      (bhava) is inextricably involved with suffering. There is no perfect 
      happiness to be found in any form of existence. As The Buddha said in the 
      Anguttara collection:</P>
      <P><I>Just as a tiny bit of faeces has a bad smell, so I do not recommend 
      even a tiny bit of existence, not even for so long as a fingersnap. </I>
      (AN 1, 18)</P>
      <P>A simile might help. A person born in a harsh prison, raised in that 
      prison, who has spent all their time in the prison, can only know prison 
      life. They don&#39;t even suspect that anything beyond their prison can exist. 
      So they make the best of prison. Those who think positively, because they 
      have gone to prison seminars, begin to think that the harsh prison is 
      instead a wonderful place. They even compose songs like &quot;All jails bright 
      and beautiful ... the good Lord made them all&quot;! Others get involved with 
      social service, compassionately decorating the prison cells of others. 
      When someone gets tortured or otherwise punished in jail, they think 
      something has gone wrong and look for someone to blame. If someone 
      suggests that it is the very nature of jail to be suffering, then they are 
      dismissed as a pessimist and told to &quot;Get a life!&quot;. One full moon night, a 
      prisoner discovers a door leading out of the jail and goes through. Only 
      then does he realize that jail was inherently suffering and you can&#39;t make 
      it otherwise. He goes back to tell his fellow prisoners. Most don&#39;t 
      believe him. They can&#39;t even imagine anything other than their jail. When 
      he says that the jail is suffering and the cessation of imprisonment is 
      happiness, he is accused by one and all of escapism.</P>
      <P>Sometimes people rebuke me saying &quot;You monks are just trying to escape 
      from the real world!&quot;.</P>
      <P>I reply &quot;Well done! At last someone else has understood Buddhism!&quot;</P>
      <P>What&#39;s wrong with escapism, especially when one realises that the real 
      world is the harsh prison</P>
      <P>The Enlightenment experience of The Buddha began with the experience of 
      jhanas. These &#39;stages of letting go&#39; are also stages of increasing bliss. 
      After jhana, one can reflect on the reason why these jhanas are by far the 
      most pure and powerful happiness of one&#39;s life. What is the cause of such 
      happiness? Ajahn Chah used to say that it is like having had a tight rope 
      around one&#39;s neck for as long as one can remember. Then one day the rope 
      is suddenly released. The bliss and ease that is felt is because a huge 
      burden of suffering has gone. The ecstasy of jhana is because one has 
      escaped, albeit temporarily, from what people mean by &#39;the real world&#39;. 
      When The Buddha reflected on jhana, He realized that the real world is 
      suffering, it is a jail, and release from it is bliss. He could only know 
      this once He had stepped out beyond jail. That is one of the purposes of 
      jhana. Jhana is also called vimokkha, which means &#39;release&#39;.</P>
      <P>Even Arahants, Enlightened monks and nuns, experience suffering. They 
      are not released from suffering, they are still in the world, in jail. The 
      main difference between an ordinary &#39;prisoner&#39; and an Arahant is that the 
      latter is certain to leave soon. Using the simile from the Theragatha (Th 
      1003, 606), an Arahant is like a workman having completed the job and now 
      calmly waiting for his wages. In the sutta called &#39;The Dart&#39; (SN 36, 6) 
      suffering is compared to being stabbed with two darts. An Arahant is only 
      stabbed with one dart. The two &#39;darts&#39; refer to bodily suffering and 
      mental suffering. The Arahant, alone of this world, only experiences 
      bodily suffering. But it is still enough to say that an Arahant in this 
      life still experiences suffering. As the Enlightened nun Vajir explained 
      (SN 5, 10), what it feels like to be an Arahant is just experiencing 
      suffering arising and suffering passing away, and this was confirmed by 
      The Buddha in the Kaccnagotta Sutta (SN 12, 15), already mentioned above. 
      Arahants experience suffering because all existence (bhava) or birth 
      (jati) is suffering. Only when they pass away, or &#39;parinibbna&#39;, when 
      existence ceases, does suffering end once and for all.</P>
      <I>
      <P>&quot;Bhava-nirodho nibbnam&quot; - &quot;Nibbana is the cessation of existence.&quot;</I> 
      (SN 12, 68)</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>Having discovered that existence (bhava) and birth (jati) are a 
      sufficient cause of suffering (dukkha), that they must create suffering, 
      the problem became how to put an end to more existence (puna-bhava) and 
      rebirth. As it became popularly and accurately known, the goal of Buddhist 
      practice (for those who realize that the real world&#39;s a jail and are not 
      in denial of this truth) is to make an end of samsara, the incredibly long 
      journey through countless lives, and get off the crushing wheel of 
      rebirth.</P>
      <P>Thus, the Bodhisatta continued to pursue yonisamanasikara, work of the 
      mind that goes back to the source, to find the causes of bhava and jati. 
      He traced the sequence of causes, now known as Dependent Origination, 
      through craving (tanha) back to delusion (avijja). It was delusion that 
      was seen as the basic culprit.</P>
      <P>What is this delusion? Avijj is consistently explained as not fully 
      understanding the Four Noble Truths. In other word, one doesn&#39;t realize 
      that one is in jail. It is amazing how so many people are in such profound 
      denial of life&#39;s suffering that they show severe signs of maladjustment to 
      old age, sickness and death. Some people are even surprised that these 
      things even happen, and exhibit such derangements as anger and grief when 
      they do! Our delusion is that life can be fixed.</P>
      <P>As every Buddhist would know, the way to get out of jail, to put an end 
      to rebirth and the inevitable suffering that follows, is to develop the 
      Noble Eightfold Path culminating in jhana (samma-samdhi). But that is a 
      subject for another essay.</P>
      <P>Here I want to add that Dependent Origination is often cited as an 
      alternative definition of the Second Noble Truth, the cause of suffering. 
      And Dependent Cessation is an alternative definition of the Third Noble 
      Truth, the cessation of suffering (SN 12, 43). Thus the main purpose of 
      Dependent Origination, equivalent to the Second Noble Truth, is to answer 
      the question &quot;Why suffering?&quot;. And the main purpose of Dependent 
      Cessation, equivalent to the Third Noble Truth, is to answer the question 
      &quot;How can suffering be stopped?&quot;.</P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">Conclusion</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>In this essay, I have attempted to describe what Paticca-samuppada is 
      all about. I began by presenting the standard sequence of the twelve 
      factors, and then their meaning as defined by The Buddha Himself. It 
      should have been clear from these definitions that Paticca-samuppada, as 
      The Buddha meant it to be understood, spans more than one life.</P>
      <P>I then went on to discuss a Western model of causality, the necessary 
      and sufficient conditions, and how these slotted so neatly into 
      Idappaccayat, The Buddha&#39;s model of causality. I later used the &#39;necessary 
      and sufficient conditions&#39; model to throw more light on the different 
      forms of causal relationships between each pair of factors.</P>
      <P>A digression on the meaning of sanditthika-akalika, and a section 
      called &#39;Misreading the Suttas&#39;, were meant to address some objections 
      (misconceived, as I hope that I have proved) to the fact that 
      Paticca-samuppada in the suttas does span more than one life. Although the 
      argument here was somewhat technical, it highlighted the importance of 
      kamma and rebirth to The Buddha&#39;s Dhamma. Kamma and rebirth are obviously 
      not a mere cultural accretion, as some modern misinformed authors would 
      have us believe, but are essential to the central teaching of 
      Paticca-samuppda.</P>
      <P>Lastly, I introduced a section rarely mentioned in essays about 
      Paticca-samuppada - What is its purpose? I have shown that the purpose of 
      Paticca-samuppada is much more than mere food for intellectual debate. 
      Indeed, Paticca-samuppada demonstrates how there can be rebirth without a 
      soul, it reveals what life is, and it explains why there is suffering 
      together with the way suffering is totally ended. Paticca-samuppda answers 
      the big questions.</P>
      <P>It is no exaggeration to state that Paticca-samuppda is at the very 
      heart of the Dhamma. As The Buddha stated, one who understands 
      Paticca-samuppada accurately, also sees the Dhamma. And the one who sees 
      the Dhamma fully, is one who has entered the stream and will soon put an 
      end to all suffering. May that be you!</P>
