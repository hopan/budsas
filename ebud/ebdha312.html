      <td width="100%"><B>Colombo, Sri Lanka </B>-- The evening is chilly in the 
      Udawattekelle Forest Reserve of Kandy. The Day is October 18th, 1994. 
      Sister Nyanasiri (American Dasa Sil Matha, formerly Helen Wilder) who 
      entered the Sil Matha Order under Nyanaponika Maha Thera, as usual brings 
      the evening &#39;Gilanpasa&#39;.<P>She walks path strewn with dead leaves leading 
      from the main point of entry to the Forest Reserve, above the Trinity 
      College junior playground, passing the Tapovana and the Senanayake Asrama 
      of Bhikkhus to the little colonial cottage, the abode of Nyanaponika Maha 
      Thera, about 100 metres away.</P>
      <P>She arrives at the Silvan abode bereft of running water or electricity, 
      where only a lantern keeps the abode alight in the night. The Maha Thera 
      is feeble and blindness too framing him. Reverently she offers the 
      &#39;Gilanpasa&#39;. Maha Thera partakes of the &#39;Gilanpasa&#39;.</P>
      <P>The abode his residence since 1952, engaged in writing, studying and 
      meditating. Maha Thera joyfully says &quot;Nyanasiri, you need not bring me 
      &#39;Heeldana&#39; (breakfast) tomorrow morning. I am passing away tomorrow, right 
      on the dot at 5.30 a.m.&quot; She bursts out in laughter. Maha Thera too joins.</P>
      <P>Nyanasiri remarks, &quot;Venerable Sir, you must be an Arhant, certainly you 
      are one to foretell the exact day and time of passing away as was done by 
      the Buddha at Capala Cetiya in Vesali, three months before the final 
      passing away (Mahaparinirvana) at Kusinara between two Sala trees&quot;. On the 
      following morning right at 6.00 a.m. Nyanasiri walks through dewed path 
      through the Forest Reserve to the abode of the Maha Thera.</P>
      <P>The agitated caretaker comes forward, falls at her feet and says 
      &quot;Maniyo, Maha Thera got up at 5.00 a.m. Had a glass of hot water, washed 
      his face sat on the bed cross legged at 5.15 a.m, then stretched himself 
      on the bed and passed away at 5.30 a.m.</P>
      <P>This episode was narrated to me by Sister Nyanasiri, with whom we were 
      associated for many years. Sister Nyanasiri passed away about an year ago, 
      bequeathing all her assets to the Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy, 
      which her preceptor Ven. Nyanaponika Thera founded in 1958.</P>
      <P>The person (German) who was to become Ven. Nyanaponika Maha Thera was 
      born in Hanau, Germany on July 21, 1901 as Siegmund Feniger, the only 
      child of a Jewish family.</P>
      <P>In 1922, he moved with his parents to Berlin, where he met with other 
      German Buddhists and also had access to Buddhist literature in German 
      language. He first came across the writings of Ven. Nyanatiloka Thera 
      (1878-1957), the former German violin virtuoso Anton Gueth, which had 
      already been published in Germany. Young Siegmund had learned Ven. </P>
      <P>Nayanatiloka Thera had established a monastery for Western Monks on an 
      island lagoon (opposite the Railway station) Polgasduwa, Dodanduwa named 
      Island Hermitage. This news stirred his conscience to come to Asia and 
      become a Buddhist Monk.</P>
      <P>However this expectation did not concretecize for some time. In 1932, 
      his father passed away and did not wish to leave his widowed mother in the 
      lurch. Then Adolf Hitler, came to power in Germany. Millions of Jews were 
      gassed to death in gas chambers.</P>
      <P>Knowing he and his mother too would end up in gas chambers in November 
      1935, he left Germany along with his mother to Vienna, where they had 
      relatives. Having arranged his mother to stay in Vienna, in early 1936 he 
      left Europe for Sri Lanka and joined Ven. Nyanatiloka Thera at the Island 
      Hermitage, Polgasduwa, Dodanduwa.</P>
      <P>After several months of studies in June 1936 he was ordained as a 
      novice under the name Nyanaponika and in 1937 was conferred Higher 
      Ordination (Upasampada), under the Tutelage of Nyanatiloka Thera.</P>
      <P>In 1939, after the Nazis invaded Austria, Ven. Nyanaponika Thera 
      arranged for his mother and other relatives to come over to Sri Lanka. She 
      passed away in Colombo in 1956. Through the influence of his son and the 
      generous hosts she embraced Buddha Dhamma and became a devoted Buddhist 
      lady.</P>
      <P>Then the Second World War broke out in 1939, and the British Government 
      had all German males resident in their colonies consigned for interment 
      suspecting them to be German spies. The interment was first at Diyatalawa 
      Army cantonment in Sri Lanka and later at Dehra Dun in northern India.</P>
      <P>Despite these traumatic experiences as prisoner of war, during this 
      period, Ven. Nayanaponika Thera completed the German translations of the 
      Sutta Nipata, the Dhammasangani (the first book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka) 
      and its commentary. He also compiled an anthology of texts on Satipattana 
      Meditation. That was when at Diyatalawa and the balance writing of what 
      Ven. Nyanaponika Thera began was concluded at Dehra Dun, India.</P>
      <P>With the cessation of war, the two Bhikkhus were released from 
      interment at Dehra Dun and returned to Sri Lanka in 1946 and resided at 
      the Island Hermitage, Dodanduwa. In early 1951 they were conferred 
      citizenship of Sri Lanka.</P>
      <P>In 1946, Ven. Nyanatiloka Thera was offered a hermitage in the 
      Udawattekelle Forest Reserve, and being advanced in age preferred the 
      cooler climate of Kandy rather than to the hot and stuffy sea - coast 
      climate of Dodanduwa. In 1947, Ven. Nyanaponika Thera too joined him at 
      the new Kandy Hermitage.</P>
      <P>In 1952, both Venerable Nyanatiloka Thera and Nyanaponika There were 
      invited by the Burmese (Myanmar) Government for consultation in 
      preparation of the Sixth Buddhist Council, to be convened in 1954 to 
      re-edit and reprint the entire Pali Canon and its commentaries. On the 
      conclusion of the consultations Ven. Nyanaponika Thera stayed on in Burma 
      for a period of training in Insight Meditation (Vipassana) under the well 
      renowned meditation teacher Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw Thera.</P>
      <P>The experience he gathered motivated him to write his best known Magnum 
      Copus, &#39;&#39;The Heart of Buddhist meditation&quot; published by Buddhist 
      Publication Society with many editions and translated into more than seven 
      languages. This is a prescribed text in universities in the Study of 
      Buddhism.</P>
      <P>In 1954, the teacher and the pupil returned to Burma for the opening 
      ceremonies of the Council, which was held in a cave - structure built 
      similar to the Sattaprani Caves in Rajagaha (Rajgir) of India, where first 
      Buddhist Council was held. For the closing ceremonies in 1956 Ven. 
      Nyanaponika Thera went to Burma alone as his teacher was indisposed.</P>
      <P>In 1957, the health of Ven. Nyanatiloka Thera deteriorated and he moved 
      to Colombo for easy and ready medical attention. Finally on May 28, 1957, 
      the great pioneering scholar monk passed away and was accorded a State 
      Funeral at the Independence Square, Colombo attended by the Prime Minister 
      S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, many State officials, both the laity and religious 
      dignitaries and prelates of all Nikayas.</P>
      <P>His ashes were enshrined at the Polgasduwa Island Hermitage, Dodanduwa 
      and a tombstone was built to perpetuate his memory. Ven. Nyanaponika 
      Thera, thereafter keeping up to the request of his teacher, revised Ven. 
      Nyanatiloka Thera&#39;s German translation of the complete Anguttara Nikaya, 
      retyping the five volumes in full by himself, and also compiling a forty 
      paged index to the work.</P>
      <P>Six months after the death of his teacher, the career of Ven. 
      Nyanaponika Thera was to be launched in a new direction, a permanent 
      contribution to the spread of Buddhism worldwide. A prominent lawyer in 
      Kandy A.S. Karunaratne suggested to his friend, Trinity College teacher in 
      retirement Richard Abeysekera, that they start a society for the 
      publication of Buddhist literature in English, mainly to be distributed 
      abroad. The unanimous decision was Ven. Nyanaponika Thera in the 
      Udawattekelle Forest Reserve Aramaya would be the best director of the 
      Institution. Thus on the New year&#39;s Day of 1958, the Buddhist Publication 
      Society (BPS) was born.</P>
      <P>Devoting his entire time and energy to writings of the society, he 
      wrote tracts, encouraged others to write, collated important Suttas, 
      translated them and had them published. In addition to his own writings he 
      had 200 wheel titles and 100 Bodhi Leaves (booklets) authored by numerous 
      scholars and books were issued during his editorship of the BPS. </P>
      <P>Ven. Nayanaponika Thera&#39;s biography is completely submerged in his 
      writings. With advancing age having a heavy toll on his strength, in 1984, 
      Ven. Nayanaponika Thera retired as editor of BPS and in 1988 he retired as 
      President, accepting appointments as BPS&#39;s distinguished Patron. His fame 
      and recognition as an exponent of authentic Theravada Buddhism reached all 
      corners of the globe.</P>
      <P>In 1978, the German Oriental Society appointed him an honorary member 
      in recognition of his combination of objective scholarship with religious 
      practice as a Buddhist Monk. In 1987, the Buddhist and pali University of 
      Sri Lanka at its first convocation, conferred on him its first ever 
      Honoris Causa Degree of Doctor of Literature.</P>
      <P>In 1990, he received the Honoris Causa Degree of Doctor of Letters from 
      the University of Peradeniya. In 1993, The Amarapura Maha Sangha Sabha to 
      which he belonged for 56 years, conferred on him the honorary title of 
      Amarapura Maha Mahopadhyaya Sasana Sobhana (The Great Mentor of the 
      Amarapura Maha Sasana Sabha, Ornament of Teaching).</P>
      <P>His last birthday which fell on July 21st 1994, was celebrated by his 
      friends and the BPS staff with the release of the BPS edition of his book. 
      The Vision of Dhamma, a collection of his writings from Wheel and Bodhi 
      leaves series. On the 19th of October 1994, the last day of his 58th Rains 
      Retreat as a Bhikkhu, he breathed his last in the pre-dawn quietude of the 
      Udawattekelle forest hermitage.</P>
      <P>His body was cremated at Mahiyawa Cemetery Kandy at which a large 
      gathering of religious and lay dignitaries as well as his many friends and 
      admirers. On the 29th of January after the traditional of Buddhistic 
      three-month Alms Giving, his remains were interred at the Island Hermitage 
      in Dodanduwa, where he spent his formative years as a Bhikkhu. His 
      tombstone lies in close proximity to that of his teacher Ven. Nyanatiloka 
      Thera.</P>
