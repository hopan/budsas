      <P><FONT SIZE="6">W</FONT>e're coming to the end of our winter retreat. 
      Over these past months we have experienced all kinds of conditions passing 
      through the mind - perhaps the whole spectrum, from anger and rage to 
      peace and serenity, from grief and despair to joy and happiness, from 
      desire and longing to contentment and equanimity. This is an aspect of the 
      mind's nature; it can go from one extreme to the other. It goes up and 
      down, goes round and round, turns from black to blue, to white, to red; it 
      can go all over the place. And in my experience, the benefit of being able 
      to have the space and time to practise and contemplate over a longer 
      period such as this, is just to see that much - that this is what the mind 
      does. And when we want to get in there and sort it all out, fix it all up, 
      and make it into what we think it should be, there's a lot of becoming 
      energy in that. There's a lot of desire, hatred, and delusion involved in 
      that kind of activity. </P>
      <P>Being able to see this clearly can lead to relinquishment and letting 
      go. This is the reflection that has come up for me most in this retreat, 
      and which has been the most consistently useful, this reflection around 
      relinquishment and renunciation. Even needing to relinquish the desire to 
      'fix it all up,' the very desire that carried me for so long in this 
      practice. I didn't realise that I was holding on to a very deep-seated 
      idea of perfection, an idea of 'the way it should be' or the way 'I' 
      should be (and along with that, the way 'it' or 'I' shouldn't be!). 
      There's a lot of judgement, views and hatred rooted in the mind; in 
      'not-wanting' things or an inability to open up to the painful or negative 
      experiences. In contemplating what relinquishment is really about we can 
      come to a place of peace and contentment with the mind just as it is. It's 
      basically about relinquishing ownership; seeing that these things are not 
      'mine' in the first place, not 'mine' to fix, not 'mine' to make into 
      something else. When we contemplate and see things in this way then things 
      settle down of their own accord; more clarity arises to actually see the 
      true nature of the conditions as they're passing through the mind. When 
      there's a lot of desire to 'fix things up', that very movement of desire, 
      hatred and views just keeps stirring up the water.
      <!-- end text 1ST table --></P>
      <!--  body text, third table; say, 2 to 4 paras -->
      <P>Much of monastic life is geared towards relinquishment; we practise on 
      many levels of body, speech and mind, giving-up, letting-go, renouncing. 
      But relinquishment has to happen in the mind by relinquishing ownership of 
      the conditions that are passing through. Not in an irresponsible way, but 
      actually finding a space within that's a little lighter and more spacious 
      around all the conditions we experience. So whatever arises can come, be 
      what it is, and pass through. This is the nature of all conditions - 
      'whatever arises is of the nature to cease.' It's such a simple truth and 
      yet so hard to see clearly in a mind that is infected with self-view; that 
      is still working on the delusion that 'this is me' and 'this is mine' and 
      grasping at whatever arises in consciousness, and creating all sorts of 
      issues and strategies. It all circles around the unquestioned sense of 
      self. 'Whose stuff is this anyway?' We just assume it to be 'me' and 
      'mine.' </P>
      <P>The mind is a weird and wonderful thing and having the space and tools 
      to investigate it can reveal quite a lot. There's a lot of becoming 
      energy; which if it's still based on self-view and ideals, is taking us 
      out of the moment, taking us out of the place where enlightenment is 
      actually possible. The suffering is here and now, the origin of suffering 
      is here and now, the cessation of suffering is here and now and the path 
      is here and now, they're nowhere else. </P>
      <P>We get caught up in a lot of picking and choosing, what the Buddha 
      calls 'favouring and opposing', based on feelings of pleasure and pain, 
      whether they be subtle or gross feelings. When there's contact at any of 
      the sense doors there's always a feeling associated with that, a feeling 
      of pleasure or pain. It's right at that point that craving arises, that 
      suffering arises. There's a claiming of whatever's passing through to be 
      'mine', then 'I want' or 'I don't want' arises, and then that 
      proliferates.
      <!-- end text third table --></P>
      <!-- start text 4th table (left col) Say, 2 paras. -->
      <P>If we're not awake to that process we get caught into the spin, caught 
      into the becoming energy which is taking us away from the possibility of 
      enlightenment here and now. If that process goes unquestioned we're 
      missing the opportunity to see the natural cessation of phenomena; we're 
      just getting caught up in the craving, clinging and becoming, into the 
      strategizing and proliferating. This happens over and over again. It's the 
      stuff of our practice, the field of our investigation where we can begin 
      to wake up. Contemplating Dependent Origination, the Four Noble Truths, 
      the three characteristics, these are the primary paradigms that can help 
      us to wake up and come back to the Dhamma of relinquishment. </P>
      <P>What does it take to relinquish clinging to a feeling, to relinquish 
      the desire for it to be other than the way it is? It takes a lot of coming 
      into presence; being willing to come into full presence with the way it 
      is. Just that much allows relinquishing to happen. Then, as you 
      contemplate the results of that shift on the body-mind, you see that it 
      brings about more of a sense of ease, contentment, and clarity. For some 
      of us some fear or uncertainty may arise right there, 'I can't be nothing, 
      I have to be something. I have to hold onto something!' </P>
      <P>In these moments, when there's agitation in the mind, we can see that 
      we're just blindly grasping at anything, anything that's stirred up and 
      running through the mind, grasping at it no matter how painful it is. 
      We're still claiming it to be 'me' and 'mine' because we want some kind of 
      support. So at those times one needs to be contemplating how suffering is 
      arising, where it is felt, and also where and how it ceases. It's always 
      here and now. It is here where suffering arises and where suffering 
      ceases. </P>
      <P>There's a famous teaching of the Buddha in which he talks of the 
      radiant mind, first describing a mind affected by defilement, and then a 
      mind free of defilement. He says, 'This mind is naturally radiant and 
      pure, it's only defiled by transitory defilements that come from without.' 
      The mind of an enlightened person is no longer stirred up by influences 
      that come from without. I find this a very important teaching because it 
      establishes a slightly different notion of the mind and defilements than 
      the one we tend to have. We tend to isolate the mind in a very personal 
      way, connecting it, if not to this body, at least to some sense of a 
      limited self - thinking that defilements are something we create. We 
      think, 'Through my ignorance I created them. It's my fault and I'm wrong 
      for having them.' So then we've got to do all this stuff to be free of 
      them.
      <!-- end text 4th table (left col) --></P>
      <!-- start text 5th table; remainder of text  -->
      <P>Yet the mind is originally pure you don't have to fix it. Ajahn Chah 
      says, 'It's already peaceful by itself, inherently peaceful, it only moves 
      and shakes when it's contacted by sense impressions.' Or, as the Buddha 
      described it, the mind shakes when defilements enter into the picture. And 
      we take those <I>sankharas</I> (conditioned formations) that are arising 
      in the mind to be self, to be 'me and my problem' or 'me and my stuff'.
      </P>
      <P>Ajahn Mun gave an analogy of this, 'This pure, radiant mind is like the 
      sun, and the defilements are like the clouds that come over and obscure 
      the sun'. It's just clouds floating over obscuring the sun; it's not that 
      the sun isn't there or it's not radiant and pure, or that it's not 
      shining, it's obscured by passing clouds. He also said, 'Don't go thinking 
      that the sun goes and grabs at the clouds, it's rather the clouds that 
      come and obscure the sun.' To me this is a really important difference in 
      the way of contemplating the mind and defilements. </P>
      <P>The mind gets caught up because we don't actually understand that all 
      conditions arise and pass away and are not self. If we could understand 
      just that much about everything that arose we'd be free. What arises, 
      ceases, and is not self. How can it be self if it can be discerned to 
      arise and cease? It's not that the stuff we deal with is not 'real' stuff 
      but it is conditioned, it comes into being through causes and then passes 
      away. </P>
      <P>Another delusion of self-view is when we have a wrong grasp of kamma - 
      'I must have caused this in the past' - taking the teaching on kamma and 
      thinking of it as a kind of kammic retribution, so taking it all very 
      personally. That's the nature of self-view, it takes these things very 
      personally. Yes, there are causes and effects, actions and results, but 
      can we see them as just that much without turning them into another cause 
      for self-view and suffering to take root. </P>
      <P>Coming back to this word 'relinquishment', in the teachings it often 
      comes after the experiences of detachment, disenchantment, dispassion and 
      cessation. Experiencing these things is a result of contemplating 
      impermanence, seeing and experiencing the impermanence of conditions with 
      insight - coming to understand conditions as not-self; not me; not 
      belonging to me. There are actually two Pali words relating to 
      relinquishment: <I>patinissagga</I> and <I>vossagga.</I> They both appear 
      in the <I>Anapanasati Sutta</I> and they're often both translated as 
      relinquishment. <I>Patinissagga </I>is a giving up, a renouncing, a full 
      letting go, abandonment. <I>Vossagga</I> comes at the very end of that 
      sutta and it is said to imply not only full abandoning and relinquishing 
      but also an entering into Nibbana; a complete letting go of all 
      attachments, and experiencing the peace and freedom of Nibbana. It seems 
      more complete. It is a lovely concept to contemplate because 
      relinquishment is actually about coming into a space of completion and of 
      peace, by letting go of the burden of self-view and resting into Nibbana. 
      Nibbana is described as liberation of mind through not clinging. The mind 
      is liberated by not clinging or holding on to anything. It realises the 
      fullness of its nature; it's a letting go of clinging to those clouds and 
      realising the fullness of its own radiance and purity. It doesn't have to 
      cling; it doesn't have to become anything. </P>
      <P>Naturally, when we're not fully awakened we have to work with the 
      habits of the mind. There might be moments of peace, recognition and 
      relinquishment but we tend to get pulled back into habitual ways and 
      states of mind. The practice is just continually waking up to the way 
      things are, continually remembering the truth of impermanence, seeing that 
      suffering arises when we claim things to be 'me' and 'mine.' The Buddha 
      said that we delight in feelings. Whether they're pleasant or painful 
      there's an element of delight there. It's actually the mind just 
      habitually wanting to engage, to get a sense of existing or having some 
      purpose, even though it might be painful. </P>
      <P>I see in myself a great desire to understand. This desire has a lot of 
      'becoming' energy in it - <I>bhavatanha</I> - because on an intellectual 
      level there's a real hit about 'Ah, now I understand! Now I've got it.' 
      But on an intellectual level it doesn't last long at all. True liberating 
      understanding has to be at the level of seeing the nature of the mind that 
      gets pulled this way and that, and of knowing what it is that pulls it and 
      relinquishing that. If we use the model of Ajahn Mun's, the mind doesn't 
      go out, rather conditions float through it. The <I>bhavatanha</I> is that 
      which, like a hand, grabs at the mental object, and then consciousness 
      becomes established there. That's why it feels so personal; we've just 
      been born into it and created conditions for future birth in the very same 
      place and conditions. </P>
      <P>After we have grabbed onto something what is relinquishment? At that 
      point we have to contemplate the Four Noble Truths - 'this is suffering' - 
      and become aware of the suffering of holding on, of consciousness becoming 
      established in a limited form. Be it pleasant or painful it's limited, 
      it's death-bound. Letting go is waking up to that, waking up to the fact 
      of anicca, dukkha, anatta. Seeing where it's happening is really 
      important; it seems to be the key. If we don't see craving that arises 
      upon feeling we can just be stuck in the holding. The metaphor for this is 
      of clinging onto a red-hot iron ball that's burning like hell, we can 
      complain all we like about it, but if we don't see where we're holding on 
      we won't be able to let go. Once you know where it's happening the 
      instinct operates to just drop it, to let go, because it's hot and it 
      hurts! </P>
      <P>Although that sounds very simple, the craving and clinging happening 
      around a painful or pleasant feeling arising upon sense contact is very 
      hard to see. The nature of delusion is that it clouds our vision and our 
      understanding. We get caught in habitual reactions and responses. We get 
      caught in views that block us from seeing what's happening. Remembering 
      images such as the radiant mind or the passing clouds is helpful. Also we 
      can remember Ajahn Chah's image of the mind being inherently peaceful, 
      that it only shakes when touched by sense impressions, just as leaves 
      shake when they're blown by the wind. It's the wind that blows the leaves; 
      it's not in the nature of the leaves. So, if we have no argument with 
      sense contact, with the mind experiencing things, then there'll be the 
      clarity to understand the nature of all this. </P>
      <P>Another familiar metaphor of Ajahn Chah's is that of the still forest 
      pool, which is a metaphor for the still mind where there's a degree of <I>
      samadhi.</I> Sitting by a still forest pool we can see many different 
      creatures coming to drink there, all sorts of weird and wonderful 
      creatures; this is likened to the stillness of the mind which can clearly 
      see all the different conditions that come. You don't have to get out 
      there and chase away the ones you don't like, or order them all according 
      to the way you want them to be, just see their nature and leave them be. 
      There are all sorts of different creatures, they come and go, they have 
      their own relationships with each other; just come to know that and be 
      aware of that. </P>
      <P>If we're harassed by particular neurotic tendencies that have obsessed 
      us for a long time, then we can get to know them as we would a particular 
      kind of creature that we're really interested in. We're out there hiding 
      behind a tree, really wanting to understand this peculiar, strange 
      creature we're watching. We watch it carefully, so we don't do anything 
      that's going to scare it away; we just watch its nature, watch its 
      behaviour and get to know it. It can take a lot to open up to stuff within 
      ourselves, to have that kind of attitude towards certain things that we've 
      had a lot of fear or judgement about. Can we check out our attitude 
      towards those things when they arise and say, 'Well, how can I understand 
      this? How does it arise? How does it pass away?' We might also find that 
      there are other things we need to meet before we can look at that, like 
      the fear or guilt about it. They're also creatures of there own. 'How does 
      that come into being? How is it maintained? How am I relating to it?' We 
      can just get very frightened of fear. It is very hard to be still with 
      fear and look at it, but we have to cultivate the attitude that allows it 
      to come out so we can see it for what it is. We trust in the stability of 
      awareness. </P>
      <P>The aim of this life devoted to Dhamma, is to practise virtue, to 
      cultivate this mind in a good way. So, it's okay to look at this more 
      ugly, difficult stuff that arises and trust in your own intentions to see 
      clearly in order to let go and be free of it. Trusting is another 
      essential aspect of the practice. Just remember to trust in your capacity 
      of awareness, which is really the root refuge in Buddha - the one who is 
      awake. Trust in your own capacity to be aware: awareness can always 
      embrace whatever's going on. </P>
      <P>Before I finish, another one of Ajahn Chah's pearls of wisdom comes to 
      mind. He said, 'When the mind is peaceful it is just like still flowing 
      water.' It's a bit of a conundrum. He said, 'Have you ever seen still 
      water? Have you ever seen flowing water? When the mind is peaceful it is 
      just like still flowing water.' Conditions are what flow through the mind. 
      The mind doesn't have to be moved by that flow but it can embrace and be 
      with it while not being pulled in. The stillness maintains its own 
      integrity. This is detachment, <I>viveka</I>, a quality of being in the 
      world yet not of the world, not drawn into worldliness. In that level of 
      detachment there is peace and yet there is flow. Relinquishment is not 
      cutting off from the world's conditions but realising their true nature 
      and the true nature of the radiant mind. The metaphor for this is that of 
      the bead of water that just rolls off the lotus leaf, it doesn't get 
      absorbed into the leaf. It's like the world and the enlightened mind, they 
      can be together but the enlightened mind, or that peace and stillness, is 
      not affected or distorted by the flow. There's a full knowing, a full 
      capacity for understanding, but not a joining to it. Not being swept 
      along, not joining to the realm of birth and death any more, that's the 
      quality of the awakened mind, of 'still flowing water'. </P>
      <P>So, relinquishment isn't about getting rid of anything, of getting rid 
      of one's old self and getting a better self, or of getting rid of the 
      nasty things. It's about relinquishing the tenacious grasping on to any 
      thing, whether good or bad. Relinquishing the 'I'- making, 'mine'- making, 
      'me'- making mechanism through seeing it as it truly is.
