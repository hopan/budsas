        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The following account represents the 
        second part of a two--part article that appeared in The Guardian 
        Magazine (Yangon, Myanmar) in the February 1963 issue (pp. 13--19), by 
        Daw Khin Myo Chit. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> 
      had done my first sitting with U Sasana as my meditation master. I had 
      promised him to do three sittings as a trial. When I went home from the 
      monastery after the first sitting I felt well and fresh in spite of the 
      trenuous nature of the sitting. However, that night I woke up shivering 
      with cold, my body feverish. Since my husband and my son were still at the 
      monastery I was all alone in the house.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I remembered what my master told me: 
      &quot;Whatever happens to your body or mind there is nothing for you to do but 
      to be mindful of them. You will need the strength to be mindful. To gain 
      that strength, breathe hard and be mindful of the touch of the air on the 
      nostril. When you have enough strength to tackle your bodily pains, be 
      mindful of them till they are no more.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Since I had no one to help me, I had to 
      find strength from within. I sat up and breathed as hard as I could 
      ignoring the feverish sensations. Even as I breathed fever subsided and I 
      began to perspire. In a few minute I fell into a restful sleep. In the 
      morning I felt well and fresh. There was not a hint of fever.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I went about doing the usual household 
      chores and went to the monastery. I reported to my meditation master what 
      happened last night and went on with my second sitting. There was not much 
      difference with the first. There always came a moment while breathing hard 
      when I felt I could not go on. With U Sasana’s encouraging words I rallied 
      my strength to go on only to find myself able to breathe on and enjoying 
      myself too. In this way I finished the three sittings I promised.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">My master just said: &quot;Now you know what it 
      is like. If you feel like doing the practice go on. If you feel otherwise, 
      do as you please.&quot; My husband and my son came home from the monastery. 
      After reorganizing our worldly life we felt we should continue the 
      practice.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With the blessing and consent of our 
      meditation masters we did try to practise at home and found out something 
      about ourselves. That something we discovered was not at all flattering -- 
      that is, we would not or could not do the practice properly without the 
      supervision of the meditation master.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After having done a few sittings under the 
      supervision of the meditation master we knew the standard of perfection to 
      be attained at each sitting. If we did well in the breathing session 
      observing the rules -- without changing position when cramped, without 
      pausing when fatigued, without letting any bodily sensation interfere with 
      the breathing -- we could tackle the unpleasant sensations that arose in 
      the second half of the sitting. Sad to say we always broke the rules. 
      Without any one to watch over us we cheated and never did well when we 
      practised mindfulness over the sensations. As a result of cheating we 
      failed to get the feeling of peace and well being after the sitting. After 
      overcoming a great disappointment in our own untrustworthiness we had to 
      face the unflattering truth about overselves and go to the monastery to 
      practise under the watchful eyes of the meditation master.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We went to the monastery once a week for 
      two sittings. A month or two later I began to have difficulty in 
      breathing. After a minute or two of hard breathing I was seized with a 
      severe contraction in the chest. Although I could overcome such a crisis 
      by rallying my strength to breathe harder, at other times I could not do 
      the same with this one. My meditation master told me to breathe harder but 
      things got worse. As I struggled hard to get over the crisis, my body 
      trembled and my neck swelled as if bursting.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I could not get over the crisis even 
      though my meditation master kept on telling me to strive more. I felt he 
      was asking me to do the impossible. As I struggled I seemed to have found 
      a way to get round if not to get over the crisis, to find some place of 
      shelter instead of bravely running through the blazing pathway.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Like an animal trapped in a burning forest 
      trying to find a place of shelter, instead of breaking through the blazing 
      pathway I found a way to shirk the painful sensations that rose in me 
      while breathing. As I was trapped in the throes of pain, I could not 
      breathe even softly. Disobeying the meditation master who reminded me to 
      breathe harder to get over the crisis, I found myself holding the breath 
      automatically.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As soon as I held my breath I experienced 
      a sensation of floating like a light feather in the pleasant wide open 
      space. The master’s voice reminding me to breathe hard seemed far away. I 
      fell into a trance during which I saw a huge pool of liquid whose colors 
      changed into hues of a rainbow as they swirled round. It was a wonderful 
      sight beautiful beyond description. All my pains were no more.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When I told my meditation master of my 
      experience he said that trances and visions were not to be encouraged, for 
      they were more of a hindrance than help in my task. They would not bring 
      me any nearer to the Truth I was seeking.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Somewhat discouraged I tried to obey the 
      master. Even though the spirit be strong, the flesh was weak. When faced 
      with the unbearable pains I would not or could not get over them; it was 
      especially difficult to obey the meditation master when I had found a way 
      to get round the pains and fall into a pool of ecstasy.</FONT></P>
      <I><B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">My First Retreat to the Monastery</FONT></P>
      </B></I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">My meditation master advised me to come to 
      the monastery for a week’s retreat, so that I could get over the crisis. I 
      was reluctant to do so. I put off as long as I could giving lame excuses. 
      One day something happened. Coming home from the monastery after our 
      weekly practice, I threw myself on a bed. That moment everything went 
      blank and my body seemed to be no more. Nothing seemed to be left of my 
      body except the heart beat. Even the heart seemed to be no more, only the 
      throb was there. Without the burden of the body the heart throb was pure 
      ecstasy … nothing like I had ever experienced before.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When I was jerked back to the every--day 
      world by someone calling me to dinner I felt sorry for the loss. Since 
      that time I kept thinking of the ecstasy that I had gained and I wondered 
      if I could make it last as long as I wished. Perhaps if I went to the 
      monastery for a week’s retreat I might be able to do it?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So I decided to go to the monastery for a 
      week’s retreat. During the time I had to practise four times a day.</FONT></P>
      <I><B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Is This the Truth I Seek?</FONT></P>
      </B></I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On the third day of my retreat I had an 
      extraordinary experience. As I began my practice at seven o’clock in the 
      morning, breathing had become easier. I was no longer hampered by any 
      critical pains. When the time came for the practice of mindfulness of 
      bodily sensations I had no pains at all. Only the pit--a--pat of the heart 
      remained. My mind withdrawn from pleasures of the flesh was clear of 
      passions, worries, anxieties and all the perilous stuff that weighed the 
      heart. My mind became a virgin pool, clear and serene. Various shapes of 
      iridescent colors danced beautifully on the mirror--like surface 
      annihilating all that is made of flesh and senses into calm tranquility. I 
      realized then how vain were the pleasures of the flesh when compared with 
      this. Sensual pleasures cloy but then this joy increased every moment of 
      enjoyment. This sweet rest, peace and tranquility, I thought, might be the 
      Truth I was seeking?</FONT></P>
      <I><B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I Found the Answer</FONT></P>
      </B></I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I began the next session with eagerness 
      expecting to get the same experience. I breathed as hard as I could. But 
      after a few moments I was caught up by a severe contraction in the chest. 
      My throat became parched and dry. Suddenly a death rattle rose up and down 
      my throat. My body shook and trembled and my heart seemed to be a lump of 
      lead. Everything seemed to have gone dead except the death rattle in my 
      throat. I had no breath left in me. When I tried to open my eyes a great 
      shroud of darkness had fallen over me. I could not open my mouth to cry. I 
      felt suffocated as if I was enveloped in the smokes of hell. A deep 
      feeling of frustration came over me. I felt let down by all that I had put 
      my trust in. That virgin pool of ecstasy, where I used to take refuge, was 
      no more. It had gone to nothing in the face of the overpowering death 
      throes.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now I realized that I must be mindful of 
      the sensations of body as they came whether pleasant or painful, for it 
      was the only way to end suffering; it would not do for me to stray from 
      the path. Like the animal in the burning forest I must break through the 
      blazing path however fearsome it might be.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">During the next session I doubled my 
      efforts in breathing, getting over the crisis in the only way the 
      meditation master taught me -- by being mindful and striving harder. When 
      the time came for the practice of mindfulness of the sensations of the 
      body, my whole body seemed to be turned into a lump of lead. All my limbs 
      had gone numb and deadened.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">That moment I had strengthened the force 
      of mindfulness so that I was aware of the action of my beating heart as it 
      was. Soon there came a sensation of heaviness. The benumbed body grew 
      heavy; but then this heaviness though it was terrifying was only a 
      sensation. Because I could look upon the heart--beat without the clinging 
      desire to wallow in its ecstasy, I could be aware of the sensation of 
      mountainous heaviness without fear.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then I reached a state wherein only two 
      things remained of the being whom I called myself; namely, sensations and 
      being aware of them, or being mindful of them. The power of mindfulness 
      caught hold of the sensations in its grip so much so that the two forces 
      hugged like two steel plates screwed together. I did not know how long I 
      stayed like that. Suddenly the strength of mindfulness became so 
      overpowering that it looked as if it would press down the sensations till 
      they were completely rubbed out.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">That moment I stayed like one on the 
      threshold of Freedom tasting the first breath of the Great Joy that was to 
      be. Just one step more and I would be free of all that was evil. Like a 
      bird trying her wings for a long flight, I stood on the edge of Freedom. 
      Waves of joy came over me.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The next moment, even before I knew what 
      was happening, everything went black and I fell into depths of despair. I 
      could not go on with the sitting. I threw myself down and wept as if my 
      heart would break. My meditation master said a few comforting words and 
      advised me to sleep on it. At that time U Sasana was away from the 
      monastery so it was my other friend U Vinaya, who helped me over with the 
      crisis. That night I was in great sorrow for something that I did not 
      know. It was as if my mind had been unhinged for the time.</FONT></P>
      <I><B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Two Great Forces at Work</FONT></P>
      </B></I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The next morning I woke up refreshed in 
      spite of the nightmare--like experience I had gone through the previous 
      night. But that day was a dream--like experience, for I went through the 
      routing of sittings like clock--work.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I had no difficulty in breathing. While I 
      breathed smoothly, a vaporous mist enveloped me and a vision of myself as 
      a tiny particle floating in an ethereal mist appeared and I watched 
      fascinated. When I became conscious of the pit--a--pat of my heart, each 
      heart--throb and the other that followed seemed to be in great conflict, 
      as two great forces were coming against each other.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Of the two forces one was the desire to 
      wallow in the cool serenity of the ecstasy instead of being mindful of the 
      sensations of the body; the other force was the realization that the pool 
      of ecstasy however pleasant was not the Goal I was seeking; more than that 
      the pool of ecstasy was not a safe place and I would be helpless when the 
      pains of death overtook me.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Though realizing the necessity to leave 
      the pool of ecstasy and face the unpleasant sensations with mindfulness, 
      the desire to wallow in the pool of ecstasy was strong. The two forces 
      were at tug--of--war within me. This conflict went on for the remaining 
      four days of my retreat. When the time came for me to go home I was 
      steadfastly determined to walk the Path my meditation masters had laid 
      down for me.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Only back at home I had time to 
      contemplate over my experiences during the week’s retreat and get 
      everything into focus. I realized it was not an easy task to tame the 
      mind. The crises which often threatened to interfere with the hard 
      breathing session were the result of the mind straining itself to wander 
      away from the point of the touch. When with great effort I succeeded in 
      keeping the mind on the sensations of the body, only two things remained 
      of my body, they were the sensations and being aware of them. This was an 
      important step; for with that realization I stood on the brink of freedom.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But why was I thrown back into depths of 
      despair the next moment? Only when I looked back I realized that I had 
      instinctively turned back. The reason was quite simple: I did not want to 
      be free from what is Suffering; for the end of suffering meant the end of 
      life. Life and suffering cannot be separated; if one wished to end 
      suffering life must be ended too -- that is, the unending cycle of 
      rebirths must be ended. Even though one could accept that life meant 
      suffering one could not accept the corollary that to end suffering, life 
      must be ended. I realized that my clinging desire to life had made me turn 
      back from the bound of freedom. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I realized that to end suffering I must 
      end the craving for life. Only if one stopped craving one could end 
      suffering. I knew I must follow my meditation master’s instruction that I 
      must be mindful of the unpleasant sensations of the body, its aches, 
      pains, and agonies. Once again I saw that the road to Deliverance lay not 
      in wallowing in the pool of ecstasy but in breaking through the blazing 
      pathway of painful sensations. If I wanted to be free, I must be brave. 
      This Path -- the practice of mindfulness -- I was convinced, was the Path 
      I must travel.</FONT></P>
      <I><B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On the Path</FONT></P>
      </B></I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With the steadfast conviction that the 
      practice of mindfulness would surely lead to Deliverance from Suffering, I 
      went on with the practice. I went to the monastery once a week and there I 
      sought the advice and guidance of my meditation masters.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Try as hard as I could, I kept on falling 
      into the pool of ecstasy. The only comfort was that my mindfulness would 
      not allow me to stay there long. I could practise mindfulness of the 
      unpleasant sensations for a longer duration.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As I went on with my practice, in one of 
      my sittings I found my mind firmly fixed on the bodily sensations. I tried 
      to be mindful of the pains only, taking great care not to let my mind 
      wander. Somehow or the other I found my mind had strayed. I was greatly 
      exasperated, for I had been doing my best to be mindful. Still the mind 
      strayed.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I understood then how important it was to 
      keep my mind on the bodily sensations, strictly on the single point 
      without the slightest deviation. It was like balancing a grain on the tip 
      of a pin. The situation was so delicate that the slightest flutter of &quot;oh&quot; 
      or &quot;ah&quot; would upset it.</FONT></P>
      <I><B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Threatening Crash</FONT></P>
      </B></I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Apart from the weekly visits to the 
      monastery I tried to practise at home. Even though I might not do as well 
      as I did under supervision, it at least gave continuity. Living the life 
      of a householder, being full of cares, I found a refuge in the practice 
      even if I could but spare a few minutes out of the twenty--four hours of 
      the day.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One day while I was practicing at home I 
      felt my body was dashing away at a terrific speed towards something but I 
      did not know what. Like a run--away car crashing against a rocky hill I 
      thought I would be smashed to pieces. A great fear seized me and I jerked 
      myself away from that sensation. Once I was free from the clutches of the 
      terrible sensation I realized I had missed a great experience. I knew I 
      should have faced that terrible sensation without fear. With mindfulness 
      as my only stay, I should abandon myself to whatever happened.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I told U Vinaya about the threatening 
      crash, and he said, &quot;Remember, in seeking Truth or Deliverance, you must 
      be prepared to lay down your life. It is not easy to abandon yourself to 
      the unknown. You are treading the Path the Buddha and His Disciples trod 
      before you. You need courage to follow the Path. Without anyone telling 
      you, you now know that you lack courage. You must practise mindfulness 
      more rigorously until you are ready to receive the gift of truth the 
      Buddha had taught and thereby win Deliverance.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I knew I was very near achieving my goal 
      but two things always came between me and my attainment. One was the 
      nameless fear I had described and the other was the joy of expectancy. 
      Knowing I was near my goal I could not restrain my joy of expectancy. One 
      slight &quot;Oh&quot; or &quot;Ah,&quot; then all was gone. When I succeeded in restraining 
      the joyful feeling I could not overcome that nameless fear. It was always 
      one or the other that came at the crucial moment.</FONT></P>
      <I><B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">An Unforgettable Experience</FONT></P>
      </B></I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I knew then that this craving for self had 
      made me afraid of breaking through the bounds of pain and suffering. When 
      I asked my meditation master how I could overcome this nameless fear, that 
      rose from clinging to my self, he told me to be more zealous in my 
      practice of mindfulness. This practice of mindfulness is something one can 
      never overdo and however much one might try it is always a little short of 
      perfection.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One day, I went to a lecture by Martha 
      Graham, who was at that time on a visit to Burma. I listened to the famous 
      dancer’s lecture with great interest. I tried to be mindful of the touch 
      of my body on the chair I sat [on] even when I listened.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In course of her lecture Martha Graham 
      mentioned a famous ballet dancer who did spectacular leaps. She told us 
      how that dancer (I have forgotten the name) practiced the leaps for 
      hundreds of times (she did mention the number of times) for a great show, 
      but he could not attain perfection. Even at the dress rehearsal he had not 
      attained the required standard. [It was] only when the actual show took 
      place that the dancer did his several hundredth leap and then and there he 
      attained perfection. Martha Graham commented that it was the hundreds of 
      leaps he had practiced and missed that culminated in the final perfection 
      on the stage.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I could leap with joy to hear that. All 
      the times I had missed because I slunk away in fear or because my mind 
      strayed away to joyous expectation all these were not in vain. One day 
      these forces would be mobilized so that the moment of perfection would be 
      won.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One night I lay in a restful trance 
      practicing mindfulness of the bodily sensations. At first the sensations 
      were not unpleasant as my body was throbbing softly. Later my whole body 
      began to vibrate as if an electric shock was running through me. I no 
      longer could be restful. I had to rally all my strength to be mindful of 
      the sensations. The vibrations grew more and more violent. I went on being 
      mindful unswervingly. My mindfulness was strong but the violence of the 
      sensations seemed to match and challenge it. Mindfulness and sensations 
      met in a death struggle in which fear caused by the thought, &quot;What shall 
      become of me?&quot; had no place. When two things, namely the sensation and 
      mindfulness existed, there was no place for I. The illusion of I was 
      broken. As the sensations increased in violence, the power of mindfulness 
      matched its fearful intensity. I did not know how long this went on. Then 
      suddenly like nerves bursting under a great strain there was a big 
      explosion. The next thing I knew I was sitting cross--legs, my whole body 
      wide open like the boundless sky, with nothing to hang on, nothing to
