    <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">O</font>n first encounter
    Buddhism confronts us as a paradox. Intellectually, it appears a freethinker's delight:
    sober, realistic, undogmatic, almost scientific in its outlook and method. But if we come
    into contact with the living Dhamma from within, we soon discover that it has another side
    which seems the antithesis of all our rationalistic presuppositions. We still don't meet
    rigid creeds or random speculation, but we do come upon religious ideals of renunciation,
    contemplation and devotion; a body of doctrines dealing with matters transcending sense
    perception and thought; and -- perhaps most disconcerting -- a program of training in
    which faith figures as a cardinal virtue, doubt as a hindrance, barrier and fetter. </font><p><font
    face="Times New Roman">When we try to determine our own relationship with the Dhamma,
    eventually we find ourselves challenged to make sense out of its two seemingly
    irreconcilable faces: the empiricist face turned to the world, telling us to investigate
    and verify things for ourselves, and the religious face turned to the Beyond, advising us
    to dispel our doubts and place trust in the Teacher and his Teaching. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One way we can resolve this dilemma is by accepting only
    one face of the Dhamma as authentic and rejecting the other as spurious or superfluous.
    Thus, with traditional Buddhist pietism, we can embrace the religious side of faith and
    devotion, but shy off from the hard-headed world-view and the task of critical inquiry;
    or, with modern Buddhist apologetics, we can extol the Dhamma's empiricism and resemblance
    to science, but stumble embarrassingly over the religious side. Yet reflection on what a
    genuine Buddhist spirituality truly requires, makes it clear that both faces of the Dhamma
    are equally authentic and that both must be taken into account. If we fail to do so, not
    only do we risk adopting a lopsided view of the teaching, but our own involvement with the
    Dhamma is likely to be hampered by partiality and conflicting attitudes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The problem remains, however, of bringing together the two
    faces of the Dhamma without sidling into self-contradiction. The key, we suggest, to
    achieving this reconciliation, and thus to securing the internal consistency of our own
    perspective and practice, lies in considering two fundamental points: first, the guiding <strong><i>purpose</i></strong>
    of the Dhamma; and second, the <strong><i>strategy</i></strong> it employs to achieve that
    purpose. The <strong><i>purpose</i></strong> is the attainment of deliverance from
    suffering. The Dhamma does not aim at providing us with factual information about the
    world, and thus, despite a compatibility with science, its goals and concerns are
    necessarily different from those of the latter. Primarily and essentially, the Dhamma is a
    path to spiritual emancipation, to liberation from the round of repeated birth, death and
    suffering. Offered to us as the irreplaceable means of deliverance, the Dhamma does not
    seek mere intellectual assent, but commands a response that is bound to be fully
    religious. It addresses us at the bedrock of our being, and there it awakens the faith,
    devotion and commitment appropriate when the final goal of our existence is at stake. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But for Buddhism faith and devotion are only spurs which
    impel us to enter and persevere along the path; by themselves they cannot ensure
    deliverance. The primary cause of bondage and suffering, the Buddha teaches, is ignorance
    regarding the true nature of existence; hence in the Buddhist <strong><i>strategy</i></strong>
    of liberation the primary instrument must be wisdom, the knowledge and vision of things as
    they really are. Investigation and critical inquiry, cool and uncommitted, constitute the
    first step towards wisdom, enabling us to resolve our doubts and gain a conceptual grasp
    of the truths upon which our deliverance depends. But doubt and questioning cannot
    continue indefinitely. Once we have decided that the Dhamma is to be our vehicle to
    spiritual freedom, we have to step on board: we must leave our hesitancy behind and enter
    the course of training which will lead us from faith to liberating vision. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For those who approach the Dhamma in quest of intellectual
    or emotional gratification, inevitably it will show two faces, and one will always remain
    a puzzle. But if we are prepared to approach the Dhamma on its own terms, as the way to
    release from suffering, there will not be two faces at all. Instead we will see what was
    there from the start: the single face of Dhamma which, like any other face, presents two
    complementary sides./.</font></p>
