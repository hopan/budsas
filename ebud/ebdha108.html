  <hr width="25%">
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Freedom of choice</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although Buddhism is Thailand's state religion, freedom to
  practice the religion of one's choice is guaranteed by the constitution, and all Thai
  citizens equally enjoy this right and prerogative. This freedom is, in fact, rooted in the
  spirit of tolerance, which is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the Buddha's
  teachings. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the 1990 Thai census there were 53,403,919
  Buddhists in Thailand. In addition, there were 2,252,427 Moslems, 299,069 Christians,
  3,606 Hindus and Sikhs, and 65,728 who profess other religions or no religion. The same
  census also reveals that there are 29,002 monasteries in the Kingdom, 225 of which are
  royal monasteries. There are 2,687 mosques, 854 Protestant churches, 331 Catholic
  churches, 33 Hindu and Sikh temples. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists are generally tolerant and accommodating, which
  is why religious persecution at Buddhist hands is unheard of in the long history of the
  religion. This has emboldened people of other religions to take advantage of Buddhist
  hospitality and tolerance by engaging in activities that are detrimental to Buddhism. We
  learn from history that with the Hindu overthrow of the Mauryan dynasty, around the early
  part of the 2nd century BC, the Hindus embarked on a massive and systematic persecution of
  the Buddhists, which resulted in a rapid decline of the religion in ancient India. A
  thousand years later they tried to wipe off whatever was left of Buddhism in the country
  by systematically distorting the Buddhist teachings and making Buddhism a subbranch of
  Hinduism. With the Moslem invasion of Sind in 710 AD, and especially when they gained more
  control over India in the 11th and 12th centuries, Buddhism suffered a great loss at the
  hands of Moslem fanatics. Buddhist monks were killed by the thousands, people were forced
  en masse to embrace Islam, and Buddhist monasteries were destroyed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In contemporary Thailand, some Christian missionaries are
  engaged in dubious activities that are detrimental to the stability of Buddhism. They
  teach, for example, that the Buddha was a messenger of God, whose duty it was to prepare
  people in Asia for Christianity. The Buddha's enlightenment, some Christian priests claim,
  was God's revelation. Christian educators also make systematic efforts to reinterpret or
  distort the Buddha's teachings to confuse Buddhists. They have no qualms about claiming
  the origin of the most fundamental Buddhist doctrines, such as the Four Noble Truths, the
  Noble Eightfold Path, and Dependent Origination, as their own, tracing them to imaginary
  sources in the Bible. These and many other incidents are part of an on-going scheme to win
  converts to Christianity. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080"><strong>Factors for the solidarity
  of Buddhism in Thailand</strong></font> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The appeal of the Dhamma to the Thai mentality and the
  ability of the religion to accommodate and transform the local culture are the most
  important factors underlying the Thai acceptance of Buddhism. The religion also contains
  within its traditions and teachings some positive characteristics that attract both
  ordinary laymen and intellectuals. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the earliest introduction of the religion, the Thais
  have been most liberal in their support of the Buddhist institution. Royal patronage, in
  particular, has always been a significant factor contributing to the stability and
  progress of the religion in Thailand. Following Khun Luang Mao, who was the first Thai
  ruler to declare himself a Buddhist, all subsequent Thai kings and rulers, without
  exception, were great supporters of the religion and did much to promote its advancement.
  Some of them, like King Lithai of Sukhothai and King Borom Trailokanath of the early
  Ayutthaya period, even entered the Order and trained for a time as monks. This set a
  precedent for a national custom: ever since then it has been a general practice for Thai
  men to leave home and enter the monkhood to receive monastic training for a certain period
  of time, at least once in their lives. Prior to his coronation as King of Thailand, King
  Mongkut of the Chakri dynasty in the more recent Bangkok period spent 27 years in the
  robes and became one of the most esteemed authorities on Buddhism and its practices. The
  present King and the Crown Prince also entered the monkhood for short periods. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To say that Buddhism and its practices are suitable to the
  Thai people is an understatement. The word 'Thai' means freedom, and this is the spirit
  that is most cherished by the Thai people. No other religion answers so well to that
  spirit as Buddhism, and this explains why the Thais feel completely at home with the
  religion. Also, as mentioned above, the Buddhist ecumenical outlook and philosophy seem to
  leave enough room for the accommodation and subsequent transformation of indigenous
  beliefs and practices, so that the religion not only became readily accepted by the local
  inhabitants, but was able in the process to bring about harmonious development in social
  values and traditions in the country as a whole. Thus, the royal patronage accorded to the
  Buddhist institution may be viewed on one hand as an expression of the King's religious
  devotion and personal preference, but on the other it may also be interpreted as a solid
  representation of the people's will and religious faith. Whatever the King does, the
  common people feel inclined to follow; while the King is anxious to fulfill the wants and
  wishes of the common people. In this way the King's actions can be said to reflect his
  people's aspirations. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism has become so integrated with Thai life that the
  two are hardly separable. Buddhist influences can be detected in Thai life-style,
  mannerisms, traditions, character, arts, architecture, language, and all other aspects of
  the Thai culture. The fact that Thailand has become widely known today as the Land of
  Smiles is due in no small measure to the Buddhist influence on the Thai people. Indeed,
  the nation as a whole owes much to the religion and wholeheartedly acknowledges her
  indebtedness to the Buddha's teachings. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Traditionally, Thai kings and their subjects have
  supported Buddhism in many different ways. They provide the four requisites of robes,
  food, shelter, and medicine to monks and novices, who are generally regarded by lay
  Buddhists as the principal guardians of the religion, and look after their other material
  needs. They also contribute to the construction and maintenance of monasteries and
  patronize monastic educational activities. Nowadays the King, as the supreme patron of the
  religion, appoints the Supreme Patriarch to head the Council of Elders, which is the
  governing body of the Sangha in charge of religious affairs in the country. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080"><strong>Different interpretations of
  the Teaching</strong></font> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Differences in doctrinal interpretation and modes of
  practice are a common phenomenon in every major religion, including Buddhism. It is
  natural that living faiths will be subject to investigation and reinterpretation, which in
  some cases lead to differences in opinions and views. If these find sufficient support and
  following, the result is often the formation of a new school of thought within that
  particular religion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is an old religion. Through the course of its
  long and complicated history many different schools or sects have come into existence,
  each offering seemingly different views and interpretations on the Buddha's teachings. New
  modes of training have also been introduced, each claimed to have enriched the original
  system and made the practices more accessible and meaningful. Some schools have continued
  to grow, while others were little more than passing phenomena. We may regard this as a
  natural manifestation of events, especially since Buddhism is very much a living religion,
  dynamic and open. However, never has Buddhism lost its essential character, which is
  common throughout all its sects and denominations. Most of the apparent differences find a
  point of unity on a higher level of understanding, and Buddhists have no difficulty in
  perceiving its real message amidst the many later ramifications and developments. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhamma is one, it is often stressed, but different
  teachers may give more emphasis to certain aspects of the Dhamma, depending on their
  predisposition or training. Just as the ocean has but one taste, so does the Dhamma have
  but one flavor, the flavor of freedom. It is possible, however, that different seekers of
  truth may find it more convenient to approach the Dhamma through different ways. Thus
  there may be more than one way to explain certain doctrinal points. At times the various
  approaches may give rise to confusion and uncertainty, but this state of affairs will come
  to an end when the Dhamma is realized on the experiential level. Just as there may be
  different ways to arrive at the same destination, so there may be different paths to
  arrive at the same truth. Once the goal has been reached, it becomes pointless to argue
  about methods. The best approach to solving doubt and problems is to practice and
  experience the Dhamma for oneself. When the Dhamma is realized, all doubts will dissolve. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha himself might have envisaged this issue. In the
  discourse called <em>Mahapadesa</em> he gave a broad criterion on which to judge if a
  teaching is the true Dhamma. This discourse can be used as a gauge to verify the
  authenticity of a teaching, and we may apply it to the instruction and practice as found
  in many Buddhist centers around the world. According to the <em>Mahapadesa</em>, if a
  teaching is claimed to be the word of either the Buddha, the Sangha, a group of learned
  monks, or a single elder (<em>thera</em>), such teachings should neither be welcomed nor
  rejected without due consideration. The teaching should be compared to the doctrine and
  the discipline (Dhamma-Vinaya) to see if they perfectly agree with one another. &quot;If,
  after thoroughly comparing them with the Discourses and the Discipline, the words and
  meaning fit not with the Discourses and agree not with the Discipline, then you may
  rightly conclude: Certainly, not from the Blessed One is the teaching, and it has been
  wrongly comprehended by that monk (who makes the claim). Then you should reject it. If,
  however ... they fit with the Discourses and agree with the Discipline, then you may
  rightly conclude: Certainly, from the Blessed One is the teaching, and it has been rightly
  comprehended.&quot; This means that we should take the Dhamma-Vinaya as the ultimate
  criterion for judgment of matters concerning differences in the teachings. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a discourse given to Venerable Upali, the Buddha
  similarly delineated a criterion to verify the true doctrine and discipline. According to
  that criterion, the true Dhamma is that which, when practiced, leads to disenchantment,
  detachment, the extinction of dukkha, calm and peace, direct discernment and knowledge of
  the truth, enlightenment, and <em>Nibbana</em>. Thus it can be concluded that the true
  Dhamma, no matter what label we give to it, is that which is conducive to the development
  of wisdom and understanding, and leads the practitioner to peace and happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Thailand some monastic establishments give more
  importance to scriptural study, some to meditation practice. Among those monasteries that
  function chiefly as educational centers, some are known to specialize in Abhidhamma
  studies, others may concentrate mainly on providing traditional ecclesiastical courses of
  Dhamma and Pali studies. There are also those that cater to contemporary needs with a
  balanced system of education that combines Dhamma studies with appropriate secular
  subjects to equip monks with necessary tools for future Dhamma work. Currently, there are
  two Buddhist universities in Bangkok, Mahachulalongkorn and Mahamakut, with their many
  affiliated colleges and schools throughout the Kingdom. There are also monasteries that
  may be considered 'unconventional,' like Buddhadasa's Suanmokkha and Ajahn Cha's Wat
  Nongpapong, which strive to give training within the context of a living condition
  believed to closely resemble that during the Buddha's time. Even those centers that are
  known for their emphasis on meditation provide a wide variety of different techniques of
  training. Some advocate concentration as the primary objective; others emphasize insight
  meditation as the most important way. There are also centers that offer training in both
  concentration and insight meditation. If we understand the basic unity of all these
  establishments and know what to choose, there should be no confusion or perplexity. The
  vast array of choices may be viewed as an advantage, considering the different levels of
  spiritual maturity and development of those who are interested in Buddhist learning and
  practice. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080"><strong>Buddhism and social problems</strong></font>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although social problems can be linked to religion, it
  would be naive to attribute them directly to religion. Essentially, it is the lack of true
  religion in the heart of people that is the root of all problems. Sometimes we take
  extraneous components of a religious institution, such as religious statues, buildings,
  and even traditional practices, rites and ceremonies, to represent religion and forget to
  really live the religious teachings. As a result, religion is rarely allowed to play its
  proper role in our personal and social lives. This leads to many problems, one of the most
  unfortunate of which is the fact that we hardly realize how much we lack true religion.
  The vicious circle seems to blind us and problems in society continue to multiply. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To be fair, problems like violence, fraud, corruption, and
  prostitution are not peculiar to any one particular society or nation. They are widespread
  social phenomena prevalent in all parts of the world, not excepting the most affluent or
  highly developed nations. Social problems may arise from a variety of causes and
  conditions for which religion can hardly be held responsible. For example, hunger and lack
  of suitable means for a decent livelihood may drive a basically harmless individual to an
  act of crime or violence. The long-term centralization of political and economic powers
  due to greed and megalomania may cause corruption and poverty on a large scale in the
  country. In fact, there are many non-Buddhist countries in the world today that are
  plagued with social problems of all descriptions and have not known peace for a long time.
  Sometimes the problems are directly related to their own religious fanaticism, which is a
  truly unfortunate situation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thai society owes a great deal to Buddhism for many of the
  blessings that it enjoys. There is no doubt that if more people earnestly practiced the
  Dhamma, many of the problems Thailand now faces could be satisfactorily solved or
  ameliorated. For example, if people really observed the five precepts, there would be
  little room left for violence, fraud, and corruption. Even if only one precept of the five
  was adhered to, it would surely contribute tremendously to society. Indeed, it is not
  Buddhism that is a problem to society, but not following it in the proper way. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is a religion of practice. This means that in
  order to derive benefit from the religion one needs to exert oneself and put it into
  practice. To call oneself a Buddhist without trying seriously to follow Buddhism will not
  mean much in terms of practical results. Although Thailand is a Buddhist country and the
  majority of the population professes Buddhism, that is hardly half the story. There still
  remains the need to practice the Dhamma, and if this is done by a sufficiently large
  number of people peace and prosperity will certainly result, and there will be less
  problems in society. Buddhism is a time-honored religious system; its teachings have stood
  the test of time for more than twenty-five centuries. The Dhamma is universally true and
  eternally valid. All that is needed is a sincere and earnest commitment to it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080"><strong>The challenge of
  modernization</strong></font> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through its long history Buddhism has been exposed to
  various cultural forces and traditions in different lands. The religion has demonstrated
  its excellent resilience throughout and has survived the most trying developments in human
  history. The scientific and logical appeal of the Buddhist teachings have consistently won
  new adherents and admirers in whichever lands the religion found its home. With the rapid
  increase of modern communications, creating an ever-shrinking world, Buddhism, which
  originated in the East, finds itself locked in contact with contemporary Western culture.
  Interestingly, new developments are taking shape. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unlike her neighbors, which had been colonized by Western
  powers at one time or another, Thailand has always maintained relatively cordial
  relationships with the West. When the first 'farangs' (Caucasians) called at a Thai port,
  they were welcomed with open arms by the locals and were treated with great hospitality
  and friendship. Thai kings and royalty even donated large pieces of land and allowances to
  Christian missionaries and generously supported them in their activities. Christian
  churches, schools, and hospitals were built. Western culture and customs were introduced.
  As Thai people have always maintained a friendly attitude toward foreigners, Western
  influence continues to spread throughout the country, unchecked and unhindered, under the
  most favorable circumstances possible. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, the West is at clear advantage in many
  respects. Modern technology impresses the Thais and the Western system of education has
  been adopted in lieu of the traditional one. People with a Western education have been
  regarded as a progressive class, while their counterparts were branded old fashioned and
  conservative. Gradually, more and more Thai intellectuals began to identify themselves
  with Western thought and values; unconsciously, they isolated themselves from traditional
  Thai society. In an effort to modernize the country in line with the 'more civilized'
  nations, Western prototypes of development were blindly followed -- sometimes with
  devastating effects. Modernization came to be identified with Westernization and
  traditional Thai values came to be regarded, mostly by the so-called Western educated
  class, as incongruous and anachronistic in the modern Thai context. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The impact of Western influence on modern Thai society is
  too obvious to require any detailed examination. One may say that almost every aspect of
  Thai life has been touched by it -- from the structure and form of government to the
  system of education, the economic system, commercialism and consumerism, to the arts and
  entertainments (where the impact is the strongest, especially among the Thai youth).
  Amidst these developments, Thai Buddhism is faced with a new challenge. From the
  perspective of religion, the impact of Christian missionary efforts in the country has
  been less than impressive. Despite the missionaries' best tactics and the enormous amount
  of money pumped into the country to support their activities, Christianity has won, until
  recently, only a marginal number of Thai converts. However, because Western culture is
  closely connected with Christianity and vice versa, what it lacks in philosophical value
  it amply makes up with cultural appeal and influence. This is all the more difficult for
  Thai Buddhists to deal with. Christianity spreads covertly in the garb of modernization
  and Western culture, and Thai Buddhists are caught unaware in the unremitting currents of
  these new developments. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For many Thais, Buddhism is closely associated with
  traditional values and cultural activities. But the cultural scene itself is fast changing
  in urban Thai society. Under the Westernized system of education, a large part of the Thai
  population has been alienated from Buddhism and traditional Thai culture. Gradually, Thai
  Buddhism finds itself more and more restricted in its role as a social and religious
  force. The intellectual leadership long enjoyed by the Thai Sangha has become much less
  distinct in the present, thanks in part to the misdirected process of modernization and in
  part to the inability of the Sangha to cope with the new developments sweeping through the
  country. Thus, the role of many Sangha members nowadays is more or less confined to little
  more than the performance of rites and ceremonies, although there are quite a few
  progressive monks who struggle hard to participate more meaningfully in social welfare
  programs and environmental issues. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So far Thailand's modernization efforts seem to have been
  concentrated mostly in the cities, and it is the urban populace who have shared most of
  the benefits from those programs. In rural areas, monks still hold social leadership among
  the underprivileged, with whom they maintain a comparatively close relation and
  cooperation. Village monasteries fulfill people's social needs and monks still fill their
  traditional roles of helping the villagers in their spiritual and temporal concerns. The
  monkhood is still greatly respected and provides a much needed opportunity for the poor to
  acquire a higher level of education, something not always accessible otherwise. Monks in
  forest meditation centers play a key role in preserving fast diminishing Thai forest
  reserves and wild life. They hold great potential to contribute to society. Thus, Western
  influence in Thailand may be drastically different in urban and rural areas, especially
  where Buddhism is concerned. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Fortunately, the encounter of Thai Buddhism with the West
  has also produced some very positive results. Many Westerners who visited the country have
  found in the Buddha's teachings an answer to their spiritual quest and have made Buddhism
  their adopted religion. Quite a few have even taken to the robes and spent the rest of
  their lives in monastic training. Although these cases are mainly personal spiritual
  pursuits, they do have an indirect influence on the Thai religious scene as a whole. These
  Thai trained Western monks have also played a crucial role in the growth of Buddhism in
  the West in recent years. Inspired by their commitment and exemplary conduct, many Thai
  Buddhists have begun to reexamine their religious and cultural identity. They become more
  serious in Buddhist studies and practice, hitherto somewhat neglected, and have grown more
  appreciative of Buddhist values and culture. Ironically, it is through Westerners that
  some Thais begin to appreciate their own spiritual heritage. Although the scope of their
  influence in Thailand is still limited, this development is nonetheless worth mentioning. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To say that Western influence in Thailand represents a
  challenge or threat to Buddhism may be an overstatement, yet its impact must be
  recognized. Whether the religion will continue to prosper, or how long it will survive the
  onslaught, will depend on how well Buddhists respond to the calls of their conscience and
  responsibility. As the Buddha himself stated prior to his passing away, the progress and
  decline of the religion lie in the hands of Buddhists. It is they who will be responsible.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080"><strong>Modern trends in Thai
  Buddhism</strong></font> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For Thai traditionalists Buddhism often means merit making
  activities such as offering food to monks or contributing to the construction projects of
  a monastery. Taking part in Buddhist festivals and ceremonies is also considered a
  meritorious act. The more devout may occasionally observe five precepts, which every lay
  Buddhist is expected to follow, and learn to practice basic meditation. However, they
  usually lack intellectual understanding of the Buddha's teachings, and take little
  interest in studying them, for which reason they are prone to indulge in superstition and
  astrology. Temple fairs and celebrations provide them with cultural entertainment and more
  opportunities to make merit. These people are more or less content with the status quo and
  expect little from their involvement with the religion other than the so-called
  accumulation of merits. Normally, one would not expect them to have any particular vision
  concerning religious or social reform, but they do contribute in no small measure to the
  preservation and maintenance of the Buddhist institution and the Thai culture. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Characteristically, the institution of the Thai Sangha is
  traditionalistic and conservative almost to the extreme. This conservatism represents both
  a weakness and a strength in the system, but in the ultimate analysis it often confines
  the Sangha to unnecessary constraint and impedes efforts by the Sangha to express their
  sense of social responsibility more fully. Even the so-called two duties of scriptural
  study and meditation practice, which the commentary attributes to monks and to which monks
  are supposed to confine themselves, have sometimes been criticized, not quite justifiably,
  as too restrictive and unrealistic, not reflecting the needs of the community to which the
  Sangha institution belongs. Thus, other than these two express tasks, monks are frequently
  seen engaged in monastic construction or renovation. Socially, their activities now rarely
  extend beyond the performance of religious rites and ceremonies. Public instruction or
  edification is often carried out perfunctorily, and the intellectual leadership which the
  Sangha previously enjoyed has weakened considerably. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Fortunately, however, there are a handful of individual
  Sangha members who are quite capable, socially conscientious, and dedicated. While not
  neglecting to preserve the conservative spirit of the Theravada tradition, they do make
  concerted efforts to relate to social needs and go out of their way to overcome the
  barriers and weaknesses of both traditionalism and conservatism. They run the risk of
  being called unconventional, but they do contribute substantially to society, in terms of
  both material development and spiritual well-being. Under their initiative and support,
  schools are built in remote rural areas, roads are constructed to connect villages, wells
  are dug to provide more water to villagers, funds are established to enable poor children
  to attend schools and colleges, family disputes are amicably settled, electricity is
  brought into long forgotten village settlements, etc. Some monasteries run charitable
  therapeutic centers for drug addicts, others establish charitable nursing homes for the
  aged or terminally ill AIDS patients. There are also monks who are active as
  environmentalists and conservation activists, who consistently try to raise public
  awareness in these pressing issues. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, despite all these tasks, the fundamental
  position of scriptural study and meditative practice never suffers a setback, for there
  are many more monks who are traditionally active in those areas. One only hopes that there
  will emerge in course of time more socially engaged Sangha members and that the balance
  between conservative traditionalism and visionary farsighted pragmatism will be properly
  maintained. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With the phenomenal increase of Western interest in
  Buddhism, more Thai Buddhists have also begun to take a closer look at their own religion.
  One may assert that the coincidence is more accidental than incidental, but the trend is
  positively a welcome sign. True, this never amounts to anything close to a reform or
  revival movement, yet it is nonetheless quite a meaningful development. Perhaps this has
  been prompted, at least in part, by modern Thai political unrest and the simultaneous
  surge in crime and violence characteristic of moral deterioration in society. People have
  subsequently been forced to look for a practical alternative and solution in Buddhism, and
  they have found answers in the ancient message of the Buddha, which had been hitherto
  neglected through the headlong rush toward the material utopia. This rediscovery gives
  them new-found confidence in the Dhamma, which they believe may be employed to effectively
  stem the downhill slide of public moral consciousness. It is generally accepted that one
  of the causes of social problems in modern Thai society is the lack of interest in and
  commitment to Buddhism and Buddhist practices. This trend of spiritual disillusionment is
  strongest among the technocrats and the intelligentsia, hence the relatively sharp
  increase in their involvements with religious activities within the modern Thai social
  context. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With the new trend, existing meditation centers have
  become revitalized and new centers have been established to meet public interest. A
  growing number of people take to meditation. Educational establishments, such as schools,
  colleges, and universities, organize seminars or workshops centering on Buddhist themes
  for both students and the general public. Extracurricular summer courses for intensive
  training in Buddhist studies and monasticism are widely introduced and generously
  supported. More and more young men from the middle class and the intellectual sector join
  the Order for religious training. Although most enter the training programs for brief
  periods of time, the effect this has come to bear on the public moral consciousness is
  quite substantial. An increasing number of laity are seriously engaged in the intellectual
  pursuit of Buddhist scriptural knowledge, previously regarded as a strictly monastic
  domain, and Buddhist courses have been integrated into advanced educational curricula at
  university level throughout the country. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The role of lay Buddhists as Dhamma teachers in the modern
  religious scene should also be recognized. University courses in Buddhism, Pali, Sanskrit,
  and general religious studies are all taught by lay teachers, alternatively supplemented
  by occasional participation of invited Sangha members. Some lay Dhamma teachers are also
  active even outside their educational establishments, holding classes in Buddhism for the
  benefit of the general public. Even the Abhidhamma, considered more technical and
  therefore more difficult to comprehend, is taught and studied by interested laity. Those
  with a background in higher secular knowledge have the added advantage of relating it to
  religious understanding and are in a better position to express it, if need be, in
  contemporary vocabulary to make the Dhamma more intelligible and interesting. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is worth remarking that women have also begun to take a
  keen interest in these intellectual pursuits, countering their previous predominant role
  as material supporters and their relative indifference to serious religious studies. In
  fact, they have now come to the forefront in the field, gaining eminence as religious
  instructors and forming a major part of the academic sector. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, these lay academic activities are as yet rather
  limited, and beyond this restricted circle, monks still fill the major role of religious
  instructors. There are two Buddhist universities, Mahachulalongkorn and Mahamakut, both
  located in Bangkok, that cater to the educational needs of monks in the Kingdom, as well
  as those from foreign lands. These two establishments have affiliated colleges and schools
  in various parts of the country and offer graduate and postgraduate courses which are
  recognized by the Ministry of Education. They are administered solely by the respective
  governing bodies of monks, and the services they have rendered to the advancement of
  Buddhist studies have been widely recognized. Meditation is another area of specialization
  where the role of monks is still of the greatest significance, although some very able lay
  teachers are quite active in this field as well. Monk instructors do have a positive
  advantage, because they naturally inspire faith and respect in the practitioners and
  because they not only train in meditation but actually live a meditative life. Lay
  teachers, on the other hand, are generally more accessible and flexible, so they appeal to
  certain groups of people who prefer a more relaxed approach. The increased interest in
  recent years in the practice of meditation is, indeed, a welcome trend in contemporary
  Thai Buddhism. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another important development is the recent Thai
  participation in international Buddhist missionary activities. Comparatively, the Thai
  entry into the international religious scene is long overdue, yet there are considerable
  resources which the country could contribute. With the West increasingly becoming
  interested in Buddhism, there seems to be a great demand for religious personnel to bring
  the Buddha's message of peace and wisdom to new and unfamiliar lands. Unfortunately, the
  Thai Sangha, especially the ecclesiastical governing body, has been slow in responding to
  this new opportunity. So far nothing of significance has been done in this direction, but
  there are individual monks who have long been active in their self-imposed foreign
  missions. Many have rendered quite commendable services, against all odds and, for Thai
  communities, the hardships of anun accustomed environment. Thai-trained Western monks are
  the most successful with Western enthusiasts and the growth of their activities has been
  phenomenal. Presently, quite a few Thai temples, eighty-nine by the latest official
  figure, have been firmly established in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, India,
  the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and in many parts of the European
  Continent. Out of these, only four are directly supported by the Thai government. However,
  recent attempts have been made by the Thai ecclesiastical governing body to form an
  institute which will deal exclusively with foreign missionary activities, and the
  Department of Religious Affairs is actively collaborating on the project. It is hoped that
  this will more effectively solve the long-standing problems with regard to the Thai role
  in the international Buddhist mission and will further help promote the advancement and
  spread of the religion in many a foreign country. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080"><strong>How serious are Thais with
  their religion?</strong></font> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is not possible to generalize whether Thai Buddhists
  are serious or not about their religion. Most probably this is true of all religious
  institutions, within which we find varying degrees of commitment and dedication. However,
  unlike most other religions, which stress the importance of faith more than anything else,
  Buddhism places great emphasis on wisdom and understanding. Thus the level of faith and
  commitment to religious practice tends to depend largely on understanding and appreciation
  of its teachings. Naturally, this varies from one individual to another. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If generosity and friendliness were the standards by which
  to judge religious commitment, Thai Buddhists would no doubt be regarded as dedicated and
  earnest practitioners. The Thai traits of generosity and friendliness are often cited as
  examples of the Buddhist influence on the national personality. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Briefly speaking, there are three modes of making merit
  recommended by the Buddha for a lay Buddhist to follow. These are generosity (<em>dana</em>),
  morality (<em>sila</em>), and mental development (<em>bhavana</em>). Of these three
  principles, generosity is considered basic training, for it explicitly concerns outward
  practice. It has been pointed out that although the act of giving itself is based on an
  inner quality of mind, yet it is directed outwardly. The practice of morality refers to
  the conscious observance of moral precepts. This is said to be of higher merit and more
  noble than generosity, because it directly concerns the control of bodily and verbal
  actions. Mental development is of the highest virtue, for it deals with the training and
  purification of the mind, which is the most important component of the psycho-physical
  structure. To train the mind is to engage in the practice of meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Generosity is the mode of merit making that Thai Buddhists
  practice more than anything else. This normally takes the form of offering food to monks,
  supporting the Sangha with material needs, contributing to monastic construction projects,
  or supporting charitable services. Fewer people go beyond this step to follow the moral
  precepts regularly. Of course, there is a customary practice of ceremonially asking for
  the five precepts at the beginning of every formal religious function, and most Buddhists
  take pains to fulfill their part in the ceremony. But, to be sure, this does not always
  amount to a conscious attempt to practice according to the spirit and intention of the
  precepts. The more devout would be an exception here. As for meditation, few are ever
  inclined to commit themselves to it, especially to a formal course or in a prolonged
  training program. Nevertheless, the recent increase of public interest in meditation may
  be regarded as an encouraging sign that this supreme form of merit making has finally
  received the attention it deserves, although one would not expect it to become a household
  practice. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist holy days are still considered special occasions
  for making merit in Thailand. There are a number of regular religious sermons or
  discussions on radio and television, especially on Sundays or holy days. The more
  important holy days, those connected with special events in the life of the Buddha, such
  as <em>Magha</em>, <em>Visakha</em>, and <em>Asalha</em>, are celebrated with greater
  enthusiasm and piety than the others. The three month period of the rains retreat is
  considered especially sacred for spiritual practices, and young men will leave home to
  enter monastic life for training as well as for merit. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One may say therefore that, on the one hand, the majority
  of Thai Buddhists need to commit themselves more meaningfully to the religion, yet, on the
  other, it may also be rightly asserted that Buddhism in the country is still very much
  alive and strong. Optimistically, one hopes that things will improve, for Thailand is
  admittedly one of the most important strongholds of the Buddhist world today. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080"><strong>Buddha lockets and amulets</strong></font>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It must be clear from the outset that the use of charms,
  talismans, and such objects as Buddha lockets or votive tablets were neither part of the
  Buddha's teaching, nor recommended by him. They were adopted by Buddhists in a much later
  period and have become popular in a comparatively recent time. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To be sure, the use of charms or talismans is a fairly
  widespread practice in all religions. In fact, these things are as old as civilization
  itself, if not older. In Buddhism, their primary introduction might have been a result of
  the religion's geographical proximity with Hinduism. The Tibetans are known to have
  practiced magic and occultism since ancient times, and they might have been among the
  earliest Buddhists to produce such sacred objects, which were intended for protection and
  blessing. Spiritually advanced lamas consecrated the objects by repeatedly reciting a
  sacred incantation, such as <em>Om mani padme hum</em>, or by entering into a very deep
  state of concentration and invoking the desired power in the objects. It is believed that
  by so doing the energy field of the consecrated objects is transformed or intensified and
  the objects eventually acquire spiritually magnetic qualities with esoteric magical
  powers. Of course, it is further explained that the efficacy of such sacred objects
  depends to a large extent on the faith and confidence of the users, as well as their own
  favorable past <em>kamma</em>. That strong unshakable faith and conviction do produce
  powerful energies where the lack thereof does not is a common experience which anyone may
  testify from personal accounts. This is the philosophy behind the use of magic, charms,
  and talismans that have come into vogue through human history. Naturally, it is likely to
  be rejected by scientists and many intellectuals simply laugh at it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Early Thai literature abounds with references to the use
  of magic and charms, testifying to the fact that such practice had been known in the
  country for a long time. Such practices do serve a certain purpose, but they also have
  severe limitations. People who lack self-confidence and a clear understanding of the
  doctrine of <em>kamma</em> may feel the need for some additional psychological support,
  which they find in such charms and magical objects. As people become more mature and have
  a better grasp of the Dhamma, they need less psychological support, other than that which
  the Dhamma provides, and are thus free from superstitious beliefs and practices. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha lockets or votive tablets are only miniaturized
  versions of larger Buddha images. Originally, Buddha images were meant to serve as
  reminders of the Buddha and his virtues. Since Buddhists have the images at home for
  worship or meditative practice, it is natural that they would want to have them when not
  at home, too, such as while travelling. Thus miniature replicas of Buddha images, which
  could be conveniently carried around the neck, were produced by the faithful. This soon
  became popular and the practice was adopted by increasingly large numbers: people feel
  secure and auspicious when they have a Buddha image with them. Of course, since Buddha
  images are held in high esteem as symbolizing the Buddha and his virtues, they are duly
  consecrated and are treated differently from other objects. Buddhists consider them sacred
  and regard them with reverence. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha lockets or votive tablets were also originally
  employed as an instrument -- a skillful means, so to say -- to induce people to practice
  the Dhamma or lead a life of righteousness. It was commonly held that whether or not one
  might benefit from the sacred objects depended largely on the stipulation that those who
  wear them must practice the Dhamma or lead a virtuous life. If people truly believed in
  this rationalization, they would likely be discouraged from doing wrong or evil deeds and
  would naturally be encouraged to do good. Although this may not strictly appear to be in
  keeping with the Buddhist spirit of wisdom and understanding, it does serve some practical
  purpose. Certainly, when the Dhamma is clearly understood one will develop a more
  realistic perspective and such rationalization would become irrelevant. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, in later times the connection between Buddha
  lockets or votive tablets and the Dhamma seems to have been lost or forgotten altogether.
  Where magic is concerned, many no longer have faith in the Dhamma but have come to blindly
  believe in the sole powers of magic. Sacred objects cease to be an effective vehicle for
  the practice of Dhamma and their original, more sublime purposes are defeated. Worse
  still, modern day magic has become so commercialized that there are concerted efforts to
  spread superstition among the gullible for commercial ends. Charms and talismans are being
  promoted through advertising like household commodities. Surely, the need for the true
  Dhamma is now more urgent than ever. </font></p>
