        <P ALIGN="left"><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Venerable Pandit Dr. 
        Medagama Vajiragnana, Viharadhipati of the London Buddhist Vihara and 
        the Chief Sanghanayaka of Great Britain was in Sri Lanka on a brief 
        visit. Before his departure on Friday 9, he spoke to Nemsiri Mutukumara 
        on the progress of Buddha Sasana in the West with special reference to 
        England. </FONT></I></P>

      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="6">D</FONT>uring 
      the last 49 years, that is after 1954, Great Britain and the countries in 
      the European continent have witnessed a remarkable growth in both quality 
      and quantity turning a new leaf in their behaviourial patterns in their 
      way of living, says the Venerable Pandit Dr. Medagama Vajiragnana, Chief 
      Sanghanayaka of Great Britain. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He is also the Viharadhipati 
      of the London Buddhist Vihara founded and established by Sri Lanka's 
      Anagarika Dharmapala in 1926 at Gloucester Road, Regents Park in London.
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Despite the Vihara being 
      closed during the Second World War - 1939 to 1945 and the building 
      acquired by the British Government and the return of the three resident 
      Bhikkhus - the Ven. Dr. Paravahera Vajiragnana, Ven. Dehigaspe Pannasara 
      and Hegoda Nandasara back to Sri Lanka, the fervour of the British who 
      were yearning for a new way of life continued undiminished. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Fundamental message</B>
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The fundamental message of 
      the Buddha &quot;Shun evil and do good&quot; and the Four Noble Truths and the Noble 
      Eightfold Path with the Layman's code of ethics which is for all times and 
      all climes etched in their minds indelibly for them to contemplate the 
      futility of bloodshed taking place in Europe and elsewhere during the 
      Second World War. Ven. Vajiragnana recalled that despite the end of the 
      war in 1945, the Mahabodhi Society could open the Vihara only in 1954.
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Immediately after the war 
      many Sri Lankan business entrepreneurs went to London for business 
      activities. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sir Cyril de Zoysa, a 
      successful entrepreneur, politician and Buddhist leader met several 
      leading Buddhists who urged him to re-open the London Buddhist Vihara. On 
      his return Sir Cycil rallied round Hewavitarana and Amarasuriya families 
      among other Buddhists and formed the London Buddhist Vihara Society in Sri 
      Lanka to fund the re-establishment of the Buddhist Vihara. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>First resident bhikkhu</B>
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A small building was rented 
      out just behind the famous Harrods shop - a place visited by the British 
      as well as foreign visitors. The location was 10, Ovington Gardens. The 
      Venerable Narada, quite popular for his Desana as well as writings in both 
      Sinhala and English became the first resident bhikkhu. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After a few months, the Ven. 
      Mirisse Gunasiri succeeded him. He was followed by the Venerable Dr. 
      Hammalava Saddhatissa who came from India to head the London Buddhist 
      Vihara. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For ten years, the Ovinton 
      Gardens became popular place for those seeking peace and contentment with 
      renewed interest. The management committee was informed that the British 
      Government has paid compensation for the take over of the Buddhist Vihara 
      building and the money can be utilised for a spacious place to accommodate 
      the increasing number of seekers of the truth. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A two storeyed building was 
      purchased at No. 5, Heathfield Gardens. The Vihara was ceremonially opened 
      by Dr. Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera, Sri Lanka High Commissioner in 
      England in 1964. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With every passing day, the 
      British Buddhists as well as the cosmopolitan population in England as 
      well as those visiting Europeans were looking forward to a visit to the 
      Vihara. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">By this time, the impact of 
      the message was so popular, every university in Great Britain has set up a 
      seat, or a department or a faculty for the Teaching of Buddhism. Books on 
      Buddha Dhamma began rolling out of many prestigious establishments both 
      educational and commercial like the Cambridge and Oxford Universities, 
      Keagan Paul and Company, Allan Unwin and Company and so on. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The London Pali Text Society 
      (PTS) started by Dr. Rhys Davids printed and published Buddha Dhamma in 
      English langauge and the Pali texts in Roman Character. In fact, the PTS 
      prepared a new alphabet to write Pali and Sinhala words without giving 
      those words an Anglican touch which today is accepted as the standard 
      throughout the world. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">About fifteen years ago, 
      there was a popular clamour that religious knowledge should be a 
      compulsory subject in all government schools. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Ven. Pandit Dr. Vajiragnana 
      was entrusted to prepare the handbook for the teaching of Buddha Dhamma in 
      government schools. Over the last ten years, Great Britain has created 
      history in making Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and 
      Sikkhism as compulsory subjects in British government schools. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Ven. Vajiragnana said, the 
      Britain has surpassed Sri Lanka in that respect. The Nayakathera said in 
      some cases where teachers cannot be found to teach any particular 
      religion, a Christian teacher fills the void and teaches the subject 
      according to the prepared text book. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Ven. Vajiragnana said, a 
      golden opportunity is downed on Sri Lanka Bhikkhu Sangha to teach Buddhism 
      in British schools. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Those willing to take up the 
      opportunity must necessarily be proficient in English language and through 
      with the Buddha Dhamma, the spread of the Dhamma from the first year of 
      Buddha's dispensation which started with the despatching of sixty Arahats 
      in sixty different places in India and the sending of Dhamatutas by 
      Emperor Asoka throughout the North-West India reading Greece and Egypt and 
      in the North-Eastern regions to Korea and Japan. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Y</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>oung 
      minds</B> </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Additionally, every religious 
      teacher should equip themselves with a sound basic knowledge and 
      understanding of the other five religions in order to explain the subject 
      to the young minds. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Lancaster University, 
      Vajiragnana Nayaka Thera explained is quite well-known as a promoter of 
      Buddhist studies. A number of Bhikkhu Sangha have had their post-graduate 
      training at Lancaster and obtained post graduate doctorates as well. The 
      teaching of Buddha Dhamma in schools and universities is not a mere 
      academic exercise, he said. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Particularly, the teaching of 
      Buddha is borne out of a dire need fell by the British people and those in 
      the Western World. Almost all Western countries are highly economically 
      developed. The Westerners have the most affluent societies. They do not 
      know what to do with their monetary and material resources they have 
      acquired. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sadly, they have everything 
      at the pressing of a button or pushing up or down a switch. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Regrettably, their 
      traditional way of life has failed miserably to provide some food for the 
      cultivation of the mind. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Mind culture is conspicuous 
      with its absence. Meditation is a new term for them. Meditation draws them 
      like a tortoise to a pond. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Bhavana sessions</B>
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Westerner's deep and abiding 
      interest in Buddhist meditation has witnessed Bhavana centres coming up 
      everywhere. In places where a Buddhist Vihara or a Buddhist Centre is not 
      found, people hire public halls for Bhavana sessions - paying quite 
      handsomely for the half-day session on mind control exercises given by the 
      Bhikkhus. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After London Buddhist Vihara, 
      many other Asian communities have opened Viharas in the outskirts of 
      London. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Viharas built by Governments 
      of Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and China are patronised by and large 
      by those respective nationals. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Buddhist communities in 
      Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Nepal, India and Bangladesh have their own Viharas 
      supported heavily by the Buddhists back home. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Several Lamaseries with big 
      Lama communities - disciples of His Holiness the Dalai Lama are supported 
      by the Dalai Lama's government in exile and large following His Holiness 
      has in the Western world. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Maha Bodhi Society</B>
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The biggest achievement of 
      the Anagarika Dharmapala's pioneering Dhammaduta work through their Maha 
      Bodhi Society is the coming up of the Amaravati Vihar at Hertfordshire. 
      Men and women from fourteen countries in Europe reside in Amaravati as 
      Samaneras, full fledged Bhikkhus and Ten Preceptor Buddhist Nuns. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Nuns provide a supplementary 
      and complimentary role at Amaravati. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Amaravati has opened a branch 
      at Chithurst too. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Head of Amaravati is a 
      former British soldier at the Vietnam war. He on retirement, renounced the 
      lay life and entered the order of the Bhikkhu Sangha as a pupil of Ajahn 
      Chah are of the foremost meditation masters in the world living in 
      Thailand. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The new Bhikkhu was named 
      Ajahn Sumedho. Ven. Sumedho is no foreigner to Sri Lanka. He has visited 
      Sri Lanka many times and conducted Bhavana and delivered Dhammadesana too.
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With the London Buddhist 
      Vihara as the nucleus, Ven. Vajiragnana described the role the Vihara has 
      played in the dissemination of Dhamma in France, Germany, Netherlands, 
      Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Italy as well one would be surprised to know 
      that Buddhist Vihara is found close to the Vatican too. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With the disintegration of 
      the Soviet system, many East European countries have gone back to the 
      glorious days of Buddhism. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Already Kalmyk Republic, 
      where the preponderant majority are Buddhists has elected a young Buddhist 
      leader - in his late thirties as the New President of Kalmykia. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">His first task had been to 
      proclaim Buddhism as the state religion and the re-opening of all Viharas 
      which had been closed during the dictatorial communist regime of the 
      Soviet Union. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Buddha Sasana</B> </FONT>
      </P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">All the Bhikkhus who had left 
      Kalmykia are returning to their old Viharas and vigorously working for the 
      development of Buddha Sasana. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Quite often, the Bhikkhus in 
      London Vihara are united to conduct Sarvaratrika Dharmadesana and 
      ordination of youth as Samaneras in the continental countries. Sri Lankan 
      Bhikkhu Sangha in those countries too as in London and elsewhere support 
      the Sri Lanka Viharas. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">They of course are keen to 
      observe and practice in puja. In their time table, priority is given to 
      rituals. Bhavana still seems to enjoy a second class berth. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Sri Lankan Bhikkhu Sangha 
      provides their best to make the Bhavana conscious Westerners their need as 
      well as the puja and ritual conscious people their requirements as well.
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After all both groups are 
      mentally satisfied that they have achieved their target. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">That is the most important 
      aspect of the matter. </FONT></P>
