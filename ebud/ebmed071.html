        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>n this chapter
        I'd like to discuss some different types of meditation in order to
        increase the repertoire. I hope you're getting the idea by now that in
        order to develop sustained attention and to get success in your
        meditation there needs to be a certain degree of entertaining the mind,
        giving it some joy, giving it some fun. You might find it very useful to
        try different types of meditation. It's actually the same basic process,
        but you're just using different objects to focus your attention on. By
        using different objects to focus your attention on, the mind avoids
        getting bored through always plugging away at the same object. This
        stops us getting sleepy as well. You'll find a lot of sleepiness, a lot
        of sloth and torpor, comes from boredom when you're always doing the
        same thing over and over again.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So in my own practice I like to
        cultivate a few different objects of meditation. I also teach others to
        do the same, especially when they're doing a lot of meditation. Not only
        does this give the variety that keeps the mind's interest, it also
        develops some different abilities of the mind which you'll find helpful
        in attaining peaceful states. In this chapter I shall cover three
        different types of meditation: Loving-kindness (<i>Metta</i>), Letting
        Be or Letting Go, and Walking Meditation.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Loving-Kindness Meditation<i> (Metta</i>)</font></p>
        </font></b><i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Metta</font></i><font face="Times New Roman">
        is the Buddhist word for &quot;loving-kindness.&quot; It refers to the
        emotion of goodwill, that which wishes happiness for another. It
        embraces forgiveness, because <i>Metta</i> says: &quot;The door to my
        heart is open to you. No matter who you are or what you have done, come
        in.&quot; It is that kindness which does not judge and is given freely,
        expecting nothing in return. The Buddha compared <i>Metta </i>to a
        mother's love for her child (Sn, 149). A mother may not always like her
        child or agree with everything it does, but she will always care for her
        child, wishing it only happiness. Such openhearted, non-discriminating
        kindness is <i>Metta</i>.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Metta</font></i><font face="Times New Roman">
        meditation is that meditation which focuses the attention on the feeling
        of loving-kindness, developing that beautiful transcending emotion until
        it fills the whole mind. There are many methods for developing <i>Metta</i>
        meditation. Here is just one way. I'll cover the basic principles with
        some instruction in this chapter. (A complete guided <i>Metta</i>
        meditation can be found in <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>. This
        section and the appendix are intended to complement and reinforce each
        other, and I urge you to make use of both).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Begin with the first steps of the
        &quot;Basic Method&quot;, presented at the beginning of the book. Take
        the method only as far as stage one, Present Moment Awareness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The way you then develop loving-kindness
        meditation is by choosing some object which you find easy to feel loving
        kindness toward. The simile I often use is that of lighting a fire. You
        need kindling to light a fire. One can't put a match to a big log and
        expect the match to ignite that log. The log is far too big. So you have
        to find something which will take the flame easily, something which is
        easy to light. It could be some of the firelighters you get for
        barbecues, or paper, or straw -- anything that takes the fire very
        easily will do. You build up the first flames of loving-kindness on that
        kindling and then later one can put on more solid pieces of wood. First
        of all one uses just twigs and then branches, then you can put big logs
        on that fire. It's always the case that only when there's a big roaring
        fire -- really strong and very hot -- only then can you put on the big
        &quot;sappy logs.&quot; The big sappy logs in this simile stand for your
        enemies. Sometimes for many of you, the biggest sappy log is yourself!
        When you find the fire of loving-kindness is very strong, you can put
        yourself on that fire, &quot;dry out&quot; and ignite the biggest,
        sappiest log of all.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once the fire is strong, you can give
        loving-kindness towards even your worst enemies. It may surprise you
        that you can actually do this. You think of this person towards whom
        you've always had anger and wanted revenge, and you find that you are
        now in a mind state where you can actually love them, really give them
        goodwill. And you're not playing around either. It's actually happening!
        This is the result of the gradual process of development of this emotion
        called &quot;loving-kindness&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now as to the &quot;kindling&quot;, this
        is where you use your power of imagination and visualisation together
        with your mental commentary. Here you encourage the commentary, but you
        keep your commentary just to a certain topic. You're, as it were,
        &quot;psyching yourself up&quot; to develop loving-kindness towards a
        small visual object, an imaginary object. Don't be afraid of
        imagination, because visualisation and imagination are tools of the mind
        that you can use to your benefit.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Keeping your eyes closed, imagine in
        front of you a small kitten or a puppy or a baby or whatever you find it
        easy to generate loving-kindness towards. (I personally like using a
        small kitten.) Imagine it to be abandoned, hungry, afraid, and in your
        mind open your heart to it. Take it up gently, in imaginary arms, and
        use inner speech to say: &quot;May you not feel so afraid. Be at peace.
        May you be happy. I will look after you, be your friend and protector. I
        care for you. Whatever you do, wherever you go, my heart will always
        welcome you. I give you my love unconditionally, always.&quot; Say those
        words inside (or similar one's that you make up) with full meaning, even
        though it is to a being only in your imagination. Say them many times
        until you feel the joy of <i>Metta</i> arise in you heart like a golden
        glow. Stay with this exercise until the feeling of <i>Metta</i> is
        strong and stable.</font></p>
        <b><i><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Metta</font></font></i><font color="#00007f"><font face="Times New Roman">
        Includes Compassion</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Loving-kindness includes compassion, so
        you can use compassion to generate <i>Metta</i>. You look at that
        imaginary being and focus on its suffering, real or potential. You see
        the fact that it is subject to pain -- not just physical pain but also
        the mental pain of loneliness and rejection. You see how very vulnerable
        it is. When I do this with my little imaginary kitten I always think
        that there's no one else in the whole world to look after that small
        being. If I don't look after it, if I don't take it in, I just imagine
        what sort of death that little being is going to have -- cold, rejected,
        hungry, thirsty and sick. When I start to see the suffering (the <i>dukkha</i>),
        in that being and how it is so vulnerable to pain, then straight away it
        encourages compassion in me towards it. I want to protect and care for
        it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As soon as that compassion, that sense
        of looking after the little being comes up, it's very easy at the same
        time to have loving-kindness, (which is basically goodwill). Compassion
        is goodwill towards someone who's suffering. In this instance it's
        goodwill to ease the suffering of that imaginary being, and if its not
        suffering, to make its happiness even more delightful. I deliberately
        generate feelings of goodwill, of kindness, of compassion and of care.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">All of these words are centering in on
        this concept of &quot;loving-kindness&quot;, and I enter into a
        commentary with myself at this time, just imagining what might happen to
        that being, imagining looking after it, saying words of kindness, of
        protection. I do imaginary exercises like getting eye contact with that
        little being. When you can actually contact the imaginary being's eyes
        it becomes very emotional. Then I just keep on developing those images.
        I continue that commentary until such time that the loving-kindness
        towards that imaginary being is really, really strong.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You will find -- at least I find anyway
        -- that it's so much easier to light a fire of loving-kindness on such
        easy kindling. First of all, my imaginary kitten is a lovely furry
        animal. It's imaginary, so I can make it whatever I want. It's young. If
        it were actually real even little kittens can sometimes be pests. But if
        it's imaginary you've got full control over it to make it as furry, or
        as soft as you like. It purrs at the right time, and it doesn't poo on
        your lap. So you can do everything you want, just to make it a very nice
        little being. It's imaginary. You've got control over it.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Choose An Object You Can Relate To</font></font></b><font color="#00007f"><font face="Times New Roman">.</font></p>
        </font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One person I know didn't have much
        empathy towards little animals, nor did she like children. What she did
        was very innovative. She'd just been planting some small flowers in some
        pots in her house; so she just imagined a small plant in the earth. Just
        like the little kitten or the puppy, the plant is also a being that
        needs care and protection. She put all her motherly instincts, which she
        didn't really have towards children, towards that little plant,
        nurturing it and just imagining it growing. When it was a young
        seedling, it was just so tender and so easily hurt and broken. It had a
        long way to go before it was a full fledged flower. She imagined herself
        nurturing it, protecting it, loving it, caring for it until such time
        that the little flower burst forth and repaid her kindness with this
        beautiful smile of a flower in bloom. She really &quot;got off&quot; on
        that. That was for her the first time that meditation actually seemed to
        work. It was the first time she wasn't waiting for me to ring the bell.
        So this is another way of developing loving-kindness, instead of towards
        an animal or a human being, towards even a plant. And you can do that.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The point is, as long as you are
        nurturing this emotion and making it grow, you're allowed to use your
        commentary, and it's good to use it at this point to keep the fire
        burning. When you put a match to a piece of paper, you've got to blow;
        you've got to fan. You've got to keep it going. Sometimes you need two
        or three matches to get it alight. You work until the fire is going, and
        once loving-kindness is going, always remember to experience the warmth
        from time to time. So you're working to get the fire going, but you're
        also pausing now and again, to experience the result of your work. And
        as you see the result of your work, it gives you encouragement.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So you're just using this imaginary
        &quot;kindling&quot; as a means to develop loving-kindness, to get it
        started. As you go along, quite naturally you'll be aware of the feel of
        loving-kindness. When the flame starts to take and there's a fire
        starting, you can feel its warmth. Loving-kindness when it gets started
        is a very pleasurable emotion. Once you start to feel its warmth, then
        you really get into it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now let go of the imaginary being, and
        imagine in its place a real person, someone very close to you
        emotionally, your best friend maybe. Choose someone to whom you also
        find it easy to generate and maintain loving-kindness towards. With
        inner speech say to them: &quot;May you live in happiness. I sincerely
        wish you joy. I give you my love, without discrimination. You will
        always have a place in my heart. I truly care for you.&quot; -- or
        similar words of your own design. Use whatever arouses the warm glow of <i>Metta</i>
        in you heart. Stay with this person. Imagine they are right before you
        until the <i>Metta</i> glows bright and constant around them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the <i>Metta</i> glows bright and
        constant, let go of the image of that person. Substitute another close
        acquaintance, creating the feeling of <i>Metta</i> around them using
        your inner speech in the same way: &quot;May you live in
        happiness…&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Next substitute a whole group of people,
        perhaps all of the people who are in the house you are in. Develop the
        caring glow of <i>Metta</i> around them, all in the same way. &quot;May
        you all be happy and well…&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">See if you can imagine <i>Metta</i> to
        be a golden radiance coming from a beautiful white lotus flower in the
        middle of your heart. Allow that radiance of loving-kindness to expand
        in all directions, embracing more and more living beings, until it
        becomes boundless, filling up all that you can imagine. &quot;May all
        living beings, near or far, great or small, be happy and at
        peace…&quot; Bathe the whole universe in the warmth of the golden
        light of loving-kindness. Stay there for a while.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now imagine yourself, as if looking in a
        mirror at yourself. Say with your inner speech, with full sincerity:
        &quot;I wish me well. I now give myself the gift of happiness. Too long
        the door to my heart has been closed to me; now I open it. No matter
        what I have done, or will ever do, the door to my own love and respect
        is always open to me. I forgive myself unreservedly. Come home. I now
        give myself that love which does not judge. I care for this vulnerable
        being called 'me'. I embrace all of me with the loving-kindness of <i>Metta</i>…&quot;
        Invent your own words here to let the warmth of loving-kindness sink
        deep inside you, to that part which is most frightened. Let it melt all
        resistance until you are one with <i>Metta</i>, non-limiting
        loving-kindness, like a mother to her child.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you feel it is time to conclude,
        pause for a minute or two to reflect on how you feel inside. Notice the
        effect that this meditation has had on you. <i>Metta</i> meditation can
        produce heavenly bliss. Now imagine that golden glow of <i>Metta</i> one
        more time, originating from the beautiful white lotus in your heart.
        Gently draw that golden light back into the lotus, leaving the warmth
        outside. When the glow is a tiny ball of intense light in the centre of
        the lotus, gently close the petals of the lotus, guarding the seed of <i>Metta</i>
        within your heart, ready to be released again in your next <i>Metta </i>meditation.
        Open your eyes and get up slowly.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Recapitulation</font></font></b><font color="#00007f"><font face="Times New Roman">.</font></p>
        </font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now to recapitulate what we've covered
        so far: when you practice the above method of <i>Metta</i> meditation,
        it is helpful to use easy objects at the beginning. Again <i>Metta</i>
        meditation is like lighting a fire. You start by using some paper and
        kindling which easily takes the flame. Once that is alight, you put on
        some thicker sticks, and when these are burning well, you add some
        bigger pieces of wood. Eventually, once the fire is established, you can
        put on the big pieces of fuel. When the fire is roaring you can even put
        on a big, wet and sappy log, and there is enough heat for that to catch
        light and burn too. In this simile, the &quot;big, wet and sappy
        log&quot; stands for your &quot;enemy,&quot; someone you find it
        especially hard to forgive and be kind to. This enemy is often yourself.
        Once <i>Metta</i> has been established on the easy objects, though, you
        will be surprised at how even the &quot;enemy&quot; can &quot;take the
        flame&quot; of <i>Metta</i>. You find, in this way, that you can
        actually love your enemy.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">A Softening of the Mind</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Something is happening. It's a softening
        of the mind. The mind is turning towards this emotion of love, goodwill
        and care. It's becoming selfless, not so concerned with its own needs.
        It's becoming more in tune with giving, with sharing with other beings
        in this universe. Emotion, when it begins to be generated like this,
        feels very beautiful, and as you develop it more and more, that
        happiness of the emotion of loving-kindness gets very strong. It gets to
        the point that it's self-sustaining, like a fire is self-sustaining.
        When it's got enough fuel, then that's when you don't need to keep on
        with the commentary of loving-kindness. You can actually just go to its
        warmth, just the feeling of loving-kindness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The feeling is usually centered around
        your chest, around your heart region. At least with me it is. It's a
        very pleasant physical feeling, and it's a very pleasant mental feeling
        as well. It's very joyful to actually give unconditional love to another
        being (even one that's imaginary). It's an unlimited loving-kindness,
        without any conditions on that love. You're just going to love that
        being no matter what it does. That brings out the aspect of
        loving-kindness which is a complete embracing of that being, with full
        forgiveness, without any faultfinding. When there is full
        loving-kindness, the &quot;faultfinding mind&quot; is completely
        transcended and there's the &quot;accepting mind&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Loving-kindness is a very useful emotion
        to develop in meditation. To repeat: if you can develop a little bit of
        loving-kindness meditation like this, then you're softening the mind.
        You're softening the heart and you find that there's not so much
        faultfinding. You find there's more embracing instead. Faultfinding is
        being critical, seeing part of the whole -- especially the part that is
        wrong. Whereas loving-kindness embraces the wholeness of something. By
        accepting even an imaginary being like the little kitten or little puppy
        exactly as it is, you embrace forgiveness. This is acceptance. When you
        can develop this acceptance toward a little puppy or a kitten or a
        flower, you find that when you do other meditations, even the meditation
        on the breath, you can be much more accepting and not so critical of the
        process. You won't be so faultfinding towards the moment. You'll find
        you have much more<b> </b>contentment. You'll be able to embrace the
        moment as it is rather than being aware of so much that is wrong in the
        moment. The whole attitude of mind is changing. &quot;The world is the
        world.&quot; It's what we add to the world that creates the
        difficulties. We can add the faults to the world or we can add
        acceptance to the world. It's really up to us.</font></p>

        meditation so that we can regard the world through the emotion of
        loving-kindness, embracing and forgiveness. Because we can do that, we
        can also transfer that loving-kindness onto something like the breath.
        When we are watching the breath, we can watch it with loving-kindness,
        with full embracing. We nurture it just like that little seedling.<b> </b>(I
        find that if I can generate loving-kindness with breath meditation, it
        becomes a very, very powerful combination.)<b> </b>Loving-kindness
        avoids the faultfinding mind and gives us the ability to embrace the
        breath as it is, and the breath meditation is what's going to take us
        into deep and peaceful states. The deep states of meditation, the <i>Jhanas</i>
        especially, are emotional states. They're not intellectual states. If we
        want to develop those states we have to be able to trust in the
        emotions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes I say a bit facetiously that <i>Jhanas</i>
        are feely-feely states like loving-kindness -- feely, feely, feely!
        You've got to feel your way into these states, rather than think your
        way in. This is why, when you do loving-kindness meditation with the
        breath, you're able to add that emotional sensitivity to breath
        meditation. You're able to trust in that part of the mind that can feel
        and can delight in just the simple breath. So this is one of the reasons
        why it's very handy to do <i>Metta</i> meditation, because it develops
        trust in your emotions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Secondly of course, it gets rid of the
        faultfinding mind and especially the hindrance of ill will. As we
        discussed earlier in this section (as well as in detail in Chapter
        Four), ill will can be directed toward all sorts of people, but
        especially toward oneself. I have mentioned that it is one of the big
        hindrances to people attaining deep meditation. They simply don't allow
        themselves to do it; or they're too critical of themselves and therefore
        think they can't do it, and this is very close to ill will. They think,
        &quot;I lack self esteem&quot;. Lack of self-confidence is right next
        door to ill will. So what loving-kindness does is to allow you to
        experience the very heights of meditation. It permits you to experience
        bliss, and it also gives you the confidence that you can achieve these
        things.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So often it's the case that if a person
        thinks they can't achieve, they won't achieve. If a person even doubts
        whether they can achieve, they won't achieve. Someone -- you! -- is
        putting the obstacle in front of yourself needlessly. So loving-kindness
        is like a form of encouragement. It frees you to achieve anything that
        is there to achieve in the world.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again: ill will towards oneself is
        because of a lack of forgiveness towards oneself. That's why near the
        end of a loving-kindness meditation, when the feeling is strong, you can
        &quot;invite yourself into your heart&quot;, as it were, and give
        yourself complete forgiveness. As it says in the <i>Metta Sutta</i> (Sn,
        149), &quot;… just as a mother loves her child, her only child.&quot;
        This is what a mother does to her child. She loves the child, meaning
        she gives full forgiveness no matter what the child does in the world.
        She'll always be the mother, and she'll never abandon her child. Even
        animals can be like this. You know this when you've seen cats with
        kittens. The mother cat eats all of the kitten's faeces. It licks the
        kittens and cleans them. The mother eats up all their dirt. It's an
        amazing sort of sacrifice the mother makes for her children; that amount
        of forgiveness and tolerance. This is what we mean by loving-kindness --
        being able to accept, embrace and forgive everything. That's the
        important part of <i>Metta</i> meditation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We seek to develop that loving-kindness
        towards ourselves so completely that we reach the point where ill will
        is abandoned. Only then, when ill will is overcome can we give ourselves
        good will, can we wish ourselves well, can we allow happiness to come
        into us, and we can start to enjoy meditation. If there's ill will
        there, it's such a huge obstacle that it will come up at one stage or
        another of the meditation. It can sometimes come up towards the breath.
        It can sometimes come up towards the teacher. It can sometimes even come
        up towards your meditation cushion -- &quot;stupid cushion!&quot;. All
        of that ill will is stopping you enjoying your meditation.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Loving-Kindness Is Very Beautiful</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So loving-kindness meditation is very
        beautiful to develop, and you can develop it at any time. You don't have
        to be sitting meditation. You can do it while you're walking on the
        path. Develop loving-kindness in whichever way you can, but remember to
        try to develop it on simple objects first of all. Once more -- imaginary
        objects are usually the best. Build it up until it's really, really
        strong. When you have very, very strong loving-kindness, you can either
        turn to the breath if you wish (and you'll find the breath is just so
        easy to watch); or if you want to, you can carry on with loving-kindness
        and take that into a </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">Jhana.</font></p>
        </i><b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Taking <i>Metta</i> into a <i>Jhana</i>.</font></font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What you should do to access <i>Jhana</i>
        through <i>Metta</i>, is be able to see the fire of loving-kindness
        without any fuel. (The fuel is like the kitten, the puppy, the dear
        person, etc.) Just have love. <i>Metta</i> is perceived as a power, as a
        fire or as a light -- whatever way you wish to imagine it. However, now
        no person is giving out that <i>Metta</i>, and no being is receiving it.
        There is just disembodied loving-kindness, rather than it being aimed at
        anyone. If you start to focus on what loving-kindness actually is,
        rather than where it's coming from or where it's going to, then
        loving-kindness by itself, alone, becomes a very beautiful object of
        meditation. You become aware of just <i>Metta</i> because it's a very
        beautiful object indeed! It's inherently beautiful. Once it's generated,
        once the fire is there, it's not that difficult to sustain your
        attention on it, because it delights the mind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, one of the difficulties is that
        <i>Metta</i> without a sender or object is not that stable at first. But
        if you can stay with loving-kindness, it delights the mind. Try and calm
        the mind down and make it very peaceful and refined. Then that
        experience of loving-kindness itself will become your <i>Nimitta</i>. It
        will take you into a <i>Jhana</i>: a <i>Metta Jhana</i>. So developing
        loving-kindness is one of the ways into <i>Jhanas</i>. But as with all
        of these <i>Jhanas</i>, you have to simplify what you are aware of. It
        has to become a mental awareness, a mental object -- not a physical
        awareness.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another Approach, Doing Deep Samadhi
        First</font></font></b><font color="#00007f"><font face="Times New Roman">.</font></p>
        </font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another way of doing loving-kindness
        meditation applies if you've done a lot of breath meditation and got a
        deep <i>Samadhi</i>, not necessarily into <i>Jhanas</i>, but at least
        some degree of <i>Samadhi.</i> Then you can take up loving-kindness.
        When you've already developed a degree of deep meditation or <i>Samadhi</i>
        and you take up loving-kindness, it's so easy to do. If you've had a
        deep meditation and you start thinking about loving-kindness, you can
        spread it to the whole world so easily, because the mind is soft. You
        can work with the mind once its has done deep <i>Samadhi</i>. What <i>Samadhi</i>
        does to the mind is make it like a piece of clay. If clay is too dry,
        you can't make it into anything. If it's too wet and soggy, it just goes
        all over the place. But if there is just the right amount of water in
        that clay, you can turn it into all sorts of shapes. When there's just
        the right amount of softness in the mind (as there is after deep
        meditation), you can turn it into anything. You can do beautiful
        loving-kindness meditation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We used to do this chant in our
        monastery some time ago. It was the Four Divine Abidings (<i>Brahmaviharas</i>).
        We chanted the spreading of loving-kindness, (<i>Metta</i>) and then
        compassion (<i>Karuna</i>) and then sympathetic joy (<i>Mudita</i>) and
        then equanimity (<i>Upekkha</i>). We did this all in about five minutes.
        After one very nice meditation when we started doing this chant, I just
        got stuck on the first part (<i>Metta</i>) and I couldn't go anywhere
        else. Just as soon as I started chanting, the mind was so workable, as
        it were, so easy to point towards whatever I wanted to, that as those
        words came up I was just immersed in loving-kindness. I couldn't do
        anything else! I got stuck in loving-kindness, a really powerful
        loving-kindness as well. I never got to the second part of the chant.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This example shows what you can do with
        a mind that is well trained. You can really do loving-kindness
        meditation. I discovered from that experience that a lot of the
        loving-kindness I had done before was just messing around, scratching at
        the surface. So when you develop a very deep mind state on the breath
        meditation, it's very good when you come out to do loving-kindness
        meditation and experience its power, experience its bliss. Direct it to
        all beings, and<b> </b>also include yourself. Because your mind has been
        empowered, loving-kindness is extremely strong, and it can really direct
        a lot of benefit towards yourself and towards other beings.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So these are some of the ways of doing
        loving-kindness meditation, especially to: overcome the hindrance of ill
        will, be able to look at the breath kindly and to nurture the breath,
        give the mind something else to do so you're not always doing breath
        meditation, and to get these very beneficial attitudes of forgiveness
        towards oneself and all other beings. This way one isn't carrying around
        the faultfinding mind that sees all the mistakes in oneself, and in
        other beings, and in the world.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Letting Be, Letting Go Meditation</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another meditation object that I would
        like to discuss is the meditation on &quot;letting be,&quot; or
        &quot;letting go&quot;. This is one of the other meditations that I
        often practise. Sometimes instead of trying to watch the breath as my
        object, or taking loving-kindness as my object, I look at my mind and
        realise the best thing it needs at the moment is just to let things be.
        Basically, letting be meditation is just this second stage of breath
        meditation, just silent awareness of the present moment. It has to be
        silent, because to really let things go means you give no orders; you
        don't have any complaints. If you really let things be, you've got
        nothing to say, nothing to talk about. &quot;Letting be&quot; happens in
        the present moment. You're just aware of things as they're appearing
        right now, and you allow them to come in. You allow them to stay. And
        you allow them to go whenever they want. Letting be meditation is like
        sitting here, and whoever comes in the door, you let them come in. They
        can stay as long as they like. If they are terrible demons, you allow
        them to come in and sit down. They can stay as long as they like, and
        you are not at all fazed. If the Buddha himself comes in all his glory,
        you just sit here, just the same, completely equanimous. &quot;You can
        come in if you want.&quot; &quot;You can go whenever you want.&quot;
        This is letting be meditation. Whatever comes into your mind, the
        beautiful or the gross, just stand back and let it be, with no reactions
        at all -- quietly observing, practising silent awareness in the present
        moment.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Garden Simile</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I will now introduce the simile of
        &quot;Just sitting out in the garden&quot; to explain the letting be
        meditation more fully.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many here in Australia have a garden at
        the back of their house and they often spend many hours working in their
        garden making it look beautiful. But a garden is to be enjoyed, not just
        to be worked in. So I advise my students that they should frequently
        just go sit in their &quot;garden&quot; and enjoy its great beauty.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most stupid of my students decide
        that they must mow the grass first, then prune the bushes, water the
        flower bed, rake the leaves…..getting the garden perfect before they
        can sit down to enjoy it. Of course, the garden never is perfect no
        matter how hard they work. So they never get to rest in peace, except
        when they're dead (R.I.P.)!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second type of student also lacks
        wisdom. They decide not to do any work, but as soon as they sit out in
        their garden they begin to think. &quot;The grass needs mowing and the
        bushes should be pruned. The flowers are looking dry and the leaves
        really need raking, and the nice native bush would look nice over there,
        and…..&quot; When they are thinking how they can make the garden
        perfect they are not simply enjoying it. They find no peace.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third type of student is the wise
        meditator. They have done a lot of work in their garden, but now is
        their time for rest. They say: &quot;Even though the lawn could be mown,
        even though the bushes could be pruned, even though the flowers could be
        watered and the leaves raked…..Not now! The garden is good enough,
        natural even&quot;. And they can rest a while, not feeling guilty in the
        midst of imperfection.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Letting be meditation is just the same.
        Don't try and make everything perfect, tying up all those loose ends,
        before you let things be. Life is never perfect and duties are never
        finished. Don't even think on how you can make this more perfect.
        Letting be is having the courage to sit quietly and rest the mind in the
        midst of imperfection, in spite of unfinished business. Let it be for
        now. The time for gardening work will come later.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Letting Be Can Become Quite Powerful</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Letting be meditation can become quite
        powerful. If your breath meditation is not working, if Metta meditation
        doesn't work, or you try any other type of meditation and it's not
        working, very often it's because you haven't got the foundation correct.
        So just do the letting be meditation. You can just &quot;sit out in the
        garden&quot; and just let things be. Whatever is happening, that's O.K.
        Whatever I'm experiencing is fine -- no preference, no choice, no good,
        no bad, no argument and no commentary. &quot;Just let things be.&quot;
        You can have a little bit of a commentary inside but just the commentary
        about &quot;Let be&quot;, &quot;Let things go&quot;. Just be with what
        is; i.e. just be with the commentary that is about the meditation
        subject, but not about anything else. That way the meditation becomes
        close to complete silent awareness of the present moment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You can use that meditation as I use it:
        if I'm in pain, got a headache or a stomachache or whatever other ache I
        have, or if the mosquitoes are biting. &quot;Just let it be.&quot; Don't
        argue with it. Don't get upset about it. Just watch the feelings in the
        body as the mosquito pushes its nose into your flesh followed by the
        itch that comes. &quot;Just let things be.&quot; Lying in bed at night
        and you can't go to sleep. &quot;Let it be.&quot; Or there's a pain that
        won't go away. &quot;Just let it be.&quot; Just be with it. &quot;Just
        let it be.&quot; Don't try running away. It's like the demons have come
        into the room. You're not going to try and push them away. You're not
        going to invite them to stay either. You're just going to let them be.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is equanimity; this is the practice
        of letting be. And it is one of the other meditations that I do from
        time to time. It can be a useful addition to your repertoire.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Walking Meditation</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Walking meditation is beautiful,
        especially in the early morning. Often when one gets up early in the
        morning, in particular when you're not used to getting up early, you're
        quite tired and the mind isn't bright. One of the advantages of walking
        meditation is that you can't nod while you're walking. You don't snore
        either! You're awake because you have to be. So if you're tired, walking
        meditation is very good to do. It brings up some energy, and also you
        can get very peaceful.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Walking meditation was both praised and
        practised by the Buddha. If you read the <i>Suttas</i>, (the teachings
        in the <i>Pali</i> Canon), you find that the Buddha would usually walk
        meditation in the early morning. He wouldn't be sitting, he'd be
        walking.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many monks and nuns became enlightened
        on the walking meditation path. It's a very effective way of developing
        both calm and insight (but not to the extent of <i>Jhana</i>). For some
        monks that I know in Thailand, their main practice is walking
        meditation. They do very little sitting. They do a lot of walking, and
        many get tremendously powerful insights while they're walking.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another benefit of walking meditation is
        that it is especially suitable for those who have physical discomfort in
        sitting for long periods. If you find it difficult to sit meditation
        because of pains in the body, walking meditation can be very effective.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So please don't look at walking
        meditation as a &quot;second class&quot; meditation. If you want to
        spend most of your meditation time this way, please do so. But do it
        well, do it carefully. See if you can develop that happiness born of
        serenity as you're walking backwards and forwards.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Setting Up Walking Meditation</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Choose a clear, straight path between
        twenty and thirty paces long. This can be a corridor in a house, a path
        in the garden or just a track on the grass. Use whatever is available,
        even if it's a bit less than twenty paces long. If it's comfortable to
        do so, walk without shoes, enjoying the contact of your bare feet on the
        ground.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Stand at one end of your path. Compose
        the mind. Relax the body and begin walking. Begin walking back and forth
        at a pace that seems natural to you. While you are walking, place your
        hands comfortably in front of you, and rest your gaze on the ground
        about two metres in front of you. Be careful not to look around. If
        you're doing walking meditation, it's a waste of time to look over here
        and look over there, because that would just distract the attention from
        the feet, where it should be.</font></p>

        attention eventually comes to rest on the foot rather than the breath.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">At first, aim to develop present moment

        the state of just walking, easily, in the here-and-now. When you feel
        that you have settled into the present moment, where business to do with
        the past and future is absent from the mind, then aim to develop silent
        walking in the present moment. Just as in Stage Two as described in
        Chapter Two, gradually let go of all thinking. Walk without commentary.
        Make use of some of the techniques described in &quot;The Basic
        Method&quot; to reach this stage of silent walking. Thus you begin
        walking meditation by developing the same two initial stages as with
        sitting meditation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once the inner commentary has slowed to
        a bare trickle of inner speech, deliberately focus your attention on the
        feeling of movement in the feet and lower legs. Do so to the extent that
        you clearly notice every step on the path. Know every left step, know
        every right step – one after the other without missing one. Know every
        step as you turn around at the end of the path. The famous Chinese
        proverb of the &quot;Journey of one thousand miles&quot; is helpful
        here. Such a journey is in fact only one step long -- that step which
        you are walking now. So, just be silently aware of this &quot;one
        step&quot; and let everything else go. When you have completed ten
        return trips up and down the path without missing one left step and
        without missing one right step, then you have fulfilled Stage Three of
        the walking meditation and may proceed to the next stage.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the attention increases you notice
        every feeling of movement in the left step, from the very beginning when
        the left foot starts to move and lift up from the ground. Notice as it
        goes up, forward, down and then rests on the ground again, taking the
        weight of the body. Develop this continuous awareness of the left step
        and then similar smooth, unbroken awareness of the right step. Do this
        throughout every step to the end of the path. Then as you turn around
        notice every feeling in the turning-around movement, not missing a
        moment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you can walk for fifteen minutes or
        more comfortably sustaining the attention on every moment of walking,
        without a single break, then you have reached the Fourth Stage of
        walking meditation, full awareness of walking. At this point the process
        of walking so fully occupies the attention that the mind cannot be
        distracted. You know when this happens because the mind goes into a
        state of <i>Samadhi </i>(Sustained Attention) and becomes very peaceful.</font></p>
        <b><i><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Samadhi</font></font></i><font color="#00007f"><font face="Times New Roman">
        on the Walking Path</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even the sound of the birds disappears
        as your attention is fully taken up with the experience of walking. Your
        attention is easily concentrated on one thing, sustained on one thing,
        settled on one thing. You will find this a very pleasant experience
        indeed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As your mindfulness increases, you get
        to know more and more of the sensations of walking. Then you find that
        walking does have this sense of beauty and peace to it. It becomes a
        &quot;beautiful step&quot;. And it can very easily absorb all your
        attention because you become fascinated and peaceful, just putting all
        your attention on walking. You can get a great deal of <i>Samadhi</i>
        through walking meditation in this way. That <i>Samadhi</i> is a sense
        of peacefulness, a sense of stillness, a sense of the mind just being
        very comfortable and very peaceful in it's corner of the world.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I started my walking meditation when I
        first ordained as a monk in a temple in Thailand. I would choose a path,
        and quite naturally, without forcing it, I'd walk very slowly. (You
        don't need to walk fast; you don't need to walk slow; just do what feels
        comfortable). I used to get into beautiful <i>Samadhi</i> states during
        walking meditation. I recall once being disturbed because I'd been
        walking too long. I hadn't noticed the time pass, and I was needed to go
        to a ceremony in this temple in Bangkok. One of the monks had been sent
        to go and get me. And I recall this monk came up to me and said,
        &quot;Brahmavamso, you've got to come to a <i>Dana</i>&quot;. I was
        looking at a space about two meters in front. My arms were in front of
        me, and my hands folded. When I heard that, it was as if hearing it from
        a thousand miles away, because I was so absorbed into what I was doing.
        He repeated, &quot;Brahmavamso, you have to come now&quot;. It took me
        about one minute to actually lift my head from the ground and to turn it
        around to the side where this senior monk was trying to get my
        attention. And as I met his eyes, all I could say was
        &quot;Pardon?&quot; It took such a long time to get out of that <i>Samadhi</i>
        and actually do anything quickly. The mind was so cool and so peaceful
        and so still.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I hope you experience this peacefulness
        for yourselves when you try walking meditation. Many people I've taught
        walking meditation to for the first time have said: &quot;Wow! This is
        amazing. This is beautiful&quot;. Just slowing down, you get into peace.
        You're getting into calm by just watching the sensations as you walk. So
        this is one other type of meditation that I am suggesting to you, giving
        to you to experiment with.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Choosing the Right Meditation for the
        Right Time</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes people ask when one should do
        which meditation. How do you choose what to do? A first, you should
        experiment with doing different meditations at different times.
        Eventually you'll develop the wisdom which knows what your mind is like
        and what your mind needs. Observing is the way to find out what type of
        meditation to do.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes your practice is like working
        with a piece of wood from the wood yard. You want to make some
        furniture, say a meditation stool. The first thing you do is to look at
        the piece of wood. Usually, it needs to be planed down initially, and
        then you apply the roughest grade of sandpaper, then a medium grade,
        then a fine grade of sandpaper. After that you get out a polishing cloth
        with some wax or some oil; or if you want to, you coat it with varnish
        instead. But if you use a cloth, you use it only at the end, after
        you've used the finest sandpaper and the wood is really smooth. Only
        then do you get the cloth out and polish it up. This way it ends up as
        this beautiful, shiny, smooth piece of furniture. But you have to
        examine the piece of wood first of all. If you get a piece of wood from
        the wood yard just freshly sawn with all of the burrs on it and you get
        the polishing cloth out straight away, you're going to ruin a lot of
        polishing cloths. And you're not going to make that wood smooth at all.
        In meditation this is like trying to go too deep too fast.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you look at your mind and it's really
        rough and coarse and you want to go straight onto the <i>Samadhi Nimitta</i>,
        then you're wasting your time. You've got to get the &quot;plane&quot;
        and the &quot;sandpaper&quot; out first of all. Sometimes it is the case
        that you get a piece of wood from the shop that is just so smooth
        already, that all you need to do is to use the polishing cloth.
        Sometimes you may sit down on that cushion and the mind is already so
        peaceful that you don't need to go through all the preliminaries. You
        just go straight onto the breath, straight onto the beautiful breath,
        sometimes even straight onto the <i>Samadhi Nimitta</i>! So you look at
        your &quot;piece of wood&quot; -- your mind. The skillful meditator in
        you knows what it needs. If it needs loving-kindness, O.K., spend a few
        minutes doing loving-kindness meditation. If it needs some &quot;letting
        be&quot; meditation because it's quite coarse, just &quot;take it out to
        the garden&quot; and let it be. You know what it needs by looking at
        your mind and by recognising the state of the mind. This is similar to
        the insight practice of meditation that I'll say more about in the next
        chapter. You recognise the problems, and you know the solutions.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Conclusion</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So these are just some types of
        meditation. There's a whole range of other types of meditation that I
        could discuss, but this is enough to practise for now. Just to sum up: I
        talked about Metta meditation. (Please do some, it is very important and
        you'll find it'll help the other meditations that you do.) I've
        discussed &quot;letting be&quot; meditation. And I've discussed walking
        meditation. Hopefully these ways of practice will help you, as well as
        sitting meditation. Try them out; see how they go. Also see if they
        don't spill over into your daily life with wonderful effects.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whatever You Are Doing, Do It With
        Everything You've Got</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I'll finish this chapter with one last
        story. I was with a teacher in Thailand for over nine years, quite a
        famous teacher in the world of Buddhism. An Australian man told one of
        his teachings to me many years after the teacher, Ajahn Chah, had
        stopped teaching. I never heard these instructions myself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The man had gone to visit Ajahn Chah in
        the north east of Thailand, which was a difficult place to get to. He
        made a special journey, and when he got to this place -- some seven
        hundred kilometres from Bangkok -- he found that Ajahn Chah was
        surrounded with people. The man was on the outskirts of these people
        trying to ask the questions which he wanted to ask of this wise old
        monk, but he found that there was no way he was going to be able to
        catch his attention. There were just too many people.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The man had arranged for a taxi to come
        back and pick him up later to take him to the station to get the train
        back to Bangkok -- an all night journey. The taxi wasn't going to come
        back for another hour. He knew he wasn't going to see the teacher and
        ask his profound questions. He saw some monks sweeping the paths in the
        monastery and he thought, &quot;Well I've come all this way, I might as
        well do something useful&quot;. He picked up a broom and started to
        sweep. He was sweeping the leaves from the path when he felt a hand on
        his shoulder. He turned around, and to his surprise and delight it was
        the teacher, Ajahn Chah. Ajahn Chah had seen this westerner coming and
        not having a chance to ask any questions, but unfortunately Ajahn Chah
        had only left the big group around him because he had another
        appointment himself. A car was waiting for him. So he just gave this
        young Australian man a very simple teaching. He told him, &quot;If you
        are going to sweep, sweep with one hundred percent of what you've
        got&quot;. Then he went away.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This man remembered this teaching that
        if you're going to sweep, sweep with everything you've got. And he
        realised this was more than a teaching on how to keep the monastery
        clean. It was a teaching on how to live life. If you're going to
        meditate, meditate with everything you've got; if you're going to write
        a letter, write with everything you've got. If you're going to brush
        you're teeth, wash your car, take an exam, make that telephone call,
        speak with a person near you, give them everything you've got.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the way of Buddhist meditation.
        It's not that hard! Try walking meditation; you'll find it's easy. Learn
        meditation on the breath, and you'll find that easy too. Whatever you do
        in life: instead of doing it half-heartedly, quarter-heartedly or
        one-eighth-heartedly, give it everything you've got, and you will find
        that life will start to come together./.</font></p>

        we practise meditation it benefits not only ourselves, it brings
        happiness to many others as well. The calmer and more peaceful we
        become, the more we can give to others. If there's no peace in our
        hearts, how can we give peace to anyone else? So when it comes to
        practising compassion, meditation is one of the kindest things that we
        can do for others. If we've built up some beautiful energy through
        meditation, then it is time to share that energy with other beings,
        recognizing that there is a connection between us all. What we do in our
        own meditation and practise does have a profound effect on all other
        beings throughout the universe. So this is why I will now describe a
        guided loving-kindness meditation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because this is a guided meditation, it
        might be better to experience it as the spoken word rather than the
        written word. Therefore you may want someone to read the instructions to
        you or perhaps better yet to actually tape record your own guided
        meditation. When guiding, it's important to pause from time to time, and
        good places to do this are indicated in square brackets throughout the
        text.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">First of all, sit down comfortably in a
        quiet place, close your eyes and give permission to your mind to let go
        of all burdens. Allow your mind to let go of all past and future,
        remembering that you deserve some peace. Be kind enough to grant
        yourself the gift that is the present. Be now, be gently. Now be kind to
        your body making sure it's comfortable. Being so careful, because that
        is what careful means, &quot;full of care.&quot; See to it that even
        little things like your toes are all cared for to make sure they are
        comfortable. Go through each part of the body, relaxing the body and
        offering it some gratitude, some thanks, for allowing you to sit
        meditation. Sometimes you may have been quite hard on your body, but now
        thank it for giving you the opportunity to be at peace. Let's care for
        this body, show it respect. Relax the body into a soft state of ease so
        it becomes a fine vehicle for loving kindness meditation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Take a few minutes just to experience
        the body and bring it to ease.</font></p>

        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now let's do a little bit of breath
        meditation. Begin with this breath which is feeding you the oxygen which
        brings all this good energy into the body. Show gratitude for this
        breath as it brings all this energy in, giving light, giving warmth, and
        giving that energy to each part of your body. Imagine the breath coming
        in and bringing golden light to every part of your body and then taking
        out all the used gases. Giving out into the world, as someone said, as a
        gift for the flowers and the trees that take the carbon dioxide as food.
        Breathing in with gratitude, with care, and breathing out as a gift to
        nature. Breathing in and out naturally with a sense of kindness and
        warmth towards this breath, giving a sense of kindness and warmth and
        gratitude towards this present moment. This present moment is giving you
        so much happiness and wisdom. Say thank you, to &quot;now&quot;.</font></p>

        upon your breath in that silence as if it were a child born of your own
        body, a part of you, something which you caress with your mindfulness,
        with softness, with warmth, with care. Trust in that loving attention of
        mindfulness as you once trusted as a young child in the arms of your
        mother. Be unworried, unconcerned for the future, just as if you were a
        baby in the arms of your mother -- being walked backwards and forwards
        with the breath, backwards and forwards as the breath goes in and the

        meditation. Choose an object in the mind's eye -- imagining a baby, a
        small kitten, a puppy or whatever object you can bring up into your mind
        through imagination. Choose an object towards which you find it easy to
        generate feelings of warmth, of love, of care. As you visualise that
        being in front of you, imagine it has only one person in this world to
        look after it and to care for it -- you. If it were not for you, that
        small baby, kitten or puppy would surely die - would die of hunger and

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">See if you can look that being in the

        after you, feed you, protect you and love you no matter what happens. I
        will always be there for you&quot;. As you bring that small kitten,
        puppy or baby into your arms close to your chest, still keeping that eye
        contact, feel the small being giving you back love, trust, kindness.
        Using whatever words, ideas, commentary which you can bring up, generate
        more kindness and care, more love towards that small being, such as
        saying to that imaginary being: &quot;The door of my heart is always
        open to you. No matter what you ever do I will never take away my love,

        that loving kindness -- unbounded and unconditioned -- to that small

        give that love it creates this beautiful warmth, this golden light of
        loving-kindness. Just dwell on that imaginary being until that warmth
        and that flow of loving-kindness towards that kitten, puppy or baby is
        just so strong, as if that being is not imaginary at all but is real.
        Give it your wholehearted love, care and protection. &quot;May you be
        happy and well forever. I truly care. Whatever you do, wherever you go,
        I will always give you my love.&quot;</font></p>

        child, a parent or a close friend. Bring them up in front of you,
        imagining them in your mind's eye, knowing that they too are fragile.
        Without your love and your care, they too will hurt, they too will

        warmth of loving kindness. It's as if you allow that golden glow to
        grow, to reach that person so close to you, to go all around them like a
        halo. Let the golden glow bathe them and give them energy, happiness and
        health. Stay with that glow. Say in your mind, &quot;I wish you
        happiness and well-being; may you be at peace; may all suffering end for
        you.&quot;</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now as you give that unconditional
        loving kindness towards your chosen person, allow that feeling of
        unconditional loving kindness to grow brighter and even more beautiful.
        Pause for a while. Just enjoy the feeling.</font></p>

        has disappeared too. Without opening your eyes imagine a whole group of
        people, perhaps all the people in the house you are in. Develop the
        caring glow of <i>Metta</i> around them all. &quot;May you all be happy
        and well…&quot; See if you can imagine <i>Metta</i> to be a golden
        radiance coming from a beautiful white lotus flower in the middle of
        your heart. Give loving kindness to all the beings in your home (or
        other group), all the visible and the invisible beings. Give your loving
        kindness to all these fellow beings. Say to yourself: &quot;I truly wish
        you all happiness and peace. The door of my heart in this moment and
        forever is always open to you; no matter what you ever do, you will
        always be my friends. I give my care to you, all my love, and my
        kindness. If there is anything I can do to ease your pain, it is my
        privilege to do so&quot;. Bathe all the beings in your group in this
        increasingly splendid golden glow of loving kindness, &quot;seeing&quot;
        a halo around each person joining into a beautiful golden fire of care
        and goodwill and gratitude to all of them. As this golden glow of
        loving-kindness grows even greater, pause every now and again to feel
        what it's like inside you.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As you give selfless love towards
        others, you find there is a beautiful warm peace inside your own heart,
        a silence, an energy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Give that golden glow your attention
        once more and spread it out beyond the group you have chosen, to all the
        people in the city or town where you live. To all the people in your
        city or town today who are suffering, who know no peace, who are having
        arguments at home, who are lost and alone, never really appreciating or
        knowing love. Know their emptiness; fill it with your own love. Give
        that golden glow indiscriminately around the whole of the city or town.
        &quot;May all these beings be happy and well. May they feel the same
        peace that I'm feeling now, and may they feel the same acceptance and
        security that I am feeling now. I give this golden light of love as a
        gift, to all beings in this city or town. May you all be happy and well.
        May you all be at peace. May you all have health and joy in your
        hearts.&quot;</font></p>

        glow wider and wider. Spread it to all the people in your home country.
        As it gets wider and wider, as it goes over the whole of this planet, it
        gets more beautiful. Say to yourself: &quot;May all beings -- human,
        animal and invisible -- may all beings be happy. We are all friends in <i>Samsara,</i>
        in perpetual wandering from lifetime-to-lifetime; all beings are subject

        a gift. I give you my love; the door of my heart will always be open to
        all beings. I wish you well. I wish you peace, sincerely, with all my

        yourself: &quot;The door to my heart is open to me. I give myself my
        love, come inside.&quot; Then say this to your own image, &quot;I wish
        you all happiness and well-being; whatever faults you have I forgive.
        The door of my heart is open to me no matter what I have ever
        done.&quot; Give unconditional love to this being inside, who we call
        &quot;me.&quot; Say to yourself: &quot;I allow myself to be happy. I
        give myself permission to be free. May I be Enlightened. May I be at
        peace, free from all suffering.&quot; Give yourself that beautiful
        warmth of love and kindness, indiscriminate, unconditional. Bathe
        yourself with the golden glow of <i>Metta</i>. Keep with that feeling of
        loving-kindness as long as you like. Enjoy it. Abide in it.</font></p>

        the lotus, gently close the petals, guarding the seed of <i>Metta</i>
        within your heart, ready to be released in your next <i>Metta</i>
