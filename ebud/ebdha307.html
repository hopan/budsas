        <P><I>This article has published in Pali Literature of South-East Asia 
        (Singapore: Singapore Buddhist Meditation Centre, 1993), pp.1-9. This

      <P><FONT SIZE="6">F</FONT>rom time immemorial, peoples in Asia have 
      migrated from their original homelands and sought places where they could 
      live in peace and security, far from the strife and enmity of neighbouring 
      tribes and this is also true of the people we know today as the Thais. The 
      word<I> Thai</I> means<I> free</I> and at the beginning of the second 
      century B.C. their long migration from the valleys between the Huang Ho 
      and Yangtze Kiang in China began in earnest.<A NAME="1"></A><A HREF="#01">[1]</A> 
      They moved ever southwards because of conflicts with neighbouring tribes 
      and one group called<I> Thai Yai</I> (literally<I> Big Thai</I>) moved to 
      what are now the Shan States, to the plains of the Salween River and other 
      areas and as far afield as modern Assam. The<I> Thai Noi</I> (which means<I> 
      Small Thai</I>) reached present-day Thailand. It is quite easy to trace 
      the language affinity of the Thais who now live in Assam, Upper Burma, 
      Southern China, Laos and North Vietnam, the Shan States and Thailand 
      itself. </P>
      <P>Archaeological finds show that Buddhism first reached Thailand when it 
      was inhabited by the Mon-Khmer, whose capital, Dvaravati, (now called 
      Nakon Pathom, or in Sanskrit,<I> Nagara Prathama</I>) was about fifty 
      kilometers to the west of Bangkok. There was a vast pagoda which was 
      called Phra Pathom Chedi, (<I>Pathama Cetiya</I>) and other archaeological 
      finds have been discovered nearby. Some scholars say that Buddhism was 
      brought to Thailand by missionaries of the Emperor Asoka, two of whom were 
      the<I> theras</I> Sona and Uttara who went to<I> Suvannabhumi</I> (the 
      Golden Land or Land of Gold).<A NAME="2"></A><A HREF="#02">[2]</A> 
      According to the Pali Chronicles, this had been decided at the end of the 
      Third Council, held in the seventeenth year of Asoka&#39;s reign, under 
      presidency of the Arahant Moggaliputta Tissa. The chronicles mention that 
      each of the missions was to consist of five<I> theras</I> so that it would 
      be possible to perform the<I> Upasampada</I> ceremony.<A NAME="3"></A><A HREF="#03">[3]
      </A>Some identify<I> Suvannabhumi</I> with Burma and others with the 
      Hiranyavati district along the Sona river. But the many artefacts found in 
      Thailand around Nakon Pathom show that it was almost certainly modern-day 
      Thailand. </P>
      <P>The conversion of Asoka to Buddhism, as now acknowledged by the world 
      of scholarship, was a tremendous help to the<I> Buddhasasana</I>. Some 
      scholars, however, maintain that Buddhism came to Thailand much later than 
      Asoka&#39;s missionaries did. </P>
      <P>The first form of Buddhism to reach Thailand was that of the Theravada 
      and this is borne out by the many historical remains which were found at 
      Nakon Pathom. Among these were rock inscriptions in Pali, the Buddha 
      footprints and seats and the<I> Dharma-Chakra</I> or Wheel of Law. All of 
      these had, of course, existed in India before images of the Buddha were 
      introduced as a result of Greek influence.<A NAME="4"></A><A HREF="#04">[4]</A> 
      It is highly likely from archeological evidence that Buddhism reached 
      Thailand in the third century B.C. in more or less the same form as that 
      propagated by Asoka. Many Buddha images were found in Nakon Pathom&#39;s ruins 
      and in other cities and on looking at their styles, it can be assumed that 
      early missionaries went there from Magadha in Bihar.<A NAME="5"></A><A HREF="#05">[5]
      </A>The Great Stupa (Phra Pathom Chedi) can be compared with Sanchi. </P>
      <P>The name Pathom Chedi, which in Pali is<I> Pathama Cetiya</I>, means 
      &#39;First Pagoda&#39; which could mean that it was in fact the first pagoda to be 
      built in<I> Suvannabhumi</I> and would corroborate the fact that the<I> 
      theras</I> Sona and Uttara established Buddhism in Thailand under Emperor 
      Asoka&#39;s direction. The Mauryan Emperor Asoka reigned from<I> circa</I> 269 
      to 237 B.C. and during this period through his emissaries and traders, 
      Indian culture with languages and religious works gradually started to 
      spread to South-East Asia. The epigraphic records often contain the 
      Emperor&#39;s willingness to establish a righteous empire. Evidently the 
      earliest Buddhist scriptures must have reached Asian kingdoms from India 
      in the third century B.C. </P>
      <P>Mahayana or Northern Buddhism was also spreading, and it flourished in 
      Northern India under King Kanishka in the second half of the first century 
      A.D., notably, and went to Sumatra, Java and Kambuja (Cambodia). Possibly 
      it went from Magadha in Bihar to Burma and Pegu (Lower Burma) and to West 
      Thailand as well as to Malaya. Many Mahayana Buddhist missionaries went to 
      Sumatra Kashmir and by 757 A.D. the Srivijaya king spread his large empire 
      throughout the Malay peninsula and islands as well as to Southern Thailand 
      from Surasthani southwards. </P>
      <P>Today, in Southern Thailand, there is much evidence showing that 
      Mahayana Buddhism was established there and the<I> cetiyas</I> in Chaiya 
      (Jaya) and Nakon Sri Thammarath (<I>Nagara Sri Dharmaraja</I>) indicate 
      this. Many other<I> stupas</I> and<I> cetiyas</I> were found with votive 
      tablets of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas (<I>Phra Phim</I>) and all are of 
      the same type as those found in Java and Sumatra. Some scholars think that 
      as Mahayana Buddhism had spread to China by the beginning of the Christian 
      era, the Thais in their original home (in china) may have already come 
      into contact with it their. From 1002 to 1182 in Cambodia, there ruled the 
      Suryavarman dynasty of kings who were Mahayana Buddhists and they also 
      propagated this with a strong admixture of Brahminism. A rock inscription 
      tells of a king in Nakon Sri Thammarath in around 1017 who traced his 
      ancestry back to the Srivijaya rulers and this inscription is now in the 
      National Museum at Bangkok. He ruled at Lopburi in central Thailand and 
      his son became king of Cambodia. </P>
      <P>An inscription was found in the Cambodian language in a Brahmanic 
      Temple near Lopburi and this Brahmanic culture survives in Thailand today 
      with evidence that the religions and cultures of Thailand and Cambodia 
      intermingled for a very considerable time. Sanskrit became deeply rooted 
      from about 1020, and Thai scrips, based on Cambodian scripts, which 
      derived their origins from India, were invented by King Ram Kamhaeng of 
      Sukhothai (Sukhodaya in Northern Thailand), when, after considerable 
      struggles, that independent state was founded in 1257 A.D. (B.E. 1800).
      </P>
      <P>King Anawrata (Anuruddha) of Burma had his capital in central Burma at 
      Pagan in 1057 and he invaded northern Thailand, his kingdom covering 
      Chiengmai, Lopburi and Nakon Pathom.<A NAME="6"></A><A HREF="#06">[6]</A> 
      Unfortunately, contact between India and Burma was rather poor and 
      Buddhism in India was in decline, so the doctrine underwent some changes 
      and became what is known in Thailand as Pagan Buddhism. This was strongest 
      in the north, and relics found there show strong Theravada influence, 
      whereas in the south the Burmese were content to leave their Khmer 
      (Cambodian) vassals, who made Lopburi their capital city, as its rulers. 
      As the Thais on their long migration southwards grew in numbers and 
      strength, they finally gained control of the land after Anawrata&#39;s death 
      when his kingdom declined. Le May says, &quot;We have a definite contact 
      between the Burmese in the west and the Thai in the east and north, and, 
      with the growth and spread of Hinayana Buddhism in Burma it is most 
      probably from the middle of the eleventh century that the Thai of northern 
      Siam and the intervening region began to be influenced by the form of 
      religion introduced at this time into upper Burma.&quot;<A NAME="7"></A><A HREF="#07">[7]</A>
      </P>
      <P>During King Anawrata&#39;s reign, the king of Ceylon, vijaya Bahu I 
      (1055-1110) asked for Buddhist monks to come and bring Buddhist scripture 
      with them, to revive the pure form of Higher Ordination in Ceylon. King 
      Anawrata agree to the Sinhalese king&#39;s request and sent both monks and 
      scripture to Ceylon, in return receiving a duplicate of the Tooth Relic.<A NAME="8"></A><A HREF="#08">[8]</A> 
      There were close relations with North and West Thailand and this led to 
      exchanges of art and culture and matters concerned with religion. In 
      Ceylon under King Parakrama-Bahu (<I>circa</I> 1165) there was a great 
      revival of Buddhism and a Council was called. Monks from Thailand went to 
      Ceylon to study Theravada literature and ceremonies and in the next 
      century monks like these returned to Srithammarat, where they built a<I> 
      cetiya</I> in the Sinhalese style. Upon this news reaching Sukhothai 
      (Sukhodaya) these monks were asked to come to that northern capital to 
      establish Theravada Buddhism as the state religion. There is a stone 
      inscription of King Ram Kamhaeng (1292 A.D.) which records the 
      introduction of Sinhaese Buddhism and the existence of the old school 
      which came by way of Burma and the new school of<I> Araññavasi</I> monks 
      from Ceylon. King Parakrama-Bahu the Great of Sri Lanka (1164-1197) had 
      accomplished the important task of purifying the Sasana and of 
      re-organising the Buddhist Order and, as a result of this, Theravada 
      Buddhism reached the apex of its glory in the island<A NAME="9"></A>.<A HREF="#09">[9]</A> 
      Le May states that Ceylon was twice unsuccessfully invated in 1230 and 
      1256 during the reign of King Parakrama-Bahu II, by a King called 
      Chandrabhanu who tried to obtain possession of a miraculous statue of the 
      Buddha to take to Thailand. It is recorded that Buddhism from Sri Lanka 
      spread to northern and central Thailand during the reign of King 
      Maha-dharmaraja Lithai, the fifth monarch of Sukhodaya dynasty (1347-1376) 
      and in the reign of King Kuna (1367-1388) Buddhism from Sri Lanka spread 
      to northern kingdom too.<A NAME="10"></A><A HREF="#010">[10]</A> It is 
      thus quite clear that by the middle of the fourteenth century, the books 
      of Pali literature with Sinhalese Buddhist traditions and practices were 
      firmly established in the heart of Siam and it received a member of new 
      impulses direct from Ceylon up to the sixteenth century. </P>
      <P>After King Ram Kamhaeng, the political power of Sukhothai (Sukhodaya) 
      declined and it succumbed to the might of Ayudhya.<A NAME="11"></A><A HREF="#011">[11]
      </A>But Sukhodayan monks went to study at Ayudhya and Ayudhyan monks went 
      to Sukhodaya. Finally Sukhodaya was annexed to Ayudhya in the reign of 
      King Boromaraja I (1370-1388). Ayudhya remained the centre of Buddhism in 
      Thailand for over 400 years until 1767. </P>
      <P>In 1423 A.D., seven<I> theras</I> and other monks went from Thailand to 
      Sri Lanka and stayed there for several years, returning to their homeland 
      with some Sinhalese monks to establish a<I> nikai</I> or fraternity which 
      was later held in high regard for its strict rules and observances.<A NAME="12"></A><A HREF="#012">[12]</A> 
      In 1750, King Kienti (Kirthi) Sri Rajasingha of Sri Lanka asked King 
      Baromakot and the Patriarch for some Thai monks to come and correct the 
      rites and ceremonies of the sinhalese monks and Sangha and to establish a 
      valid Ordination service. Eighteen monks went to Sri Lanka and ordained 
      seven hundred monks and three thousand novices in a period of under three 
      years, and established the still existing Siamese fraternity or sect.<A NAME="13"></A><A HREF="#013">[13]</A>
      </P>
      <P>The Ninth Buddhist Council was held in 1788 in Bangkok and its purpose 
      was to collect and amend the existing Buddhist texts.<A NAME="14"></A><A HREF="#014">[14]</A> 
      Ayudhya had been captured by the Burmese in 1767 and the libraries of 
      temples and palaces had been destroyed in the subsequent fire and pillage. 
      Countless thousands of Buddhist texts and manuscripts and historical 
      documents were burnt and destroyed. Phya Tak Sin liberated Thailand from 
      the Burmese, establishing his capital at Thonburi, across the river from 
      Bangkok, and in 1769 his army captured Srihammarat in southern Thailand 
      which the Burmese had not touched. He managed to collect many Buddhist 
      texts and brought them to his capital as he wanted to restore the Tipitaka 
      to its entirety. Unfortunately, he died long before the work could be 
      completed and his wish fulfilled. Every effort has been made since then to 
      obtain a pure text for the Thai version of the Pali Tipitaka. </P>
      <P>King Rama I or Phra Buddha Yot Fa succeeded him and continued the 
      labour of collecting the Tipitaka and he called a Council of two hundred 
      and thirty monks and thirty[?] royal pundits who were to edit the texts 
      which had been assembled. They all met for the first time at Wat Mahadhatu 
      in Bangkok on November 12th, 1788 and it took them five months to complete 
      the task. The work was entitled &#39;The Council edition of the Tipitaka&#39; or 
      &#39;The Edition of the First Masters&#39; and it consisted of a total of 3,568 
      packets of palm-leaves which were sorted into 157 books of the Suttanta, 
      40 books of Vinaya, 56 books of the Abhidhamma, and 35 books of 
      Saddavisesa. The last was a dictionary of Pali terms which were used in 
      studying the three sections of the Pitaka. During the reign of King Rama 
      I, two additional copies were made for examination purposes and so that 
      temples would be able to make copies for their own students and for their 
      libraries as well as for teaching and disseminating the Dhamma.<A NAME="15"></A><A HREF="#015">[15]</A> 
      King Rama I was the first king of the present Thai dynasty called the 
      Chakri Dynasty. The present king, Phumipol Adulyadet, has reigned from 
      1946. </P>
      <P>Later on, a further seven copies were made in the reign of Rama III 
      Phra Nang Klao (1824-1851). These editions were made when King Mongkut 
      (King Rama IV -- Phra Chom Klao) was then Prince Buddhavajiranana and was 
      in the robe. He was able to undertake supervision of the revision of the 
      texts and he secured forty volumes of sacred writings from Sri Lanka for 
      use in making recensions of existing Thai texts in 1843. In 1844, these 
      were then returned and a further thirty volumes were borrowed for the same 
      reason. The King, Rama III wanted to have a Thai translation made of the 
      Tipitaka (which was in Pali) and he started on the task by having all 
      those who preached from the Dhamma translate into Thai the parts which 
      they used in their sermons when teaching. But it was not until much later 
      on that the Tipitaka was printed. The Ninth Council had been held in 1788 
      and about a hundred years later, the king Chulalonkorn (1868-1910), 
      proposed that the Tipitaka be put into print for the first time ever.<A NAME="16"></A><A HREF="#016">[16]</A>
      </P>
      <P>Before this huge commission was started, the higher Sangha members made 
      a final version of the Tipitaka in its entirety. </P>
      <P>A full comparison was also made of Sinhalese, Cambodian and Mon 
      manuscripts in order to make a true text in as pure a form as possible, 
      and in 1893, the complete Tipitaka was printed in Pali, using Thai 
      characters. This took place during the twenty-fifth year of the king&#39;s 
      reign. </P>
      <P>One thousand monks took part in a three-day religious festival to 
      celebrate the occasion and the edition was of a thousand copies. Each 
      royal temple in the country received a set and many were sent abroad and 
      the rest sold. Thailand thus printed the very first standard and complete 
      edition of the Tipitaka in the Pali language. King Rama VI also wanted a 
      Buddhist book to be distributed as his memorial at his cremation. King 
      Prajadhipok (Phra Pok Klan 1925-1935), chose the Tipitaka and entrusted 
      the task of reprinting it to the Prince Patriarch. Subscriptions poured in 
      and 590,514 baht were collected. In fact, it cost only 237,449 baht, so 
      the balance was set aside for future editions. On 26th November, 1930, a 
      special service was held to commemorate the printing of this 
      forty-five-volume set of the Tipitaka in an edition of 1,500 copies and in 
      the Rayal Library there are now 15 editions or recensions of the Tipitaka, 
      thirteen of which are on palm-leaves whilst two are on paper. These are 
      the printed editions of 1893 and 1928. </P>
      <P>For many centuries, as we have seen, Buddhism has been firmly 
      entrenched in the hearts and minds of the vast majority of the people of 
      Thailand and it has deeply enriched their lives. It may indeed be said 
      that, without it, life in Thailand would not be as it is today. It is 
      probably the only country where the king is constitutionally a Buddhist 
      and an upholder of Buddhism and it is one of the countries where Buddhism 
      remains a living and dynamic force for the well-being and happiness of the 
      world. </P>
