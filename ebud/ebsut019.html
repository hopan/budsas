This is the third article in the series about the Vinaya, the
body of monastic rules and traditions binding on every Buddhist
monk and nun. In this article I will discuss the four <I>Parajika</I>
- the disrobing offences.
<P>
The core of the monastic discipline is a list of rules called
the Patimokkha. In the bhikkhu-patimokkha (for the monks) there
are 227 rules, while in the bhikkhuni-patimokkha (for the nuns)
there are 311 rules. The first four rules in the patimokkha, for
both monks and nuns, are the <B>four <I>Parajika</I></B>. The word <B><I>parajika</I></B>
(in the ancient Indian language called Pali) is usually translated
as <B><I>'making the doer defeated'</I></B>. In effect it means that the offender
<B>MUST DISROBE</B>. No ceremony or trial is required. From the instant
the transgression is completed, the perpetrator automatically
loses his or her status as a Buddhist monk or nun. Obviously these
four rules were considered by the Buddha to be extreme violations
of the spiritual ethic and a major obstacle in the path to enlightenment.
They considered such gross behaviour on the part of a monk or
nun that the penalty of disrobal was for life! Such a one could
not simply re-ordain after a period of grace.
<P>
The four transgressions which incur a <I>Parajika</I>, the penalty
of automatic disrobal, are as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Engaging in sexual intercourse with another being of either
sex.
<P>
2. Stealing something of value (which includes smuggling, cheating
or deliberately avoiding payment of a tax).
<P>
3. Purposely killing a human being or encouraging him or her to
commit suicide (this includes inciting another to murder somebody
and it also includes convincing a woman to have an abortion.
<P>
4. Boasting that one has realised a high spiritual attainment,
knowing that one is lying. For example, claiming to be enlightened,
to be Maitreya Buddha, to have entered Jhana (deep meditation-ecstasy)
or that one can read minds when one knows that one hasn't reached
any of these states.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Should any monk or nun do any of these then you may know them
as no longer holding the status of Buddhist monk or nun. They
must disrobe. Should they attempt to hide their transgression
and not disrobe then it is said that the bad karma produced is
extreme indeed!
<P>
In these four disrobing offences there is no excuse for ignorance.
In a story related in the Buddhist scriptures [1], a newly ordained
monk who had not as yet been instructed in the Vinaya was cajoled
by his former wife into having sexual intercourse with her. When
he told the other monks of this, they approached the Buddha and
asked what should be done. The Buddha decreed that the offending
monk had to disrobe and in future all monks were to be told of
the Four Things Not to be Done, the <B>four <I>Parajika</I></B>, immediately
after they have been ordained. Indeed, instructing the new monk
in these four rules has now become part of the Ordination Ceremony
itself. So there can be no excuse! <BR>
