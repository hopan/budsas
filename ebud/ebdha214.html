        three main schools of Buddhism have been identified. These are
        Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana. While this threefold classification
        is useful it does not encompass the totality of schools and approaches
        that one encounters in Buddhism, both in the historical past as well as
        today. For instance the term Mahayana covers a variety of schools
        ranging from Pure Land Buddhism to Zen. Vajrayana usually refers to
        Tibetan Buddhism, but even here we have a number of traditions and
        lineages. In contrast to this diversity it was thought that Theravada
        referred to a single and definitive strain of Buddhism, that which
        recognised the Pali Canon as authoritative. Unfortunately this is not
        the case. First of all there is no complete agreement on what texts
        should be considered Canonical, and even if there is scholars have
        identified a number of strata in the Pali Canon. This article seeks to
        explore some of the strains of Theravada Buddhism that we encounter.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">A digression into the historical origin
        of Theravada may be useful. During the Buddhas lifetime the only
        schismatic movement was that initiated by Devadatta, but with the
        downfall of Devadatta this vanishes from the record. Thus at the time of
        the Buddha's death there was no schisms in the ranks of his disciples.
        So when three months after the death of the Buddha the Dhamma-Vinaya was
        rehearsed at the First Council held at the Saptaparna Cave near Rajagaha
        there was complete agreement. The Canon that was agreed to at this
        Council probably included only the Vinaya Pitaka and parts of the Sutta
        Pitaka. The latter probably included the first four Nikayas of the Pali
        Canon (the Digha, the Majjhima, the Anguttara and the Samyutta) with
        some of the books in the Khuddhaka Nikaya like the Suttanipata and the
        Dhammapada. They became the core of the Theravada Canon. There was a
        rapid expansion of Buddhism from its cradle in North-Central India first
        to Western India in the first century after the death of the Buddha,
        then to the South and the North-West. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to historians of Buddhism the
        term Theravada first arose in the disputes which arose about a hundred
        years after the Buddha's death. The first of these disputes related to
        the validity of certain Vinaya of practices indulged in by some monks in
        Central India. Some ten practices were involved, some of them rather
        trivial (like keeping salt in a horn) while others were more substantial
        (like accepting gifts of gold and silver). The Second Council was
        convened at Vesali to settle this issue. The views of the monks who
        opposed the new practices and reiterated the old Vinaya came to be known
        as the Theravada (&quot;Doctrine of the Elders&quot;). Thus no doctrinal
        issues were at stake in the Second Council and the Canon of the First
        Council was again recited to reiterate its validity. Even though the
        Theravada view became the official view of the Second Council a
        substantial number of monks continued to hold on to the new practices,
        and they came to be known as the Mahasanghika.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another issue of greater doctrinal
        importance are the five points raised by Mahadeva. Four of these
        questioned the attainments of the <i>arhat</i> which was the Theravada
        ideal. Mahadeva claimed that arhats may be sexually tempted, had not
        eliminated ignorance completely, had doubts and would not have reached
        enlightenment by their own effort. In addition he advanced the notion of
        instantaneous enlightenment. These are reminiscent of later Mahayana
        views but at this stage it is still too early to speak of Mahayana.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Following Mahadeva Indian Buddhism
        entered the great schismatic period. The two earlier divisions of
        Theravada and Mahasanghika each generated several schools. None of these
        however can be identified with the later Mahayana. In fact scholars
        usually refer to them as the &quot;Hinayana schools&quot;. The exact
        number of schools have been variously counted. Some eighteen schools are
        identified in the Theravada literature as contesting one or the other of
        its doctrines and practices. The French scholar Bareau names some
        thirty-four schools.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The emergence of these new views
        together with the continuing violation of Vinaya rules by monks led to
        the convening of the Third Council during the reign of King Asoka.
        Moggaliputta Tissa Thera who was the leading monk behind this Council
        wrote the <i>Kathavattu </i>to refute the new views put forward, and the
        monks violating the Vinaya were expelled from the Sangha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was during the Third Council that the
        final version of the Pali Canon was compiled. It added a whole new
        Pitaka (the Abhidhamma) as well as several new books the Khuddhaka
        Nikaya. It is this enlarged Canon which was taken to Sri Lanka by the
        Arahat Mahinda in 246 BCE. It was committed to writing in Sri Lanka in
        the year 110 BCE at the Aluvihara Monastery, thus freezing it for all
        time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whether the original Buddhism should be
        confined only to the Dhamma-Vinaya or whether it should include the
        entirety of the Pali Canon as it now stands has been the subject of some
        debate. The term Theravada is sometimes used to denote the Canon as it
        emerged in the Third Council, while the Canons of the First and Second
        Canon are sometimes referred to as original (or primitive) Buddhism. If
        this is so then Theravada is not identical to original Buddhism, but it
        could be argued that none of the material introduced in the Third
        Council is in direct contravention of the the Dhamma-Vinaya established
        earlier.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In India itself new Pali texts came to
        be composed long after the Third Council. These include the <i>Milindapanha</i>,
        which is highly regarded by Theravadins, and in Burma is actually
        included in the Canon. After this Theravada Buddhism entered a phase of
        decline in India. However by this time Theravada Buddhism had been
        established in Sri Lanka. It was here that the Canon was first comitted
        to writing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">With the compilation of the
        commentaries, mainly through the efforts of Buddhaghosa Theravada
        Buddhism entered a new phase. The classic statement of Theravada as it
        stood at this time is contained in the <i>Visuddhimagga</i> (The Path to
        Purity) also written by Buddhaghosa Thera. This represents the final
        form of Theravada. &nbsp;</font></p>
