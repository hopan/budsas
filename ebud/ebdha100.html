<blockquote>
  <p>Buddhism teaches to, and expects from, its followers a certain level of ethical
  behaviour. The minimum that is required of the lay Buddhist is embodied in what is called
  the Five Precepts (panca sila), the third of which relates to sexual behaviour. Whether or
  not homosexuality, sexual behaviour between people of the same sex, would be breaking the
  third Precept is what I would like to examine here. </p>
  <p>Homosexuality was known in ancient India; it is explicitly mentioned in the Vinaya
  (monastic discipline) and prohibited. It is not singled out for special condemnation, but
  rather simply mentioned along with a wide range of other sexual behaviour as contravening
  the rule that requires monks and nuns to be celibate. Sexual behaviour, whether with a
  member of the same or the opposite sex, where the sexual organ enters any of the bodily
  orifices (vagina, mouth or anus), is punishable by expulsion from the monastic order.
  Other sexual behaviour like mutual masturbation or interfemural sex, while considered a
  serious offense, does not entail expulsion but must be confessed before the monastic
  community. </p>
  <p>A type of person called a pandaka is occasionally mentioned in the Vinaya in contexts
  that make it clear that such a person is some kind of sexual non-conformist. The Vinaya
  also stipulates that pandakas are not allowed to be ordained, and if, inadvertently, one
  has been, he is expelled. According to commentary, this is because pandakas are &quot;full
  of passions, unquenchable lust and are dominated by the desire for sex.&quot; The word
  pandaka has been translated as either hermaphrodite or eunuch, while Zwilling has recently
  suggested that it may simply mean a homosexual. It is more probable that ancient Indians,
  like most modern Asians, considered only the extremely effeminate, exhibitionist
  homosexual (the screaming queen in popular perception) to be deviant while the less
  obvious homosexual was simply considered a little more opportunistic or a little less
  fussy than other 'normal' males. As the Buddha seems to have had a profound understanding
  of human nature and have been remarkably free from prejudice, and as there is not evidence
  that homosexuals are any more libidinous or that they have any more difficulties in
  maintaining celibacy than heterosexuals, it seems unlikely that the Buddha would exclude
  homosexuals per se from the monastic life. The term pandaka therefore probably does not
  refer to homosexuals in general but rather to the effeminate, self-advertising and
  promiscuous homosexual. </p>
  <p>The lay Buddhist is not required to be celibate, but she or he is advised to avoid
  certain types of sexual behaviour. The third Precept actually says: <em><strong>'Kamesu
  micchacara veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami.'</strong></em> The word kama refers to any
  form of sensual pleasure but with an emphasis on sexual pleasure and a literal translation
  of the precept would be <em><strong>&quot;I take the rule of training (veramani
  sikkhapadam samadiyami) not to go the wrong way (micchacara) for sexual pleasure
  (kamesu)&quot;</strong></em>. What constitutes &quot;wrong&quot; will not be clear until
  we examine the criteria that Buddhism uses to make ethical judgments. </p>
  <p>No one of the Buddha's discourses is devoted to systematic philosophical inquiry into
  ethics such as one finds in the works of the Greek philosophers. But it is possible to
  construct a criterion of right and wrong out of material scattered in different places
  throughout the Pali Tipitaka, the scriptural basis of Theravada Buddhism. The Buddha
  questioned many of the assumptions existing in his society, including moral ones, and
  tried to develop an ethics based upon reason and compassion rather than tradition,
  superstitions and taboo. Indeed, in the famous Kalama Sutta he says that revelation
  (anussana), tradition (parampara), the authority of the scriptures (pitakasampada) and
  one's own point of view (ditthinijjhanakkhanti) are inadequate means of determining right
  and wrong. </p>
  <p>Having questioned the conventional basis of morality, the Buddha suggests three
  criteria for making moral judgments. The first is what might be called the
  universalisability principle - to act towards others the way we would like them to act
  towards us. In the Samyutta Nikaya he uses this principle to advise against adultery. He
  says: &quot;What sort of Dhamma practice leads to great good for oneself?... A noble
  disciple should reflect like this: 'If someone were to have sexual intercourse with my
  spouse I would not like it. Likewise, if I were to have sexual intercourse with another's
  spouse they would not like that. For what is unpleasant to me must be unpleasant to
  another, and how could I burden someone with that?' As a result of such reflection one
  abstains from wrong sexual desire, encourages others to abstain from it, and speaks in
  praise of such abstinence.&quot; </p>
  <p>In the Bahitika Sutta, Ananda is asked how to distinguish between praiseworthy and
  blameworthy behaviour. He answers that any behaviour which causes harm to oneself and
  others could be called blameworthy while any behaviour that causes no harm (and presumably
  which helps) oneself and others could be called praiseworthy. The suggestion is,
  therefore, that in determining right and wrong one has to look into the actual and
  possible consequences of the action in relation to the agent and those affected by the
  action. The Buddha makes this same point in the Dhammapada: &quot;The deed which causes
  remorse afterwards and results in weeping and tears is ill-done. The deed which causes no
  remorse afterwards and results in joy and happiness is well-done.&quot; This is what might
  be called the consequential principle, that behaviour can be considered good or bad
  according to the consequences or effects it has. </p>
  <p>The third way of determining right and wrong is what might be called the instrumental
  principle, that is, that behaviour can be considered right or wrong according to whether
  or not it helps us to attain our goal. The ultimate goal of Buddhism is Nirvana, a state
  of mental peace and purity and anything that leads one in that direction is good. Someone
  once asked the Buddha how after his death it would be possible to know what was and was
  not his authentic teaching and he replied: &quot;The doctrines of which you can say:
  'These doctrines lead to letting go, giving up, stilling, calming, higher knowledge,
  awakening and to Nirvana' - you can be certain that they are Dhamma, they are discipline,
  they are the words of the Teacher.&quot; </p>
  <p>This utilitarian attitude to ethics is highlighted by the fact that the Buddha uses the
  term kusala to mean 'skillful' or 'appropriate' or its opposite, akusala, when evaluating
  behaviour far more frequently than he uses the terms punna, 'good', or papa, 'bad'. The
  other thing that is important in evaluating behaviour is intention (cetacean). If a deed
  is motivated by good (based upon generosity, love and understanding) intentions it can be
  considered skillful. Evaluating ethical behaviour in Buddhism requires more than
  obediently following commandments, it requires that we develop a sympathy with others,
  that we be aware of our thoughts, speech and actions, and that we be clear about our goals
  and aspirations. </p>
  <p>Having briefly examined the rational foundations of Buddhist ethics we are now in a
  better position to understand what sort of sexual behaviour Buddhism would consider to be
  wrong or unskillful and why. The Buddha specifically mentions several types of unskillful
  sexual behaviour, the most common of which is adultery. This is unskillful because it
  requires subterfuge and deceit, it means that solemn promises made at the time of marriage
  are broken, and it amounts to a betrayal of trust. In another passage, the Buddha says
  that someone practicing the third Precept &quot;avoids intercourse with girls still under
  the ward of their parents, brothers, sisters or relatives, with married women, with female
  prisoners or with those already engaged to another.&quot; Girls still under the protection
  of others are presumably too young to make a responsible decision about sex, prisoners are
  not in a position to make a free choice, while an engaged woman has already made a
  commitment to another. Although only females are mentioned here no doubt the same would
  apply to males in the same position. </p>
  <p>As homosexuality is not explicitly mentioned in any of the Buddha's discourses (more
  than 20 volumes in the Pali Text Society's English translation), we can only assume that
  it is meant to be evaluated in the same way that heterosexuality is. And indeed it seems
  that this is why it is not specifically mentioned. In the case of the lay man and woman
  where there is mutual consent, where adultery is not involved and where the sexual act is
  an expression of love, respect, loyalty and warmth, it would not be breaking the third
  Precept. And it is the same when the two people are of the same gender. Likewise
  promiscuity, license and the disregard for the feelings of others would make a sexual act
  unskillful whether it be heterosexual or homosexual. All the principles we would use to
  evaluate a heterosexual relationship we would also use to evaluate a homosexual one. In
  Buddhism we could say that it is not the object of one's sexual desire that determines
  whether a sexual act is unskillful or not, but rather the quality of the emotions and
  intentions involved. </p>
  <p>However, the Buddha sometimes advised against certain behaviour not because it is wrong
  from the point of view of ethics but because it would put one at odds with social norms or
  because its is subject to legal sanctions. In these cases, the Buddha says that refraining
  from such behaviour will free one from the anxiety and embarrassment caused by social
  disapproval or the fear of punitive action. Homosexuality would certainly come under this
  type of behaviour. In this case, the homosexual has to decide whether she or he is going
  to acquiesce to what society expects or to try to change public attitudes. In Western
  societies where attitudes towards sex in general have been strongly influenced by the
  tribal taboos of the Old Testament and, in the New Testament, by the ideas of highly
  neurotic people like St. Paul, there is a strong case for changing public attitudes. </p>
  <p>We will now briefly examine the various objections to homosexuality and give Buddhist
  rebuttals to them. The most common Christian and Muslim objection to homosexuality is that
  it is unnatural and &quot;goes against the order of nature&quot;. There seems to be little
  evidence for this. Miriam Rothschild, the eminent biologist who played a crucial role in
  the fight to decriminalize homosexuality in Britain, pointed out at the time that
  homosexual behaviour has been observed in almost every known species of animal. Secondly,
  it could be argued that while the biological function of sex is reproduction, most sexual
  activity today is not for reproduction, but for recreation and emotional fulfillment, and
  that this too is a legitimate function of sex. This being so, while homosexuality is
  unnatural in that it cannot lead to reproduction, it is quite natural for the homosexual
  in that for her or him it provides physical and emotional fulfillment. Indeed, for him or
  her, heterosexual behaviour is unnatural. Thirdly, even if we concede that homosexuality
  &quot;goes against the order of nature&quot;, we would have to admit that so do many other
  types of human behaviour, including some religious behaviour. The Roman Catholic Church
  has always condemned homosexuality because of its supposed unnaturalness - but it has long
  idealized celibacy, which, some might argue, is equally unnatural. Another Christian
  objection to homosexuality is that it is condemned in the Bible, an argument that is
  meaningful to those who accept that the Bible is the infallible word of God, but which is
  meaningless to the majority who do not accept this. But while there is no doubt that the
  Bible condemns homosexuality, it also stipulates that women should be socially isolated
  while menstruating, that parents should kill their children if they worship any god other
  than the Christian God and that those who work on the Sabbath should be executed. Few
  Christians today would agree with these ideas even though they are a part of God's words,
  and yet they continue to condemn homosexuality simply because it is condemned in the
  Bible. </p>
  <p>One sometimes hears people say: &quot;If homosexuality were not illegal, many people,
  including the young, will become gay.&quot; This type of statement reflects either a
  serious misunderstanding about the nature of homosexuality or perhaps a latent
  homosexuality in the person who would make such a statement. It is as silly as saying that
  if attempted suicide is not a criminal offense then everyone will go out and commit
  suicide. Whatever the cause of homosexuality (and there is great debate on the subject),
  one certainly does not 'choose' to have homoerotic feelings in the same way one would, for
  example, choose to have tea instead of coffee. It is either inborn or develops in early
  childhood. And it is the same with heterosexuality. Changing laws does not change people's
  sexual inclinations. </p>
  <p>Some have argued that there must be something wrong with homosexuality because so many
  homosexuals are emotionally disturbed. At first there seems to be some truth in this. In
  the West, at least, many homosexuals suffer from psychological problems, abuse alcohol,
  and indulge in obsessive sexual behaviour. As a group, homosexuals have a high rate of
  suicide. But observers have pointed out that such problems seem to be no more pronounced
  amongst African and Asian homosexuals than they are in the societies in which they live.
  It is very likely that homosexuals in the West are wounded more by society's attitude to
  them than by their sexual proclivity, and, if they are treated the same as everybody else,
  they will be the same as everybody else. Indeed, this is the strongest argument for
  acceptance and understanding towards homosexuals. </p>
  <p>Christianity grew out of and owes much to Judaism with its tradition of fiery prophets
  fiercely and publicly denouncing what they considered to be moral laxity or injustice.
  Jesus was very much influenced by this tradition, as have been the Christian responses to
  public and private morality generally. At its best, this tradition in Christianity to
  loudly denounce immorality and injustice has given the West its high degree of social
  conscience. At its worst, it has meant that those who did not or could not conform to
  Christian standards have been cruelly exposed and persecuted. The Buddhist monk's role has
  always been very different from his Christian counterpart. His job has been to teach the
  Dhamma and to act as a quiet example of how it should be lived. This, together with
  Buddhism's rational approach to ethics and the high regard it has always given to
  tolerance, has meant that homosexuals in Buddhist societies have been treated very
  differently form how they have been in the West. In countries like China, Korea and Japan
  where Buddhism was profoundly influenced by Confucianism, there have been periods when
  homosexuality has been looked upon with disapproval and even been punishable under the
  law. But generally the attitude has been one of tolerance. Matteo Ricci, the Jesuit
  missionary who lived in China for twenty-seven years from 1583, expressed horror at the
  open and tolerant attitude that the Chinese took to homosexuality and naturally enough saw
  this as proof of the degeneracy of Chinese society. &quot;That which most shows the misery
  of these people is that no less than the natural lusts, they practise unnatural ones that
  reverse the order of things, and this is neither forbidden by law nor thought to be
  illicit nor even a cause for shame. It is spoken of in public and practiced everywhere
  without there being anyone to prevent it.&quot; In Korea the ideal of the hwarang (flower
  boy) was often associated with homosexuality especially during the Yi dynasty. In Japan, a
  whole genre of literature (novelettes, poems and stories) on the love between samurais and
  even between Buddhist monks and temple boys developed during the late mediaeval period. </p>
  <p>Theravada Buddhist countries like Sri Lanka and Burma had no legal statutes against
  homosexuality between consenting adults until the colonial era when they were introduced
  by the British. Thailand, which had no colonial experience, still has no such laws. This
  had led some Western homosexuals to believe that homosexuality is quite accepted in
  Buddhist countries of South and South-east Asia. This is certainly not true. In such
  countries, when homosexuals are thought of at all, it is more likely to be in a
  good-humored way or with a degree of pity. Certainly the loathing, fear and hatred that
  the Western homosexual has so often had to endure is absent and this is due, to a very
  large degree, to Buddhism's humane and tolerant influence. </p>
