    face="Times New Roman">n the 'Maha-Mangala-Sutta' (The Greatest Blessings, Sutta-Nipata
    II, 4, Khuddaka Nikaya) we read that a deva came to see the Buddha when he was staying at
    Anathapindika's monastery in the Jeta Grove, and asked him what the greatest blessings
    were.&nbsp;In reply the Buddha spoke to him about the greatest blessings.&nbsp;All the
    blessings of a life full of Dhamma are to be found in this sutta.&nbsp;We read: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">Not to associate with the foolish, but to
      associate with the wise; and to honour those who are worthy of honour- this is the
      greatest blessing. </font></em></p>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">To reside in a suitable locality, to have
      done meritorious actions in the past and to set oneself in the right course- this is the
      greatest blessing. </font></em></p>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">To have much learning, to be skilful in
      handicrafts, well-trained in discipline, and to be of good speech- this is the greatest
      blessing. </font></em></p>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">To support mother and father, to cherish
      wife and children, and to be engaged in peaceful occupation- this is
      the&nbsp;&nbsp;greatest blessing. </font></em></p>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">To be generous in giving, to be righteous
      in conduct, to help one's relatives, and to be blameless in action- this is the greatest
      blessing. </font></em></p>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">To loathe evil and abstain from it, to
      refrain from intoxicants, and to be steadfast in virtue- this is the greatest blessing. </font></em></p>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">To be respectful, humble, contented and
      grateful; and to listen to the Dhamma on due occasions- this is the greatest blessing. </font></em></p>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">To be patient and obedient, to associate
      with monks and to have religious discussion on due occasions - this is the greatest
      blessing. </font></em></p>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">Self-restraint, a holy and pure life, the
      perception of the Noble Truths and the realisation of Nibbana- this is the greatest
      blessing. </font></em></p>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">A mind unruffled by worldly conditions,
      from sorrow freed, from defilements cleansed, full of peace- this is the greatest
      blessing. </font></em></p>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">Those who thus abide, ever remain
      invincible, in happiness established. These are the greatest blessings.</font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">'Not to associate with the foolish, but to
    associate with the wise; and to honour those who are worthy of honour' are the first
    blessings. The last blessings, which are the blessings of the arahat, cannot be attained
    if one does not have the first blessings. If one does not know the right conditions for
    enlightenment, nibbana cannot be realised. There are four conditions for
    enlightenment,&nbsp;the first of which is, association with the 'righteous person; the
    second, listening to Dhamma; the third, 'wise consideration' of Dhamma; and the fourth,
    practising Dhamma&nbsp;(Samyutta Nikaya, Maha-vagga, Kindred Sayings on Stream-winner,
    Chapter I, par. 5). We cannot hear Dhamma, investigate the truth of it and practise it,
    unless we have met the right person who can point out to us the way to the Buddha's
    teachings. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Do we want to associate with foolish people
    or with wise people? Is it of no use to apply ourselves to mental development it we do not
    scrutinize ourselves first with regard to this question. We do not inclined to associate
    with people who have the same ideas and the same likes and dislikes as ourselves. Our
    inclinations are like elements; they arise by conditions. The same elements attract each
    other. We read in the 'Niddana-vagga' (Samyutta Nikaya, Kindred Saying on Elements,
    Chapter XIV, par 14): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">Through an element it is, monks, that
      beings flow together, meet together. Beings of low tastes flow together, meet together
      with them of low tastes. They of virtuous tastes flow together, meet together with them of
      virtuous tastes. So have they done in the past. So will they do in the future. So do they
      now in the present.</font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When we are together with someone for a long
    time we cannot help being influenced by him. If we have foolish friends, who do not know
    the value of kusala, who act and speak in an unwholesome way, it is to our detriment. We
    may not notice that we are under their influence, but gradually&nbsp;we may find ourselves
    following their ways. If we have friends who know the value of kusala, who are generous,
    perform good deeds and speak in a wholesome way, it encourages us to more wholesomeness.
    The Buddha often pointed out the dangers of evil friendship and the benefit of righteous
    friendship. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Fools do not know what is wholesome and what
    in unwholesome. They praise what should not be praised and do not give honour to those who
    should be honoured. For example, high esteem is given to the most beautiful woman in the
    country or the world, or to persons who have the greatest skill in the field of sports, or
    to the best actor or musician. Should we disapprove of people who have beauty, strength or
    skill? We cannot force ourselves not to admired them, but if we have right understanding
    fo kusala and akusala, we will know whether it is wholesome or unwholesome to be attached
    to beauty, strength and skill. We will know whether these things lead to the welfare of
    ourselves and others or not. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">How confused is our life when we have not
    heard about Dhamma. We do not know what is wholesome and what is unwholesome; we do not
    know about cause and effect in life. When we suffer we do not understand why it had to
    happen to us. In everyone's life there are experiences of gain and loss, honour and
    dishonour, praise and blame, happiness and misery. These are called in the teachings the
    eight 'worldly conditions' ( lokadhamma). </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Anguttara Nikaya' (Book of
    the Eights, Chapter I, par. 5): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">Monks, these eight worldly conditions
      obsess the world; the world resolves around these eight worldly conditions.&nbsp;What
      eight? <br>
      &nbsp;Gain and loss, fame and obscurity, blame and praise, contentment and pain....</font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">How susceptible we are to those worldly
    conditions.&nbsp;We are so sensitive to the way other people treat us.&nbsp;We attach
    great importance to whether we receive blame or praise and whether we are honoured or
    not.&nbsp;If we do not receive the honour we think is due ot us we feel slighted. We have
    feelings of bitterness towards those who teat us badly.&nbsp;If we do not make the career
    in life we were hoping for, or if work is assigned to us which we consider to be beneath
    our dignity, we feel frustrated.&nbsp;There are many things which make us feel irritated,
    depressed or angry.&nbsp;Is there ever a day when everything goes according to our wishes
    for the whole day, a day full of perfect happiness?&nbsp;When we do not have right
    understanding we are obsessed by the 'worldly conditions'; we are foolish people. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha pointed out the dangers of being
    enslaved to these worldly conditions.&nbsp;To what does this lead?&nbsp;It leads to an
    unhappy rebirth.&nbsp;Devadatta, who caused a schism in the order and separated from it
    with five hundred monks, was a fool; he was obsessed by the worldly conditions and
    corrupted by evil friendship.&nbsp;We read in the 'Anguttara Nikaya' (Book of the Eights,
    Chapter I, par. 7, Devadatta) that the Buddha spoke to the monks, while he was staying on
    Vulture's Peak, not long after the departure of Devadatta: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">...Monks, mastered by eight wrong states,
      Devadatta, with his mind out of control, became one doomed to suffer in hell, in
      perdition, dwelling there a kalpa irreprievable. <br>
      &nbsp;By what eight? <br>
      &nbsp;Mastered by gain... by loss... by fame... by obscurity... by honour... by lack of
      honour... by evil intention... by evil friendship, with his mind out of control, Devadatta
      became one doomed to suffer in hell, in perdition, dwelling there a kalpa,
      irreprievable...</font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Fools like Devadatta who are obsessed by
    worldly conditions cannot teach Dhamma.&nbsp;They want others to follow them
    blindly.&nbsp;They do not lead people to the Buddha's teachings so that they can
    investigate the truth for themselves.&nbsp;If we associate with fools we cannot develop
    right understanding about our life.&nbsp;We will become more obsessed by the 'worldly
    conditions' and there will be no way for us to eradicate defilements. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, 'Teacher of devas and men',
    taught out of compassion for the world, not in order to have 'gain, honour and praise' in
    return.&nbsp;He pointed out that it is the Dhamma that is important, not the person who
    teaches it.&nbsp;We read in the 'Samyutta Nikaya' (Khandha-vagga, Kindred Sayings on
    Elements, Middle Fifty, Chapter IV, par. 87, Vakkali) about Vakkali who was sick and who
    had been longing for a long time to set eyes on the Buddha.&nbsp;The Buddha came to see
    him and taught him Dhamma; he pointed out to Vakkali the impermanence of all conditioned
    things, so that he could cultivate the eightfold Path.&nbsp;Vakkali then said to the
    Buddha: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">'For a long time, lord, I have been
      longing to set eyes on the Exalted One, but I had not strength enough in this body to come
      to see the Exalted One.' <br>
      &nbsp;'Hush, Vakkali! What is there in seeing this vile body of mine?&nbsp;He who see
      Dhamma, Vakkali, he sees me: he who sees me, Vakkali, he sees Dhamma.&nbsp;Verily, seeing
      Dhamma, Vakkali, one sees me: seeing me, one sees Dhamma. <br>
      &nbsp;As to this what do you think, Vakkali?&nbsp;Is body permanent or impermanent?' <br>
      &nbsp;'Impermanent, lord.' <br>
      &nbsp;'Wherefore, Vakkali, he who thus sees... he knows &quot;...for life in these
      conditions there is no hereafter&quot;.'</font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The wise person does not want others to
    follow him blindly, but he helps them in such a way that they can realize the truth
    themselves, without being dependent on him; this is the most effective way one can help
    others.&nbsp;He leads them directly to the Buddha's teachings and encourages them to study
    the 'Tipitaka' (Vinaya, Suttanta and Abhidhamma).&nbsp;Then they can have 'wise
    consideration' of the teachings and verify Dhamma themselves.&nbsp;He points out the way
    by which they can realize for themselves the perception of impermanence.&nbsp;The aim of
    the Buddha's teachings is to see things as they are.&nbsp;So long as we do not see things
    as they are we take for happiness what is not happiness, we take for permanent what is
    impermanent, we take for self what is not self. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Samyutta Nikaya'
    (Salayattana-vagga, Kindred Sayings on Sense, First Fifty, Chapter III, par. 26,
    Comprehension): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">Without fully knowing, without
      comprehending the all, monks, without detaching himself from, without abandoning the all,
      a man is incapable of extinguishing Ill. <br>
      &nbsp;Without fully knowing, without comprehending, without detaching himself from,
      without abandoning what (all) is a man incapable of extinguishing Ill? <br>
      &nbsp;It is by not fully knowing the eye...objects... eye-consciousness... eye-contact...
      that pleasant or unpleasant or indifferent feeling ... the ear... sound... the nose...
      odour... the tongue... savours... the body... touches... the mind... mind-objects... that
      a man is incapable of extinguishing Ill.&nbsp;This is the all, monks, without fully
      knowing which ... a man is so incapable. <br>
      &nbsp;But by fully knowing, by comprehending, by detaching himself from, by abandoning the
      all, one is capable of extinguishing Ill.</font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha pointed out time and again the
    impermanence of seeing, hearing and all the other realities which we experience through
    the six doors, in order to remind people to be aware of the seeing at this moment, of the
    hearing at this moment.&nbsp;If we are not mindful of the seeing-consciousness which
    appears at the present moment or of the other realities appearing now, we will not have a
    precise knowledge of their characteristics and thus we will not be able to see them as
    they are.&nbsp;The wise person does not teach a Dhamma which is different from the
    Buddha's teachings.&nbsp;He does not point out things which do not lead to the
    goal.&nbsp;He does not discourage people from study and he does not discourage them from
    being mindful.&nbsp;He encourages them to be mindful of the reality appearing at the
    present moment, no matter where they are and no matter what they are doing.&nbsp;It is
    essential to find out whether the person with whom we associate is the right friend in
    Dhamma or not.&nbsp;If he is not the right person he cannot point out to us the way to see
    things as they are.&nbsp;We will know that he is the right person if he helps us to know
    the characteristic of seeing which appears now, of hearing which appears now, and of the
    other realities which present themselves through the six doors.&nbsp;This is the way the
    Buddha taught as the one and only way to eradicate the concept of self, to see things as
    they are.&nbsp;When there is less attachment to the concept of self we know from our own
    experience that association with the wise is the greatest blessing. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">To honour those who are worthy of honour is
    the greatest blessing.&nbsp;The Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha are worthy of
    honour.&nbsp;The wise person who taught us the development of the eightfold Path is worthy
    of honour.&nbsp;How can we honour those who are worthy of honour in the most appropriate
    way?&nbsp;We feel deep gratitude to the Buddha and we want to give expression to our
    gratitude.&nbsp;We can honour him by following his last words: 'Transient are all the
    elements of being! Strive with earnestness!' (Maha-Parinibbana-sutta, Digha
    Nikaya).&nbsp;We should not be heedless.&nbsp;We are not heedless if we are mindful at
    this moment and there would be no way to eradicate defilements at all.&nbsp;The whole
    purpose of the teachings is the eradication of defilements through the development of
    wisdom.&nbsp;Therefore, each moment of mindfulness is the highest possible form of respect
    to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">'To reside in suitable location' is the
    greatest blessing.&nbsp;We cannot meet the good friend in Dhamma in just any place; wise
    people are rare in the world.&nbsp;It is a great blessing to live in a country where
    Dhamma is taught and practised, so that we have an opportunity to know the Buddha's
    teachings.&nbsp;There are many things that have to coincide in order that we meet the
    right person.&nbsp;It not by mere chance that we meet him; it is conditioned by kamma. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When we meet a wise person we may not be
    ready to receive Dhamma.&nbsp;It may not be the right time for us to listen to Dhamma; we
    may not be capable yet of 'wise consideration' of the teachings.&nbsp;Accumulations of
    wholesome deeds are very helpful for making us ready&nbsp;for the receiving of
    Dhamma.&nbsp;'To have done meritorious deeds in the past' is the greatest blessing. We
    read in the 'Thera-Theri-gatha' that the men and women in the Buddha's time who attained
    enlightenment had accumulated meritorious deeds for&nbsp;aeons and that they had listened
    to Dhamma preached by Buddhas of former times.&nbsp;We read about Subha (Commentary to the
    'Theri-gatha,' Canto XII, 70, Subbha, Paramattha-Dipani Thera-Theri-gatha Atthakatha): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">She, too, having made her resolve under
      former Buddhas, and accumulating good of age-enduring efficacy, so that she had
      progressively planted the root of good and accumulated the conditions of emancipation,
      was, in this Buddha era reborn at Rajagaha...</font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When we see the many conditions necessary for
    wisdom to reach maturity we will be less inclined to think that it is self who develops
    the eightfold Path.&nbsp;When we read about the accumulated good 'of age-enduring
    efficacy' of men and women in the Buddha's time and when we consider how they had listened
    time and again to Dhamma preached by former Buddhas, before they met the Buddha Gotama and
    attained enlightenment, we are reminded not to be heedless at the present time. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The 'Maha-Mangala-sutta' tells us about the
    blessings of a life full of Dhamma.&nbsp;We read about loving-kindness in the relationship
    between parents and children, between husband and wife, between relatives.&nbsp;We read
    about self-restraint, a holy and pure life.&nbsp;When we read these words we may feel
    discouraged and think that we shall never be able to practise what the Buddha
    taught.&nbsp;We would like to have less lobha, dosa and moha; but can we force ourselves
    not to be attached to pleasant things, not to be disturbed by unpleasant things?&nbsp;We
    cannot force ourselves to b 'righteous in conduct', 'to abstain from evil', 'to be
    steadfast in virtue'.&nbsp;Will all these blessings of a life full of Dhamma ever be
    attainable? </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">As long as there is the concept of self there
    will be no end to lobha, dosa and moha.&nbsp;Our many defilements are the real cues of the
    'dukkha' in our life, day after day.&nbsp;We should be clear in our mind as to what we
    really want in our life: do we want to accumulate more defilements or do we want to have
    less defilements?&nbsp;If we want to eradicate defilements we should develop the eightfold
    Path.&nbsp;When there is mindfulness of nama and rupa the notion of self will be gradually
    eradicated.&nbsp;With the development of the eightfold path a radical change comes into
    our life. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught Maha-satipatthana (the
    Applications of Mindfulness) to monks, nuns, laymen and women layfollowers.&nbsp;As
    regards the life of the monks, the Vinaya should not be separate from
    Maha-satipatthana.&nbsp;In the Buddha's time the Vinaya and Maha-satipatthana were not
    separated.&nbsp;We read in the 'Maha-Mangala-sutta' that one of the greatest blessings is
    'To be well-trained in the discipline' (Vinaya).&nbsp;The Commentary to this sutta
    (Paramatthajotika, to the Sutta-Nipata) speaks about the discipline of the layman
    (abstinence from the ten immoral actions) and about the discipline of the
    monk.&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk who develops the eightfold Path will have a deeper understanding
    of the Vinaya and he will observe the rules more perfectly.&nbsp;Each detail of the Vinaya
    is full of meaning, because the rules support the welfare of the Sangha and help the monk
    to lead a pure life; the rules help him to be considerate in his speech and actions, to
    cause no trouble to others.&nbsp;The Vinaya teaches the monk to be watchful in body,
    speech and mind.&nbsp;When one develops mindfulness there is watchfulness as regards the
    six doors.&nbsp;When there is mindfulness of nama and rupa we are less infatuated by what
    we see, hear, smell, taste, touch and perceive through the mind-door.&nbsp;We learn to
    know our subtle defilements and the danger of even these defilements.&nbsp;The monk who
    develops mindfulness will have a deeper respect for the rules of the Vinaya which remind
    him to be watchful, seeing danger in even the slightest faults.&nbsp;Thus we see that
    Vinaya and Maha-satipatthana should not be separated. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The monk who develops the eightfold Path and
    attains enlightenment will not leave the order any more and return to the 'lower
    life'.&nbsp;We read in the 'Samyutta Nikaya' (Maha-vagga, Book I, Chapter VI, par. 12)
    that the Buddha spoke by way of simile about the monk who will not return to the layman's
    life; he said that the river Ganges, tending towards the east, cannot be made to change
    its course and tend towards the west.&nbsp;We read: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman">Just so, monks, if the rajah's royal
      ministers or his friends or boon companions or kinsmen or blood relatives were to come to
      a monk who is cultivating and making much of the ariyan eightfold way, and were to seek to
      entice him with wealth, saying: 'Come, good man! Why should these yellow robes torment
      you?&nbsp;Why parade about with shaven crown and bowl?&nbsp;Come!&nbsp;Return to the lower
      life and enjoy possessions and do deeds of merit.'- for that monk so cultivating and
      making much of the ariyan eightfold way, return to the lower life is impossible.&nbsp;Why
      so?&nbsp;Because, monks, that monks heart has for many a long day been bent on detachment,
      inclined to detachment, turned towards detachment, so that there is no possibility for him
      to return to the lower life....</font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The eightfold Path changes the lives of monks
    and laypeople.&nbsp;It changes the relationship between parents and children, husband and
    wife, relatives and friends.&nbsp;There is bound to be attachment and displeasure or anger
    in one's relationship with others, but when we develop mindfulness there are more
    conditions for alobha (generosity) instead of lobha, for adosa (kindness) instead of
    displeasure or anger.&nbsp;When other people treat us badly there is less the concept of a
    self who suffers or the concept of another person who treats us badly.&nbsp;There are only
    nama and rupa arising by conditions; there is not this or that person.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are
    less susceptible to gain and loss, honour and dishonour, blame and praise, happiness and
    misery.&nbsp;One day there is blame, the next day there is praise, but receiving blame or
    praise is only nama and rupa arising because of conditions and falling away
    immediately.&nbsp;It is unavoidable that there be both pleasant and unpleasant experiences
    in life; the more we see that they arise by conditions the less we will take them for
    self. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Those who are arahats have a mind 'unruffled
    by worldly conditions', they are 'from sorrow freed, from defilements cleansed, full of
    peace- this is greatest blessing.'&nbsp;The harass have become invulnerable; nothing can
    disturb them any more.&nbsp;The sutta continues: 'Those who thus abide, ever remain
    invincible, in happiness established.&nbsp;These are the greatest blessings.' </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We are not free from sorrow, but when wisdom
    realizes a characteristic of nama or rupa, there is at that moment no fear, anxiety or
    restlessness; there is peace.&nbsp;Is it not true that wisdom brings contentment, be it
    only for a moment.&nbsp;At times we may feel discouraged; we may think that the eightfold
    Path is not for us and that we are far from the realization of the truth.&nbsp;We should,
    however, remember that the Buddha became enlightened and taught the truth for our welfare
    and happiness.&nbsp;The Buddha did not teach anything which cannot be realized. When we
