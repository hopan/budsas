  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>as there a
    &quot;beginning&quot; -- &quot;of course there was, the Bible says so!&quot;-- Or is a
    beginning or &quot;First Cause&quot; even necessary?</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">If
    you consider that at one time you were not, then what has brought you into existence as
    this being known by the name you care called?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The usual answer is that a God or impersonal Power created
    this universe, this planet, and the beings on it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Considering the above, a further question can arise: Where
    has this God or other power come from? If the reply is that He (or in some cases,
    &quot;She&quot;!) is eternal then why did He decide at some point in time to bring all
    this into existence? What for? His pleasure? Our tribulation? If the answer can be given
    in either way, He can hardly be called Compassionate. An answer to all such inquiries
    which kills further investigation of this subject, is that he ways of God are inscrutable
    and we should accept this as fact without any need of investigation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is interesting to examine and observe how people
    relegate the God to the distant past of Creation or to the distant future of Judgement.
    This means that He has little relevance in and to their daily lives, for if He did, those
    very people who claim to have unshakable faith in this God would live different lives and
    leave the rat race, the competitions, the politics of violence, warfare, and social
    injustice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps &quot;He&quot; is a belief that arises out of a
    very real need for security, or maybe even a craving for some authority figure like a
    father -- or for the New Agers who prefer &quot;goddess&quot; -- a mother, or even a
    craving for eternal life. But when it comes to everyday living, the God idea really takes
    second place and the evidence lies in the very behavior an actions of people all over the
    planet. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Where is God intervening in the unspeakable crimes against
    humanity that are perpetrated and viewed on TV like a regular daily show? This is a fair
    question, if you assert, which you probably do if you are a &quot;believer&quot;, that we
    are all made in God's image. Put the actions with the image, together, and that is one
    nasty God! Put forward &quot;belief&quot;, and &quot;doubt&quot; will be found, too.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From a Buddhadharma perspective, even if &quot;He&quot;
    does exist, what practical difference does it make to one's life here and now? Is not the
    distant past and the distant future, strictly irrelevant to us in the present -- in the
    here-and-now? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is always the present, which is important in the
    Dhamma, not the past, often compared to a dream, and certainly not the future, which we
    can liken to a mirage seen by one thirsty in the desert. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What I do NOW, how I react/respond NOW -- these things are
    infinitely more relevant than speculations over distant events. (And notice there is a
    difference between &quot;react&quot; vs. &quot;respond&quot;.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are said by Buddha to be the &quot;tangle of Wrong
    Views&quot;, &quot;wrong&quot; since no firm conclusions can be reached on the bases on
    which they are reared. And what are these? Blind faith is one and craving is the other.
    Ignorance is the root. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover a hornet's nest is stirred up whenever opposing
    sets of &quot;beliefs&quot; come into conflict, and so-called &quot;religious&quot; wars
    and persecutions are a pointer to how strong the attachment can be to Wrong Views. Why be
    tangled up in them? Why get stung when the venom as well as the stinger is avoidable? Take
    a look at the atrocities that are ongoing and given such insidious and guileful a term as
    &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;. Religious differences play a bigger role than political ones
    in many cases.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Buddha was asked about the length of an eon, He
    answered, &quot;No beginning can be seen to beings, blinded by unknowing and driven by
    craving who are hurrying through the round of birth-and-death&quot;. Thus for the
    practitioner of the Buddhadharma, i.e., the &quot;Buddhist&quot;, &quot;in the
    beginning&quot; has no meaning, and no point in time can be found when there was a
    Creation. Nor is there found any Creator (though we create things through cause and effect
    (kamma) and bring about a seemingly continuous sort of creation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhadhamma-Vinaya practitioner knows well at some
    point, sooner or later, that unknowing and/or ignorance is the seed of (karma) kamma
    sprouting into the various stressful and unsatisfactory experiences termed
    &quot;dukkha&quot;. &quot;God&quot; is a concept, a mix of ideas -- as evidenced by so
    many traditions holding the view of a god or gods under a Supreme Being or Creator God.
    &quot;Buddhism&quot; does not lump these ideas together calling them &quot;God&quot;. If
    one speaks of &quot;eternity&quot;, it is dealt with as it is -- Dharma; if one speaks of
    judgement and retribution -- Karma; if you want to know about beings -- there are other
    sentient beings seen and unseen through out the cosmos. And this area is more scientific
    and better explained than even some so called Buddhists know! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And since this matter deals with ideas, it is not more
    puzzling to comprehend an infinity of birth-and-death rounds rooted in unknowing than it
    is to communicate about a &quot;Creator&quot; who was never born. Indeed, the former has
    great advantage over the latter since unknowing is in one's very own heart and may be
    removed by education, investigation, and directly experiencing Reality as it is. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is complex sets of conditions that give rise to
    dependent events, though the co-dependent arisings may not be clear to one's own
    awareness. Thus, all dhammas (paramattha dhammas) come into and go from existence in this
    way. One does not have to seek a beginning, nor does a &quot;Maker&quot; or
    &quot;Creator&quot; need be sought after. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Visuddhi Magga, XIX, translated by Nyanamoli Thera,
    we have this verse: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No god, no Brahma can be called <br>
      The Maker of this Wheel of Life: <br>
      Just empty phenomena roll on <br>
      Dependent on conditions all.&quot; </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The cosmology found in the Buddhadhamma not only takes
    into account the existence of innumerable systems of worlds grouped into what we should
    call galaxies, but has equally vast conceptions of cosmic time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What did Lord Buddha really have to say about God? At
    times, He did remain silent on this topic. But there is an account given by Him on the
    genesis of the &quot;Creator&quot; and this should settle the issue. But before going on
    with that, we should note that Buddha was not an agnostic (one who does not know). In
    fact, He was a gnostic or 'one who knows' (in Pali: &quot;janata&quot;) and was also
    called &quot;Sabbannu&quot;, the 'All-knower&quot;. This means that to whatever subject
    Lord Buddha attended to, He knew all the contents of that subject. It does NOT mean that
    He always knew everything about every subject all at once, for this very claim was one He
    emphatically and specifically denied about himself. Now, to settle this question of
    &quot;God&quot; we can investigate. It happens that in the beginning of a new cycle (after
    one of the periodic cosmic collapses), a being according to his or her kamma (karma) is
    reborn into a heavenly realm or state where no other beings are to found. (That one's
    kamma being a condition for the arising of that particular heavenly experience.) That one
    does not remember her or his past life among other &quot;gods&quot; in the
    &quot;higher&quot; heavenly realms, and comes to believe during the passing of ages that
    s/he has lived there forever. With the passing of immense time spans, that one wishes for
    the company of others and then, since according to their kamma some other beings appear in
    that realm, s/he comes to believe that they were produced by her or his will. From this
    s/he goes on to glorify herself or himself, her or his supposed &quot;creation&quot; and
    this aids that being's vanity since such a being does not remember the past life it was
    subjected to and so imagines that it is a creature of Brahma. One of these great Brahmas
    called by the name of Baka, was made to see the emptiness and futility of his claims to
    eternal existence and creatorhood when Lord Buddha while in meditation paid a visit to
    that realm. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And not only that, the &quot;Buddhist&quot; attitude to
    Brahma or God or &quot;the Creator&quot; is fairly if somewhat seemingly acridly summed up
    in these translated verses: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He who has eyes can see the sickening sight; <br>
      Why does not Brahma set his creatures right? <br>
      If his wide power no limit can restrain, <br>
      Why is his hand so rarely spread to bless? <br>
      Why are all his creatures condemned to pain? <br>
      Why does he not to all give happiness? <br>
      Why do fraud, lies, and ignorance prevail? <br>
      Why triumphs falsehood -- truth and justice fail? <br>
      I count your Brahma one the unjust among <br>
      Who made a world in which to shelter wrong.&quot; <br>
      -- Bhuridatta Jataka, No. 453 </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consider this: the greater the power of a so-called God
    then the less will be the ability of the human being to do skill or do the unskillful (as
    found in pre-destinarian doctrines). Thus the provocation for the following: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If there exists some lord all-powerful to fulfill
      <br>
      In every creature bliss or woe, and action good or ill, <br>
      That Lord is stained with sin. The human being does but work his will.&quot; <br>
      -- Mahabodhi Jataka, No. 528 </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
