      <P>Introduction </P>
      </B></FONT><FONT FACE="VU Times">
      <P>The Pāli Nikāyas leave no doubt of the important role the jhānas play 
      in the structure of the Buddhist path. In such texts as the Sāmaññaphala 
      Sutta (DN No. 2), the Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta (MN No. 27), and many 
      others on the &quot;gradual training&quot; (anupubbasikkhā) of the Buddhist monk, 
      the Buddha invariably introduces the jhānas to exemplify the training in 
      concentration. When the bhikkhu has fulfilled the preliminary moral 
      discipline, we read, he goes off into solitude and cleanses his mind of 
      the &quot;five hindrances.&quot; When his mind has been so cleansed, he enters and 
      dwells in the four jhānas, described by a stock formula repeated countless 
      times in the Nikāyas:</P>
      <P>Here, bhikkhus, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from 
      unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which 
      is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and happiness born 
      of seclusion. With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and 
      dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal confidence and unification 
      of mind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness 
      born of concentration. With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells 
      equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences 
      happiness with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which 
      the noble ones declare: &quot;He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells 
      happily.&quot; With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous 
      passing away of joy and displeasure, he enters and dwells in the fourth 
      jhāna, which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purification 
      of mindfulness by equanimity.[1]</P>
      <P>In Theravada Buddhist circles during the past few decades a debate has 
      repeatedly erupted over the question whether or not jhāna is necessary to 
      attain the &quot;paths and fruits,&quot; that is, the four graded stages of 
      enlightenment. The debate has been sparked off by the rise to prominence 
      of the various systems of insight meditation that have become popular both 
      in Asia and the West, especially among lay Buddhists. Those who advocate 
      such systems of meditation contend that the paths and fruits can be 
      attained by developing insight (vipassanā) without a foundation of jhāna. 
      This method is called the vehicle of bare insight (suddha-vipassanā), and 
      those who practise in this mode are known as &quot;dry insighters&quot; 
      (sukkha-vipassaka) because their practice of insight has not been 
      &quot;moistened&quot; by prior attainment of the jhānas. Apparently, this system 
      finds support from the Visuddhimagga and the Pāli Commentaries, though it 
      is not given a very prominent place in the commentarial treatment of the 
      path, which usually follows the canonical model in placing the jhānas 
      before the development of insight.[2]</P>
      <P>To help answer the question whether the jhānas are necessary for the 
      attainment of the stages of awakening, we might narrow the question down 
      by asking whether they are needed to reach the first stage of awakening, 
      known as stream-entry (sotāpatti). Since the Nikāyas order the process of 
      awakening into four stages -- stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, 
      and arahantship -- it is possible that the jhānas come to assume an 
      essential role at a later stage in the unfolding of the path, and not at 
      the first stages. Thus it may be that the insight required for the earlier 
      stages does not presuppose prior attainment of the jhānas, while the 
      jhānas become indispensable in making the transition from one of the 
      intermediate stages to a more advanced stage. I myself believe there is 
      strong evidence in the Nikāyas that the jhānas become an essential factor 
      for those intent on advancing from the stage of once-returning to that of 
      non-returner. I will review the texts that corroborate this thesis later 
      in this paper. </P>
      <P>Recently, however, several articulate teachers of meditation have 
      argued down the validity of the dry insight approach, insisting that the 
      jhānas are necessary for the successful development of insight at every 
      stage. Their arguments usually begin by making a distinction between the 
      standpoints of the Pāli Canon and the Commentaries. On this basis, they 
      maintain that from the perspective of the Canon jhāna is needed to attain 
      even stream-entry. The Nikāyas themselves do not address this problem in 
      clear and unambiguous terms, and it is difficult to derive from them any 
      direct pronouncement on its resolution. In the suttas dealing with the 
      gradual training, all the stages of awakening are telescoped into one 
      series, and thus no differentiation is made between the preparatory 
      attainments required for stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, and 
      arahantship. We simply see the monk go off into solitude, attain the four 
      jhānas, and then proceed directly to arahantship, called &quot;the knowledge of 
      the destruction of the taints.&quot; From such texts, there can be no denying 
      the role of the jhānas in bringing the path to fulfilment, but here I 
      shall be concerned principally with the question whether or not they are 
      categorically necessary to win the first fruit of the path.</P>
      <P>In pursuing this question I intend to pick up an important but 
      generally neglected clue the suttas lay at our doorstep. This is the fact 
      that many of the Buddha&#39;s followers who attained the first three stages of 
      awakening, from stream-entry through non-returning, were lay people. The 
      only stage that the Canon depicts as the near-exclusive domain of monks 
      and nuns is arahantship.[3] This clue is more important than might appear 
      at first glance, for a close examination of texts describing the personal 
      qualities and lifestyles of noble lay disciples might bring to light just 
      the material we need to unravel the knots tied into this perplexing issue.</P>
      <P>A study of the Nikāyas as a whole would show that they depict classes 
      of disciples in terms of paradigms or archetypes. These paradigms are 
      generally constructed with extreme rigor and consistency, indicating that 
      they are evidently governed by a precisely determined scheme. Yet, 
      somewhat strangely, it is rare for the outlines of this scheme to be 
      spelled out in the abstract. This puts the burden on us to elicit from the 
      relevant suttas the underlying principles that govern the portrayal of 
      types. The texts with which we are concerned delineate disciples at 
      different levels of development by way of clusters of specific qualities 
      and practices. These texts function both descriptively and prescriptively. 
      They show us what kinds of qualities we can normally expect of disciples 
      at particular stages of progress, and thereby they imply (and sometimes 
      state) what kinds of practices an aspirant at a lower stage should take up 
      to advance further along the path.</P>
      <P>To draw upon suttas dealing with lay disciples is to approach the 
      question of the need for jhāna from an angle somewhat different from the 
      one usually adopted. Most participants in this discussion have focused on 
      texts dealing principally with monastic practice. The drawback to this 
      approach, as indicated above, lies in the predilection of the Nikāyas to 
      compress the successive levels of monastic attainment into a single 
      comprehensive scheme without showing how the various levels of practice 
      are to be correlated with the successive stages of attainment.[4] So 
      instead of working with these monastic texts, I intend to turn my 
      spotlight on the unordained segment of the Buddhist community and look at 
      suttas that discuss the spiritual practices and qualities of the lay noble 
      disciple. For if the jhānas are truly necessary to attain stream-entry, 
      then they should be just as much integral to the practice of the lay 
      follower as they are to the practice of the monk, and thus we should find 
      texts that regularly ascribe jhānic practice and attainment to lay 
      disciples just as we find them in the case of monks. If, on the other 
      hand, the texts consistently describe the practices and qualities of 
      certain types of noble lay disciples in ways that pass over or exclude the 
      jhānas, then we have strong grounds for concluding that the jhānas are not 
      prerequisites for attaining discipleship at these levels.</P>
      <P>I will frame my study around three specific questions:</P>
      <P>(1) Do the texts indicate that a worldling must attain jhāna before 
      entering upon the &quot;fixed course of rightness&quot; (sammatta-niyāma), the 
      irreversible path to stream-entry?</P>
      <P>(2) Do the texts typically ascribe the jhānas to lay disciples who have 
      attained stream-entry?</P>
      <P>(3) If the texts do not normally attribute the jhānas to the 
      stream-enterer, is there any stage in the maturation of the path where 
      their attainment becomes essential? </P>
      <P></P>

      <P>Jhāna and the Attainment of Stream-entry</P>
      </B></FONT><FONT FACE="VU Times">
      <P>Let us turn directly to the texts themselves to see if they can shed 
      any light on our problem. When we do survey the Nikāyas with this issue in 
      mind we find, perhaps with some astonishment, that they neither lay down a 
      clear stipulation that jhāna is needed to attain stream-entry nor openly 
      assert that jhāna is dispensable. The Sutta Piṭaka mentions four 
      preconditions for reaching the path, called sotāpattiyaṅga, factors of 
      stream-entry, namely: association with superior people (i.e., with the 
      noble ones); listening to the true Dhamma; proper attention; and practice 
      in accordance with the Dhamma.[5] It would seem that all the elements of 
      Buddhist meditative practice, including the jhānas, should come under the 
      fourth factor, but the Nikāyas themselves do not state whether &quot;practice 
      in accordance with the Dhamma&quot; includes the jhānas. The few texts that 
      specify what is actually meant by &quot;practice in accordance with the Dhamma&quot; 
      are invariably concerned with insight meditation. They employ a fixed 
      formula, with variable subjects, to describe a bhikkhu practising in such 
      a way. Two suttas define such practice as aimed at the cessation of the 
      factors of dependent origination (SN II 18, 115); another, as aimed at the 
      cessation of the five aggregates (SN III 163-64); and still another, as 
      aimed at the cessation of the six sense bases (SN IV 141). Of course, 
      meditation practice undertaken to attain the jhānas would have to be 
      included in &quot;practice in accordance with the Dhamma,&quot; but the texts give 
      no ground for inferring that such practice is a prerequisite for reaching 
      stream-entry.</P>
      <P>A stream-enterer is endowed with four other qualities, mentioned often 
      in the Sotāpatti-saṃyutta (SN chap. 55). These, too, are called 
      sotāpattiyaṅga, but in a different sense than the former set. These are 
      the factors that qualify a person as a stream-enterer. The first three are 
      &quot;confirmed confidence&quot; (aveccappasāda) in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the 
      Sangha; the fourth is &quot;the virtues dear to the noble ones,&quot; generally 
      understood to mean inviolable adherence to the Five Precepts. From this, 
      we can reasonably suppose that in the preliminary stage leading up to 
      stream-entry the aspirant will need firm faith in the Three Jewels (the 
      Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha) and scrupulous observance of the Five 
      Precepts. Further, the realization of stream-entry itself is often 
      depicted as a cognitive experience of almost ocular immediacy. It is 
      called the gaining of the eye of the Dhamma (dhammacakkhu-paṭilābha), the 
      breakthrough to the Dhamma (dhammābhisamaya), the penetration of the 
      Dhamma (dhamma-paṭivedha).[6] One who has undergone this experience is 
      said to have &quot;seen the Dhamma, reached the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, 
      fathomed the Dhamma.&quot;[7] Taken together, both modes of description -- by 
      way of the four factors of stream-entry and by way of the event of 
      realization -- indicate that the disciple has arrived at stream-entry 
      primarily through insight supported by unwavering faith in the Three 
      Jewels. It is noteworthy that the texts on the realization of stream-entry 
      make no mention of any prior accomplishment in jhāna as a prerequisite for 
      reaching the path. In fact, several texts show the breakthrough to 
      stream-entry as occurring to someone without any prior meditative 
      experience, simply by listening to the Buddha or an enlightened monk give 
      a discourse on the Dhamma.[8] </P>
      <P>While the process of &quot;entering the stream&quot; involves both faith and 
      wisdom, individuals differ in their disposition with respect to these two 
      qualities: some are disposed to faith, others to wisdom. This difference 
      is reflected in the division of potential stream-enterers into two types, 
      known as the saddhānusārī or faith-follower and the dhammānusārī or 
      Dhamma-follower. Both have entered &quot;the fixed course of rightness&quot; 
      (sammatta-niyāma), the irreversible path to stream-entry, by attuning 
      their understanding of actuality to the nature of actuality itself, and 
      thus for both insight is the key to entering upon the path. The two types 
      differ, however, in the means by which they generate insight. The 
      faith-follower, as the term implies, does so with faith as the driving 
      force; inspired by faith, he resolves on the ultimate truth and thereby 
      gains the path. The Dhamma-follower is driven by an urge to fathom the 
      true nature of actuality; inspired by this urge, he investigates the 
      teaching and gains the path. When they have known and seen the truth of 
      the Dhamma, they realize the fruit of stream-entry.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most informative source on the difference between these two 
      types is the Okkantika-saṃyutta, where the Buddha shows how they enter 
      upon the fixed course of rightness:</P>
      <P>&quot;Bhikkhus, the eye is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. So too 
      the ear ... nose ... tongue ... body ... mind. One who places faith in 
      these teachings and resolves on them thus is called a faith-follower: he 
      is one who has entered the fixed course of rightness, entered the plane of 
      the superior persons, transcended the plane of the worldlings. He is 
      incapable of doing any deed by reason of which he might be reborn in hell, 
      in the animal realm, or in the sphere of ghosts; he is incapable of 
      passing away without having realized the fruit of stream-entry.</P>
      <P>&quot;One for whom these teachings are accepted thus to a sufficient degree 
      by being pondered with wisdom is called a Dhamma-follower: he is one who 
      has entered the fixed course of rightness ... (he is) incapable of passing 
      away without having realized the fruit of stream-entry.</P>
      <P>&quot;One who knows and sees these teachings thus is called a 
      stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, 
      with enlightenment as his destination.&quot;[9]</P>
      <P>It is noteworthy that this passage makes no mention of jhāna. While 
      prior experience of jhāna would no doubt help to make the mind a more fit 
      instrument for insight, it is surely significant that jhāna is not 
      mentioned either as an accompaniment of the &quot;entry upon the fixed course 
      of rightness&quot; or as a prerequisite for it.</P>
      <P>It might be objected that several other passages on the two candidates 
      for stream-entry implicitly include the jhānas among their meditative 
      equipment. The details of these passages need not concern us here. What is 
      of interest to us is that they assign to both the faith-follower and the 
      Dhamma-follower the five spiritual faculties: faith, energy, mindfulness, 
      concentration, and wisdom.[10] The Indriya-saṃyutta states that the 
      faculty of concentration &quot;is to be seen among the four jhānas,&quot;[11] and a 
      definition of the concentration faculty includes the formula for the 
      jhānas.[12] Thus, if we argue deductively from these ascriptions and 
      definitions, it would seem to follow as a matter of logic that both the 
      Dhamma-follower and the faith-follower possess the jhānas. More broadly, 
      since these faculties and powers belong to all noble disciples, not to 
      monks alone, this might be held up as proof that all noble disciples, 
      monks and lay followers, invariably possess the jhānas.</P>
      <P>Such a conclusion would follow if we adopt a literal and deductive 
      approach to the interpretation of the texts, but it is questionable 
      whether such a hermeneutic is always appropriate when dealing with the 
      formulaic definitions employed so often by the Nikāyas. To extract the 
      intended meaning from such schematic definition, we require greater 
      sensitivity to context, sensitivity guided by acquaintance with a wide 
      assortment of relevant texts. Further, if we do opt for the literalist 
      approach, then, since the passage simply inserts the formula for the four 
      jhānas without qualification into the definition of the concentration 
      faculty, we would have to conclude that all noble disciples, monks and lay 
      followers alike, possess all four jhānas, not just one. Even more, they 
      would have to possess the four jhānas already as faith-followers and 
      Dhamma-followers, at the very entry to the path. This, however, seems too 
      generous, and indicates that we need to be cautious in interpreting such 
      formulaic definitions. In the case presently being considered, I would 
      regard the use of the jhāna formula here as a way of showing the most 
      eminent type of concentration to be developed by the noble disciple. I 
      would not take it as a rigid pronouncement that all noble disciples 
      actually possess all four jhānas, or even one of them.</P>
      <P>But there is more to be said. When we attend closely to these texts, we 
      see that a degree of flexibility is already built into them. In the 
      analysis of the faculties at SN 48:9-10/V 197-98, the first sutta offers 
      an alternative definition of the faculty of concentration that does not 
      mention the four jhānas, while the following sutta gives both definitions 
      conjointly. The alternative version runs thus: &quot;And what, monks, is the 
      faculty of concentration? Here, monks, a noble disciple gains 
      concentration, gains one-pointedness of mind, having made release the 
      object. This is called the faculty of concentration.&quot;[13] </P>
      <P>The Nikāyas themselves nowhere explain exactly what is meant by the 
      concentration gained by &quot;having made release the object&quot; (vossaggārammaṇaṃ 
      karitvā), but they do elsewhere suggest that release (vossagga) is a term 
      for Nibbāna.[14] The Commentary interprets this passage with the aid of 
      the distinction between mundane (lokiya) and supramundane (lokuttara) 
      concentration: the former consists in the form-sphere jhānas (and the 
      access to these jhānas), the latter in the supramundane jhānas concomitant 
      with the supramundane path.[15] On the basis of this distinction, the 
      Commentary explains &quot;the concentration that makes release the object&quot; as 
      the supramundane concentration of the noble path arisen with Nibbāna as 
      object.[16] Thus if we feel obliged to interpret the faculty and power of 
      concentration in the light of the jhāna formula, we might go along with 
      the Commentary in regarding it as the supramundane jhāna pertaining to the 
      supramundane path and fruit.</P>
      <P>However, we need not agree with the Commentaries in taking the 
      expression &quot;having made release the object&quot; so literally. We might instead 
      interpret this phrase more loosely as characterizing a concentration aimed 
      at release, that is, directed towards Nibbāna.[17] Then we can understand 
      its referent as the concentration that functions as the basis for insight, 
      both initially in the preparatory phase of practice and later in immediate 
      conjunction with insight. This would allow us to ascribe to the noble 
      disciple a degree of concentration strong enough to qualify as a faculty 
      without compelling us to hold that he must possess jhāna. Perhaps the 
      combined definition of the concentration faculty in SN 48:10 is intended 
      to show that two courses are open to disciples. One is the route 
      emphasizing strong concentration, along which one develops the jhānas as 
      the faculty of concentration; the other is the route emphasizing insight, 
      along which one develops concentration only to the degree needed for 
      insight to arise. This concentration, though falling short of jhāna, could 
      still be described as &quot;concentration that makes release its object.&quot; </P>
      <P>The faith-follower and the Dhamma-follower are the lowest members of a 
      sevenfold typology of noble persons mentioned in the Nikāyas as an 
      alternative to the more common scheme of &quot;the four pairs of persons,&quot; the 
      four path-attainers and the realizers of their respective fruits.[18] The 
      seven fall into three groups. At the apex are the arahants, who are 
      distinguished into two types: (i) &quot;both-ways-liberated&quot; arahants 
      (ubhatobhāgavimutta), who gain release from the taints together with deep 
      experience of the formless attainments; and (ii) &quot;wisdom-liberated&quot; 
      arahants (paññāvimutta), who win release from the taints without such 
      experience of the formless attainments. Next are three types in the 
      intermediate range, from stream-enterers up to those on the path to 
      arahantship. These are: (iii) the body-witness (kāyasakkhī), who has 
      partly eliminated the taints and experiences the formless attainments; 
      (iv) the view-attainer (diṭṭhippatta), who does not experience the 
      formless attainments and has partly eliminated the taints, with emphasis 
      on wisdom; and (v) the faith-liberated (saddhāvimutta), who does not 
      experience the formless attainments and has partly eliminated the taints, 
      with emphasis on faith. Any disciple at the six intermediate stages -- 
      from stream-enterer to one on the path to arahantship -- can fall into any 
      of these three categories; the distinctions among them are not determined 
      by degree of progress but by mode of progress, whether through strong 
      concentration, wisdom, or faith. Finally come the two kinds of anusārī 
      (vi-vii), who are on the path to stream-entry.</P>
      <P>What is noteworthy about this list is that samādhi, as a faculty, does 
      not determine a class of its own until after the fruit of stream-entry has 
      been realized. That is, facility in concentration determines a distinct 
      type of disciple among the arahants (as the both-ways-liberated arahant) 
      and among the aspirants for the higher stages (as the body-witness), but 
      not among the aspirants for stream-entry. In this lowest category we have 
      only the faith-follower and the Dhamma-follower, who owe their status to 
      faith and wisdom, respectively, but there is no type corresponding to the 
      body-witness.[19]</P>
      <P>From the omission of a class of disciples training for stream-entry who 
      also enjoy the experience of the formless meditations, one might suppose 
      that disciples below the level of stream-entry cannot gain access to the 
      formless attainments. This supposition is not tenable, however, for the 
      texts show that many of tthe ascetics and contemplatives in the Buddha&#39;s 
      day (including his two teachers before his enlightenment) were familiar 
      with the jhānas and formless attainments. Since these attainments are not 
      dependent on the insight made uniquely available through the Buddha&#39;s 
      teaching, the omission of such a class of jhāna-attainers among those on 
      the way to stream-entry must be explained in some other way than by the 
      supposition that such a class does not exist.</P>
      <P>I would propose that while disciples prior to stream-entry may or may 
      not possess the formless attainments, skill in this area does not 
      determine a distinct type because powerful concentration is not a 
      governing factor in the attainment of stream-entry. The way to 
      stream-entry certainly requires a degree of concentration sufficient for 
      the &quot;eye of the Dhamma&quot; to arise, but the actual movement from the stage 
      of a worldling to that of a path-attainer is driven by either strong 
      conviction or a probing spirit of inquiry, which respectively determine 
      whether the aspirant is to become a faith-follower or a Dhamma-follower. 
      Once, however, the path has been gained, then one&#39;s degree of 
      accomplishment in concentration determines one&#39;s future mode of progress. 
      If one gains the formless attainments one takes the route of the 
      body-witness, culminating in release as a both-ways-liberated arahant. If 
      one does not attain them, one takes the route of the view-attainer or 
      faith-liberated trainee, culminating in release as a wisdom-liberated 
      arahant. Since these distinctions relate only to the formless attainments 
      and make no mention of the jhānas, it is reasonable to suppose that types 
      (ii), (iv-v), and (vi-vii) may have possession of the form-sphere jhānas. 
      But by making faith and wisdom the key factors in gaining the initial 
      access to the path, this scheme leaves open the possibility that some 
      stream-enterers, and perhaps those at still higher levels, may not have 
      gained these jhānas at all.</P>

      <P>Jhāna and Right Concentration </P>
      </B></FONT><FONT FACE="VU Times">
      <P>Though the above discussion seems to imply that the path of 
      stream-entry might be reached without prior attainment of jhāna, the 
      thesis that jhāna is necessary at every stage of enlightenment claims 
      powerful support from the canonical account of the Noble Eightfold Path, 
      which defines the path factor of right concentration (sammā samādhi) with 
      the stock formula for the four jhānas.[20] From this definition it might 
      be argued that since right concentration is integral to the path, and 
      since the jhānas form the content of right concentration, the jhānas are 
      indispensable from the first stage of awakening to the last.</P>
      <P>This conclusion, however, does not necessarily follow. Even if we agree 
      that the definition of right concentration by way of the jhānas 
      categorically means that the jhānas must be reached in the course of 
      developing the path, this need not be taken to stipulate that they must be 
      attained prior to attaining stream-entry. It could be that attainment of 
      jhāna is necessary to complete the development of the path, becoming 
      mandatory at a relatively late point in the disciple&#39;s progress. That is, 
      it may be a prerequisite for reaching one of the higher paths and fruits, 
      but may not be indispensable for reaching the first path and fruit. The 
      Theravāda exegetical system found in the Pāli Commentaries handles this 
      issue in a different way. Based on the Abhidhamma&#39;s classification of 
      states of consciousness, the Commentaries distinguish two kinds of path: 
      the preliminary (pubbabhāga) or mundane (lokiya) path and the supramundane 
      (lokuttara) path.[21] Two kinds of jhānas, mundane and supramundane, 
      correspond to these two kinds of path. The mundane jhānas are exalted 
      states of consciousness (mahaggata-citta) developed in the preliminary 
      path, as a preparation for reaching the supramundane path; technically, 
      they are &quot;form-sphere&quot; states of consciousness (rūpāvacara-citta), that 
      is, types of consciousness typical of the &quot;form realm&quot; and tending to 
      rebirth in the form realm. The supramundane jhānas are supramundane states 
      of consciousness (lokuttara-citta) identical with the supramundane paths 
      or fruits themselves.</P>
      <P>This distinction allows the Commentaries to hold simultaneously two 
      theses regarding the relation of jhāna to the path: (i) every path and 
      fruition attainment, from the stage of stream-entry up, is also a jhāna, 
      and thus all path-attainers are attainers of supramundane jhāna; (ii) not 
      all path-attainers have reached jhāna in the preliminary path leading up 
      to the supramundane path, and thus they need not be attainers of mundane 
      (or form-sphere) jhāna. These two theses can be reconciled because the 
      paths and fruits always occur at a level of concentration corresponding to 
      one of the four jhānas and thus may be considered jhānas in their own 
      right, though jhānas of the supramundane rather than mundane type. These 
      jhānas are quite distinct from the mundane jhānas, the exalted states of 
      concentration pertaining to the form-sphere (rūpāvacara). As all 
      path-attainers necessarily attain supramundane jhāna, they fulfil the 
      definition of right concentration in the Noble Eightfold Path, but they 
      may not have attained the form-sphere jhānas prior to reaching the path. 
      Those who do not attain jhāna develop a lower degree of concentration 
      (called access concentration, upacāra-samādhi) which they use as a basis 
      to arouse insight and thereby reach the supramundane path. When those 
      meditators who arouse insight without prior attainment of jhāna reach the 
      supramundane path, their path attainment occurs at the level of the first 
      supramundane jhāna. Those who have already cultivated the mundane jhānas 
      prior to attaining the path, it is said, generally attain a path that 
      occurs at a jhānic level corresponding to their degree of achievement in 
      the practice of the mundane jhānas.[22]</P>
      <P>Though the Nikāyas do not clearly distinguish the two types of paths 
      and jhānas, several suttas foreshadow this distinction, the most prominent 
      among them being the Mahācattārīsaka Sutta.[23] The distinction becomes 
      explicit in the Abhidhamma, where it is used as a basis for the 
      definitions of the form-sphere and supramundane wholesome states of 
      consciousness. The Commentaries go one step further and adopt this 
      distinction as foundational to their entire method of exegesis. Although 
      one is certainly not justified in reading the interpretative concepts of 
      the Commentaries into the canonical texts themselves, since the 
      Commentaries feel obliged to explain the definition of right concentration 
      as the four jhānas in a way that does not imply all path-attainers possess 
      the form-sphere jhānas, this makes it plain that they did not regard the 
      form-sphere jhānas as a prerequisite for attaining the path of 
      stream-entry. </P>

      <P>The Stream-enterer and Jhāna </P>
      </B></FONT><FONT FACE="VU Times">
      <P>The contention between the two parties in the contemporary debate might 
      be recapitulated thus: Those who assert that jhāna is necessary for the 
      attainment of stream-entry usually insist that a mundane (or form-sphere) 
      jhāna must be secured before one can enter the supramundane path. Those 
      who defend the dry-insight approach hold that a mundane jhāna is not 
      indispensable, that a lower degree of concentration suffices as a basis 
      for the cultivation of insight and the attainment of the path. Both 
      parties usually agree that jhāna is part of the actual path experience 
      itself. The issue that divides them is whether the concentration in the 
      preliminary portion of the path must include a jhāna.</P>
      <P>To decide this question, I wish to query the texts themselves and ask 
      whether they show us instances of stream-enterers who are not attainers of 
      the jhānas. Now while there are no suttas which flatly state that it is 
      possible to become a stream-enterer without having attained at least the 
      first jhāna, I think there are several that imply as much.</P>
      <P>(1) Let us start with the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha Sutta (MN No. 14). The 
      sutta opens when the Sakyan lay disciple Mahānāma, identified by the 
      commentary as a once-returner, comes to the Buddha and presents him with a 
      personal problem. Although he has long understood, through the guidance of 
      the teaching, that greed, hatred, and delusion are corruptions of the mind 
      (cittassa upakkilesa), such states still arise in him and overpower his 
      mind. This troubles him and makes him wonder what the underlying cause 
      might be. In his reply the Buddha says: &quot;Even though a noble disciple has 
      clearly seen with perfect wisdom that sensual pleasures give little 
      satisfaction and are fraught with suffering and misery, rife with greater 
      danger, if he does not achieve a rapture and happiness apart from sensual 
      pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, or something more peaceful than 
      this, then he is not beyond being enticed by sensual pleasures.&quot;[24] The 
      first part of this statement implies that the subject is at least a 
      stream-enterer, for he is referred to as a &quot;noble disciple&quot; 
      (ariya-sāvaka). Though the term ariya-sāvaka is occasionally used in a 
      loose sense that need not be taken to imply attainment of stream-entry, 
      here the expression &quot;seeing with perfect wisdom&quot; seems to establish his 
      identity as at least a stream-enterer. Yet the second part of the 
      statement implies he does not possess even the first jhāna, for the phrase 
      used to describe what he lacks (&quot;a rapture and happiness apart from 
      sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states&quot;) precisely echoes the 
      wording of the basic formula for the first jhāna. The state &quot;more peaceful 
      than that&quot; would, of course, be the higher jhānas. </P>
      <P>(2) At AN 5:179/III 211, the Buddha speaks, with reference to &quot;a lay 
      follower clothed in white&quot; (gihī odātavasana), of four &quot;pleasant dwellings 
      in this very life pertaining to the higher mind&quot; (cattāro ābhicetasikā 
      diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihārā). Now in relation to monks, the Nikāyas 
      invariably use this expression to mean the four jhānas.[25] If it were 
      considered commonplace, or even paradigmatic, for a lay noble disciple to 
      attain the four jhānas, one would expect the Buddha to explain the above 
      expression in the same way as he does for monks. But he does not. Rather, 
      when he specifies what these &quot;pleasant abidings&quot; mean for the noble lay 
      follower, he identifies them with the possession of the four &quot;factors of 
      stream-entry&quot; (sotāpattiyaṅga), namely, confirmed confidence in the 
      Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and possession of &quot;the virtues dear to 
      the noble ones.&quot; This difference in explanation has important 
      ramifications and is indicative of major differences in expectations 
      regarding lay followers and monks.</P>
      <P>(3) At AN VI 10/III 284-88, the Sakyan noble Mahānāma again approaches 
      the Buddha and inquires about the meditative practice of &quot;a noble disciple 
      who has reached the fruit and understood the message&quot; (ariyasāvako 
      āgataphalo viññātasāsano). Here again, it is clear from the epithets used 
      that the question concerns a lay follower who has realized stream-entry or 
      some higher stage. Further, at the end of each expository section, the 
      Buddha stresses the ariyan stature of the disciple with the words: &quot;This 
      is called, Mahānāma, a noble disciple who among unrighteous humanity has 
      attained righteousness, who among an afflicted humanity dwells 
      unafflicted, who has entered the stream of the Dhamma and develops 
      recollection of the Buddha&quot; (and so for each object of recollection).[26]</P>
      <P>In his reply the Buddha shows how the lay disciple takes up one of the 
      six objects of recollection (cha anussati): the Three Jewels, morality, 
      generosity, and the devas. As the disciple recollects each theme, his mind 
      is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion, but becomes upright 
      (ujugata): &quot;With an unright mind he gains the inspiration of the goal, the 
      inspiration of the Dhamma, gladness connected with the Dhamma. When he is 
      gladdened rapture arises, his body becomes tranquil, and he experiences 
      happiness. For one who is happy the mind becomes concentrated.&quot;[27] As 
      this passage shows, contemplation based on the Buddha (and the other 
      objects of recollection) culminates in samādhi, yet the nature of this 
      samādhi is not elucidated by way of the jhāna formula. In fact, the 
      Nikāyas never ascribe to these reflective contemplations the capacity to 
      induce jhāna, and this is expressly denied in the Commentaries, which hold 
      that because these meditation subjects involve intensive use of discursive 
      thought they can lead only as far as access concentration 
      (upacāra-samādhi).</P>
      <P>It thus seems that the type of concentration typically available to a 
      lay noble disciple at the stage of stream-entry or once-returning is 
      access concentration. This, of course, does not mean that stream-enterers 
      and once-returners don&#39;t attain the jhānas, but only that the standard 
      doctrinal structure does not ascribe the jhānas to them as essential 
      equipment. </P>
      <P>(4) Nor does the above sutta imply that a lay stream-enterer must 
      remain content merely with excursions into access concentration and cannot 
      develop the higher wisdom of insight. To the contrary, the Buddha includes 
      the higher wisdom among the five excellent qualities he regularly ascribes 
      to noble lay disciples: faith, virtue, learning, generosity, and 
      wisdom.[28] In several suttas of the Sotāpatti-saṃyutta, generosity and 
      wisdom even replace virtue as the fourth factor of stream-entry, faith 
      being included by &quot;confirmed confidence&quot; in the Three Jewels.[29] We 
      should note that we do not find among these qualities any mention of 
      samādhi or a formula for the jhānas. Yet we see that wisdom is defined in 
      exactly the same terms used to define the wisdom of a monk in training 
      (sekha). It is &quot;the noble wisdom that discerns the arising and passing 
      away of things, that is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete 
      destruction of suffering.&quot;[30] Since the lay stream-enterer or 
      once-returner is thus well equipped with the wisdom of insight but is not 
      typically described as a jhāna attainer, this implies that attainment of 
      jhāna is not normally expected or required of him. From this we can also 
      conclude that at these early stages of the path liberative wisdom does not 
      depend on a supporting base of jhāna.</P>
      <P>(5) A text in the Sotāpatti-saṃyutta gives credit to this conclusion. 
      At SN 55:40/V 398-99, the Buddha explains to the Sakyan Nandiya how a 
      noble disciple dwells diligently (ariyasāvako appamādavihārī). He says 
      that a noble disciple should not become complacent about possessing the 
      four factors of stream-entry but should use these qualities as starting 
      points for contemplation: &quot;He is not content with his confirmed confidence 
      in the Buddha (etc.), but strives further in seclusion by day and in 
      retreat by night. As he dwells diligently, gladness arises ... (as above) 
      ... for one who is happy the mind becomes concentrated. When the mind is 
      concentrated, phenomena become manifest. It is with the manifestation of 
      phenomena to him that he is reckoned as &#39;one who dwells diligently.&#39;&quot;[31]</P>
      <P>The expression &quot;manifestation of phenomena&quot; (dhammānaṃ pātubhāva) 
      indicates that the disciple is engaged in contemplating the rise and fall 
      of the five aggregates, the six sense bases, and so forth. Thus this 
      passage shows how the disciple proceeds from concentration to insight, but 
      it does not describe this concentration in terms suggesting it occurs at 
      the level of jhāna. Since the sequence switches over from concentration to 
      insight without mentioning jhāna, it seems that the concentration attained 
      will be tantamount to access concentration, not jhāna, yet even this 
      suffices to support the arising of insight. </P>

      <P>When Do the Jhānas Become Necessary?</B> </P>
      </FONT><FONT FACE="VU Times">
      <P>While there seem to be no suttas that impose an inflexible rule to the 
      effect that a lay noble disciple must possess the jhānas, there are at 
      least two texts that explicitly ascribe all four jhānas to certain 
      householders. One, found in the Citta-saṃyutta (SN 41:9/IV 300-2), 
      features Citta the householder, the foremost lay preacher, in a 
      conversation with a naked ascetic named Kassapa. Kassapa was an old friend 
      of Citta who had embraced the life of renunciation thirty years earlier, 
      and this is apparently their first meeting since that time. Kassapa 
      confesses to Citta that in all these years he has not achieved any 
      &quot;superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision befitting the noble ones&quot; 
      (uttarimanussadhammā alamariya-ñāṇadassanavisesa); all he does is go about 
      naked, with a shaved head, using a feather brush to sweep his seat. He 
      then asks Citta whether, as a lay disciple of the Buddha, he has reached 
      any distinguished attainments. Citta says that he has, and then declares 
      his ability to enter and dwell in the four jhānas (he uses the standard 
      formula). To this he adds: &quot;Further, if I were to die before the Blessed 
      One, it would not be surprising if the Blessed One would declare of me: 
      &#39;There is no fetter bound by which Citta the householder might come back 
      to this world.&#39;&quot;[32] Through this bit of coded text, partly a stock 
      formulation, Citta is informing his friend that he is a non-returner with 
      access to the four jhānas.</P>
      <P>The other sutta is AN 7:50/IV 66-67 and concerns the lay woman 
      Nandamātā. In the presence of the Venerable Sāriputta and other monks, 
      Nandamātā has been disclosing the seven wonderful and marvellous qualities 
      with which she is endowed. The sixth of these is possession of the four 
      jhānas, again described by the stock formula. The seventh is as follows: 
      &quot;As to the five lower fetters taught by the the Blessed One, I do not see 
      among them any as yet unabandoned in myself.&quot;[33] This too is a coded way 
      of declaring her status as a non-returner. </P>
      <P>Such are the reports that have come down in the Sutta Piṭaka about two 
      lay followers who possess both the four jhānas and the status of 
      non-returner. Whether these two achievements are inseparably connected or 
      not is difficult to determine on the basis of the Nikāyas, but there are 
      several texts that lend support to this conclusion. One sutta (AN 3:85/I 
      231-32) ranks the four classes of noble disciples in relation to the 
      threefold higher training consisting of the higher virtue, the higher 
      mind, and the higher wisdom. Just below, the Buddha explains the training 
      in the higher virtue (adhisīla-sikkhā) as the restraint of the Pātimokkha, 
      the code of monastic rules; the training in the higher mind 
      (adhicitta-sikkhā), as the four jhānas (defined by the usual formula); and 
      the training in the higher wisdom (adhipa</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">񱡡</FONT><FONT FACE="VU Times">-sikkhā), 
      as either the knowledge of the four noble truths or liberation from the 
      taints (AN 3:88-89/I 235-36). Although the Buddha&#39;s treatment of this 
      topic is governed by a monastic context, the principles of classification 
      can easily be extended to lay disciples. Returning to AN 3:85, we learn 
      that the stream-enterer and the once-returner have fulfilled the training 
      in the higher virtue (which for a lay disciple would mean possession of 
      &quot;the virtues dear to the noble ones&quot;) but have accomplished the other two 
      trainings only partly; the non-returner has fulfilled the trainings in the 
      higher virtue and the higher mind but accomplished the training in the 
      higher wisdom only partly; and the arahant has fulfilled all three 
      trainings. Now since the non-returner has fulfilled the training in the 
      higher mind, and this is defined as the four jhānas, he is probably an 
      attainer of the jhānas.</P>
      <P>It might still be questioned, however, whether he must possess all four 
      jhānas. While a literal reading of the above sutta would support this 
      conclusion, if we bear in mind my earlier comments about interpreting 
      stock formulas, we might conjecture that the training in the higher mind 
      is fulfilled by the secure attainment of even one jhāna. This seems to be 
      confirmed by the Mahāmāluṅkya Sutta (MN No. 64/I 434-37), which shows how 
      the attainment of jhāna figures in the preliminary phase of the path to 
      the stage of non-returner. At a certain point in his discourse, the Buddha 
      announces that he will teach &quot;the path and way for the abandoning of the 
      five lower fetters&quot; (yo maggo yā paṭipadā pancannaṃ orambhāgiyānaṃ 
      saṃyojanānaṃ pahānāya). He underscores the importance of what he is about 
      to explain with a simile. Just as it is impossible to cut out the 
      heartwood of a great tree without first cutting through the bark and 
      softwood, so it is impossible to cut off the five lower fetters without 
      relying on the path and practice he is about to make known. This lays down 
      categorically that the procedure to be described must be exactly followed 
      to win the promised goal, the eradication of the five lower fetters (the 
      defining achievement of the non-returner).</P>
      <P>The Buddha then explains the method. The meditator enters into one of 
      the four jhānas or the lower three formless attainments (the text takes up 
      each in turn) and dissects it into its constituents: form, feeling, 
      perception, volitional formations, and consciousness in the case of the 
      four jhānas; the same, but omitting form, for the three formless 
      attainments.[34] He next contemplates these phenomena in eleven ways: as 
      impermanent, suffering, a disease, a boil, a dart, misery, affliction, 
      alien, disintegrating, empty, and non-self. Then, when his contemplation 
      reaches maturity, he turns his mind away from these things and directs it 
      to the deathless element (amata-dhātu), i.e., Nibbāna. &quot;If he is firm in 
      this he reaches arahantship right on the spot, but if he holds back 
      slightly due to attachment and delight in the Dhamma, then he eliminates 
      the five lower fetters and becomes a spontaneous ariser, who attains final 
      Nibbāna there (in a celestial realm) without ever returning from that 
      world.&quot;[35] </P>
      <P>The Mahāmāluṅkya Sutta thus makes the attainment of jhāna a necessary 
      part of the preparatory practice for attaining the stage of non-returner. 
      Though the sutta discusses the practice undertaken by a monk, since the 
      Buddha has declared this to be &quot;the path and practice for abandoning the 
      five lower fetters,&quot; we are entitled to infer that lay practitioners too 
      must follow this course. This would imply that a once-returner who aspires 
      to become a non-returner should develop at least the first jhāna in the 
      preliminary phase of the path, using the jhāna as the launching pad for 
      developing insight.</P>
      <P>While the Mahāmāluṅkya Sutta and its parallel (AN 9:36/IV 422-26) imply 
      that prior attainment of the first jhāna is a minimum requirement for 
      reaching the fruit of non-returning, we may still query whether this is an 
      invariable rule or merely a general stipulation that allows for 
      exceptions. Several suttas suggest the latter may in fact be the case. In 
      two consecutive texts the Buddha extols the &quot;eight wonderful and 
      marvellous qualities&quot; of two lay followers named Ugga. In the first (AN 
      8:21/IV 211), he declares that Ugga of Vesālī has abandoned all five 
      fetters (as for Nandamātā above); in the second (AN 8:22/IV 216), he says 
      that Ugga of Hatthigāma has no fetters bound by which he might come back 
      to this world (as for Citta). Yet, though he thus confirms their standing 
      as non-returners, the Buddha does not mention jhānic attainments among 
      their eight wonderful qualities. This, of course, need not be taken to 
      mean that they lacked attainment of jhāna. It may have been that their 
      jhānic skills were less remarkable than the other qualities they 
      possessed, or they may have been adept in only one or two jhānas rather 
      than in all four. But it does leave open the possibility that they were 
      non-returners without jhāna.</P>
      <P>Still another suggestive text is the Dīghāvu Sutta (SN 55:3/V 344-46). 
      Here, the Buddha visits a young lay follower named Dīghāvu, who is gravely 
      ill. He first enjoins the sick boy to acquire confirmed confidence in the 
      Three Jewels and the virtues dear to the noble ones, that is, to become a 
      stream-enterer. When Dīghāvu declares that he already possesses these 
      qualities, the Buddha tells him that since he is established in the four 
      factors of stream-entry, he should &quot;strive further to develop six 
      qualities that partake of true knowledge&quot; (cha vijjābhāgiyā dhammā): &quot;You 
      should dwell contemplating the impermanence of all formations, perceiving 
      suffering in what is impermanent, perceiving non-self in what is 
      suffering, perceiving abandonment, perceiving dispassion, perceiving 
      cessation.&quot;[36] Dīghāvu assures the Blessed One that he is already 
      practising these contemplations, and the Master leaves. A short time later 
      Dīghāvu dies. On hearing the news of his death, the monks approach the 
      Buddha to ask about his future rebirth. The Buddha declares that Dīghāvu 
      the lay follower had eradicated the five lower fetters and was 
      spontaneously reborn as a non-returner. Here the transition from 
      stream-entry to non-returning occurs entirely through a series of 
      contemplations that pertain to insight. There has been no exhortation to 
      develop the jhānas, yet through the practice of the &quot;six things partaking 
      of true knowledge&quot; Dīghāvu has severed the five fetters and gained the 
      third fruit of the path.</P>
      <P>A theoretical foundation for Dīghāvu&#39;s approach might be gleaned from 
      another sutta. At AN 4:169/II 155-56, the Buddha contrasts two kinds of 
      non-returners: one who attains final Nibbāna without exertion 
      (asaṅkhāra-parinibbāyī), and one who attains final Nibbāna with exertion 
      (sasaṅkhāra-parinibbāyī). The former is one who enters and dwells in the 
      four jhānas (described by the stock formula). The latter practises instead 
      the &quot;austere&quot; meditations such as the contemplation of the foulness of the 
      body, reflection on the repulsiveness of food, disenchantment with the 
      whole world, perception of impermanence in all formations, and 
      recollection of death.[37] Again, there is no categorical assertion that 
      the latter is altogether bereft of jhāna, but the contrast of this type 
      with one who gains the four jhānas suggests this as a possibility.</P>
      <P>Though the possibility that there might be non-returners without jhānas 
      cannot be ruled out, from the Nikāyas we can elicit several reasons why we 
      might normally expect a non-returner to have access to them. One reason is 
      inherent in the very act of becoming a non-returner. In ascending from the 
      stage of once-returner to that of non-returner, the meditator eradicates 
      two fetters that had been merely weakened by the once-returner: sensual 
      desire (kāmacchanda) and ill will (byāpāda). Now these two fetters are 
      also the first two among the five hindrances, the defilements to be 
      abandoned to gain the jhānas. This suggests that by eradicating these 
      defilements the non-returner permanently removes the main obstacles to 
      concentration. Thus, if his mind so inclines, the non-returner should not 
      find it difficult to enter upon the jhānas.</P>
      <P>Another reason why non-returners should be gainers of the jhānas, while 
      stream-enterers and once-returners need not be so, pertains to their 
      future destination in saṃsāra. Though all three types of disciple have 
      escaped the plane of misery -- rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the 
      sphere of ghosts -- stream-enterers and once-returners are still liable to 
      rebirth in the sensuous realm (kāmadhātu), while non-returners are utterly 
      freed from the prospect of such a rebirth. What keeps the former in 
      bondage to the sensuous realm is the fetter of sensual desire 
      (kāmacchanda), which remains inwardly unabandoned by them. If they succeed 
      in attaining the jhānas, they can suppress sensual desire (and the other 
      mental hindrances) and thus achieve rebirth in the form or formless 
      realms. But this is not fixed for noble disciples at the lower two stages, 
      who normally expect only a fortunate rebirth in the human realm or the 
      sense-sphere heavens. Non-returners, on the other hand, are so called 
      precisely because they never again return to the sensuous realm. They have 
      eliminated sensual desire, observe celibacy, and enjoy a high degree of 
      facility in meditation. At death, the non-returner takes rebirth 
      spontaneously in the form realm (generally in the Pure Abodes) and attains 
      final Nibbāna there without ever returning from that world. </P>
      <P>The non-returner severs all connection with the sensuous realm by 
      eliminating the fetter of sensual desire, and this establishes a certain 
      correspondence between the non-returner and the ordinary jhāna-attainer. 
      The texts sometimes speak of the worldling jhāna-attainer as &quot;an outsider 
      devoid of lust for sensual pleasures.&quot;[38] If he retains mastery over a 
      jhāna at the time of death, his sublime kamma leads him to rebirth in the 
      form realm, the specific plane of rebirth being determined by his degree 
      of mastery over the jhānas. However, while both the ordinary 
      jhāna-attainer and the non-returner are devoid of sensual desire and bound 
      for rebirth in a non-sensuous realm, the two are divided by deep and 
      fundamental differences. The ordinary jhāna-attainer has not fully 
      eliminated any fetters and thus, with a slip of mindfulness, can easily 
      fall victim to sensuality; the non-returner, in contrast, has cut off 
      sensual desire and ill will at the root, ensuring that they will never 
      again arise in him. He is not reborn in the form realm merely through the 
      wholesome kamma generated by the jhānas, like the ordinary jhāna-attainer, 
      but because he has eradicated the two fetters that bind even the 
      once-returner to the sensuous realm.</P>
      <P>This difference implies still another difference concerning their 
      long-term fate. The ordinary jhāna-attainer, after being reborn in the 
      form realm, eventually exhausts the powerful meritorious kamma responsible 
      for this sublime rebirth and might then take rebirth in the sensuous 
      realm, even in the nether world. The non-returner, on the other hand, 
      never falls away. Set firmly on the path of the Dhamma, the non-returner 
      who is reborn in the form realm continues to develop the path without ever 
      regressing until he attains final Nibbāna within the form realm 
      itself.[39] </P>

      <P>Conclusions and an Afterthought</B> </P>
      </FONT><FONT FACE="VU Times">
      <P>Our study has led us to the following conclusions regarding the 
      relationship between lay noble disciples and the jhānas.</P>
      <P>(1) Several suttas describe the process by which a worldling enters 
      &quot;the fixed course of rightness&quot; in a way that emphasizes either faith or 
      wisdom as the chief means of attainment. None of the texts, however, that 
      deal with the two candidates for stream-entry -- the faith-follower and 
      the Dhamma-follower -- show them as being proficient in the jhānas. Though 
      some suttas include the jhānas in the analysis of the faculty of 
      concentration, this may be done simply out of compliance with the 
      formulaic style of definition employed by the Nikāyas and need not be seen 
      as having categorical implications. The Commentaries treat these 
      definitions as referring to the supramundane jhāna arisen within the 
      supramundane path. Moreover, the analysis of the concentration faculty 
      mentions another type of concentration, which is gained &quot;by making release 
      the object,&quot; and this may be interpreted broadly enough as including 
      degrees of concentration short of the jhānas.</P>
      <P>(2) All noble disciples acquire the right concentration of the Noble 
      Eightfold Path, which is defined as the four jhānas. This need not be 
      understood to mean that stream-enterers and once-returners already possess 
      jhāna before they reach stream-entry. The formula for right concentration 
      may imply only that they must eventually attain the jhānas in the course 
      of developing the path to its culmination in arahantship. If we go along 
      with the Commentaries in recognizing the Abhidhammic distinction between 
      the preparatory path and the supramundane path, then we can maintain that 
      the jhānas included in right concentration as a path factor pertain to the 
      supramundane path and are thus of supramundane stature. This still leaves 
      open the question whether aspirants for stream-entry must develop the 
      mundane jhānas in the preliminary phase of their practice.</P>
      <P>(3) A number of texts on stream-enterers and once-returners imply that 
      they do not possess the jhānas as meditative attainments which they can 
      enter at will. Though it is obvious that disciples at the lower two levels 
      may have jhānic attainments, the latter are not declared to be an integral 
      part of their spiritual equipment. </P>
      <P>(4) Several non-returners in the Nikāyas claim to possess all four 
      jhānas, and according to the Mahāmāluṅkya Sutta, attainment of at least 
      the first jhāna is part of the practice leading to the eradication of the 
      five lower fetters. It thus seems likely that stream-enterers and 
      once-returners desirous of advancing to non-returnership in that very same 
      life must attain at least the first jhāna as a basis for developing 
      insight. Those content with their status, prepared to let the &quot;law of the 
      Dhamma&quot; take its course, generally will not strive to attain the jhānas. 
      Instead, they settle for the assurance that they are bound to reach the 
      final goal within a maximum of seven more lives passed in the human and 
      celestial worlds.</P>
      <P>(5) As non-returners have eliminated sensual lust and ill will, the 
      main obstacles to jhānic attainment, they should face no major problems in 
      entering the jhānas. The non-returner is similar to the ordinary 
      jhāna-attainer in being bound for rebirth in the form realm. Unlike the 
      latter, however, the non-returner is utterly free from sensual desire and 
      ill will and thus can never fall back to the sensuous realm.</P>
      <P>(6) Although in the Nikāyas the tie between the two attainments -- the 
      jhānas and non-returnership -- is clear enough, it remains an open 
      question whether the connection is absolutely binding. Several suttas 
      speak of the achievements of non-returners without mentioning the jhānas, 
      and at least one sutta contrasts the non-returner who gains all four 
      jhānas with one who practises more austere types of meditation that do not 
      typically lead to the jhānas.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <P>The Commentaries speak even of a sukkhavipassaka arahant, an arahant 
      who has gained the goal entirely through &quot;dry insight,&quot; without any 
      attainment of form-sphere jhāna at all. Although such a type is not 
      explicitly recognized in the Nikāyas, the question may be raised whether 
      the Commentaries, in asserting the possibility of arahantship without 
      attainment of jhāna in the mundane portion of the path, have deviated from 
      the Canon or brought to light a viable possibility implict in the older 
      texts. The famous Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta declares, in its conclusion, that all 
      those who earnestly dedicate themselves to uninterrupted practice of the 
      four establishments of mindfulness are bound to reap one of two fruits: 
      either arahantship in this very life or, if any residue of clinging 
      remains, the stage of non-returning. While several exercises within the 
      Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta are certainly capable of inducing the jhānas, the 
      system as a whole seems oriented towards direct insight rather than 
      towards the jhānas.[40] Thus this opens the question whether the 
      Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta might not be propounding a way of practice that leads 
      all the way to non-returning, even to arahantship, without requiring 
      attainment of the jhānas. This, however, is another question, one that 
      lies beyond the scope of this paper. </P>

      commenting on SN 12:70.</P>
      <P>3. For example, at DN II 92 the Buddha testifies that numerous lay 
      disciples who had died had reached the first three stages, and at MN I 
      490-91 he declares that he has &quot;many more than five hundred&quot; lay disciples 
      who have become non-returners. The question of lay arahantship is a vexed 
      one. While the texts record several cases of lay people who attained 
      arahantship, immediately afterwards they either take ordination or expire. 
      This is the basis for the traditional belief that if a lay person attains 
      arahantship, he or she either enters the Sangha that very day or passes 
      away.</P>

      two types of persons who, though the terms are not used, are clearly 
      identifiable as the dhammānusārī and saddhānusārī.</P>

      too AN 5:15/III 12, where it is said that the power of concentration 
      (samādhibala) &quot;is to be seen among the four jhānas.&quot;</P>
      <P>12. At SN 48:10/V 198, the faculty of concentration is defined by the 
      formula for the four jhānas. At AN 5:14/III 11, the power of concentation 
      (samādhibala) is similarly defined.</P>

      <P>14. Throughout the Magga-saṃyutta, the expression vossagga-pariṇāmi, 
      &quot;maturing in release,&quot; is used to describe the factors of the Noble 
      Eightfold Path. This suggests that vossagga, as the goal of the path, is 
      Nibbāna.</P>
      <P>15. Below I will elaborate on the distinction between the form-sphere 
      and supramundane jhānas.</P>
      <P>16. Spk III 234, commenting on SN 48:9.</P>
      <P>17. Pṭs III 586-87 seems to take this tack in commenting on the 
      expression thus: &quot;Having as object release: here release is Nibbāna, for 
      Nibbāna is called release because it is the releasing of the conditioned, 
      its relinquishment. Insight and the phenomena associated with it have 
      Nibbāna as object, Nibbāna as support, because they are established on 
      Nibbāna as their support in the sense of slanting towards it by way of 
      inclination. Concentration is nondistraction distinguished into access and 
      absorption (upacārappanābhedo avikkhepo), consisting in the 
      one-pointedness of mind aroused by being established on Nibbāna, with that 
      as cause by taking as object release of the phenomena produced therein. 
      Concentration partaking of penetration (nibbedhabhāgiyo samādhi), aroused 
      subsequent to insight, is described.&quot; From this, it seems that 
      &quot;concentration having release as its object&quot; can be understood as a 
      concentration aroused through the practice of insight meditation, aiming 
      at the attainment of Nibbāna.</P>
      <P>18. The fullest discussion of this sevenfold typology is at MN I 
      477-79. The seven types are also defined, somewhat differently, at Pp 
      14-15.</P>
      <P>19. One possible exception to this statement is a curious sutta, AN 
      7:53/ IV 78. Here the Buddha begins by discussing the first six types, of 
      which the first two are said to be &quot;without residue&quot; (anupādisesa), i.e., 
      of defilements, which means that they are arahants; the next four are said 
      to be &quot;with residue&quot; (sa-upādisesa), meaning they have some defilements 
      and thus are not yet arahants. But in the seventh position, where we would 
      expect to find the saddhānusārī, he inserts instead &quot;the seventh type, the 
      person who dwells in the signless&quot; (sattamaṃ animittavihāriṃ puggalaṃ). 
      This is explained as &quot;a monk who, through non-attention to all signs, 
      enters and dwells in the signless mental concentration&quot; (bhikkhu 
      sabbanimittānaṃ amanasikārā animittaṃ cetosamādhiṃ upasampajja viharati). 
      This assertion seems to open up, as an alternative to the faith-follower, 
      a class of aspirants for stream-entry who specialize in concentration. But 
      this passage is unique in the Nikāyas and has not formed the basis for an 
      alternative system of classification. Moreover, the commentary explains 
      the &quot;signless mental concentration&quot; to be &quot;strong insight concentration&quot; 
      (balava-vipassanā-samādhi), so called because it removes the signs of 
      permanence, pleasure, and selfhood. (See Mp IV 40 PTS ed.; II 720 SHB ed.) 
      Thus it is questionable whether even the recognition of this type means 
      that samatha concentration determines a class of disciple on the path to 
      stream-entry.</P>
      <P>20. For example, at DN II 313 and SN V 10.</P>
      <P>21. The distinction is found already in Dhs, in its analysis of the 
      classes of wholesome consciousness pertaining to the sphere of form and 
      the supramundane types of wholesome consciousness. See too the 
      Jhāna-vibhaṅga (Abhidhamma-bhājanīya) of Vibh.</P>
      <P>22. See Vism XXI, 112-16.</P>
      <P>23. MN No. 117. In this sutta the Buddha distinguishes five of the path 
      factors, from right view through right livelihood, into two kinds, one 
      &quot;connected with taints, partaking of merit, ripening in the aggregates&quot; 
      (sāsava puññabhāgiya upadhivepakka), the other &quot;noble, taintless, 
      supramundane, a factor of the path&quot; (ariya anāsava lokuttara maggaṅga). 
      &quot;Noble right concentration with its supports and requisites&quot; (ariya sammā 
      samādhi sa-upanisa sa-parikkhāra) is mental one-pointedness equipped with 
      the other seven factors in their noble, supramundane dimension. If the 
      latter is understood to be supramundane jhāna, then we might suppose the 
      jhānas usually described in the training of the disciple are &quot;connected 
      with taints, partaking of merit, ripening in the aggregates.&quot; The texts 
      never describe the jhānas in quite these terms, but some suttas imply 
      their attainment leads only to a higher rebirth without necessarily 
      conducing to deliverance. See note 39 below.</P>
      <I>
      <P>[39. See AN 4:123/II 126-28, which contrasts the worldling who attains 
      the jhānas with the Buddhist disciple who attains them.]</P>

      <P>28. Saddhā, sīla, suta, cāga, paññā. Sometimes learning is omitted, 
      since this is not as integral to the ariyan character as the other four 
      qualities.</P>

      <P>34. According to the commentary, the fourth formless state, the base of 
      neither-perception-nor-non-perception, is not mentioned because its 
      constituents are too subtle to be comprehended by insight. But a parallel 
      text, AN 9:36/IV 422-26, teaches a method by which the fourth formless 
      attainment, as well as the cessation of feeling and perception, can be 
      used to generate insight and thereby reach arahantship or non-returning.</P>
      <P>35. MN I 435-36: So tatthaṭṭhito āsavānaṃ khayaṃ pāpuṇāti; no ce

      <P>39. See AN 4:123/II 126-28, which contrasts the worldling who attains 
      the jhānas with the Buddhist disciple who attains them.</P>
      <P>40. This is a widespread view among contemporary interpreters, though 
      the sutta itself does not describe its method explicitly in such terms.
