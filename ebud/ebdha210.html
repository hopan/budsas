        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">FEAR AND WORRY</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Fear and worry are born of
        the imaginings of a mind that is influenced by wordly conditions. They
        are rooted in craving and attachment. In fact, life is like a motion
        picture in which everything is constantly moving and changing. Nothing
        in this world is permanent or still. Those who are youthful and strong
        have fear of dying young. Those who are old and suffering worry about
        living too long. Locked in between are those who craze for merriment all
        the year round.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Joyful expectations of the
        pleasant seem to pass off too quickly. Fearful expectations of the
        unpleasant create anxieties that do not seem to go away. Such feelings
        are natural. Such up and downs of life play with an illusionary self or
        ego like puppets on a string. But the mind is supreme unto itself.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The training of the mind,
        otherwise known as mental culture, is the first step towards taming
        mental unrest. The Buddha has explained:</font></p>
        <b><i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;From craving springs
        grief,<br>
        from craving springs fear<br>
        For him who is wholly free from craving,<br>
        there is no grief, much less fear&quot;</font></i><font face="Times New Roman">.</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All attachments will end in
        sorrow. Neither tears not long goodbyes can end the transitoriness of
        life. All compounded things are impermanent.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Old and young suffer in
        this existence. No one is exempted. Many teenagers have growing pains.
        Being neither frogs nor tadpoles, teenagers are understandably
        inexperienced at building stable relationships with members of the
        opposite sex. They try to show off their beauty in trying to impress
        their opposite sex who are flattered to see themselves as sex objects.
        Both try to behave not as they really are but as what they think is
        adult. They are afraid that if they behave naturally they will be
        laughed at. Beheviour like this has the potential for exploitation.
        There is fear of rejection as well as worry about deflated egos.
        Unrequited love will often &quot;break&quot; many teenagers hearts
        because they feel they have made &quot;fools of themselves&quot;. Some
        are driven to commit suicide. But such traumas could be avoided if life
        is seen as it really is. Young people must be taught the Buddhist
        approach to life, so that they can grow into maturity the correct way.</font></p>
        <b><i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">'Wheresoever fear arises,
        it arises in the fool, not in the wise men'</font></i><font face="Times New Roman">.</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
        says the Buddha. Fear is nothing more than a state of mind. One's state
        of mind is subject to control and direction; the negative thought
        produces fear, the positive use realizes hopes and ideals. The choice
        rests entirely with ourselves. Every human being has the ability to
        control his own mind. Nature has endowed man with absolute control over
        one thing, and that is thought. Everything a man creates begins in the
        form of a thought. Here is the key to help one understand the principle
        by which fear may be mastered.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A noted British anatomist
        was once asked by a student what was the best cure for fear, and he
        answered:<b><i>&quot;Try doing something for some one&quot;</i></b>.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The student was
        considerably astonished by the reply, and requested further
        enlightenment whereupon his instructor said:</font><b><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;You
        cannot have two opposing sets of thoughts in your mind at one and the
        same time. One set of thoughts will always drive the other out. If, for
        instance, your mind is completely occupied with an unselfish desire to
        help someone else,you can't be harbouring fear at the same time.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Worry dries up the
        blood sooner than age&quot;</font></i></b><font face="Times New Roman"><i>.</i></font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Fear and worry in
        moderation are natural instincts of self-preservation. But constant
        irrational fear and prolonged worry are relentless enemies to the human
        body. They derange the normal bodily functions.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">CONTROL YOUR MIND</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Man's mind influences his
        body profoundly. The mind has just as much potential to be a medication
        as it has to be a poison. When the mind is vicious, it can kill a being
        but when it is steady and diligent it can benefit others. When the mind
        is concentrated on right thoughts, and supported by right effort and
        understanding, the effect it produces is immense. A mind with pure and
        wholesome thoughts leads to healthy relaxed living.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha says: </font><b><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No
        enemy can harm one so much as one's own thoughts of craving, thoughts of
        hate, thoughts of jalousy and so on&quot;.</font></p>
        </i></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A man who does not know how
        to adjust his mind according to circumstances is as if dead. Turn your
        mind inwards, and try to find pleasure within yourself.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is only when the mind is
        controlled and properly directed that it becomes useful to its owner and
        society. An unruly mind is a liability both to its</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">owner and to others. All
        the havoc wrought in this world is the creation of men who have not
        learned the way of mind control, balance and poise.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Calmness is not weakness. A
        calm attitude at all times shows a man of culture. It is not too hard
        for one to be calm when things are favourable, but to be composed when
        things are wrong is hard indeed. It is this difficult quality that is
        worth achieving, for by exercing such calm and control, a man builds
        strength of character.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">THE VOICE OF NATURE</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Modern man does not listen
        to the voice of nature because of his preoccupation with material gain
        and pleasure. His mental activities are so preoccupied with wordly
        pleasures that he neglects the needs of his spiritual self. This
        unnatural behaviour of contemporary man immediately results in a wrong
        world view of human life and its ultimate purpose. It is the cause of
        all frustation, anxiety, fear, and insecurity of our present times.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If man is cruel and wicked,
        lives against the laws of nature and the cosmos, his acts, words and
        thougths pollute the whole atmosphere. Nature abused will not provide
        what man requires for his living; instead, clashes, conflicts, epidemics
        and disaters will be in store for him.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If man lives in accordance
        with the natural law, leads a righteous life, purifies the atmosphere
        through the merits of his virtues and radiates his compassionate love
        towards other living beings, he can bring human happiness. One who
        really likes peace should not violate another man's freedom. It is wrong
        to disturb and deceive others.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">You may be a very busy
        person, but spend at least a few minutes a day in meditation or in
        reading some valuable books. This habit will r&#7865;lieve you of your
        worries and will develop your mind. Religion is your benefit. Therefore,
        it is your duty to think about your religion. Spare some time to attend
        gatherings held in a religious atmosphere. Even a short period spent in
        the company of spiritually inclined people will produce good results.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">MENTAL HEALTH AND CRIMINAL
        TENDENCIES</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The increase of all kinds
        of mental ailments and disturbances is the most alarming of all diseases
        of modern age. There are more and more mentally sick patients all over
        the world; especially in affluent countries.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In many cases the criminal
        element within our society is mentioned in the same breath as mental
        illness. One positive and far-reaching result stemming directly from the
        research work of Freud, is the recognition that criminals and
        delinquents are mentally sick people, who need treatment rather than
        punishment. It is this liberal outlook on the problem that is the basis
        all &quot;progressive&quot; social reform to replace punishment with
        rehabilitation.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we do not see how
        people live, we may not learn the different ways of living. Travel is
        the best form of education. Personal encounters with people different
        from ourselves make us feel more sympathetic. Intolerance is often born
        of ignorance of another person's needs and way of thinking.</font></p>

        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's taught that
        all of man's unhappiness results from selfish desire: more pleassure
        that money can buy, more power over other men, and, most important of
        all, to live forever, even after death! The desire for these things
        makes people selfish. They think only of themselves, want things only
        for themselves, and do not care about what happens to other people. When
        their wishes are not fulfilled, they become restless and discontented.
        The only way to avoid this restlessness is to get rid of the desires
        that cause it. This is very difficult, but when a man achieves it, he
        appreciates it.</font></p>

        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Trouble passes. What has
        caused you to burst into tears will be soon forgotten. You may remember
        that you cried but not why you did so! As we grow up and go through
        life, we are often surprised at how we lie awake at night brooding over
        something that has upset us during the day, or how we nurse resentment
        against someone by letting the same thoughts run through our minds
        concerning how to have our own back. We may fall into a rage at the spur
        of the moment over something, and later wonder what it was we were so
        angry about, and be surpised to realise what a waste of time and energy
        it had all been. We have deliberately gone on being unhappy when we
        could have stopped being so and started thinking about something else
        more wholesome.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Whatever our troubles are,
        and however aggrieved we may feel, time will heal our wounds. But surely
        there must be something we can do to prevent ourselves from being hurt
        in the first place. Why should we allow others or troubles to drain away
        our energy and make us unhappy? The answer is that they do not. It is we
        who make ourselves unhappy.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">You may have some trouble
        in your work place but you should not infect your home with a bad
        atmosphere. You should realise that there is an end to those problems.
        The solutions could be found in achieving freedom from our selfish
        desires by eradicating all forms of confusion and ignorance.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Whenever we fail to find a
        solution to a problem, we are inclined to find a scapegoat to vent our
        frustration. We are not prepared to admit our own shortcomings. It is
        easier to put the blame on others. In fact, some even take pleasure in
        doing so. This is a completely wrong attitude to adopt. We must not show
        resentment towards others. We should do our utmost, pains-takingly and
        calmly, to resolve our own problems. We must be prepaired to face up to
        any difficulties that we encounter.</font></p>

        to avoid enmity with anybody. Losing your cool whole playing the game

        spoil the pleasure of those watching the game.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are many ways of
        correcting a person when he is wrong. By criticising, blaming and
        railing at him in public, you will be humiliating and not correcting
        him. Criticism is certain to make more enemies. If you can show concern
        for a man's future good with kind words, he will thank you for it
        someday.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Never use harsh or

        many doors.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Do not feel defensive when
        your own faults are pointed out. Your faults are your signposts for
        learning perfection. Temper is a poor camouflage for shortcomings. When
        someone loses his temper he will blurt out too many things better left
        unsaid. Never reveal a former friend's personal secret no matter how
        angry you are with him now. You will only degrade yourself in the
        process and others could never accept you as sincere friend thereafter.
        Others will think you could do the same thing you did to injure a former

        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For most people, death is
        an unwelcome event. With so many cravings to be satisfied, the business
        of living in spite of enormous suffering is never quite finished. People
        feel more comfortable with the mirage of happiness than with the reality
        of death. If at all they have to think about it, it only has a slot in
        the eleventh hour.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Attachments to wordly life
        create a morbid fear of death. But the truth is that all life is nothing
        but suffering. Death is natural and inevitable. It is not half as
        frightening as the thought of dying itself. The mind has an ability of
        its own to create and to stretch phantom images of death. The reason is
        that a mind untrained to see life with all its impermanence and
        unsatisfactoriness, is likely to cling to illusions just as a drowning
        man will even cling to a straw.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It creates uneasiness even
        for those who fervently pray to an imaginary supernatural being for
        forgiveness and a place in heaven when life seems hopeless. Of course
        the fear of death is a manifestation of instinctive self-preservation.
        But there is a way to overcome that fear. Do some selfless service for
        the welfare of others to gain hope and confidence in the next life.
        Altruism purges all selfish attachments.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Purity of the mind, not
        attachment to worldly things, will ensure a happy parting from this
        world. It is the constant contemplation on death to understand the
        impermanence of life, and the wisdom to correct the wrong way of living,
        that take the fear out of death. Strenghten the mind to face fact and
        realities of life. Avoid unrealistic and impracticable ambitions.
        Develop self-confidence. Then you will be more relaxed in overcoming
        your difficulties in life.</font></p>

        blame others for our own shortcomings and misfortunes. Have you ever
        given a thought that you yourself could be responsible for your own
        problem? Your sorrow has nothing to do with a family curse or the
        original sin of an ancestor. Neither is it the work of a god or a devil.
        Your sorrow is of your own making. You are therefore your own jailor and
        your own liberator. At the same time, you create your own hell and your
        own heaven. You have the potentiality of becoming a sinner or a saint.
        No other person can make you a sinner or a saint.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">You must learn to shoulder
        the responsibilities of your own life. You have to learn to admit your

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Whenever any problem
        arises, we as understanding people should try to find out ourselves
        where the mistake lies without blaming anybody. If each person could try
        to correct himself, there would not be any trouble or conflict in this
        world. But people just do not make the effort to improve their
        understanding by acting unbiasedly. They prefer to find scapegoats. They
        look outside of themselves for the source of their troubles because they
        are reluctant to admit their own weaknesses.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Man's mind is given to so
        much self-deceit that he will try to find some excuse to justify his
        action so as to create an illusion that he is blameless. The Buddha
        says:</font></p>
        <b><i>

        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To hide their weaknesses
        with disclaimers for mistakes, many people adopt an aggressive attitude
        towards others thinking that by so doing, they can avoid the shameful
        situation or the cause of the complaint against them. They do not
        realise that such an attitude would only create more problems for
        themselves besides giving rise to an unhealthy atmosphere all around.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">You must admit when you are
        wrong. Do not follow the ways of the uncultured who always blame others.

        frame of mind. You are hurt only by the mental attitude that you adopt
        towards yourself and towards others. If you show a loving attitude
        towards others, you will likewise receive a loving attitude. If you show
        hate, you will undoubtedly receive hate in return. An angry man breathes
        out poison, and he hurts himself more than he would hurt others.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">An angry man who shouts at
        others will be unable to see things in proper perspective as if smoke
        got into his eyes. Anyone who is wise not to be angered cannot be hurt.
        Always remember that no one can hurt you unless you pave the way for
        others to do so. If you follow the Dhamma (righteous way of life), that
        Dhamma will protect you. The Buddha says:</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If you learn to guard your
        mind properly, external happenings cannot affect you. You must not blame
        circumstances when things go wrong. You must not think that you are
        unlucky, that you are the victim of fate, or that somebody has cursed
        you or had done some 'charm' against you. No matter what reason you
        give, you must not evade responsibility for your own actions. Try to

        service to others also face problems. They even encounter more blame
        than those who do not serve others at all. You should not be
        discouraged; instead, have the understanding to realise that selfless
        service eventually brings happiness as its own reward. In rendering our

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">You must learn how to guard
        yourself against unjust criticism and how to make sensible use of
        constructive criticism. You must always look objectively at criticism.
        If the criticism levelled at you is injust, ill-founded, given with a
        bad intention, you should not cowardly surrender your dignity. If you
        know that there is no consciencious guilt in you, your attitude is
        correct and appreciated by wise people, then you need not worry about
        ill-founded criticism. Your understanding of both constructive and

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">You can avoid
        disappointments by not having any expectation for your service. If you
        expect nothing, then nothing can disappoint you. Do something for the
        benefit of others to relieve suffering. If you can do that without
        expecting any kind of reward, then you can have no cause of
        disappointment. You can be a contented man! The happiness that appears
        in your mind for the good that you have done, is itself a big reward.
        That happiness creates immense satisfaction in your life. By expecting
        reward, you not only miss your happiness, but very often you will even
        experience bitter disappointment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps, you may be a
        person who is good by nature and so you do not harm others. But
        nevertheless you get blamed despite having done good. Then you might ask
        &quot;If good begets good and bad begets bads, why should I have to
        suffer when I am completely innocent? Why should I have to undergo so
        many difficulties? Why should I be troubled with so many disturbances?
        Why should I get blamed by others despite my good work?&quot;The simple
        answer is that when you do some good deeds you may unwittingly be going
        against many evil forces at work in the universe. Those evil forces
        naturally interrupt good deeds. If not, it could be that you are facing
        the evil effects of some past evil deeds (kamma) that is ripening at the
        present moment. By continuing your good work with sound understanding,
        you will eventually be free from such troubles. Since you are the one
        who initially created the disappointments, it is reasonable that only
        you can overcome them - by realising the true situation of your wordly

        defeated and miserable. Since he did not co-operate with you to fulfil
        your wish, it is he who is victorious. The Buddha teaches us how to live
        happily when we are faced with disturbances.</font></p>

        Therefore they need guidance.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We should not curse them.
        It is not justifiable for us to say that they should be condemned to
        everlasting suffering as it is still not too late to correct them. We
        should try to explain to them in a very convincing way that they are in
        fact in the wrong. With this understanding, you can treat the evil-doer
        as you would a patient who is suffering from a sickness and in need of
        treatment. When the sickness is cured the ex-patient and everyone else
        will be well and happy. The ignorant must be guided by the wise.</font></p>

        wrong to you of ignorance or misunderstanding, then that is the time to
        radiate your compassionate love towards the evil-doer. One day, he will
        realise this folly and relent on his evil habits. So it is better to
        give him a chance to be good. Repentance of his past misdeeds will
        change him into a better person and in the end he will truly appreciate
        your kind thoughts. The most compassionate Buddha's advice is:</font></p>
        <b>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If you can radiate
        compassionate love, no harm will come to you. This will help you to
        achieve both physical and mental health. Life has its own rythm.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When you lose on the swing,
        you gain on the roundabout. Those who do not understand this principle
        often get into trouble and face difficulties in life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If a man does something
        wrong to you again and again, you must act wisely in correcting him each
        time he makes the mistake. Although it not so easy to do that, you
        should nevertheless try your best to follow the example set by the
        Buddha. Then you will come to know that it is after all not impossible.
        The attitude of the Buddha in such a situation could be summerised thus:</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>The more evil that

        not practicable to return good for evil. Try it and see for yourself. If
        you find it too difficult to return good for evil, then you can still do
        a great service to yourself and to others by not returning evil for
        evil.</font></p>

        weaknesses and are therefore prone to make mistake. All human beings
        have desire, anger and ignorance. These weaknesses prevail in all of us
        in varying degrees. unless you are perfect or an Arahant, you are no
        exception. The nature of the human mind shows itself in the following

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Let us take a closer look
        at a man who is envelopped by ignorance. His mind is clouded by
        disturbances, confusion and darkness. Out of ignorance, man creates
        misfortunes and he shares this with his fellow men. most of the worry
        and misery that come to man are due to changing wordly conditions and
        man's own craving for wordly pleasures which to his selfish mind should
        continue forever. Disappointment unfulfilled desires which arise from
        unexpected changes create worry. Therefore you are responsible for your
        worry.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Nobody is perfect in this
        world; everybody is liable some time to commit certain mistakes or evil
        actions. So how can you think that you are free from mistakes or evil?
        Ignorance is the main cause for nurturing the impulse of craving which
        in turn generates worry.</font></p>

        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">You are responsible for the
        well-being and upbringing of your children. If the child grows up to be
        a strong, healthy, and useful citizen, it is the result of your efforts.
        If the child grows up to be a delinquent, it is you who must bear the
        responsibility. Do not blame others. As parents, it is your bounden duty
        to guide your child on a proper path. Although there are a few
        incorrigible cases of juvenile delinquency, nevertheless as parents, you
        are responsible for the behaviour of your children.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A child at its most
        impressionable age, needs the love, care, affection and attention of the
        parents. Without parental love and guidance, the child will be
        emotionally handicapped and will find the world a bewildering place to
        live in. Showering parental love does not mean pandering to all the
        demands of the child, reasonable or otherwise. Too much pampering would
        in fact spoil the child. The mother in bestowing her love and care,
        should also be strict and firm but not harsh, in handling the tantrums
        of a child. Show your love with a disciplined hand - the child will
        understand.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, all too
        often parental love in our present day society is sadly lacking. The
        rush for material advancement, and the rising aspiration for equality of
        the sexes, have resulted in many mothers joining their husbands in the
        rat-race. Mothers struggle to maintain their family image or status
        symbol by working in offices and shops, rather than being at home
        tendering to the needs of their off-spring.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Children who are left to
        the care of relatives or paid servants, as well as 'latch key' children
        who are left to their own devices at home, are often deprived of
        motherly love and care. The mother, feeling guilty about her lack of
        attention, would try to placate the child by giving in to all sorts of
        demands of the child. Such action only spoils the child.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Providing the child with
        sophisticated modern toys that are detrimental to character formation
        such as tanks, machine guns, pistols, swords and the like are
        psychological unwholesome. The child is</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">unwittingly being taught to
        condone destruction instead of being taught to be kind, compassionate
        and helpful. Such a child will develop brutal tendencies as they grow
        up. Giving a child such toys is no substitute for a mother's love and
        affection.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parents are often placed in
        a dilemma. Rushing home from a hard day's work the weary parents have
        family chores waiting upon them. When the day's work is done, it would
        be time for dinner followed by T.V., and whatever time there is left, is
        hardly enough to attend a child's rightful dues of parental love and
        affection.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With the call of women's
        liberation, many women seem to think that the solution is to compete
        with men outside the home. Such women should consider very carefully
        whether to bear children. It is irresponsible for a mother to bring a
        life into this world and then 'abandon' it. You are responsible for what
        you create.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A child has a right to be
        satisfied materially, but more importantly spiritually and
        psychologically. The provision of material comfort is secondery compared
        to the provision of parental love and attention. We know of many people
        from poor homes who have with meagre income, brought up children well
        and plenty of love. Conversely, many rich people have provided every</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">material comfort for their
        children, but being deprived of parental love, these children have grown
        up to become phsychologically and morally handicapped.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some women may feel that
        advising them to concentrate on the upbringing of the family is
        something degrading and reflects the thinking of the old and the
        conservative. It is true that in the past women have been treated very
        badly, but this was due more to ignorance on the part of men than to an
        inherent weakness in women. The Sanskrit word for a housewife is
        'Gruhini' which literally means <i>'leader of the house'</i>. Certainly
        it does not imply that a women is inferior. Rather it means a division
        of responsibility for the male and the female.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In certain countries, many
        husbands hand over their pay packet to their wives who handle domestic
        affairs. This leaves the man free to concentrate on what he can do best.
        Since each partner knows clearly what his of her reponsibilities are,
        there is no conflict between them. The atmosphere at home is happy and
        peaceful where their children can grow up well.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, the husband must
        see to it that his partner is well cared for, that she is consulted on
        every family decision, that there is enough freedom for her to develop
        her own personality and that she has her own free time to pursue her
        personal interests. In this</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">sense, husband and wife are
        equally responsible for the welfare of their family. They are not in
        competition with each other.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A mother should consider
        carefully whether she should continue as a working mother with all the
        attendant pitfalls or as a housewife giving all her due affection and
        care to her growing child. Strangely, some modern mothers, particularly
        in certain countries with military regimes facing a shortage of
        manpower, are being trained to handle guns of other deadly weapons when
        they should be cuddling their children and training them to be good or
        law-abiding citizens.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The modern attitude of
        working mothers towards their children tends to erode the time-honoured
        filial piety which children are expected to uphold. The replacement of
        breast-feeding by bottle feeding is yet another cause. Hitherto, when
        mothers used to breast-feed and cuddle babies in their arms, the tender
        affection between mother and child become much greater. A breast feeding
        mother, through her maternal instinct, often experiences a tremendous
        satisfaction from knowing she is providing the baby, as nature has
        intended, with something of her very own which no one else can give. The
        influence a mother has on the child grows and becomes much more
        pronounced.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Under such circonstances,
        filial piety, family cohesion and obedience are invariably present.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These traditional traits
        are for the good and the well-being of children. It is up to the
        parents, especially the mother to provide them with love, care and
        affection as their rightful dues. The mother is responsible for the
        child being good or wayward. The mother can thus reduce juvenile
        delinquency! At the highest level of thinking, you can see things as
        they are, not as you are. Then you know that you are responsible for
        everything.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Whenever certain
        difficulties and problems arise, make up your mind to reduce your mental
        agony. First, you must try to understand the nature of the world where
        you live. You can never expect everything in this world to be perfect
        and to run smootly. The world situation may not always be in your
        favour. There could be no world and no life without problems. Natural
        forces like sunlight, rain, wind and moonlight are favourable and useful
        to many, yet at times they could be a nuisance to many others. There is
        in fact nothing perfectly bad of perfectly good in this world because
        the very things that are welcomed by one group could be hated by another
        group. Therefore, we define good and bad according to our needs. Things
        are neither good nor bad by nature, According to Buddhism, the world
        exist on conflict to which you become part of.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If you have strong selfish
        cravings for existence and the senses, you will have to pay the price -
        the mental agony of having to survive with a topsy-turvy view of the
        world. Wishful thinking, yearnings for eternity and clinging to feelings
        such as the elusive 'I' or 'Me' only warp the mind and its sense of
        time. Unfulfilled desires yields their crop of quarels, friction,
        communication failures, fear, worry, loneliness and anxiety. There are
        no free rides.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If you are desirous of
        eradicating the mental agony within you, you have to subdue selfish
        cravings. Life's journey has a T-junction. Either you take the right
        path and develop your spiritually to unwind the tensions of wordly life
        or you continue to indulge in sensual pleasures with their many
        attendant confrontations.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One way to relieve yourself
        of your occasional mental agony is to understand the degree of your own
        sufferings and difficulties compared with those experienced by others.
        When you are unhappy, you often feel that the world is against you. You
        think that everything around you is about to collapse. You feel that the
        end of the road is near. However, if you take a mental note of things
        around you and count your blessings, surprisingly, you will find that
        you are indeed much better off than many other people.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">You might have probably
        heard the saying: <b><i>'I complained I had no shoes until I met a man
        who has no feet'</i>.</b> In short, you have been unduly exaggerating
        your own difficulties and problems. Others are in fact worse off, and
        yet they do not worry themselves induly. Problems are there. You should
        try to solve them instead of worrying and creating mental anguish within
        you. The Chinese have a practical saying about solving problems:</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">'<b>If you have a big

        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Another way to reduce your
        problems is to recapitulate what you have gone through before, under
        similar or even worse circumstances; and how you have, through you own
        patience, initiative and effort,</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">been able to surmount your
        then seemingly insurmountable difficulties. By doing so, you will not
        permit your existing problems to '<b>drown you'. </b>On the contrary, by
        seeing life in a new perspective you will be able to solve whatever
        problems that you may now face.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">You should realise that you
        have gone through much worse situations before and that you are prepared
        to face them squarely, come what may. With this frame of mind, you will
        soon regain your self-confidence and be in a better position to solve
        whatever problems that will be in store for you.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If you are facing a
        problem, there must surely be a remedy to overcome it. So why worry? On
        the other hand, even if there is no solution for your problem, again why
        worry because your worry cannot contribute anything to settle your
        problem.</font></p>

        have lived. They feel they have been harmed through no fault of their
        own. Under such circumstances, the innocent victim must realise that the

        the bad and the not so bad, with all the unusual characters that go to
        make this world of ours. The innocent victim may console himself that he
        belongs to the good category whereas the disturber of the peace belongs
        to the bad, and that on certain occasions, he will still have to bear
        patiently the misdeeds of those belonging to the bad.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We take for instance the
