<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Kalamas of Kesaputta go to see the Buddha)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. I heard thus. Once the Blessed One, while wandering in
  the <a NAME="kosala">Kosala</a> country with a large community of bhikkhus, entered a town
  of the <a NAME="kalama">Kalama</a> people called <a NAME="kesaputta">Kesaputta</a>. The
  Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta: &quot;Reverend Gotama, the monk, the son of the
  Sakyans, has, while wandering in the Kosala country, entered Kesaputta. The good repute of
  the Reverend Gotama has been spread in this way: Indeed, the Blessed One is thus
  consummate, fully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and practice, sublime, knower of the
  worlds, peerless, guide of tamable men, teacher of divine and human beings, which he by
  himself has through direct knowledge understood clearly. He set forth the Dhamma, good in
  the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end, possessed of meaning and the letter,
  and complete in everything; and he proclaims the holy life that is perfectly pure. Seeing
  such consummate ones is good indeed.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Then the Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta went
  to where the Blessed One was. On arriving there some paid homage to him and sat down on
  one side; some exchanged greetings with him and after the ending of cordial memorable
  talk, sat down on one side; some saluted him raising their joined palms and sat down on
  one side; some announced their name and family and sat down on one side; some without
  speaking, sat down on one side. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The Kalamas of Kesaputta ask for guidance from the
  Buddha)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. The Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta sitting
  on one side said to the Blessed One: &quot;There are some monks and brahmins, venerable
  sir, who visit Kesaputta. They expound and explain only their own doctrines; the doctrines
  of others they despise, revile, and pull to pieces. Some other monks and brahmins too,
  venerable sir, come to Kesaputta. They also expound and explain only their own doctrines;
  the doctrines of others they despise, revile, and pull to pieces. Venerable sir, there is
  doubt, there is uncertainty in us concerning them. Which of these reverend monks and
  brahmins spoke the truth and which falsehood?&quot; </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The criterion for rejection)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. &quot;It is proper for you, Kalamas, to doubt, to be
  uncertain; uncertainty has arisen in you about what is doubtful. Come, Kalamas. Do not go
  upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon tradition; nor upon rumor; nor
  upon what is in a scripture; nor upon surmise; nor upon an axiom; nor upon specious
  reasoning; nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over; nor upon
  another's seeming ability; nor upon the consideration, 'The monk is our teacher.' Kalamas,
  when you yourselves know: 'These things are bad; these things are blamable; these things
  are censured by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to harm and ill,'
  abandon them. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman"><a NAME="defilements">(Greed, hate, and delusion)</a></font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. &quot;What do you think, Kalamas? Does greed appear in
  a man for his benefit or harm?&quot; -- &quot;For his harm, venerable sir.&quot; --
  &quot;Kalamas, being given to greed, and being overwhelmed and vanquished mentally by
  greed, this man takes life, steals, commits adultery, and tells lies; he prompts another
  too, to do likewise. Will that be long for his harm and ill?&quot; -- &quot;Yes, venerable
  sir.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. &quot;What do you think, Kalamas? Does hate appear in a
  man for his benefit or harm?&quot; -- &quot;For his harm, venerable sir.&quot; --
  &quot;Kalamas, being given to hate, and being overwhelmed and vanquished mentally by hate,
  this man takes life, steals, commits adultery, and tells lies; he prompts another too, to
  do likewise. Will that be long for his harm and ill?&quot; -- &quot;Yes, venerable
  sir.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. &quot;What do you think, Kalamas? Does delusion appear
  in a man for his benefit or harm?&quot; -- &quot;For his harm, venerable sir.&quot; --
  &quot;Kalamas, being given to delusion, and being overwhelmed and vanquished mentally by
  delusion, this man takes life, steals, commits adultery, and tells lies; he prompts
  another too, to do likewise. Will that be long for his harm and ill?&quot; -- &quot;Yes,
  venerable sir.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. &quot;What do you think, Kalamas? Are these things good
  or bad?&quot; -- &quot;Bad, venerable sir&quot; -- &quot;Blamable or not blamable?&quot;
  -- &quot;Blamable, venerable sir.&quot; -- &quot;Censured or praised by the wise?&quot; --
  &quot;Censured, venerable sir.&quot; -- &quot;Undertaken and observed, do these things
  lead to harm and ill, or not? Or how does it strike you?&quot; -- &quot;Undertaken and
  observed, these things lead to harm and ill. Thus it strikes us here.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">9. &quot;Therefore, did we say, Kalamas, what was said
  thus, 'Come Kalamas. Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon
  tradition; nor upon rumor; nor upon what is in a scripture; nor upon surmise; nor upon an
  axiom; nor upon specious reasoning; nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been
  pondered over; nor upon another's seeming ability; nor upon the consideration, &quot;The
  monk is our teacher.&quot; Kalamas, when you yourselves know: &quot;These things are bad;
  these things are blamable; these things are censured by the wise; undertaken and observed,
  these things lead to harm and ill,&quot; abandon them.' </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(The criterion for acceptance)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">10. &quot;Come, Kalamas. Do not go upon what has been
  acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon tradition; nor upon rumor; nor upon what is in a
  scripture; nor upon surmise; nor upon an axiom; nor upon specious reasoning; nor upon a
  bias towards a notion that has been pondered over; nor upon another's seeming ability; nor
  upon the consideration, 'The monk is our teacher.' Kalamas, when you yourselves know:
  'These things are good; these things are not blamable; these things are praised by the
  wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to benefit and happiness,' enter on and
  abide in them. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">(Absence of greed, hate, and delusion)</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">11. &quot;What do you think, Kalamas? Does absence of
  greed appear in a man for his benefit or harm?&quot; -- &quot;For his benefit, venerable
  sir.&quot; -- &quot;Kalamas, being not given to greed, and being not overwhelmed and not
  vanquished mentally by greed, this man does not take life, does not steal, does not commit
  adultery, and does not tell lies; he prompts another too, to do likewise. Will that be
  long for his benefit and happiness?&quot; -- &quot;Yes, venerable sir.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">12. &quot;What do you think, Kalamas? Does absence of hate
  appear in a man for his benefit or harm?&quot; -- &quot;For his benefit, venerable
  sir.&quot; -- &quot;Kalamas, being not given to hate, and being not overwhelmed and not
  vanquished mentally by hate, this man does not take life, does not steal, does not commit
  adultery, and does not tell lies; he prompts another too, to do likewise. Will that be
  long for his benefit and happiness?&quot; -- &quot;Yes, venerable sir.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">13. &quot;What do you think, Kalamas? Does absence of
  delusion appear in a man for his benefit or harm?&quot; -- &quot;For his benefit,
  venerable sir.&quot; -- &quot;Kalamas, being not given to delusion, and being not
  overwhelmed and not vanquished mentally by delusion, this man does not take life, does not
  steal, does not commit adultery, and does not tell lies; he prompts another too, to do
  likewise. Will that be long for his benefit and happiness?&quot; -- &quot;Yes, venerable
  sir.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">14. &quot;What do you think, Kalamas? Are these things
  good or bad?&quot; -- &quot;Good, venerable sir.&quot; -- &quot;Blamable or not
  blamable?&quot; -- &quot;Not blamable, venerable sir.&quot; -- &quot;Censured or praised
  by the wise?&quot; -- &quot;Praised, venerable sir.&quot; -- &quot;Undertaken and
  observed, do these things lead to benefit and happiness, or not? Or how does it strike
  you?&quot; -- &quot;Undertaken and observed, these things lead to benefit and happiness.
  Thus it strikes us here.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">15. &quot;Therefore, did we say, Kalamas, what was said
  thus, 'Come Kalamas. Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon
  tradition; nor upon rumor; nor upon what is in a scripture; nor upon surmise; nor upon an
  axiom; nor upon specious reasoning; nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been
  pondered over; nor upon another's seeming ability; nor upon the consideration, &quot;The
  monk is our teacher.&quot; Kalamas, when you yourselves know: &quot;These things are good;
  these things are not blamable; these things are praised by the wise; undertaken and
  observed, these things lead to benefit and happiness,&quot; enter on and abide in them.' </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman"><a NAME="dwellings">(The Four Exalted Dwellings)</a></font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">16. &quot;The disciple of the Noble Ones, Kalamas, who in
  this way is devoid of coveting, devoid of ill will, undeluded, clearly comprehending and
  mindful, dwells, having pervaded, with the thought of amity, one quarter; likewise the
  second; likewise the third; likewise the fourth; so above, below, and across; he dwells,
  having pervaded because of the existence in it of all living beings, everywhere, the
  entire world, with the great, exalted, boundless thought of amity that is free of hate or
  malice. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He lives, having pervaded, with the thought of
  compassion, one quarter; likewise the second; likewise the third; likewise the fourth; so
  above, below, and across; he dwells, having pervaded because of the existence in it of all
  living beings, everywhere, the entire world, with the great, exalted, boundless thought of
  compassion that is free of hate or malice. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He lives, having pervaded, with the thought of
  gladness, one quarter; likewise the second; likewise the third; likewise the fourth; so
  above, below, and across; he dwells, having pervaded because of the existence in it of all
  living beings, everywhere, the entire world, with the great, exalted, boundless thought of
  gladness that is free of hate or malice. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He lives, having pervaded, with the thought of
  equanimity, one quarter; likewise the second; likewise the third; likewise the fourth; so
  above, below, and across; he dwells, having pervaded because of the existence in it of all
  living beings, everywhere, the entire world, with the great, exalted, boundless thought of
  equanimity that is free of hate or malice. </font></p>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="solaces">(The Four Solaces)</a></font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">17. &quot;The disciple of the Noble Ones, Kalamas, who has
  such a hate-free mind, such a malice-free mind, such an undefiled mind, and such a
  purified mind, is one by whom four solaces are found here and now. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'Suppose there is a hereafter and there is a fruit,
  result, of deeds done well or ill. Then it is possible that at the dissolution of the body
  after death, I shall arise in the heavenly world, which is possessed of the state of
  bliss.' This is the first solace found by him. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'Suppose there is no hereafter and there is no
  fruit, no result, of deeds done well or ill. Yet in this world, here and now, free from
  hatred, free from malice, safe and sound, and happy, I keep myself.' This is the second
  solace found by him. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'Suppose evil (results) befall an evil-doer. I,
  however, think of doing evil to no one. Then, how can ill (results) affect me who do no
  evil deed?' This is the third solace found by him. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'Suppose evil (results) do not befall an evil-doer.
  Then I see myself purified in any case.' This is the fourth solace found by him. </font></p>

  purified mind, is one by whom, here and now, these four solaces are found.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So it is, Blessed One. So it is, Sublime one. The
  disciple of the Noble Ones, venerable sir, who has such a hate-free mind, such a
  malice-free mind, such an undefiled mind, and such a purified mind, is one by whom, here
  and now, four solaces are found. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<a NAME="magnif">Marvelous</a>, venerable sir!
  Marvelous, venerable sir! As if, venerable sir, a person were to turn face upwards what is
  upside down, or to uncover the concealed, or to point the way to one who is lost or to
  carry a lamp in the darkness, thinking, 'Those who have eyes will see visible objects,' so
  has the Dhamma been set forth in many ways by the Blessed One. We, venerable sir, go to
  the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma for refuge, and to the Community of Bhikkhus for
  refuge. Venerable sir, may the Blessed One regard us as lay followers who have gone for
  refuge for life, from today.&quot; </font></p>
