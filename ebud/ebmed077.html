      <p><font  face="Times New Roman"><strong>Introduction</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > There is a great deal of interest in Buddhist 
        meditation in contemporary Australia, especially among psychologists and 
        psychotherapists who seek to integrate Buddhist meditation, and in particular 
        the <i>vipassanâ</i> meditation of the Theravâda school of Buddhism, with 
        various forms of psychotherapy. The popularity of this approach is shown 
        by the success of books such as Jack Kornfield's <i>A path with heart: 
        A guide through the perils and promises of spiritual life</i>, a runaway 
        best-seller that has had an enormous impact on many people, including 
        non-meditators. Indeed, Kornfield is one of the central influences behind 
        this movement. Himself a successful meditation teacher and psychotherapist, 
        he has inspired at least two other therapists, both of them his meditation 
        students, to write on psychotherapy and meditation: Jeffrey Rubin, author 
        of <i>Psychotherapy and Buddhism: Towards an integration</i>; and Mark 
        Epstein, author of <i>Thoughts without a thinker: Psychotherapy from a 
        Buddhist perspective</i>. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > As I read these books I did not feel the 
        excitement that comes from discovering a new and culturally relevant way 
        of encountering the timeless essence of the Buddha-dharma. Rather, I felt 
        somewhat disturbed by what I see as a growing confusion about the nature 
        of Buddhist teachings and a willingness to distort and dilute these teachings, 
        apparently in order to make Buddhist meditation more saleable in our contemporary 
        spiritual marketplace. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > In this paper I wish to discuss the issues 
        I feel are raised by these three books in particular, seeing them as representative 
        of a wider movement. At this point I wish to declare my own interest in 
        this discussion. I have practised Buddhist meditation for 20 years, since 
        1984 in the tradition of the late Mahâsî Sayâdaw of Burma, principally 
        under the guidance of Sayâdaw U Pandita Bhivamsa (of Mahâsî Sâsana Yeiktha 
        and recently of Panditârâma Yeiktha) and Sayâdaw U Janaka Bhivamsa (of 
        Chanmyay Yeiktha). I have had very little exposure to the American <i>vipassanâ 
        </i>tradition, although I do have some experience of American Zen, gained 
        through two years of practice with the Diamond Sangha in Hawaii. Nor have 
        I had any exposure to Western psychotherapy. So I speak as one ignorant 
        of psychotherapeutic practice but with a great deal of respect for the 
        traditions of Theravâda Buddhism, and rush in to judgement in a situation 
        where I am, at best, familiar with only half the territory. </font></p>
      <p><font  face="Times New Roman"><b>Eastern Meditation and Western Psychotherapy</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > In <i>A path with heart</i>, Jack Kornfield 
        raises the issue of the relationship between traditional Buddhist meditation 
        and Western psychotherapy. Buddhism has always been an extremely adaptable 
        religion, and it demonstrates a protean ability to adjust itself to new 
        cultures. Buddhism tends to take existing elements of a new host culture 
        and &quot;buddhise&quot; them, using them as vehicles for its fundamental 
        insights. But cultural adaptation is a two-way process, and Buddhism is 
        itself transformed as it moves from one culture to another. We are living 
        through a period in which Asian forms of Buddhism are adapting themselves 
        to the culture of the contemporary West, and Jack Kornfield sees Western 
        psychology as that aspect of Western culture which is providing the most 
        significant impact on Buddhism (244). His words are echoed by Mark Epstein 
        in <i>Thoughts without a thinker</i>, who compares our situation to that 
        encountered by Buddhists when Indian Buddhism came to China. Indian Buddhism 
        was translated into Taoist terms by the Chinese, and this process of &quot;sinification&quot; 
        changed Indian Buddhism into Chinese Buddhism. Today, Epstein says, as 
        Asian forms of Buddhism are being transformed into Western Buddhism by 
        the same process of translation, it is the language of psychoanalysis 
        that is providing the vehicle for the Buddha's insights to be presented 
        to the West (7). </font></p>
      <p><font  face="Times New Roman"><b>Suffering East and West</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > To what extent can psychotherapy shed light 
        on Buddhist teachings? Let us begin by examining how the therapists understand 
        the first of the Four Noble Truths, that of suffering. It is axiomatic 
        to all Buddhist traditions that people begin meditation because of their 
        discovery of the First Noble Truth: that of <i>dukkha</i>, suffering or 
        unsatisfactoriness. The Buddha taught that all experience is fundamentally 
        unsatisfactory, whether it be gross forms of physical pain and mental 
        anguish, or the experiences of pleasure, success and fulfilment that we 
        would normally regard as pleasurable or even blissful. In brief, why do 
        we begin meditation practice? Because we are in pain, and we know we are 
        in pain. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Kornfield approaches the question of the 
        relationship between meditation and psychotherapy by arguing that there 
        is a very specific kind of suffering that Westerners bring to meditation 
        practice. He says: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">[S]piritual practice attracts a great 
            many wounded people who are drawn to such practice for their own healing. 
            Their numbers appear to be increasing. The spiritual impoverishment 
            of modern culture and the number of children raised without a nurturing 
            and supportive family is growing. Divorce, alcoholism, traumatic or 
            unfortunate circumstances, painful child-rearing practices, latchkey 
            children, and child-rearing by day care and television all can produce 
            people who lack an inner sense of security and well-being. These children 
            grow up to have adult bodies but still feel like impoverished children. 
            Many such &quot;adult children&quot; live in our society. Their pain 
            is reinforced by the isolation and denial of feelings that is common 
            in our culture. (204)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Epstein echoes this concern. He argues that 
        Westerners commonly suffer from what has been called the <i>basic fault</i>, 
        a chronic spiritual hunger caused by inadequate childhood attention, neglect 
        rather than abuse (173). Epstein goes on to say: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">From the Buddhist perspective, the closest 
            parallel lies in the descriptions of the hungry ghost realm. Many 
            Westerners require a combined approach of psychotherapy <b>and</b> 
            meditation precisely because the hungry ghost realm is so strongly 
            represented in their psyches. This is a phenomenon that is new to 
            the recorded history of Buddhism: never before have there been so 
            many Hungry Ghosts engaged in Buddhist practice. (174)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Kornfield and Epstein agree that the situation 
        contemporary Western meditators face is unique. Kornfield calls people 
        who suffer from this unique spiritual hunger &quot;adult children,&quot; 
        people who lack a healthy sense of self and who are spiritually crippled 
        by the suffering they have undergone in childhood and their unconscious 
        denial of this suffering (Kornfield:&nbsp;217; &amp; Epstein:&nbsp;176-8). 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Given that Western meditators are faced 
        with culturally unique forms of suffering, it follows that these particular 
        types of suffering are best dealt with by the techniques of Western psychotherapy 
        which have been developed within this culture to deal with the problems 
        specific to this culture. Kornfield says: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">Psychotherapy addresses in directed and 
            powerful ways the need for healing, the reclamation and creation of 
            a healthy sense of self, the dissolution of fears and compartments, 
            and the search for a creative, loving, and full way to live in the 
            world. (245)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Having established that Westerners undergo 
        unique forms of suffering that psychotherapy has developed techniques 
        to handle, Kornfield goes on to argue that meditation alone is not enough 
        to heal many of the deep issues we uncover in the course of our meditation 
        (245). Meditation alone is not enough. He makes the extraordinary claim 
        that at least half the students at the annual three month retreat at the 
        Insight Meditation Society cannot do traditional Insight Meditation, &quot;because 
        they encounter so much unresolved grief, fear, and wounding and unfinished 
        developmental business from the past&quot; (246). He follows up this revelation 
        with a number of stories relating how specific students were blocked in 
        their meditation but successfully resolved these blockages once they were 
        able to identify traumatic events or unsatisfactory or even abusive relationships 
        in their past. He also narrates stories of spectacular failure in spiritual 
        practice when these issues were neglected. Indeed, much of Kornfield's 
        argument is based on case histories of meditational success and failure 
        that all go to support his view of the limitations of traditional meditation 
        without psychotherapy. While these stories are interesting and sometimes 
        even instructional, the implications behind this view need to be teased 
        out. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > I was first struck by Kornfield's claim 
        that at least half of the students who attempt to do traditional <i>vipassanâ</i> 
        meditation at IMS cannot do so. This is an extraordinary admission of 
        failure for any meditation teacher or meditation centre. In my experience 
        as a practitioner and as a teacher - and I must admit to having a very 
        limited experience as a teacher - I have only seen evidence of such a 
        large failure rate among the students in circumstances where it was quite 
        clear that the teachers were doing a very bad job. Nor have I seen any 
        evidence that such failures are confined to specific ethnic or cultural 
        groups. It is true that <i>vipassanâ</i> meditation is very difficult, 
        and it is true that many students engaged in this practice spend significant, 
        even long, periods of time stuck, not moving on through the stages of 
        <i>vipassanâ</i> <i>ñâna</i>, or insight knowledge, as described in the 
        traditional meditation literature. But I have never experienced a situation 
        where anything like half the people who begin intensive meditation practice 
        are psychologically incapable of getting started. If Kornfield's 
        claim is true, something very strange is going on in the world of <i>vipassanâ</i> 
        meditation teaching. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Another aspect of this claim that struck 
        me was the sense of specialness that underlies it; the sense that we as 
        Westerners with a capital &quot;W&quot; are unique, special, not at all 
        like those far-off foreign Easterners with a capital &quot;E.&quot; Indeed, 
        in my work as a student and teacher of Buddhist studies at a modern Western 
        (with a capital &quot;W&quot;) university, I feel an instant warning signal 
        whenever someone starts throwing around labels like capital-W &quot;Western&quot; 
        and capital-E &quot;Eastern,&quot; and basing arguments on this level 
        of generalisation. This is a habit much loved by first year undergraduates, 
        but I point out to them that any argument based on this level of generalisation 
        will almost invariably be shot down in flames once it is examined seriously. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > This kind of argument requires a strong 
        polarisation between two opposite but supporting extremes. Any attempt 
        to exalt one group as uniquely embodying some specific trait or set of 
        traits requires a strong sense of the &quot;Other,&quot; some other group 
        that embodies the opposing traits. Perhaps one of the most extreme examples 
        of this in Western culture was seen in Nazi Germany, where Hitler's 
        idealisation of the Aryan Germans required the invention of an opposite 
        pole of demonised Jews. In the case of Kornfield's argument, if we 
        are to hold up Western culture as uniquely diseased we need an opposite 
        pole, a utopian Other culture where people are uniquely healthy. Apart 
        from a story of how well his daughter was treated by her Balinese dance 
        teachers, Kornfield makes only one attempt to present this elusive Other 
        when he says: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">In the best of traditional cultures, 
            where people are embraced and nourished on both the physical and spiritual 
            levels, they grow up with a sense of ample inner and outer resources. 
            (217)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Unfortunately, Kornfield does not tell us 
        which cultures these are. Are they still around? Where are they? Or is 
        he speaking historically, of cultures which once existed but do so no 
        longer? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Demonising one type of culture and idealising 
        another saves us from facing the unpleasant fact that suffering is universal, 
        that the members of every society suffer in every conceivable way. Does 
        Kornfield expect us to believe that child abuse and neglect are unique 
        to North America? Let's consider what we know of ancient India in 
        the time of the Buddha. Like all highly developed traditional societies, 
        India had a large slave population. A considerable proportion of the population 
        were born, grew up and died knowing that they did not even own their own 
        bodies. Practices that we would condemn as abhorrent forms of sexual abuse 
        were so routine in such societies that they were not even worthy of comment. 
        Can we be confident these slaves enjoyed healthy child rearing practices? 
        Consider women in traditional India. Does Kornfield really think that 
        women who were the chattels of their male relatives from birth to death, 
        who had little or no control over their lives unless they escaped into 
        the sangha, that these women were endowed with inner and outer resources 
        uniquely missing in the contemporary West? And apart from considering 
        slaves and women (who together made up the majority of the population), 
        where was the quality of childhood in a society where the vast majority 
        of people, slave or free, male or female, were set to work at the earliest 
        possible age? Where was the sense of inner security in a society where 
        the lives of the great majority of the population consisted of endless 
        drudgery accompanied by endless insecurity, the insecurity which came 
        from the certain knowledge that the question of whether they would be 
        able to eat into the following year was entirely determined by the quality 
        of the next harvest? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Let's forget societies in the past. 
        Anyone who has practised meditation in Burma agrees that the Burmese give 
        every appearance of being extremely successful at intensive meditation 
        practice. Is Kornfield seriously suggesting that the Californian middle 
        and upper classes suffer more than the Burmese living under the tender 
        mercies of one of the most violently repressive regimes on the planet? 
        Any such suggestion is obviously bizarre in the extreme - which may be 
        why he couches the existence of the Other in such vague terms. </font></p>
      <p><font  face="Times New Roman"><b>Meditation and the Four Noble Truths</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Let's look deeper into this claim. 
        I have already mentioned how the First Noble Truth provides the starting 
        point for Buddhist practice. The Four Noble Truths provide the fundamental 
        framework for all Buddhist traditions, to the extent that any spiritual 
        teaching that fits within this framework can be legitimately regarded 
        as Buddhist, regardless of any cultural peculiarities, and any spiritual 
        teaching which does not fit within this framework can not be legitimately 
        regarded as Buddhist. The Four Noble Truths are: <i>dukkha</i>; the arising 
        of <i>dukkha</i>; the cessation of <i>dukkha</i>; and the way that leads 
        to the cessation of <i>dukkha</i>. The Buddha made the outrageous claim 
        that his way of practice - the Noble Eightfold Path - leads to the complete 
        cessation of suffering. This claim is based on these four truths, and 
        these truths are universal because they are concerned with the <i><b>structure</b></i> 
        of experience, not the <i><b>content</b></i> of experience. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > The key to understanding what the Buddha 
        is getting at is seeing how the four truths hang together. All experience 
        has a beginning; all experience has an end. All experience arises and 
        ceases (the second and third truths). This arising and ceasing is structural; 
        it is irrelevant which kind of experience we are talking about, be it 
        pleasant or painful, physical or mental, Eastern or Western. Further, 
        experiences arise and cease because of causes. They do not arise and cease 
        randomly, but because of specific causes which can be discovered in the 
        course of <i>vipassanâ</i> meditation. The fact that all experience arises 
        and ceases makes experience itself fundamentally unsatisfactory (the first 
        truth). It follows from the fact that all experience ceases because of 
        specific causes, that if we discover those causes and allow them to manifest, 
        we can discover the way to bring painful experience to an end (the fourth 
        truth). The Four Noble Truths hang together. Hence the Buddha said: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">The one who sees dukkha sees also the 
            arising of dukkha, sees also the cessation of dukkha, and sees also 
            the way leading to the cessation of dukkha. (S5.437)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > What Kornfield is implying is that the way 
        that leads to the cessation of <i>dukkha </i>does not work for certain 
        types of suffering. There are certain specific types of suffering which 
        are immune to the path. But the path is not concerned with specific types 
        of suffering, or specific types of experience, but simply with the fact 
        that <i><b>all</b></i> suffering, of whatever type, arises and ceases. 
        Because all suffering, of whatever type, arises and ceases, then all suffering 
        can be brought to this point of cessation, and the bringing of suffering 
        to this point of cessation is the practice of the path. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Because the path is concerned with the underlying, 
        universal structures of experience, if it is true that some types of experience 
        are immune to the treatment provided by the path, then all experience 
        must be immune to the path. If it is true that <i>vipassanâ</i> meditation 
        does not work for <i><b>some</b></i> types of suffering, then it does 
        not work for <i><b>any</b></i> type of suffering. And if <i>vipassanâ</i> 
        meditation does not work, then there is no Third Noble Truth - no path 
        that leads to the cessation of suffering. And since the Four Noble Truths 
        hang together, if one truth is denied, all are denied, and Buddhism has 
        just disappeared out the window. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > However, it may be objected at this point 
        that my analysis is going too far. Is Kornfield really denying the Four 
        Noble Truths? Or is he simply saying that some people need extra help 
        to enable them to seriously engage <i>vipassanâ</i> meditation? In other 
        words, is he simply suggesting that psychotherapy can play an effective 
        supporting role in traditional meditation practice? To examine this question, 
        we must examine how Kornfield treats Buddhism in his book, <i>A path with 
        heart</i>. </font></p>
      <p><font  face="Times New Roman"><b>The Great Way</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Throughout the course of his book, Kornfield 
        presents a view of the Buddha and his teachings which is based on a particular 
        concept of the role of spiritual traditions, a concept which we might 
        loosely describe as universalist liberal. He introduces this view early 
        in the book, for example when he compares spiritual practice to a journey 
        up a mountain, and warns us that &quot;it is crucial to understand that 
        there are many ways up the mountain - that there is never just one true 
        way&quot; (32). He sees the various traditions as providing maps which 
        guide the seeker up the mountain. Different traditions map different paths, 
        and all paths are equally valid, all may be useful to the earnest seeker. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Kornfield was trained primarily in the <i>vipassanâ</i> 
        meditation of Theravâda Buddhism, and we can see how he applies his universalist 
        liberal attitude to this tradition. In Theravâda we find a literary genre 
        of path manuals, teachings which describe the path of <i>vipassanâ</i> 
        meditation from the beginning to the end. Probably the best known and 
        elaborate of these is contained in the <i>Visuddhimagga</i>, a medieval 
        text written in the 5<sup>th</sup> century by Âcariya Buddhaghosa. Here 
        we find an elaborate scheme of the path analysed in terms of 16 <i>ñânas</i>, 
        or knowledges, and Kornfield devotes part of Chapter 10 to presenting 
        it to his readers. However, he introduces his account with a warning: 
        </font></p>

          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">The map of the Elders is used in Insight 
            Meditation. As you read about it in detail, keep in mind that such 
            maps are both helpful and limiting. Depending on the form of practice 
            used and the individual, meditation can progress in quite different 
            ways. Mystical texts outside of Buddhism also describe the process 
            of awakening, in hundreds of other languages and landscapes, although 
            they all share common elements. So I offer this map with some caution, 
            as an example of promises and perils we may encounter on our spiritual 
            journey. (137)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Note the warning to the unwary reader. Maps 
        are helpful, but they are apparently dangerous (otherwise why the need 
        for caution?) because they are limiting. But what is being limited? Earlier 
        in his book, Kornfield introduces the notion of the &quot;Great Way,&quot; 
        of which any given teaching or practice is simply one part (for example, 
        121). Buddhism in general, and Theravâda Buddhism in particular, is merely 
        one aspect of this Great Way. While the Great Way does seem very attractive 
        in the hands of a skilful writer like Jack Kornfield, it has one fundamental 
        problem: it doesn't actually exist; or rather, it exists only in 
        Kornfield's imagination. When I say that it doesn't actually 
        exist, I mean that there is no living Buddhist tradition found on the 
        planet which manifests as the Great Way described by Kornfield. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > This raises the issue of what exactly do 
        we mean when we use the word &quot;Buddhism.&quot; You may remember the 
        scandal which broke out after Pope John Paul II published a book called 
        <i>Crossing the threshold of hope</i>, in which he explained his world 
        view, including his view of other religions. He devoted a chapter to Buddhism 
        in which he described it as an atheistic system which aims to make its 
        devotees perfectly indifferent to the world around them (86). This description 
        of Buddhism caused a great deal of offence to Buddhists around the world, 
        because they saw it as blatant propaganda designed to discredit their 
        religion. The problem with John Paul's description of Buddhism, the 
        factor that made it propaganda rather than genuine analysis, was that 
        no Buddhist could recognise his or her Buddhist tradition in John Paul's 
        words. This was a Buddhism which existed only in John Paul's imagination, 
        and therefore this was a Buddhism which simply did not exist at all. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > The same is true of Jack Kornfield's 
        Great Way. This Great Way can not be found in any specific Buddhist or 
        Hindu or Sufi or Christian or other school or tradition, but is an abstract 
        entity which somehow floats above and encompasses every tradition. In 
        the name of this non-existent Great Way, Kornfield takes bits and pieces 
        from every tradition and mixes them up into a kind of Great Way Soup. 
        For example, he occasionally quotes the Buddha, using him as an authority 
        to justify one or another teaching. However, if one is actually acquainted 
        with the Buddhist scriptures he is drawing upon, it soon becomes evident 
        that when Kornfield says, &quot;The Buddha once said ... ,&quot; what 
        he really means is, &quot;This is what the Buddha would have said, had 
        he been a psychotherapist living in late 20<sup>th</sup> century California.&quot; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Throughout his book, Kornfield cheerfully 
        changes Buddhist teachings in order to make them fit into his scheme. 
        We can find a number of cases when he supposedly quotes the Buddha or 
        explains some traditional teaching where he makes some slight change, 
        some subtle adaptation, which in isolation may seem trivial to the casual 
        reader, but in total create a cumulative effect in which Buddhist teachings 
        are distorted to give a false impression of traditional support for the 
        position Kornfield is taking. To give just one example, he quotes the 
        Buddha as saying: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">Just as the great oceans have but one 
            taste, the taste of salt, so too there is but one taste fundamental 
            to all true teachings of the Way, and this is the taste of freedom. 
            (76)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > This sounds very nice and very liberal. 
        However, the passage should read something like: &quot;Just as the great 
        ocean has but one taste, the taste of salt, so this <i>dhamma</i> has 
        but one taste, the taste of freedom.&quot; What's the difference? 
        Kornfield skilfully changes the passage to insert his key concept of the 
        Tao, the Great Way, and present the Buddha as liberally accepting the 
        validity of all ways of practice which correspond to the Great Way. The 
        strong probability that the Buddha never heard of this Great Way, and 
        the fact that it is nowhere mentioned in the scriptures Kornfield is purporting 
        to expound, is not allowed to get in the way of a good story. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Linked with this notion of the Great Way 
        is Kornfield's extensive use of the map metaphor. Spiritual traditions 
        provide maps for practice, as outlined above. These traditions and their 
        maps often contradict each other, and this creates a problem for the spiritual 
        seeker. Kornfield tells a story about a married couple who practiced with 
        Sufis, Christians and Tibetan Buddhists. At some point, the husband fell 
        into a depression and committed suicide. Some weeks later his widow was 
        comforted by a friend from her Buddhist community who assured her that 
        her husband had been safely reborn in a pure land. This had been seen 
        in meditation. Later, friends from her Sufi and Christian communities 
        on different occasions also assured her that they too had seen her husband 
        safely reborn in one or another circumstance - and all of these circumstances 
        were different! She went to Kornfield for guidance, and he advised her 
        &quot;to put away all her philosophies and beliefs, the maps of past and 
        future lives and more,&quot; and asked her: What is she convinced is true, 
        regardless of what anyone else says? She replied: &quot;I know that everything 
        changes and not much more than that. Everything that is born dies, everything 
        in life is in the process of change.&quot; Kornfield asked: Could that 
        be enough? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Kornfield turns to his readers and argues 
        on the basis of this case that we must maintain a sense of inquiry rather 
        than seek to imitate the spiritual ideals provided by each tradition. 
        We must not look beyond ourselves and our own experience (158-63). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > I feel that the advice Kornfield gave to 
        the widow was very good: As practitioners of meditation, we must learn 
        to rely fundamentally on our own experience. However, what I find most 
        interesting is not what he did tell her, but what he did not. What he 
        did not say was: You are practicing in three different spiritual traditions, 
        and have ended up being very confused. Are you surprised by this? If we 
        set out on a journey into the unknown using three contradictory maps to 
        show us the way, surely we are guaranteed confusion. If we want to develop 
        clarity rather than confusion, at some time we have to decide: What am 
        I? Am I a Buddhist? A Sufi? A Christian? And having decided, then go for 
        it, and follow the map provided as far as it goes. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > But instead of advising the practitioner 
        to settle on <i><b>one </b></i>tradition, Kornfield advises her to settle 
        for the lowest common denominator of all of them. At this point he brings 
        in a distorted version of the <i>Kalama-sutta </i>to bolster his position, 
        to give the entirely false impression that this advice is somehow in accordance 
        with the Buddha's teachings. The Buddha's teachings are misused 
        to support a position no Buddhist tradition would endorse - that we should 
        use the practice as a means of avoiding commitment to the tradition, even 
        if this means reducing our spiritual aspiration so we can remain comfortably 
        within our limitations. The one thing that seems to be entirely off the 
        agenda is to place one's faith on one tradition and to surrender 
        totally to it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > What am I getting at here? The point I am 
        trying to make is that Kornfield is not merely suggesting that psychotherapeutic 
        techniques be added to our practice of Buddhist meditation; he is inventing 
        a whole new tradition, a new religion, the &quot;Great Way&quot; which 
        embraces all that is good in all of the ancient wisdom traditions, and 
        transcends all that is limited in each of them. As each tradition provides 
        a specific map which guides the practice, it follows that Kornfield is 
        teaching from the &quot;Map of Maps,&quot; and so he becomes the ultimate 
        spiritual authority. For if all traditions are relative except for the 
        &quot;Great Way&quot; that embraces them all, and if Kornfield is our 
        authority for this Great Way, then it follows that Kornfield is the master 
        of every tradition. Even the Pope doesn't make this claim. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > None of this, of course, is openly stated. 
        It is simply hidden in the rhetoric, wrapped up in layers of inspirational 
        writing which is designed to make its readers feel that they have somehow 
        penetrated into the mysteries of all the mystic paths of the planet and 
        that, by avoiding commitment to any specific tradition, they have demonstrated 
        their superiority to all specific traditions, and to those deluded and 
        bigoted people who stick to a single path. </font></p>
      <p><font  face="Times New Roman"><b>Does Enlightenment Exist?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Let us return to the Four Noble Truths. 
        Jack Kornfield's approach to the teaching has found supporters in 
        other meditating psychotherapists. One of these is Jeffrey Rubin, author 
        of <i>Psychotherapy and Buddhism</i>. Claiming Kornfield as an authority 
        (89), Rubin moves the agenda forward by examining the claims made about 
        Enlightenment by Theravâda Buddhism. In a chapter titled &quot;The emperor 
        of enlightenment may have no clothes,&quot; Rubin says: &quot;In this 
        chapter, I shall challenge certain foundational assumptions of the Theravadin 
        Buddhist conception of Enlightenment&quot; (83). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Rubin explains that enlightenment in Theravâda 
        Buddhism is described as completely purifying the mind of the defilements 
        of greed, hatred and delusion. This ideal assumes that the mind can be 
        permanently and completely purified and therefore transformed (83-4 &amp; 
        87). However, Rubin points out that in 1983 &quot;five of the six most 
        esteemed Zen Buddhist masters in the United States&quot; were involved 
        in grossly unenlightened behaviour such as sexual exploitation and stealing 
        money (88). The question arises: How can these scandals occur if these 
        people are supposed to be enlightened? How can this have happened? Rubin 
        concludes that these scandals suggest that: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">... psychological conditioning from the 
            past that inevitably warps personality cannot be completely eradicated 
            and that there is no conflict-free stage of human life in which the 
            mind is permanently purified of conflict. This is consistent with 
            psychoanalytic insights about the essential nontransparency of the 
            human mind; that is, the inevitability of unconsciousness and self-deception.</font></p>
          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">For an individual to be enlightened, 
            they would have to be certain that they were completely awake without 
            any trace of unconsciousness or delusion. Even if that existed in 
            the present, it is not clear to me how one could know for certain 
            that would never change in the future. From the psychoanalytic perspective, 
            a static, conflict-free sphere - a psychological &quot;safehouse&quot; 
            - beyond the vicissitudes of conflict and conditioning where mind 
            is immune to various aspects of affective life such as self-interest, 
            egocentricity, fear, lust, greed, and suffering is quixotic. Since 
            conflict and suffering seem to be inevitable aspects of human life, 
            the ideal of Enlightenment may be asymptotic, that is, an unreachable 
            ideal (90).</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > From the context of the Four Noble Truths, 
        Rubin has just torpedoed the third truth. He does this in an attempt to 
        integrate Buddhism and psychotherapy, to create a new Buddhism more suited 
        to Western culture. Unfortunately, Rubin is so confused about Buddhist 
        teaching that he seems oblivious to the fact that he is not adapting or 
        integrating Buddhism, he is simply destroying it. We referred earlier 
        to the Buddha's teaching that to see one of the Noble Truths is to 
        see all of them. These truths form a pattern which is so closely interwoven 
        that to deny one of them is to deny all of them. If there is no cessation 
        of <i>dukkha</i>, there is no path leading to the cessation of <i>dukkha</i>. 
        And if there is no cessation of <i>dukkha </i>and no path leading to the 
        cessation of <i>dukkha</i>, then the Buddha was a very confused fellow 
        indeed. Since enlightenment is psychotherapeutically impossible, then 
        the Buddha was not enlightened. In other words, there never was a Buddha. 
        Rubin's version of Buddhism is a Buddha-less Buddhism. And a Buddha-less 
        Buddhism is in the same position as a Christ-less Christianity - non-existent. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > But is Rubin's analysis valid? Rubin 
        began by saying he was examining the <i><b>Theravâda</b></i> view of enlightenment. 
        He then attempts to discredit this view by looking at the behaviour of 
        a number of Zen teachers. However, by comparing the Theravâda ideal of 
        enlightenment with the representatives of a Mahâyâna school of Buddhism, 
        he is committing the classic error of comparing apples with oranges. To 
        begin with, we need to examine this notion of &quot;enlightenment,&quot; 
        which is a source of endless confusion to many Western writers, not just 
        Rubin and Epstein. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > I have never been able to find any Pâli 
        or Sanskrit word which corresponds to the English word &quot;enlightenment.&quot; 
        This word was selected some time late last century by English translators 
        as a label for the goal of Buddhist practice because of its resonance 
        with the 18<sup>th</sup> century ideal of the Enlightenment. The European 
        Enlightenment was a movement which idealised progress, science and reason 
        - the &quot;light&quot; in &quot;Enlightenment&quot; refers to the light 
        of reason. In Victorian Britain, sympathetic English scholars wanted to 
        present Buddhism in as favourable a light as possible, and they did so 
        by portraying the Buddha as the perfect Victorian gentleman. He was presented 
        as rejecting the priestly mumbo-jumbo of the brahmins (who for the Victorian 
        English corresponded to the Roman Catholic clergy) in favour of a religion 
        of reason and morality (Almond: 70-4). The only thing that spoiled this 
        picture was undeniable evidence in the Buddhist texts that the Buddha 
        taught and practiced some kind of bizarre self-hypnosis or cultivation 
        of trance states - what we today call meditation. The word &quot;enlightenment&quot; 
        referred to a state of enlightened reason attained by the Buddha which, 
        however, existed only in the imagination of Victorian scholars. Unfortunately 
        the word has stuck, and with it the confusion. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > The word <i>buddha </i>comes from the root 
        <i>budh</i>, meaning <i>wake</i>, <i>know</i>. A buddha is one who is 
        awake, one who knows. The state of knowing, of being awake, which is experienced 
        by a buddha is <i>bodhi</i>, and <i>bodhi </i>can be reasonably translated 
        as <i>awakening</i>. Soon after his awakening the Buddha himself described 
        what he had discovered under the Bodhi Tree in this way: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">This dhamma which I have discovered is 
            deep, difficult to understand, difficult to awaken to, peaceful, exalted, 
            beyond the scope of reason, subtle, to be experienced only by the 
            wise. But this people finds pleasure in attachment, is intent on attachment, 
            delights in attachment; and for a people that finds pleasure in attachment, 
            is intent on attachment, delights in attachment, this state is difficult 
            to comprehend: that is, specific conditionality (<i>idapaccayatâ</i>), 
            dependent arising (<i>paticcasamuppâda</i>).</font></p>
          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">This state, also, is extremely difficult 
            to see: that is, the calming of all formations, the surrender of all 
            clinging, the destruction of craving, the fading of passion, cessation, 
            <i>nibbâna</i>. (Vin. 1:&nbsp;4-5)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > We can see that the Buddha divided his discovery 
        into two aspects: specific conditionality/dependent arising, and <i>nibbâna</i>. 
        Dependent arising refers to the structure of experience - all experience. 
        It is a restatement of the second and third of the Four Noble Truths, 
        but seen from a different angle. Dependent arising is summed up in the 
        following verse, found throughout the suttas: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">When this is, that is;<br>
            From the arising of this, that arises.<br>
            When this is not, that is not;<br>
            From the cessation of this, that ceases. (S&nbsp;2.28)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <font >Dependent arising teaches that all 
        experiences arise and cease dependent upon conditions other than themselves. 
        Experience is inherently dynamic, an endless process of change without 
        exception. Dependent arising expands the Noble Truths of the arising and 
        ceasing of <i>dukkha</i>, by revealing the specific patterns of causality 
        that give rise to either <i>dukkha </i>or the cessation of <i>dukkha</i>. 
        Specific conditionality refers to the fact that any specific experience 
        arises because of some other specific experience, and then ceases because 
        of some other specific experience. Specific conditionality emphasises 
        the orderliness of change, the fact that experiences do not arise randomly 
        but in accordance with precise and observable patterns of causation. In 
        the <i>Mahâtanhâsankhaya-sutta, </i>the Buddha examined his students on 
        their meditation experience</font>: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">Bhikkhus, do you see: &quot;This has 
            come to be?&quot;&nbsp;... Do you see: &quot;Its origination occurs 
            with that as support?&quot;&nbsp;... Do you see: &quot;With the cessation 
            of that support, what has come to be is subject to cessation?&quot; 
            (M&nbsp;1.260)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Notice the focus of the Buddha's questions. 
        He is not just asking his students, &quot;Do you see change?&quot; He 
        is asking, &quot;Do you see the <i><b>patterns</b></i> of change? Do you 
        see what supports what? Do you see what specific experience gives rise 
        to what specific experience? And when that experience ceases, do you see 
        what changes to make it cease?&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > This perceived order in the flow of experience, 
        the fact we can see that precisely this gives rise to precisely that, 
        is specific conditionality. This is what makes our situation workable. 
        The wisdom of the Buddha exposes the underlying structures of our experience, 
        the underlying laws that govern change, and therefore shows us how we 
        can develop our experience in a direction we want. This is what makes 
        possible the path. The goal of practice, and the means of practice, is 
        awakening (<i>bodhi</i>). What we awaken <i><b>to </b></i>is our experience, 
        now. This experience, now, is the content of awakening. Note that awakening 
        does not refer to any specific type of experience, be it painful or pleasurable, 
        happy or sad, Eastern or Western. Awakening is simply the penetrating 
        knowing of the structure of any experiences that are arising and ceasing, 
        now. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > The second aspect of the Buddha's <i>dhamma</i> 
        is <i>nibbâna</i> (in Sanskrit, <i>nirvâna</i>). In Theravâda Buddhism, 
        <i>nibbâna</i> refers to the paradoxical experience of the cessation of 
        all experience, the shut-down of the phenomenal universe. It is this second 
        aspect of the <i>dhamma</i> which permanently transforms the mind. We 
        may, according to the Theravâda teaching, spend any amount of time in 
        the experience of <i>bodhi</i>, but not necessarily have experienced <i>nibbâna</i>; 
        and the effects of the experience of <i>bodhi </i>are temporary, not permanent. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > In this context we can see Rubin's 
        error. Mahâyâna Buddhism sees its ideal as the attainment of <i>bodhi</i>, 
        which it expresses as <i>shunyatâ</i>, or emptiness. The followers of 
        the Mahâyâna are <i>bodhisattvas</i>, beings (<i>sattva</i>) who are inclined 
        toward awakening (<i>bodhi</i>). A <i>bodhisattva</i> must renounce the 
        experience of <i>nirvâna</i> until her last life, when she has accumulated 
        sufficient wisdom and compassion to attain full Buddhahood and become 
        a <i>sammâsambuddha</i>. The Zen teachers Rubin talks about follow a practice 
        which is designed to give rise to this experience of emptiness. They are 
        not following a practice which is designed to give rise to the experience 
        of <i>nirvâna</i>. Nothing which these Zen teachers say or do can tell 
        us anything at all about the Theravâda ideal of enlightenment, since we 
        have no evidence that any of them have ever experienced it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Rubin's confusion is due to his determination 
        to mix up the different traditions of Buddhism into a homogenous stew 
        which is neither Theravâda nor Mahâyâna - which, like Kornfield's 
        Great Way, does not correspond to any actual living Buddhist tradition 
        found anywhere on the planet. But apart from being confused about enlightenment, 
        Rubin is also engaging in some hermeneutical sleight-of-hand that needs 
        to be examined. </font></p>
      <p><font  face="Times New Roman"><b>Interpreting Buddhism</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Let us review the journey we have been taking. 
        We began with psychotherapists who practice Buddhist meditation undertaking 
        the project of translating or interpreting Buddhism into terms that are 
        culturally relevant to the contemporary West by using psychotherapy as 
        a template. We have seen that in practice this means more than merely 
        asserting that psychotherapy can be used as an aid to traditional Buddhist 
        meditation. Rather, it has involved, in the works of the therapists under 
        discussion, a fundamental rewriting of Buddhism, the creation of an entirely 
        new form of Buddhism which does not correspond to any of the existing 
        Buddhist traditions, and which is designed to be compatible with the teachings 
        of psychotherapy. At this point we need to take a look at the broader 
        problem of interpretation or translation itself. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > What is interpretation? To interpret means 
        to read one myth in terms of another. In his provocatively titled <i>We've 
        had a hundred years of psychotherapy - and the world's getting worse</i>, 
        psychologist James Hillman spoke about the developmental model that Kornfield, 
        Rubin and Epstein take for granted. In a conversation with journalist 
        Michael Ventura, Hillman said: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">The principal content of American psychology 
            is developmental psychology: What happened to you earlier is the cause 
            of what happened to you later. That's the basic theory: our history 
            is our causality. ... So you have to go back to childhood to get at 
            why you are the way you are. ... No other culture would do that. If 
            you're out of your mind in another culture or quite disturbed 
            or impotent or anorexic ... It could be thousands of other things 
            - the plants, the water, the curses, the demons, the Gods, being out 
            of touch with the Great Spirit. It would never, <b>never</b>be what 
            happened to you with your mother and your father forty years ago. 
            Only our culture uses that myth.</font></p>
          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">Ventura: ... That's not a myth, 
            that's what happened!</font></p>
          <p><font  face="Times New Roman">Hillman: &quot;That's not a myth, 
            that's what happened.&quot; The moment we say something is &quot;what 
            happened&quot; we're announcing, &quot;This is the myth I no 
            longer see as a myth. This is the myth that I can't see through.&quot; 
            &quot;That's not a myth, that's what happened&quot; suggests 
            that myths are the things we <b>don't</b>believe. The myths we 
            believe and are in the middle of, we call the &quot;fact,&quot; &quot;reality,&quot; 
            &quot;science.&quot; (17-18)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > I don't want to question the strengths 
        and weaknesses of the model of developmental psychology here. All I want 
        to do here is to present the concept of myth. I am using the word &quot;myth&quot; 
        to refer to what we take for granted within a society as given, as obvious, 
        as what happens. That which is so obvious that it never actually occurs 
        to us to seriously question it. As Hillman points out, myths arise dependent 
        upon a given culture. What is obvious to one culture is far from obvious 
        to another culture, and vice versa. This is the kind of problem we get 
        involved in when we &quot;translate&quot; from one culture into another, 
        or &quot;interpret&quot; one culture in terms of another. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Hence the answer to my question, what is 
        interpretation? To interpret means to read one myth in terms of another. 
        We are all living within a myth, the myth or myths that provide us with 
        our fundamental world view. Psychotherapists are reading the Buddhist 
        myth in terms of their psychotherapeutic myth. In order to interpret, 
        we must take the alien myth and read it through a grid, as it were, a 
        conceptual grid which can rearrange the parts of the alien myth and make 
        them coherent for us. In this process, one particular myth must be dominant, 
        because one particular myth must provide that through which or in terms 
        of which the other is read. Psychotherapists interpret Buddhism in terms 
        of the myth of psychotherapy, so what naturally emerges is a view of Buddhism 
        as colonised by psychotherapy. Psychotherapy becomes hierarchically superior 
        to Buddhism. But to understand Buddhism, one must enter the Buddhist myth, 
        and once we are within that myth, then we will naturally read psychotherapy 
        in terms of Buddhism. When we do that, Buddhism becomes hierarchically 
        superior to psychotherapy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Rubin says Enlightenment is impossible, 
        because in the myth of psychotherapy the absence of the unconscious mind 
        is impossible. But the myth of Theravâda Buddhism does not posit the existence 
        of an unconscious mind. The closest Theravâda psychology comes to the 
        notion of an unconscious is the concept of <i>anusaya kilesa</i>, the 
        latent afflictions. <i>Bodhi</i>, in this myth, implies the absence of 
        all <i>anusaya kilesa</i>, the absence of all latent afflictions. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > As we have seen above when talking about 
        specific conditionality and dependent arising, the Buddhist world view 
        is one of dynamic process. All phenomena arise and cease. Fundamental 
        to the Buddhist myth is the concept of <i>anattâ</i>, or not-self. When 
        we do <i>vipassanâ</i> meditation, we train ourselves to see the discontinuities 
        in our experience. As we do this, we see our experience as an continuous 
        flow of arising and ceasing, arising and ceasing, endlessly. We become 
        intimate with change, or, in Buddhist terms, impermanence (<i>aniccatâ</i>). 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Normally when we see change we assume an 
        underlying entity which undergoes change. For example, we all know the 
        weather is constantly changing: today it is hot, tomorrow will be cooler; 
        yesterday was wet, today is dry. However, the very language we use shows 
        that we assume an underlying entity, which we call &quot;weather,&quot; 
        which, while subject to change, itself remains unchanged. We all know 
        that our experience is constantly changing, but we all assume there exists 
        an underlying person - &quot;me&quot; - who, while subject to change, 
        himself or herself remains unchanged. In other words, while we all know 
        change, we all assume there is someone <i><b>to whom </b></i>change occurs. 
        This unexamined assumption is one of our guiding myths, and it is from 
        within this myth that we undertake Buddhist practice. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > The teaching of <i>anattâ</i> denies the 
        existence of some one or some thing which underlies the process of change. 
        For Buddhism, what there <i><b>is</b></i>, is process, and <i><b>all</b></i> 
        there is, is process. Hence, from within the Buddhist myth, the contents 
        of the mind arise and cease, and there is no mind beyond or beneath that 
        process of arising and ceasing. There is nothing which underlies this 
        process. Whence do the contents of the mind - our drives, desires, fears 
        and hatreds - arise? Where do they go when they cease? We don't know. 
        The myth of psychotherapy posits the existence of a something, an Unconscious, 
        which is the repository of these mental contents. But inside the Buddhist 
        myth, all that exists are causal patterns, and to say thoughts and emotions 
        arise from the unconscious is simply to say we do not know the causal 
        patterns from which our thoughts and emotions arise. Suddenly they are 
        just here, and then they are gone. But a <i>buddha</i>, an awakened one, 
        sees the complete network of causal relationships. This is dependent arising. 
        He sees the specific cause of each specific experience. This is specific 
        conditionality. The totality of this seeing is <i>bodhi</i>, awakening, 
        and this process is all there is to see. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > So when Rubin judges the Buddhist doctrine 
        of awakening on the basis of the presence or absence of an unconscious 
        mind, he is judging one cultural myth by the standards of another, and 
        assuming the universal application, and therefore the superiority, of 
        his own cultural myth. Rubin begins his book by criticising what he calls 
        Eurocentric and Orientocentric approaches to the study of Buddhism and 
        psychotherapy. A Eurocentric approach sees psychoanalysis as superior, 
        and an Orientocentric approach sees Buddhism as superior. Rejecting this, 
        he seeks to allow a conversation between Buddhism and psychotherapy which 
        brings out the strengths and weaknesses of each tradition, allowing each 
        to supplement and improve the other (6-7). In fact he does no such thing, 
        and instead ends with a firmly fixed hierarchy in which psychotherapy 
        is on top and Buddhism on the bottom. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > As long as we read one myth in terms of 
        the other, some such hierarchy of values is inevitable. Rubin and Epstein 
        end up destroying Buddhism and turning it into a new form of psychotherapy. 
        They are not content to simply leave Buddhism alone and use <i>vipassanâ</i> 
        meditation as a psychotherapeutic tool, but insist on reinventing Buddhism 
        on their own terms. Unfortunately, they are so confused about Buddhism 
        that their newly minted Buddhism is clearly inferior to the original. 
        Kornfield's new Buddhism is more sophisticated than that of Epstein 
        and Rubin, partly because he knows more about it in the first place, and 
        partly because he reads both Buddhism and psychotherapy from a third viewpoint 
        which is neither Buddhism nor psychotherapy, but which floats above both. 
        This is his &quot;Great Way,&quot; which supposedly transcends all spiritual 
        traditions and all therapies. But he also ends up with a firmly entrenched 
        hierarchy, with a new Buddhism of his own invention. </font></p>
      <p><font  face="Times New Roman"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > And what, after all, is wrong with this? 
        Many people may conclude that they prefer these new versions of Buddhism 
        to any of the traditional models currently on offer. Certainly if book 
        sales are anything to go by, Kornfield's Great Way is a very suitable 
        commodity for our post-modern spiritual marketplace. But let's be 
        clear on what is happening. Let's not try to fool ourselves or anyone 
        else that we are practising the teachings of the Buddha when we follow 
        any of these ersatz forms of Buddhism. Let's be clear whose teachings 
        we are putting our faith in. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Kornfield reduces Buddhism to a collection 
        of spiritual disciplines or techniques, the most important of which is 
        <i>vipassanâ </i>meditation. These disciplines are part of the glad-bag 
        of techniques which together make up the Great Way. Practising in this 
        spirit, the seeker can avoid ever becoming a finder, because he never 
        trades down into joining any one specific tradition. For Kornfield, the 
        goal of practice is spiritual maturity, and spiritual maturity &quot;is 
        not about adopting any one particular philosophy or set of beliefs or 
        teachings&quot; (316), but involves the freedom to move from spiritual 
        vehicle to spiritual vehicle, according to the seeker's desire and, 
        presumably, the advice of his therapist. The seeker never becomes a finder, 
        never becomes someone who puts their faith in one tradition and follows 
        it without reservation, without holding back. Always the seeker keeps 
        that sense of separation, that sense of alienation inherent in the knowledge 
        that the tradition within which he practices is just another commodity 
        in the spiritual marketplace, which, in the event of difficulty, can be 
        traded in for the latest model. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Epstein and Rubin want to rewrite Buddhism 
        on their own terms, taking the ocean of the Buddha's wisdom and reducing 
        it to a puddle small enough to accommodate the views of Freud and his 
        successors. Their Buddhism is shallow, limited and extremely muddled, 
        a Buddhism which accurately reflects their own confusion and ignorance, 
        but has little connection with any living Buddhist tradition. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > What's the alternative? In one word, 
        faith. Faith involves a surrender to the tradition, which in Buddhism 
        is expressed as taking refuge in the three treasures of Buddha, Dharma 
        and Sangha. We began this paper with Jack Kornfield's assertion that 
        half the students who attempt the three month retreat at IMS cannot engage 
        <i>vipassanâ</i> meditation because of the suffering they are undergoing. 
        In the Nidâna-vagga of Samyutta Nikâya the Buddha in one passage expounds 
        in brief the full path from suffering to liberation. He explains that 
        suffering gives rise to faith (<i>saddhâ</i>), faith gives rise to delight 
        (<i>pâmojja</i>), delight gives rise to rapture, rapture gives rise to 
        calm, calm gives rise to bliss, bliss gives rise to concentration, concentration 
        gives rise to knowing and seeing phenomena as they are, knowing and seeing 
        phenomena as they are gives rise to disenchantment, disenchantment gives 
        rise to the fading of passion, and the fading of passion gives rise to 
        liberation (S&nbsp;2.30-3). Note how the process begins. From suffering 
        we proceed to delight, and what turns suffering into delight is faith. 
        Faith is the missing ingredient in the strange attempt to psychotherapeutise 
        Buddhism. None of the therapists we have looked at here seem to have taken 
        seriously the thought that what we need to do is cultivate faith in the 
        three treasures of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. Presumably they are far 
        too sophisticated for that - or perhaps they just feel that faith won't 
        sell. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" > Buddhism is not a collection of spiritual 
        or therapeutic techniques. Buddhism is an ocean. If we want we are free 
        to paddle on the edge of the shore, trying a technique here or a therapy 
        there, occasionally getting our feet wet, but staying safely within our 
        limitations. Or we can take the advice of Dogen Zenji, who said: &quot;Arouse 
        the mind that seeks the way, and plunge into the ocean of Buddhism.&quot; 
        Ultimately the future of Buddhism in the West will be decided by those 
        who take the plunge, because the paddlers will always draw back and, rather 
        than adapt Buddhism to its new home, will develop new forms of Buddhised 
        psychotherapy. For ultimately we must choose whom we will follow. We can 
        follow Buddha or we can follow Freud; we cannot do both, because they 
        are just not travelling in the same direction. </font></p>
