      </I><FONT SIZE="6">
      <P>W</FONT>hen we keep the breath in mind in combination with repeating 
      the meditation word <I>Bud-dho, Bud-dho</I>, we establish peace in our 
      minds, up to the point where we don&#39;t have to use the word <I>Buddho</I> 
      any more. All we wish is simply to know the in and outgoing of the breath, 
      only that much, fully at ease, with a heart at ease, watching the air 
      coming in and coming out, breathing in ... breathing out, knowing it, 
      still and peaceful.</P>
      <P>With the heart being at ease, certain experiences may come up, 
      experiences as to how we feel our body. There may be the feeling that our 
      body expands, becoming very large, filling out the whole room, the whole 
      meditation hall. It can become so large that it even hits the ceiling. Our 
      body becomes imbued with blissful feelings called <I>p<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">īti</FONT></I>, 
      waves of joy and rapture rolling on to the shore so that it makes our hair 
      stand on end. We might feel a tingling sensation throughout the whole of 
      our body. When <I>p<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">īti</FONT></I> is strong, 
      we might experience the body becoming very light, as if it was floating up 
      in the air, there is no feeling of weight at all sitting up there in 
      space. The body is light, the mind is light, still and peaceful.</P>
      <P>If these experiences in meditation come up for a short time, just for a 
      few moments, they are called <I>khanika-sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I>, 
      momentary concentration. <I>Khanika</I> means little, there is just a 
      little concentration. If a state like this lasts longer, for example five, 
      ten or fifteen minutes, or half an hour, this means, the heart is entering 
      a state of deeper peace. This is called <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>.
      <I>Upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> is a state of 
      concentration that is almost still, or, as it is said neighboring, or 
      touching <I>jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I>, almost entering
      <I>jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I>.</P>
      <P>We continue to develop peace in our mind on the level of <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> 
      by knowing the breath coming in and going out until we have the feeling 
      that the mind is still. In this state our mind can be compared to the 
      pendulum of a clock that is swinging a little to the left and right. The 
      mind in <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> still 
      has tiny little thoughts, but generally, the mind is peaceful. Sometimes, 
      there are proliferations, the mind is not yet completely still. These 
      small activities of the mind are the knowing of the breath. They are 
      called <I>vitakka</I> and <I>vic<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra</FONT></I>, 
      initial and sustained application of thought. The mind takes up the breath 
      and investigates it. <I>Vitakka </I>and <I>vic<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra</FONT></I> 
      is thinking that is being applied to the breath.</P>
      <I>
      <P>P<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">īti</FONT></I> (bliss) and <I>sukha </I>
      (happiness) are feelings that come up in the meditation at this level. <I>
      Sukha</I> expresses itself in the body being deep and heavy, a feeling of 
      inner satisfaction, a saturated, blissful feeling of contentment, rapture 
      that imbues the body. When <I>p<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">īti</FONT></I> 
      becomes very powerful, to the point where it reaches its full development, 
      it is called <I>sukha</I>. When <I>sukha</I> becomes very powerful, the 
      mind doesn&#39;t move any more and stays still and calm. It doesn&#39;t move left 
      or right, it is still. In this phase, if we want the mind to think, it 
      doesn&#39;t -- it rests in itself. The mind at peace is not interested in the 
      outer world. Sounds from outside won&#39;t attract it, the mind won&#39;t go out, 
      and things from outside won&#39;t reach it. The mind doesn&#39;t accept anything 
      -- whatever is the matter, it is uninterested, steadily resting in peace. 
      If the peace of mind has reached this stage, what is called <I>ekaggat<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT></I> 
      arises, one-pointedness of mind. Together with <I>vitakka</I> and <I>vic<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra</FONT></I>,
      <I>p<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">īti</FONT></I> and <I>sukha</I>, the five
      <I>jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I> factors are complete. In 
      this stage there is no thinking -- <I>vitakka</I> is not thinking and <I>
      vic<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra</FONT></I> is not thinking. Only a 
      little remainder of <I>p<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">īti</FONT></I> stays.
      <I>P<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">īti</FONT></I> and <I>sukha</I> are not 
      very bright and trying to make them become more clearer only makes the 
      mind become more still and peaceful. The still and peaceful mind that is 
      one-pointed like this is very powerful. Now the mind has reached the first
      <I>jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I>. Maybe I&#39;ll only explain 
      up to this level for now.</P>
      <P>Usually we understand <I>vitakka</I> and <I>vic<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra</FONT></I> 
      as being mere thinking, but this isn&#39;t what it means. <I>Vitakka </I>and
      <I>vic<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra</FONT></I> need to focus on the 
      breath. If we use <I>vitakka</I> and <I>vic<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra</FONT></I> 
      for all kinds of other issues, we are only proliferating. We need to apply 
      our thoughts and interest on the breath, on the observing of the coming 
      and going of the breath. <I>Vitakka</I> and <I>vic<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra</FONT></I> 
      are only supposed to dwell on a single object, on nothing other than that, 
      so that the thinking is still and peacefulness, <I>p<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">īti</FONT></I>,
      <I>sukha</I> and <I>ekaggat<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT></I> can 
      arise. Nevertheless, we may sometimes choose to practice reflecting on 
      other meditation-objects. After having reflected, we can also come to the 
      point where <I>p<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">īti</FONT></I> arises. Just 
      as when practising Mindfulness of Breathing, when the feeling of <I>p<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">īti</FONT></I> 
      is still weak, we have reached <I>khanika-sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I> 
      and so on.</P>
      <P>For example, we can take up <I>Buddhanusati,</I> the reflection on the 
      Buddha as our meditation-object. For this we can also use our morning- and 
      evening chanting. To recollect the Buddhas qualities means to think of the 
      Buddha, the Lord, who, by his own strength attained full enlightenment, 
      who is pure and free from defilements, self-attained, who possesses the 
      qualities of purity, loving-kindness and compassion in an unexcelled way. 
      If we devote our hearts to these reflections, <I>p<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">īti</FONT></I> 
      will arise. If it appears in a short, momentary flash, it is given the 
      name <I>khanika-sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I>, if we can 
      uphold it longer, <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>. 
      But as concerns the levels of peace and <I>sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I>, 
      all the reflective meditations, the ten anusatis as <I>Buddha-, Dhamma</I>- 
      and <I>Sangha-nusati </I>or reflection on death for example, are only 
      capable of giving results up to upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ārasam 
      ādhi. As they imply thinking they cannot lead into </FONT><I>jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I>, 
      but they are a good basis for it. If we are skilled in them, sooner or 
      later the power of our concentration grows by itself. With Mindfulness of 
      Breathing or contemplating the Four Elements, it is possible for our minds 
      to enter peace, one-ness or <I>jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I>.</P>
      <P>After having attained <I>jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I>, 
      when retreating from one-pointedness, the mind reenters <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>. 
      Then we need to take up contemplation of the body. We analyze the hair, 
      nails, teeth and skin of our body in the way our preceptor taught us in 
      the ordination ceremony. Or, for the laypeople, any of the 32 parts of the 
      body can be used, in whatever way. We take up body-contemplation in order 
      to see the nature of the body. The body simply consists of the four 
      elements, it is just nature, changing according to cause and effect, it is 
      not an individual being, a person or a self and doesn&#39;t belong to anybody. 
      To reflect like this is the way of developing <I>Kayagatasatipatth<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I>, 
      mindfulness of the body, the part of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness 
      that deals with comprehending the body. Mindfulness of Breathing is also a 
      part of <I>Kayagatasatipatth<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I>, 
      and so are the contemplation of the 32 parts, the nine charnelground 
      contemplations, the analysis in terms of the four elements. All these 
      practices concern the body. Further there is the awareness of the 
      body-movements, such as going to and fro, standing, walking, sitting, 
      lying down, standing up, speaking and thinking for example. With all these 
      actions that are related to the body, mindfulness needs to be present. 
      Always bring the mind back to aspects related to the body, don&#39;t think of 
      anything else.</P>
      <P>Becoming more and more skilled in mindfulness of the body, including
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>ānāpānasati</I></FONT>, leads us to other 
      reflections, such as the ones given in the summary of the section on 
      mindfulness of the body in the <I>Satipatth<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna 
      Sutta</FONT></I>: the body is just the body, not a being, not a person or 
      ours or theirs. Usually we&#39;d see our body as belonging to us, as a person 
      or a personal belonging, but after having meditated on the body, we might 
      suddenly realize: &quot;Eh, suppose I breathe in but don&#39;t breathe out any more 
      or breathe out but don&#39;t breathe in any more, that&#39;s death! What will 
      happen then? We are all subject to the processes of nature&quot;.</P>
      <P>With a peaceful mind in <I>sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I>, 
      we can see reality clearly, we know that this body is not a person or not 
      our self or belonging to us. Our mind will let go of the feeling of self, 
      it will see the mind as one thing and the body as another, both completely 
      different from each other, different aspects of nature. When we see this 
      separation between body and mind clearly, we can let go of up<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādāna, 
      the grasping hold of things. This is what is meant with &quot;wisdom arising&quot;, 
      especially wisdom arising from meditation </FONT><I>(bh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āvanāmayāpa</FONT>ññ<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT></I>). 
      The first step in the development of wisdom usually comes from having 
      heard or studied that the body is not self. Thinking about it, we agree, 
      but we don&#39;t really see it ourselves. But if we practise <I>sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I> 
      and reflect coming from a still mind, we begin to see clearly for 
      ourselves. Then we can let go of <I>up<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādāna</FONT></I>, 
      as well as desire, aversion and delusion altogether, at this point. We 
      understand how we thought before that our body was ours, now we see 
      clearly that it isn&#39;t ours.</P>
      <P>The still, peaceful and one-pointed mind at this level of practice can 
      see not-self very sharp. When contemplating on other levels before, one 
      can also see that the body is not self, but on the level of <I>khanika-sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I> 
      it is not as clear. One can also let go, but not as much. One can also 
      analyze phenomena as impermanent, not-self and dukkha and practice letting 
      go, but it will always be letting go on the level of <I>khanika-sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi.</FONT></I> 
      Or, reflecting when entering or staying in <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>, 
      one makes use of the strength of <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>. 
      Of course, one can also let go there, but it will always be in the range 
      of <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>, though this 
      is already clearer than before. But if the mind can enter the &quot;state of 
      being one&quot;, the power of being focused to one point can be used when 
      withdrawing into <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>. 
      Reflecting then, one can see very clear and let go very easily. To anyone 
      who comes to this point and practices a lot and makes use of all the 
      potential of practice he has built up before, the Buddha promised, that he 
      will receive the fruits, that he will see the Dhamma for certain -- if I 
      remember correctly -- in seven years, seven months or seven days. So, if 
      our minds have reached the state of one-pointedness and we analyze the 
      body, we will see the Dhamma for sure, we will change our status from 
      being a common worldling to becoming a Noble being.</P>
      <P>This is, why the practice of <I>sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I> 
      is so important to begin with, it is for the sake of giving power to the 
      mind. Those, who say, &quot;Why is it that our practice bears only little 
      fruit?&quot; can be answered, it is because they still lack a stable firmness 
      of mind. It is lacking because restraint and heedfulness haven&#39;t been 
      developed. Heedfulness and restraint need to be present in order to be 
      able to keep the mind inside and to control it.</P>
      <P>Practising in this way our mind begins to become peaceful and reaches
      <I>sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I>. This is the style that 
      the arahant that attains merely through insight <I>(Sukkhavipassako 
      Arahant)</I> follows. He develops the practice up to the level where the 
      mind attains peacefulness, and then investigates and abandons defilements. 
      The next level that takes the practice higher than this, is the arahant 
      that also attains the Threefold Knowledge <I>(Tevijjo Arahant)</I>. He 
      needs <I>sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I> that is stronger, 
      twice as powerful. He has takes the practice up to the second <I>jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I>, 
      and when he withdraws from it, going back into first <I>jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I> 
      and <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>, his 
      investigations are even more powerful than before or than in the ordinary 
      state of mind. But let&#39;s leave this level aside for the time being.</P>
      <P>When we begin the practice, let us work on building up strength in 
      order to attain one-pointedness, starting from<I> khanika-</I> and<I> upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-</FONT></I> 
      finally up to <I>appana-sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I> (<I>jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I>). 
      One problem that comes up in this way of practice, is the question: &quot;Why, 
      even though the mind has reached <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> 
      a few times already, doesn&#39;t it go further into one-ness?&quot;</P>
      <P>The reason is, that <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>, 
      that has been brought about through investigation or reflections, already 
      achieves peacefulness (though on a coarser level). If the mind has dwelled 
      in <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> of the 
      coarse kind to the full extend, the power of the mind will collapse again, 
      just as if it had never meditated before. Then we need to start practising 
      anew, we need to contemplate again, to make the mind go inwards again, 
      meditate again, concentrate on the breath again and continue like this 
      until we have a firm foundation of power of mind. Then we enter the stage 
      of <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> that is of 
      medium refinement. We see the body clearly, to the point where we think we 
      can abandon our defilements, cut them off completely. But still, we don&#39;t 
      enter one-ness, the mind pulls out again. So we need to do the same again, 
      until our mind reaches the refined stage of <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>. 
      If we dwell in this to the full extent, we can see things very clearly, 
      very distinctly. But already in the medium stage of refinement of <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>, 
      we can experience feelings of coolness to the extent of a few months. 
      After getting up in the morning, it only needs a tiny little bit of 
      determination to focus the mind and the mind already enters <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>. 
      It may stay there all day. Maybe it withdraws a little from time to time 
      -- for example when going to sleep -- and then the mind closes down as 
      well, but when getting up, the mind is able to instantly pick up <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> 
      again.</P>
      <P>The period of time that one can uphold <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> 
      of the medium or the coarse kind depends on the way we use reflection. 
      When we reflect, or listen to the Dhamma, for example the Dhamma about 
      samutti and vimutti (the conventional level and the level of liberation), 
      we always need to investigate in terms of the mind and the objects of the 
      mind. The mind and its objects are two separate things, but the one who 
      knows knows. We can let go of the objects, we can let go of attachment to 
      the body, we can let go of mind-states. Seeing reality on the conventional 
      level as what it is, the mind has entered the level of liberation. We can 
      compare it to how we see this meditation hall here. It is neither small 
      nor large. On a day like today (where there aren&#39;t too many people) it 
      looks as if the hall is quite spacious, it is not yet full. But at the 
      kathina festival, for example, or a donation ceremony, the hall seems too 
      small. Actually, the hall itself is neither too small nor too big, it is 
      just what it is, in itself it isn&#39;t anything. A reflection like this makes 
      us understand the world in accordance with reality. Seeing the 
      conventional world as for what it is the mind reaches the level of 
      liberation -- being liberated from having to hold on to things. This kind 
      of analysis deals with the outer world, the material world, it makes us 
      see the material world very clearly. When seeing reality the way it really 
      is, our minds may become very focused and collected, maybe even lasting up 
      to three days.</P>
      <P>The Nine Insight Knowledges <I>(vipassana ñ<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ānas)</FONT></I> 
      occur in these states of mind. One can see the arising and ceasing of 
      conditioned phenomena <I>(sankh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ārā)</FONT></I> 
      as it actually takes place. One can watch how they steadily keep on 
      disintegrating, and one realizes the threat and horror both of the inner 
      and outer conditioned world, feeling dispassion towards it. When we are 
      able to see these processes directly, <I>p<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">īti</FONT></I> 
      and contentment arise in the mind straight away. The external material 
      world would never be able to give rise to similar blissful feelings of 
      delight and being at ease - this is the power of the Dhamma working. A 
      heap of gold as huge as the whole earth couldn&#39;t give the same 
      satisfaction as seeing the Dhamma. At this point, the mind won&#39;t be 
      attached to the material world as usual any more, since it has already 
      seen how much more valuable the practice is. It is worth much more than 
      anything in the world.</P>
      <P>These insights are all already possible on the coarsest level of <I>
      upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>. The faith and 
      believe in the Buddha&#39;s teaching, the inspiration from it becomes stronger 
      and more stable for one who has such insights. Our heart starts looking 
      for a way out of this world, gets more and more dispassionate and the 
      search for sensory gratification starts to lessen -- so we increase our 
      efforts in practice. In this phase, after the mind has left the state of
      <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>, it can look 
      like the mind won&#39;t reestablish <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> 
      any more the way it did before, when it was capable of upholding <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> 
      for months. Now, only from time to time the mind goes as far as reentering
      <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>, sometimes it 
      only goes as far as entering <I>khanika-sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I>. 
      This is the way the practice is at this stage. But the foundation of 
      insights that we have already seen is still the driving force. It is like 
      having fired off the first stage of a rocket shooting out into freedom. 
      The second stage of the rocket keeps up working and firing on. It takes 
      the power of our mind to even higher levels.</P>
      <P>Whatever type of meditation we have taken up for reflection, whether it 
      is <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>ānāpānasati</I></FONT>, recollection of 
      death, or contemplating the loathsomeness of the body, we have to practise 
      it a lot, develop it a lot. Then our mind will start becoming more and 
      more peaceful. Maybe for a whole year we will experience a state of 
      coolness in our minds. This is a characteristic of peacefulness that can 
      appear, maybe even for as long as two, three or four years. The coolness 
      becomes more and more refreshing until our whole heart is filled with it. 
      A still, peaceful heart is one that can be controlled, that can develop 
      stable mindfulness.</P>
      <P>Now we start entering the level of <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> 
      of medium refinement. At first, we don&#39;t know it -- we think that we are 
      about to enter <I>jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I>, but again 
      and again it doesn&#39;t work. We have burnt up and cast off the second stage 
      of the rocket, so now we need to fire off the third stage. With all this 
      our practice is becoming stronger, and we increase our efforts to find a 
      way to make our minds more peaceful. It is now, that our practice is 
      developing to the point where <I>saddh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā
      </FONT></I>(faith), <I>viriya </I>(effort),<I> sati</I> (mindfulness), <I>
      sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I> (concentration) and <I>
      paññ<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT></I> (wisdom) become firmly 
      established. The Five Faculties or Powers start coming together. This 
      means, that the Seven Enlightenment Factors <I>(bojjhanghas)</I> start 
      arising. They can already arise from <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> 
      of the coarse and <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samād</FONT>hi</I> 
      of the medium level. The Four Foundations of Mindfulness start developing 
      more and more. And liberation starts to unfold bit by bit, up to the level 
      of medium refinement of <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>.</P>
      <P>When we start reflecting now, sometimes it only needs a little reminder 
      -- for example of death, to become peaceful: &quot;Our life is not secure, 
      death is certain, we need to die for sure when it comes to the end of our 
      lives.&quot; Luang Por Chah used to teach, if we have a lot of greed, anger and 
      delusion and none of the meditation objects work, just think of death. For 
      me personally, when I was newly ordained, I mostly practised Mindfulness 
      of Breathing and reflection on death as basic practices. This is because I 
      still used to fantasize about the future very much. When one is young, one 
      only thinks in terms of progress, one doesn&#39;t think of things declining, 
      so that&#39;s why I took up recollection of death, to think of the danger in 
      the cycle of rebirth, the constant sequence of birth and death. Life is 
      not sure, death is for sure. Finally we all have to die, the end of life 
      is death. Thinking like this, the mind is moved by a sense of urgency and 
      dispassion. We can see it like living in a house that&#39;s on fire: one can&#39;t 
      stay, one has to get out of the house. This is the feeling I had. </P>
      <P>When I practised at Wat Nong Pah Pong, Luang Por Chah taught us to 
      develop these reflections as a practice in order to prevent the mind 
      following its likes and dislikes. He gave us the means to find the path 
      leading to understanding the Dhamma, so we tried to pull ourselves 
      together to practice accordingly. This meant to be willing to sacrifice, 
      developing <I>dana-paramita</I>, the perfection of the spiritual potential 
      of giving or developing <I>sila-paramita</I>, perfecting the spiritual 
      potential of morality. But even before ordaining, I already saw the 
      difference between the conventional level of reality and the level of 
      liberation very clearly, as I mentioned before. </P>
      <P>It seemed that, when seeing the world of conventions as it is and 
      dealing with it, the mind had to escape into another world, bringing <I>p<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">īti</FONT></I> 
      and delight with it, for three days. I didn&#39;t want to eat my meal, so 
      contented, fulfilled and inspired was I. This is why I thought of leaving 
      laylife, of ordaining. <I>Nekkhamma-paramita</I>, the spiritual potential 
      of renunciation, was developed, to leave in search of freedom from 
      suffering. I was thinking, all the riches of the world don&#39;t really have a 
      meaning, all they cause is worry, stress and grasping. They just increase 
      suffering all the more. My mind wasn&#39;t yet peaceful. If these reflections 
      about reality as it is had been accompanied by mind-states of peace and 
      delight, the Nine Insight Knowledges would have arisen at that point 
      already.</P>
      <P>The mind in this phase searches for the path to freedom from suffering, 
      and if we constantly keep up the practice, we can even use situations 
      where we have to face crowds of people looking for pleasure and enjoying 
      themselves for reflection, simply bringing up the recollection of death. 
      Whatever object we choose for reflection, we need to maintain thinking of 
      it continuously in order to calm down our minds. Then our mind&#39;s will 
      neither feel attracted or aversed. But the peace of mind that results from 
      this practice still falls under the category of<I> samatha</I> (the type 
      of practice that calms the mind). To reflect on death is still <I>samatha</I>, 
      but it works with investigation and enables us to put things down and does 
      purify our hearts. When our hearts get calmer, merely to think of death or 
      our object of contemplation can take us into <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>, 
      where there is peace of mind with only a few thoughts coming up here and 
      then.</P>
      <P>After the end of my fifth rainy-season I started pactising <I>asubha 
      kammatth<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I>, contemplation of the 
      loathsomeness of the body. Although I had tried a little before, I had 
      somehow determined to focus on it only after the fifth rainy-season. Why, 
      I don&#39;t know -- whenever I started trying before, it wouldn&#39;t work. So, 
      after my fifth rainy-season, I took it up, bringing up images of the body 
      being not beautiful and disgusting in my mind. These images then became 
      more clear, to the point of becoming <I>sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi-nimittas</FONT></I> 
      (visions). Sometimes I imagined blood running, dripping down from my moth 
      all down my body, until strong feelings of revulsion would come up 
      straight away. If I developed it further, it looked so real that it would 
      make me throw up. This is what can come about simply through visualization 
      in meditation. When one develops this practice constantly, seeing the body 
      as clearly as loathsome inside and out, eventually gives rise to <I>p<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">īti</FONT></I>. 
      Seeing the body as impure, the mind gets pure all the more. <I>P<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">īti</FONT></I> 
      arises. Then <I>sukha</I> arises -- very powerful -- and then stillness of 
      mind. The mind enters peace. At first, these visions are called <I>
      uggaha-nimittas</I> (visualized images), and at a later stage <I>patibh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āga-nimittas</FONT></I> 
      (counterpart images). These are <I>nimittas </I>that one can increase or 
      decrease in size as one likes. In the beginning one analyzes a particular 
      part of the body and contemplates it. Then one can magnify it. The <I>
      uggaha-nimittas </I>can be turned into <I>patibh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āga-nimittas</FONT></I> 
      .</P>
      <P>This is an important stage of practice. If the mind has come as far as 
      this, it is able to separate and analyze the body in terms of the Four 
      Elements (earth, water, fire and air). Seeing the fallen leaves on the 
      ground, the green ones, the brown ones, the black ones, one is reminded of 
      the fact that they all have to turn into earth again. Then looking at 
      one&#39;s body one thinks of the fact that the body also is bound to 
      deteriorate and die, returning to the earth. So one sees the body as 
      earth, being earth element. This feels comfortable, calming and the mind 
      may enter <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> or 
      oneness from time to time. The mind is at peace, but hasn&#39;t reached 
      emptiness yet. But when we analyze in terms of the earth element in this 
      way, and seperate the state of being earth as indepedent from the body 
      being earth, the mind can see emptiness. If the peace in our minds becomes 
      more refined we can see the emptiness of the body after having 
      contemplated. Seeing the emptiness of the body, the mind is able to let go 
      of attachments. The emptiness that the mind realizes in this way has been 
      developed through <I>paññ<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā </FONT></I>
      (wisdom) and is called tadangavimutti, liberation through reflection on a 
      certain aspect.</P>
      <I>
      <P>Sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I> can also bring about 
      emptiness -- through the power of suppression. In this case the mind is 
      empty of objects<I> (<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ārammanas)</FONT></I>, 
      but not of defilements<I> (kilesas).</I> There is still attachment in the 
      mind, still greed, hatred and delusion, but the mind is peaceful, it can 
      force itself to attain peace. The same is true for contemplating things as 
      being elements, it also means to attain peace by suppressing, since greed, 
      hatred and delusion haven&#39;t been destroyed. But still the mind attains to 
      emptiness through seeing how the Four Elements form reality. They are <I>
      anicca </I>(impermanent), <I>dukkha </I>(unsatisfactory) and <I>anatt<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT></I> 
      (not-self).</P>
      <P>Emptiness means that we have seen the reality of the material world. 
      The mind is different from the body, distinct and absolutely separate. One 
      can compare it to going to another world, having the feeling of witnessing 
      another world -- not the world of conventions, not the world of the I or 
      me, not the world of beings, persons, me and mine, us and them. It is a 
      world that exists of freedom. The mind definitely flies up heading towards 
      it, but cannot reach it yet. It has to return again, back to the 
      conventions. But at least, when we have come as far as this, we will know, 
      that if we keep investigating in this direction many times and get to see 
      things clearly many times, then we should be able to see the Dhamma, 
      realize the Dhamma. This knowledge of the possibility of advancing into 
      freedom is called <I>gotrabhu-ñ<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I>. 
      Comparing it to the rocket, it means that our rocket has left the field of 
      gravity of this world and is heading on to another universe. The third 
      stage has already given it the power to shoot on and on. At this stage we 
      are very inspired to practise. Nobody has to remind us to put forth 
      effort, to do walking meditation or sitting meditation, we want to do it 
      by ourselves. When we are in <I>khanika- </I>or <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I>, 
      nobody needs to tell us about the peacefulness of each state, we find out 
      for ourselves, are motivated by ourselves. </P>
      <P>This is my experience from the first rainy-season on, and now it is 
      even more. Whether there is something to get or something happening, or 
      not, all we do is practise. Put forth effort, walk and sit meditation 
      until the mind is very peaceful, until it enters peace. Generally 
      upholding the state of <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> 
      and then attaining deeper peace, reaching stillness, one-pointedness or <I>
      appana-sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I>, the mind is very 
      strong. If one investigates then, one can separate mind and matter, see 
      very clearly again, and then -- depending on the individual strength -- 
      for three days, seven days or a month experience clearly the coming 
      together of the Noble Eightfold Path <I>(magga samaggi)</I>. This leads to 
      seeing the Buddha in one&#39;s own heart, seeing the Dhamma and the Sangha, 
      without any doubt. The mind dwells in liberation three days, seven days or 
      more than that. The ways of the world are one thing, the mind is another 
      -- worlds apart. The mind sees things in the light of <I>vimutti</I> all 
      the time. When the mind&#39;s power has been used up, it falls back into its 
      former state, but it won&#39;t doubt any more about the path leading to peace, 
      since it has already experienced emptiness, seen emptiness, or -- as we 
      say in the conventions of language -- has seen <I>Nibb<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I>. 
      The mind has entered the stream of Dhamma -- one can find many names.</P>
      <P>If someone has come as far as this, he won&#39;t doubt about how to 
      continue his practice. In the beginning, though, the question is only, how 
      to develop <I>saddh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā </FONT></I>(faith). As 
      to what concerns the fruits of the practice, they will ripen by 
      themselves. Luang Por Chah expressed this process comparing it to coming 
      into this <I>sala</I> (hall) here. To explain, what is inside the sala is 
      solely for the sake of arousing the people&#39;s interest in going inside for 
      themselves -- afterwards they will understand on their own. So all we need 
      to do now is to ask ourselves how to get our minds to be interested in 
      meditation, to be interested practising to know the breath, to be 
      interested in looking at the body and developing peace. When the mind is 
      peaceful, things will happen by themselves. This is my advice for 
      developing the practice of <I>sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I>.</P>
      <P>So the experience of emptiness can happen in either way, through the 
      peaceful mind that comes from using reflections, or through focusing on 
      knowing the breath in order to quieten the mind. Although emptiness can be 
      attained merely through <I>sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I>, 
      the way of developing emptiness through the use of <I>paññ<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT></I> 
      is the stronger one, as it implies letting go of grasping. This is 
      emptiness on the level of liberation, or in whatever way one likes to call 
      it on the conventional level -- one can call it emptiness that arises 
      through having uprooted grasping. What are the advantages of this 
      practise? When the mind has reached emptiness in this way, one doesn&#39;t 
      have to do anything any more, one doesn&#39;t have to focus on anything 
      anymore. If the mind is in <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> 
      of the coarse kind and we let go and liberate it even more and the power 
      of mind is stronger, the mind will be in <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> 
      of the medium level without having to do anything, it is there already. If 
      our power is even more, then the mind will accordingly be in <I>upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> 
      of the refined level. </P>
      <P>This is the way the power of the mind works. <I>Upac<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āra-samādhi</FONT></I> 
      of this type is freed of defilements already. The <I>sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I> 
      that one attains for the first time is different from this, it is 
      emptiness through suppressing things until the mind attains to oneness. 
      When one investigates afterwards, one can eradicate defilements as well, 
      and emptiness arises again, but of another type (than in one-ness). This 
      time the state of emptiness is a state of purity, it is <I>sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I> 
      that automatically arises through the purity of mind -- a very light state 
      of body and mind. In the beginning, practising <I>sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I> 
      is difficult. If one has <I>sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I>, 
      but then encounters with negative mind-states, the <I>sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I> 
      disappears. So one has to reflect more. Having reflected a lot, the <I>sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I> 
      is gone even more. The power of mind is not strong enough. That&#39;s how it 
      is. One becomes tired both with focusing and investigating. But, please be 
      patient. If one experiences <I>dukkha</I> in the present, one will 
      experience <I>sukha</I> as result. One has to be patient, keep being 
      patient and one will receive the fruits later on.</P>
      <P>So, let all of us, who are practitioners of the Dhamma, bound in the 
      fetters of the world, but born as human beings who have met the Buddha&#39;s 
      Teaching, put forth effort in the practice of meditation for the sake of 
      encountering the Dhamma in our hearts. Everyone of us.</P>
