        the most important questions we come to in spiritual practice is how to
        reconcile service and responsible action with a meditative life based on
        nonattachment, letting go, and coming to understand the ultimate
        emptiness of all conditioned things. Do the values that lead us to
        actively give, serve, and care for one another differ from the values
        that lead us deep within ourselves on a journey of liberation and
        awakening? To consider this question, we must first learn to distinguish
        among four qualities central to spiritual practice -- love, compassion,
        sympathetic joy, and equanimity -- and what might be called their
        &quot;near enemies.&quot; Near enemies may seem to be very close to
        these qualities and may even be mistaken for them, but they are not
        fundamentally alike.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The near enemy of love is attachment.
        Attachment masquerades as love. It says, &quot;I love this person as
        long as he or she doesn't change. I'll love you if you'll love me back.
        I'll love that if it will be the way I want it.&quot; This isn't love at
        all -- it is attachment -- and attachment is very different from love.
        Love allows, honors, and appreciates; attachment grasps, demands, needs,
        and aims to possess. Attachment offers love only to certain people; it
        is exclusive. Love, in the sense that the Buddha used the word metta is
        a universal, nondiscriminating feeling of caring and connectedness, even
        toward those whom we may not approve of or like. We may not condone
        their behavior, but we cultivate forgiveness. Love is a powerful tool
        that transforms any situation. It is not passive acquiescence. As the
        Buddha said, &quot;Hatred never ceases through hatred. Hatred only
        ceases through love.&quot; Love embraces all beings without exception,
        and discards ill will.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One near enemy of compassion is pity.
        Instead of feeling the openness of compassion, pity says, &quot;Oh, that
        poor person is suffering!&quot; Pity sets up a separation between
        oneself and others, a sense of distance and remoteness from the
        suffering of others that is affirming and gratifying to the ego.
        Compassion, on the other hand, recognizes the suffering of another as a
        reflection of one's own pain: &quot;I understand that; I suffer in the
        same way. It's a part of life.&quot; Compassion is shared suffering.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another near enemy of compassion is
        grief. Compassion is not grief. It is not an immersion in or
        identification with the suffering of others that leads to an anguished
        reaction. Compassion is the tender readiness of the heart to respond to
        one's own or another's pain without grief or resentment or aversion. It
        is the wish to dissipate suffering. Compassion embraces those
        experiencing sorrow, and eliminates cruelty from the mind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third quality, sympathetic joy, is
        the ability to feel joy in the happiness of others. The near enemy of
        equanimity is unintelligent indifference or callousness. We appear
        serene if we say, &quot;I'm not attached. I don't care what happens
        anyway because it's all transitory.&quot; We feel a certain peaceful
        relief because we withdraw from experience and from the energies of
        life. But true equanimity is not a withdrawal; it is a balanced
        engagement with all aspects of life. It is opening to the whole of life
        with composure and with balance of mind, seeing the nature of all
        things. Equanimity embraces the loved and the unloved, the agreeable and
        the disagreeable, and pleasure and pain; it eliminates clinging and
        aversion.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although everything is empty, we
        nevertheless honor the reality of form. As Zen Master Dogen says:
        &quot;Flowers fall with our attachment, and weeds spring up with our
        aversion.&quot; Knowing deeply that all will cage -- that the world of
        conditioned phenomena is insubstantial, we are fully present and in
        harmony with it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Attachment, pity, comparison, and
        indifference are all ways of backing away from life out of fear.
        Spirituality is not a removal or escape from life. It is seeing the word
        with a deeper vision that is not self-centered, a vision that sees
        through dualistic views to the underlying interconnectedness of all of
        life. It is the discovery of freedom in the very midst of our bodies and
        minds.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Eightfold Path the Buddha talks
        about Right Thought or Right Aspiration, which has three aspects. The
        first is cultivating thoughts that are free from desire, discarding
        transitory experience, and developing a sense of inner contentment. The
        second is cultivating thoughts free from ill will and resentment; this
        means cultivating thoughts of compassion and gentleness. The third is
        cultivating thoughts free from cruelty; this means nourishing the forces
        of kindness and active love within us. With a sense of Right Aspirations
        we can use all the different situations we face as stepping stones, This
        is the thread that unites all the moments of our lives. Each moment
        becomes an opportunity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">While in India, I spoke with Vimala
        Thaker about the question of meditation and activity in the world.
        Vimala had worked for many years in rural development and land
        redistribution projects when, as a result of her longtime interest in
        Krishnamurti's teachings, she began to teach meditation and devoted many
        years to this. She has recently returned to development work and to
        helping the hungry and homeless, teaching much less than she once had. I
        asked her why she decided to go back to the type of work she had been
        doing years before. She replied: &quot;Sir, I am a lover of life, and as
        a lover of life, I cannot keep out of any activity of life. If there are
        people who are hungry, for food, my response its to help feed them. If
        there are people who are hungry for truth, my response is to help them
        discover it. I make no distinction.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Suds have a saying, &quot;Praise
        Allah, and tie your camel to the post.&quot; Pray, but also make sure
        you do what is necessary in the world. Meditate, but manifest your
        understanding of this spiritual experience. Balance your realization of
        emptiness with a sense of compassion and impeccability to guide your
        life.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing emptiness means seeing that all
        of life is like a bubble in a rushing stream, a play of light and
        shadow, a dream. It means understanding that this tiny planet hangs in
        the immensity of space amidst millions and billions of stars and
        galaxies, that all of human history, is like one second compared to the
        billions of years of earth's history, and that it will all be over very
        soon and no one is really going anywhere. This context helps us to let
        go amidst the seeming seriousness of our problems, and to enter life
        with a sense of lightness and ease. Impeccability means that we must
        realize how precious life is, even though it is transient and ephemeral,
        and how each of our actions and words affect all beings around us in a
        most profound way. There is nothing inconsequential in this universe,
        and we need to respect this fact personally and act responsibly in
        accordance with it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One could make a very convincing case
        for simply devoting oneself to meditation. Does the world need more
        medicine and energy and buildings and food? Not really. There are enough
        resources for all of us. There is starvation and poverty and disease
        because of ignorance, prejudice, and fear, because we board materials
        and create wars over imaginary geographic boundaries and act as if one
        group of people is truly different from another group somewhere else on
        the planet. What the world needs is not more oil, but more love and
        generosity, more kindness and understanding. The most fundamental thing
        we can do to help this war-torn and suffering world is to genuinely free
        ourselves from the greed and fear and divisive views in our own minds,
        and then help others to do the same. Thus, a spiritual life is not a
        privilege; it is a basic responsibility.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But there is also a convincing argument
        for devoting oneself entirely to service in the world. I have only to
        mention the recent horror of Cambodia, the violence in Central America,
        the starvation in Africa -- situations in which the enormity of
        suffering is almost beyond comprehension In India alone, 350 million
        people live in such poverty that one day's work pays for only one meal.
        I once met a man in Calcutta who was sixty-four years old and pulled a
        rickshaw for a living. He had been doing it for forty years and had ten
        people dependent on him for income. He had gotten sick the year before
        for ten days; within a week money ran out and they had nothing to eat.
        How can we possibly let this happen? Forty children per-minute die from
        starvation while 25 million dollars per minute are spent on arms. We
        must respond. We cannot hold back or look away. We have painful dilemmas
        to face. Where should we put our energy? If we decide to meditate, even
        choosing which type of meditation practice can be confusing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The starting point is to look directly
        at suffering, both the suffering in the world and the suffering in our
        own hearts and minds. This is the beginning of the teaching of the
        Buddha. and the beginning of our own understanding of the problem of
        world peace. At this moment on our planet. there are hundreds of
        millions of people who are starving or malnourished. Hundreds of
        millions of people are so impoverished that they have little or no
        shelter and clothing, or they are sick with diseases that we know how to
        sure, but they cannot afford the medicine or do not have access to it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">For us to begin to look directly at the
        situation is not a question of ceremony or of religion. We have a
        mandate to took in a very deep way at the sorrow and suffering that
        exists now in our world, and to look at our individual and collective
        relationship to it, to bear witness to it, to acknowledge it instead of
        running away. The suffering is so great that we do not want to We close
        our minds. We close our eyes and hearts.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Opening ourselves to all aspects of
        experience is what is asked of us if we want to do something, if we want
        to make a change, if we want to make a difference. We must look at the
        world honestly, unflinchingly, and directly, and then look at ourselves
        and see that sorrow is not just out there, external, but it is also
        within ourselves. It is our own fear, prejudice, hatred, desire,
        neurosis, and anxiety. it is our own sorrow. We have to look at it and
        not run away from it. In opening ourselves to suffering, we discover
        that we can connect with and listen to our own hearts.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the heart of each of us, a great
        potential exists for realizing truth, for experiencing wholeness, for
        going beyond the shell of the ego. The problem is that we become so busy
        and lost in our own thinking that we lose our connection with our own
        true nature. If we look deeply, we discover that the wholeness of our
        being comes to know and express itself both through meditation and
        through sharing ourselves with others, and the course to take is very
        clear and immediate. Whether it is an inner or an outer path, it has
        enormous power to affect the world.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I spend most of my time teaching
        meditation. A few years ago, when many &quot;thousands of Cambodian
        people were fleeing the violence in their homeland only to face
        starvation and disease in refugee camps in Thailand, something in me
        said, &quot;I've got to go there,&quot; and so I went. I knew the people
        and a few of the local languages. After being there for a short time,
        trying to assist, I returned to this country to guide intensive
        meditation retreats. I did not deliberate much at the time about whether
        or not I should go to work in the refugee camps. I felt that it had to
        be done, and I went and did it. It was immediate and personal.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The spiritual path does not present us
        with a stylized pat formula for everyone to follow. It not a matter of
        imitation. We cannot be Mother Theresa or Gandhi or the Buddha. We have
        to be ourselves. We must discover and connect with our unique expression
        of the truth. We must learn to listen to and trust ourselves.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two great forces in the world.
        One is the force of killing. People who are not afraid to kill govern
        nations, make wars, and control much of the activity of our world. There
        is great strength in not being afraid to kill. The other source of
        strength in the world--the real strength--is in people who are not
        afraid to die. These are people who have touched the very source of
        their being, who have looked into themselves in such a deep way that
        they understand and acknowledge and accept death, and in a way, have
        already died. They have seen beyond the separateness of the ego's shell,
        and they bring to life the fearlessness and the caring born of love and
        truth. This is a force that can meet the force of someone who is not
        afraid to kill.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the power Gandhi called
        satygraha, the force of truth, and the force that he demonstrated in his
        own life. When India was partitioned, millions of people became refugees
        -- Muslims and Hindus moved from one country to another. There was
        horrible violence and rioting. Tens of thousands of troops were sent to
        West Pakistan to try to quell the terrible violence, while Gandhi went
        to what was then East Pakistan. He walked from village to village asking
        people to stop the bloodshed. Then he fasted. He said he would take no
        more food until the violence and insanity stopped, even if it meant his
        own death. And the riots stopped. They stopped because of the power of
        love, because Gandhi cared about something -- call it truth or life or
        whatever you wish -- it was something much greater than Gandhi the
        person. This is the nature of our spiritual practice, whatever form it
        may' take. Living aligned with truth is more important than either
        living or dying. This understanding is the source of incredible power
        and energy, and must be manifested through love, compassion, sympathetic
        joy, and equanimity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the exquisite experiences of my
        travels in India was going to the holy city of Benares by the Ganges
        River. Along the river bank are ghats where people bathe as a
        purification, and there are also ghats where people bring corpses to be
        cremated. I had heard about the burning ghats for years and had always
        thought that being there would be a heavy experience. I was rowed down
        river in a little boat, and up to the ghats where there were twelve
        fires going. Every half-hour or so, a new body would be carried down to
        the fires as people chanted &quot;Rama Nama Satya Hei,&quot; the only
        truth is the name of God. I was surprised. It was not dreadful at all;
        it was peaceful, quiet, and very sane. There was as a recognition that
        life and death are part of the same process and therefore death need not
        be feared.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a deep joy that comes when we
        stop denying the painful aspects of life, and instead allow our hearts
        to open to and accept the full range of our experience: life and death,
        pleasure and pain, darkness and light. Even in the face of the
        tremendous suffering in the world, there can be this joy, which comes
        not from rejecting pain and seeking pleasure, but rather from our
        ability to meditate and open ourselves to the truth. Spiritual practice
        begins by allowing ourselves to face our own sadness, fear, anxiety,
        desperation -- to die to the ego's ideas about how things should be, and
        to love and accept the truth of things as they are.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">With this as our foundation, we can see
        the source of suffering in our lives and in the world around us. We can
        see the factors of greed, hatred, and ignorance that produce a sense of
        separation. If we look directly, we can see the end of suffering because
        its end is an acknowledgment and a clear understanding of the oneness of
        light and dark, up and down, sorrow and joy. We can see all these things
        without attachment and without separation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We must look at how we have created and
        enforced separation. How have we made this a world of &quot;I want this;
        I want to become that; this will make me safe; this will make me
        powerful?&quot; Race, nationality, age, and religion all enforce
        separation. Look into yourself and see what is &quot;us&quot; and what
        is &quot;them&quot; for you. When there is a sense of &quot;us,&quot;
        then there is a sense of &quot;other.&quot; When we can give this up,
        then we can give up the idea that strength comes from having more than
        others, or from having the power to kill others. When we give this up,
        we give up the stereotype of love as a weakness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a story from the Zen tradition
        about an old monk in China who practiced very hard meditation for many
        years. He had a good mind and became very quiet, but never really
        touched the end of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot; in himself. He
        never came to the source of complete stillness or peace out of which
        transformation comes, So he went to the Zen Master and said, &quot;May I
        please have permission to go off and practice in the mountains? I have
        worked for years as a monk and there is nothing else I want but to
        understand this: the true nature of myself, of this world.&quot; And the
        master, knowing that he was ripe, gave him permission to leave.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">He left the monastery, took his bowl and
        few possessions, and walked through various towns toward the mountains.
        He had left the last village behind and was going up a little trail when
        there appeared before him, coming down the trail, an old man carrying a
        great big bundle on his back. This old man was actually the Bodhisattva,
        Manjusri, who is said to appear to people at the moment that they are
        ripe for awakening, and is depicted carrying the sword of discriminating
        wisdom that cuts through all attachment, all illusion, and separateness.
        The monk looked at the old man, and the old man said, &quot;Say, friend,
        where are you going?&quot; The monk told his story. &quot;I've practiced
        for all these years and all I want now is to touch that center point, to
        know that which is essentially true. Tell me, old man, do you know
        anything of this enlightenment?&quot; The old man simply let go of the
        bundle; it dropped to the ground, and the monk was enlightened.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is our aspiration and our task --
        to put it all down, to drop all of our clinging, condemning,
        identifying, our opinions and our sense of I, me, mine. The newly
        enlightened monk looked at the old man again. He said, &quot;So now
        what?&quot; The old man reached down, picked up the bundle again and
        walked off to town.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We want to put it all down, which means
        also to acknowledge where it begins. To see sorrow, to see suffering, to
        see pain, to see that we are all in it together, to see birth and death.
        If we are afraid of death and afraid of suffering, and we do not want to
        look, then we cannot put it down. We will push it away here and will
        grab it again there. When we have seen the nature of life directly, we
        can put it down. Once we put it down, then with understanding and
        compassion we can pick it up again. Then we can act effectively, even
        dramatically, without bitterness or self-righteousness. We can be
        motivated by a genuine sense of caring and of forgiveness, and a
        determination to live our lives well.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">A number of years ago I attended a
        conference at which Mad Bear, an Iroquois medicine man spoke. He said,
        &quot;For my presentation I'd like us to begin by going outside,&quot;
        and we all went out. He led us to an open field and then asked us to
        stand silently in a circle. We stood for a while in silence under a wide
        open sky, surrounded by fields of grain stretching to the horizon. Then
        Mad Bear began to speak offering a prayer of gratitude. He began by
        thanking the earthworms for aerating the soil so that plants can grow.
        He thanked the grasses that cover the earth for keeping the dust from
        blowing, for cushioning out steps, and for showing our eyes the
        greenness and beauty of their life. He thanked the wind for bringing
        rain, for cleaning the air, for giving us the life-breath that connects
        us with all beings. He spoke in this way for nearly an hour, and as we
        listened we felt the wind on our faces, and the earth beneath our feet,
        and we saw the grass and clouds, all with a sense of connectedness,
        gratitude, and love.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the spirit of our practice of
        mindfulness. Love -- not the near enemy of attachment, but something
        much deeper -- infuses our awareness enables us to open to and accept
        the truth of each moment, to feel our intimate connectedness with all
        things, and to see the wholeness of life. Whether we are sitting in
        meditation or sitting somewhere in protest, that is our spiritual
        practice in every moment./.</font></p>
