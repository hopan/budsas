    <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>n general terms,
    Right Concentration means establishing the mind rightly. On one level, this can apply to
    all the factors of the path. You have to start out by setting the mind on Right View. In
    other words, you use your discernment to gather together all the Dhamma you've heard. Then
    when you set the mind on Right Resolve, that's also a way of establishing it rightly. Then
    you set it on Right Speech, speaking only things that are right. You set it on Right
    Action, examining your actions and then forcing yourself, watching over yourself, to keep
    your actions firmly in line with what's right. As for Right Livelihood, you set your mind
    on making your livelihood exclusively in a right way. You're firm in not making a
    livelihood in ways that are wrong, not acting in ways that are wrong, not speaking in ways
    that are corrupt and wrong. You won't make any effort in ways that go off the path, you
    won't be mindful in ways that lie outside the path. You'll keep being mindful in ways that
    stay on the path. You make this vow to yourself as a firm determination. This is one level
    of establishing the mind rightly. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman">But what I want
    to talk about today is Right Concentration in the area of meditation: in other words,
    Right Meditation, both in the area of tranquillity meditation and insight meditation. You
    use the techniques of tranquillity meditation to bring the mind to stillness. When you
    make the mind still, firm in skillful qualities, that's one aspect of Right Concentration.
    If the mind isn't firmly established in skillful qualities, it can't grow still. If
    unskillful qualities arise in the mind, it can't settle down and enter concentration. This
    is why, when the Buddha describes the mind entering concentration, he says, <i>&quot;Vivicceva
    kamehi&quot;:</i> Quite secluded from sensual preoccupations. The mind isn't involved,
    doesn't incline itself toward sights that will give rise to infatuation and desire. It
    doesn't incline itself toward sounds that it likes, toward aromas, tastes, or tactile
    sensations for which it feels infatuation through the power of desire. At the same time,
    it doesn't incline itself toward desire for those things. Before the mind can settle into
    concentration, it has to let go of these five types of preoccupations. This is called <i>vivicceva
    kamehi,</i> quite secluded from sensual preoccupations. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Vivicca akusalehi dhammehi: </i>quite secluded from the
    unskillful qualities called the five Hindrances. For example, the first Hindrance: sensual
    desire. When you sit in meditation and a defilement arises in the mind, when you think of
    something and feel desire for an internal or an external form, when you get infatuated
    with the things you've seen and known in the past, that's called sensual desire. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Or if you think of something that makes you dissatisfied
    to the point of feeling ill will for certain people or objects: that's the Hindrance of
    ill will. Things from the past that upset you suddenly arise again in the present, barge
    their way in to obstruct the stillness of your mind. When the mind gets upset in this way,
    that's an unskillful mental state that forms an obstruction to concentration. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Or sloth and torpor: a sense of laziness and
    inattentiveness when the mind isn't intent on its work and so lets go out of laziness and
    carelessness. It gets drowsy so that it can't be intent on its meditation. You sit here
    thinking <i>buddho, buddho, </i>but instead of focusing the mind to get it firmly
    established so that it can gain knowledge and understanding from its <i>buddho,</i> you
    throw <i>buddho</i> away to go play with something else. As awareness gets more refined,
    you get drowsy and fall asleep or else let delusion overcome the mind. This is an
    unskillful mental state called sloth and torpor. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then there's restlessness and anxiety, when mindfulness
    isn't keeping control over things, and the mind follows its preoccupations as they shoot
    out to things that you like and don't like. The normal state of people's minds is that,
    when mindfulness isn't in charge, the mind can't sit still. It's bound to keep thinking
    about 108 different sorts of things. So when you're practicing concentration you have to
    exercise restraint, you have to be careful that the mind doesn't get scattered about. You
    have to be mindful of the present and alert to the present, too. When you try to keep <i>buddho</i>
    in mind, you have to be alert at the same time to watch over your <i>buddho.</i> Or if
    you're going to be mindful of the parts of the body -- like hair of the head, hair of the
    body, nails, teeth, skin -- you should focus on only one part at a time, making sure that
    you're both mindful and alert to your mindfulness, to make sure you don't go being mindful
    of other things. That's how you can cut off restlessness and anxiety. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As you keep being mindful for of the same thing for a long
    time, the body will gradually calm down and relax. The preoccupations of the mind will
    calm down, too, so that the mind can grow still. It grows still because you keep it under
    control. You weaken its unruliness -- as when you pull fuel away from a burning fire. As
    you keep pulling away the fuel, the fire gradually grows weaker and weaker. And what's the
    fuel for the mind's unruliness? Forgetfulness. Inattentiveness. This inattentiveness is
    the fuel both for restlessness and anxiety and for sloth and torpor. When you keep
    mindfulness and alertness in charge, you cut away forgetfulness and inattentiveness. As
    these forms of delusion are subdued, they lose their power. They gradually disband,
    leaving nothing but awareness of <i>buddho</i> or whatever your meditation object is. As
    you keep looking after your meditation object firmly, without growing inattentive,
    restlessness will disappear. Drowsiness will disappear. The mind will get firmly
    established in Right Concentration. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is how you enter Right Concentration. You have to
    depend on both mindfulness and alertness together. Right Concentration can't simply arise
    on its own. It needs supporting factors. The first seven factors of the path are the
    supporters for Right Concentration, or its requisites, the things it needs to depend on.
    It needs Right View, Right Resolve, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right
    Effort, and Right Mindfulness. As you keep developing the beginning factors of the path,
    concentration becomes more and more refined, step by step. When the mind is trained and
    suffused with these qualities, it's able to let go of sensual preoccupations, able to let
    go of unskillful mental qualities. <i>Vivicceva kamehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi. </i>When
    it's secluded from sensual preoccupations, secluded from unskillful qualities, it can
    enter concentration. It experiences stillness, rapture, pleasure, singleness of
    preoccupation. Both body and mind feel light. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the first stage, the mind isn't totally refined because
    it still has directed thought and evaluation in the factors of its concentration. If your
    mindfulness is in good shape and keeps its object in mind without pulling away, if your
    effort is right and alertness keeps watching over things, the coarser parts of your
    concentration will drop away and the mind will grow more refined step by step. Directed
    thought and evaluation -- the coarser parts -- will drop away because they can't follow
    into that more refined stage. All that's left is rapture, pleasure, and singleness of
    preoccupation. As you keep on meditating without let-up, things keep growing more refined
    step by step. Rapture, which is coarser than pleasure, will drop away, leaving the
    pleasure. Pleasure is coarser than equanimity. As you keep contemplating while the mind
    grows more refined, the pleasure will disappear, leaving just equanimity. As long as
    there's still pleasure, equanimity can't arise. As long as the mind is still feeding off
    pleasure, it's still with something coarse. But as you keep up your persistent effort
    until you see that this pleasure still comes under the Three Characteristics of
    inconstancy, stress, and not-self, that it's part of the aggregate of feeling, the mind
    will let go of that coarser aspect and settle down with equanimity. Even though
    equanimity, too, is part of the feeling aggregate, it's a feeling refined enough to
    cleanse the mind to the point where can give rise to knowledge of refined levels of
    Dhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the mind reaches this level, it's firm and unwavering
    because it's totally neutral. It doesn't waver when the eye sees a form, the ear hears a
    sound, the nose smells an aroma, the tongue tastes a flavor, the body feels a tactile
    sensation, or an idea comes to the mind. None of these things can make the mind waver when
    it's in the factors of jhana. It maintains a high level of purity. This is Right
    Concentration. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We should all develop tranquillity meditation, which can
    give temporary respite from suffering and stress. But in a state like this, you simply
    have mindfulness in charge. Discernment is still too weak to uproot the most refined
    levels of defilement <i>(kilesa)</i> and latent tendencies <i>(anusaya). </i>Thus, for our
    Right Concentration to be complete, we're taught not to get carried away with the sense of
    pleasure it brings. When the mind has been still for an appropriate amount of time, we
    should then apply the mind to contemplating the five aggregates, for these aggregates are
    the basis for insight meditation. You can't develop insight meditation outside of the five
    aggregates -- the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, thought-fabrications, and
    consciousness -- for these aggregates lie right within us. They're right next to us, with
    us at all times. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So. How do you develop the aggregate of form as a basis
    for insight meditation? You have to see it clearly in line with its truth that form is
    inconstant. This is how you begin. As you develop insight meditation, you have to
    contemplate down to the details. What is form? Form covers hair of the head, hair of the
    body, nails, teeth, skin, and all the four great elements that we can touch and see. As
    for subsidiary forms, they can't be seen with the eye, but they can be touched, and they
    depend on the four great elements. For example, sound is a type of form, a type of
    subsidiary form. Aromas, flavors, tactile sensations are subsidiary forms that depend on
    the four great elements. The sensory powers of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body are
    subsidiary forms -- they're physical events, not mental events, you know. Then there are
    masculinity and femininity, which fashion the body to be male or female, and create
    differences in male and female voices, manners, and other characteristics. Then there's
    the heart, and then <i>viññati-rupa,</i> which allows for the body to move, for speech
    to be spoken. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the Buddha taught that we should contemplate form in
    all its aspects so as to gain the insight that will enable us to withdraw all our clinging
    assumptions that say that they're us or ours. How does this happen? When we contemplate,
    we'll see that <i>yam kiñci rupam atitanagata-paccuppannam:</i> all form -- past, future,
    or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near -- is
    inconstant, stressful, and not-self. It all lies under the Three Characteristics. When we
    remember this, that's called <i>pariyatti-dhamma,</i> the Dhamma of study. When we
    actually take things apart and contemplate them one by one to the point where we gain true
    knowledge and vision, that's called the practice of insight meditation, the discernment
    that arises in line with the way things really are. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a short explanation of insight meditation, focused
    just on the aggregate of form. As for feeling -- the pleasures, pains, and feelings of
    neither pleasure nor pain within us -- once we've truly seen form, we'll see that the same
    things apply to feeling. It's inconstant. When it's inconstant, it'll have to make us
    undergo suffering and stress because of that inconstancy. We'll be piling suffering on top
    of suffering. Actually, there's no reason why the mind should suffer from these things,
    but we still manage to make ourselves suffer because of them. Even though they're
    not-self, there's suffering because we don't know. There's inconstancy because we don't
    know. Unless we develop insight meditation to see clearly and know truly, we won't be able
    to destroy the subtle, latent tendency of ignorance, the latent tendency of becoming, the
    latent tendency of sensuality within ourselves. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But if we're able to develop insight meditation to the
    point where we see form clearly in terms of the Three Characteristics of inconstancy,
    stress, and not-self, then disenchantment will arise. When the latent tendencies of
    ignorance and becoming are destroyed, the latent tendency of sensuality will have no place
    to stand. There's nothing it can fabricate, for there's no delusion. When ignorance
    disbands, fabrications disband. When fabrications disband, all the suffering that depends
    on fabrication will have to disband as well. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is why we should practice meditation in line with the
    factors of the noble eightfold path as set down by the Buddha. To condense it even
    further, there are three trainings: virtue, concentration, and discernment. Virtue --
    exercising restraint over our words and deeds -- is part of the path. Tranquillity
    meditation and insight meditation come under concentration. So virtue, concentration, and
    discernment cover the path. Or if you want to condense things even further, there are
    physical phenomena and mental phenomena -- i.e., the body and mind. When we correctly
    understand the characteristics of the body, we'll see into the ways the body and mind are
    interrelated. Then we'll be able to separate them out. We'll see what's not-self and what
    isn't not-self. Things in and of themselves aren't not-self, for they each have an
    in-and-of-themselves. It's not the case that there's nothing there at all. If there were
    nothing there at all, how would there be contact? Think about it. Take the fire element:
    who could destroy it? Even though it's not-self, it's got an in-and-of-itself. The same
    holds true with the other elements. <i>In other words, these things still exist, simply
    that there's no more clinging. </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So I ask that you understand this and then put it
    correctly into practice so as to meet with happiness and progress. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's enough explanation for now. Keep on meditating
    until the time is up. </font></p>
