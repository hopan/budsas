    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The late Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw was born in the year
    1904 at Seikkhun, a large, prosperous and charming village
    lying about seven miles to the west of the historic Shwebo
    town in Upper Burma. His parents, peasant proprietors by
    occupation, were U Kan Taw and Daw Oke. At the age of six he
    was sent to receive his early monastic eduction under U
    Adicca, presiding monk of Pyinmana Monastery at Seikkhun. Six
    years later, he was initiated into the monastic Order as a
    novice <i>(samanera)</i> under the same teacher and given the
    name of Shin Sobhana (which means Auspicious). The name
    befitted his courageous features and his dignified behaviour.
    He was a bright pupil, making remarkably quick progress in
    his scriptural studies. When U Adicca left the Order, Shin
    Sobhana continued his studies under Sayadaw U Parama of
    Thugyi-kyaung Monastery, Ingyintaw-taik. At the age of
    nineteen he had to decide whether to continue in the Order
    and devote the rest of his life to the service of the <i>Buddha
    Sasana</i> or to return to lay life. Shin Sobhana knew where
    his heart lay and unhesitatingly chose the first course. He
    was ordained as a <i>Bhikkhu</i> on the 26th of November
    1923, Sumedha Sayadaw Ashin Nimmala acting as his preceptor.
    Within four years Ven. Sobhana passed all three grades of the
    Pali scriptural examinations conducted by the Government.</p>
    <p>Ven. Sobhana next went to the city of Mandalay, noted for
    its pre-eminence in Buddhist learning, to pursue advanced
    study of the scriptures under Sayadaws well-known for their
    learning. His stay at Khinmakan-west Monastery for this
    purpose was, however, cut short after little more than a year
    when he was called to Moulmein. The head of the Taik-kyaung
    monastery in Taungwainggale (who came from the same village
    as Ven. Sobhana) wanted him to assist with the teaching of
    his pupils. While teaching at Taungwainggale, Ven. Sobhana
    went on with his own studies of the scriptures, being
    especially interested in the <i>Mahasatipatthana Sutta.</i>
    His deepening interest in the <i>satipatthana</i> method of <i>vipassana</i>
    meditation took him next to neighbouring Thaton where the
    well-known Mingun Jetavan Sayadaw was teaching it. Under the
    Mingun Jetavan Sayadaw's instruction, Ven. Sobhana took up
    intensive practice of <i>vipassana</i> meditation. Within
    four months he had such good results that he could teach it
    properly to his first three disciples at Seikkhun while he
    was on a visit there in 1938. After his return from Thaton to
    Taungwainggale (owing to the grave illness and subsequent
    death of the aged Taik-kyaung Sayadaw) to resume his teaching
    work and to take charge of the monastery, Ven. Sobhana sat
    for and passed with distinction the Government-held <i>Dhammacariya</i>
    (Teacher of the Dhamma) examination in June 1941.</p>
    <p>On the eve of the Japanese invasion of Burma, Ven. Sobhana
    had to leave Taungwainggale and return to his native
    Seikkhun. This was a welcome opportunity for him to devote
    himself wholeheartedly to his own practice of <i>satipatthana
    vipassana</i> meditation and to teaching it to a growing
    number of disciples. The Mahasi Monastery at Seikkhun (whence
    he became known as Mahasi Sayadaw) fortunately remained free
    from the horror and disruption of war. During this period the
    Sayadaw's disciples prevailed upon him to write the 'Manual
    of Vipassana Meditation', an authoritative and comprehensive
    work expounding both the doctrinal and practical aspects of <i>satipatthana</i>
    meditation.</p>
    <p>It was not long before the Mahasi Sayadaw's reputation as
    a skilled meditation teacher had spread throughout the
    Shwebo-Sagaing region and came to the attention of a devout
    and wealthy Buddhist, Sir U Thwin. U&nbsp;Thwin wanted to
    promote the <i>Buddha Sasana</i> by setting up a meditation
    centre directed by a teacher of proven virtue and ability.
    After listening to a discourse on <i>vipassana</i> given by
    the Sayadaw and observing his serene and noble demeanour, Sir
    U Thwin had no difficulty in deciding that the Mahasi Sayadaw
    was the meditation teacher he had been looking for.</p>
    <p>On the 13th of November 1947, the Buddhasasana Nuggaha
    Association was founded at Rangoon with Sir U Thwin as its
    first President, and with scriptural learning and the
    practice of the <i>Dhamma</i> as its object. Sir U Thwin
    donated to the Association a plot of land in Hermitage Road,
    Rangoon, measuring over five acres, for the erection of the
    proposed meditation centre. In 1978, the Centre occupied an
    area of 19.6 acres, on which a vast complex of buildings and
    other structures had been built. Sir U Thwin told the
    Association that he had found a reliable meditation teacher
    and proposed that the then Prime Minister of Burma invite
    Mahasi Sayadaw to the Centre.</p>
    <p>After the Second World War, the Sayadaw alternated his
    residence between his native Seikkhun and Taungwainggale in
    Moulmein. Meanwhile, Burma had regained independence on 4th
    January 1948. In May 1949, during one of his sojourns at
    Seikkhun, the Sayadaw completed a new <i>nissaya</i>
    translation of the <i>Mahasatipatthana Sutta.</i> This work
    excels the average <i>nissaya</i> translation of this <i>Sutta,</i>
    which is very important for those who wish to practise <i>vipassana</i>
    meditation but need guidance.</p>
    <p>In November of that year, on the personal invitation of
    the then Prime Minister, U Nu, Mahasi Sayadaw came down from
    Shwebo and Sagaing to the Sasana Yeiktha (Meditation Centre)
    at Rangoon, accompanied by two senior Sayadaws. Thus began
    Mahasi Sayadaw's guardianship of the Sasana Yeiktha at
    Rangoon. On 4th December 1949 Mahasi Sayadaw personally
    instructed the very first batch of twenty-five meditators in
    the practice of <i>vipassana.</i> As the meditators grew in
    numbers, it became too demanding for the Sayadaw to give the
    entire initiation talk to all the meditators. From July 1951
    the tape-recorded talk was played for each new batch of
    meditators with a brief introduction by the Sayadaw. Within a
    few years of the establishment of the Sasana Yeiktha at
    Rangoon, similar meditation centres were inaugurated in many
    parts of the country with Mahasi-trained members of the <i>Sangha</i>
    as meditation teachers. These centres were not confined to
    Burma alone, but extended to neighbouring Theravada countries
    like Thailand and Sri Lanka. There were also a few centres in
    Cambodia and India. According to a 1972 census, the total
    number of meditators trained at all these centres (both in
    Burma and abroad) had exceeded seven hundred thousand. In
    recognition of his distinguished scholarship and spiritual
    attainments, Mahasi Sayadaw was honoured in 1952 by the then
    Prime Minister of the Union of Burma with the prestigious
    title of <i>Aggamahapandita</i> (the Exalted Wise One).</p>
    <p>Soon after attaining Independence, the Government of Burma
    began plans to hold a Sixth Buddhist Council <i>(Sangayana)</i>
    in Burma, with four other Theravada Buddhist countries (Sri
    Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos) participating. For this
    purpose the Government dispatched a mission to Thailand and
    Cambodia, composed of Nyaungyan Sayadaw, Mahasi Sayadaw and
    two laymen. The mission discussed the plan with the Primates
    of the Buddhist Sangha of those two countries.</p>
    <p>At the historic Sixth Buddhist Council, which was
    inaugurated with every pomp and ceremony on 17th May 1954,
    Mahasi Sayadaw played an eminent role, undertaking the
    exacting and onerous tasks of <i>Osana</i> (Final Editor) and
    <i>Pucchaka</i> (Questioner). A unique feature of this
    Council was the editing of the commentaries <i>(Atthakatha)</i>
    and sub-commentaries <i>(tikas),</i> as well as the canonical
    texts. In the editing of this commentarial literature, Mahasi
    Sayadaw was responsible for making a critical analysis, sound
    interpretation and skilful reconciliation of several crucial
    and divergent passages.</p>
    <p>A significant result of the Sixth Buddhist Council was the
    revival of interest in Theravada Buddhism among Mahayana
    Buddhist. In 1955, while the Council was in progress, twelve
    Japanese monks and a Japanese laywoman arrived in Burma to
    study Theravada Buddhism. The monks were initiated into the
    Theravada Buddhist Sangha as<i> </i>novices while the
    laywoman was made a Buddhist nun. Then, in July 1957, at the
    instance of the Buddhist Association of Moji, the Buddha
    Sasana Council of Burma sent a Theravada Buddhist mission to
    Japan. Mahasi Sayadaw was one of the leading representatives
    of the Burmese Sangha in that mission.</p>
    <p>Also in 1957, Mahæsø Sayadaw undertook the task of
    writing an introduction in Pali to the <i>Visuddhimagga
    Atthakatha,</i> to refute certain misstatements about its
    famous author, Ven. Buddhaghosa. The Sayadaw completed this
    difficult task in 1960, his work bearing every mark of
    distinctive learning and depth of understanding. By then the
    Sayadaw had also completed two volumes (out of four) of his
    Burmese translation of this famous commentary and classic
    work on Buddhist meditation.</p>
    <p>At the request of the Government of Sri Lanka, a special
    mission headed by Sayadaw U Sujata, an eminent deputy of
    Mahasi Sayadaw, went there in July 1955 to promote <i>satipatthana
    </i>meditation. The mission stayed in Sri Lanka for over a
    year doing admirable work, setting up twelve permanent and
    seventeen temporary meditation centres. Following the
    completion of a meditation centre on a site granted by the
    Sri Lankan Government, a larger mission led by Mahasi Sayadaw
    left Burma for Sri Lanka on 6th January 1959, via India. The
    mission was in India for about three weeks, during which its
    members visited several holy places associated with the life
    and work of Lord Buddha. They also gave religious talks on
    suitable occasions and had interviews with Prime Minister
    Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, President of India Dr. Rajendra Prasad
    and vice-president Dr.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Radhakrishnan. A notable
    feature of the visit was the warm welcome received from
    members of the depressed classes, who had embraced Buddhism
    under the guidance of their late leader Dr.&nbsp;Ambedkar.</p>
    <p>The mission flew from Madras to Sri Lanka on 29th January
    1959 and arrived at Colombo on the same day. On Sunday 1st
    February, at the opening ceremony of the meditation centre
    named 'Bhavana Majjhathana', Mahasi Sayadaw delivered an
    address in Pali after Prime Minister Bandaranayake and some
    others had spoken. The members of the mission next went on an
    extended tour of the island, visiting several meditation
    centres where Mahasi Sayadaw gave discourses on <i>vipassana</i>
    meditation. They also worshipped at famous sites of Buddhist
    pilgrimage like Polonnaruwa, Anuradhapura and Kandy. This
    historic visit of the Burmese mission under the inspiring
    leadership of Mahasi Sayadaw was symbolic of the ancient and
    close ties of friendship between these two Theravada Buddhist
    countries. Its benefit to the Buddhist movement in Sri Lanka
    was a revival of interest in meditation, which seemed to have
    declined.</p>
    <p>In February 1954, a visitor to the Sasana Yeiktha might
    have noticed a young Chinese man practising <i>vipassana</i>
    meditation. The meditator in question was a Buddhist teacher
    from Indonesia by the name of Bung An who had become
    interested in <i>vipassana</i> meditation. Under the guidance
    of Mahasi Sayadaw and Sayadaw U&nbsp;Nanuttara, Mr Bung An
    made such excellent progress that in little more than a month
    Mahasi Sayadaw gave him a detailed talk on the progress of
    insight. Later he was ordained a <i>bhikkhu</i> and named
    Ven. Jinarakkhita, with Mahasi Sayadaw as his preceptor.
    After he returned as a Buddhist monk to Indonesia, the Buddha
    Sasana Council received a request to send a Burmese Buddhist
    monk to promote missionary work in Indonesia. It was decided
    that Mahasi Sayadaw, as the preceptor and mentor of Ashin
    Jinarakkhita, should go. With thirteen other Theravada monks,
    Mahasi Sayadaw undertook such primary missionary activities
    as consecrating <i>simas</i> (ordination boundaries)
    ordaining <i>bhikkhus,</i> initiating novices and giving
    discourses, particularly talks on <i>vipassana</i>
    meditation.</p>
    <p>Considering these fruitful activities in promoting
    Buddhism in Indonesia and Sri Lanka, we might describe Mahasi
    Sayadaw's missions to these countries as '<i>Dhamma-vijaya'</i>
    (victory of the Dhamma) journeys.</p>
    <p>As early as 1952, at the request of the Thai Minister for
    Sangha Affairs, Mahasi Sayadaw had sent Sayadaws U Asabha and
    U&nbsp;Indavamsa to Thailand for the promotion of <i>satipatthana
    vipassana.</i> Thanks to their efforts, Mahasi Sayadaw's
    method gained wide acceptance in Thailand. By 1960, many
    meditation centres had been established and the number of
    Mahasi meditators exceeded a hundred thousand.</p>
    <p>It was characteristic of the Venerable Sayadaw's
    disinterested and single-minded devotion to the cause of the <i>Buddha
    Sasana</i> that, regardless of his advancing age and feeble
    health, he undertook three more missions to the West
    (Britain, Europe and America) and to India and Nepal in the
    three years (1979, 1980 and 1981) preceding his death.</p>
    <p>Abhidhajamaharatthaguru Masoeyein Sayadaw, who presided
    over the Sanghanayaka Executive Board at the Sixth Buddhist
    Council, urged Mahasi Sayadaw to teach two commentaries to
    the Sangha at Sasana Yeiktha. Ven. Buddhaghosa's <i>Visuddhimagga
    Atthakatha</i> and Ven. Dhammapala's <i>Visuddhimagga
    Mahatika</i> deal primarily with Buddhist meditation theory
    and practice, though they also offer useful explanations of
    important doctrinal points, so they are vital for prospective
    meditation teachers. Mahasi Sayadaw began teaching these two
    works on 2nd February 1961, for one and a half or two hours
    daily. Based on the lecture notes taken by his pupils, the
    Sayadaw started writing a <i>nissaya</i> translation of the <i>Visuddhimagga
    Mahatika,</i> completing it on 4th February 1966. This <i>nissaya</i>
    was an exceptional achievement. The section on the different
    views held by other religions <i>(samayantara)</i> was most
    exacting since the Sayadaw had to familiarise himself with
    ancient Hindu philosophy and terminology by studying all
    available references, including works in Sanskrit and
    English.</p>
    <p>Up till now Mahasi Sayadaw has to his credit 67 volumes of
    Burmese Buddhist literature. Space does not permit us to list
    them all here, but a complete up-to-date list of them is
    appended to the Sayadaw's latest publication, namely, '<i>A
    Discourse on Sakkapanha Sutta'</i> (published in October
    1978).</p>
    <p>At one time, Mahasi Sayadaw was severely criticised in
    certain quarters for his advocacy of the allegedly unorthodox
    method of noting the rising and falling of the abdomen in <i>vipassana</i>
    meditation. It was mistakenly assumed that this method was an
    innovation of the Sayadaw's, whereas the truth is that it had
    been approved several years before Mahasi Sayadaw adopted it,
    by no less an authority than the <i>mula</i> (original)
    Mingun Jetavan Sayadaw, and that it is in no way contrary to
    the Buddha's teaching on the subject. The reason for Mahasi
    Sayadaw's preference for this method is that the average
    meditator finds it easier to note this manifestation of the
    element of motion <i>(vayodhatu).</i> It is not, however,
    imposed on all who come to practise at any of the Mahasi
    meditation centres. One may, if one likes, practise <i>anapanasati</i>.
    Mahasi Sayadaw himself refrained from joining issue with his
    critics on this point, but two learned Sayadaws brought out a
    book each in defence of the Sayadaw's method, thus enabling
    those who are interested in the controversy to judge for
    themselves. </p>
    <p>This controversy arose in Sri Lanka where some members of
    the Sangha, inexperienced and unknowledgeable in practical
    meditation, publicly assailed Mahasi Sayadaw's method in
    newspapers and journals. Since this criticism was voiced in
    the English language with world-wide coverage, silence could
    no longer be maintained and so Sayadaw U&nbsp;Nanuttara of
    Kaba-aye (World Peace Pagoda campus) forcefully responded to
    the criticisms in the pages of the Sri Lankan Buddhist
    periodical '<i>World Buddhism'.</i></p>
    <p>Mahasi Sayadaw's international reputation has attracted
    numerous visitors and meditators from abroad, some seeking
    enlightenment for their religious problems and others intent
    on practising meditation under the Sayadaw's personal
    guidance. Among the first meditators from abroad was former
    British Rear-Admiral E.H. Shattock who came on leave from
    Singapore and practised meditation at the Sasana Yeiktha in
    1952. On his return to England he published a book entitled '<i>An
    Experiment in Mindfulness'</i> in which he related his
    experiences in generally appreciative terms. Another
    foreigner was Mr. Robert Duvo, a French-born American from
    California. He came and practised meditation at the Centre
    first as a lay meditator and later as a <i>bhikkhu.</i> He
    subsequently published a book in France about his experiences
    and the <i>satipatthana vipassana</i> method. Particular
    mention should be made of Anagarika Shri Munindra of Buddha
    Gaya in India, who became a close disciple of Mahasi Sayadaw,
    spending several years with the Sayadaw learning the Buddhist
    scriptures and practising <i>vipassana.</i> Afterwards he
    directed an international meditation centre at Buddha Gaya
    where many people from the West came to practise meditation.
    Among these meditators was a young American, Joseph
    Goldstein, who has written a perceptive book on insight
    meditation titled '<i>The Experience of Insight: A Natural
    Unfolding'.</i></p>
    <p>Some of the Sayadaw's works have been published abroad,
    such as '<i>The Satipatthana Vipassana Meditation'</i> and <i>'Practical
    Insight Meditation'</i> by the Unity Press, San Francisco,
    California, USA, and '<i>The Progress of Insight'</i> by the
    Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy, Sri Lanka. Selfless and
    able assistance was rendered by U Pe Thin (now deceased) and
    Myanaung U Tin in the Sayadaw's dealings with his visitors
    and meditators from abroad and in the translation into
    English of some of Sayadaw's discourses on <i>vipassana</i>
    meditation. Both of them were accomplished meditators.</p>
    <p>The Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw is profoundly revered by
    countless grateful disciples in Burma and abroad. Although it
    was the earnest wish of his devoted disciples that the
    Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw might live for several more years
    and continue showering the blessings of the <i>Buddhadhamma</i>
    on all those in search freedom and deliverance, the
    inexorable law of impermanence terminated, with tragic
    suddenness, his selfless and dedicated life on the 14th of
    August 1982. Like a true son of the Buddha, he lived
    valiantly, spreading the word of the Master throughout the
    world and helped many thousands and tens of thousands onto
    the Path of Enlightenment and Deliverance.</p>
