      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT> would like to begin this talk 
      firstly by speaking about developing the posture for meditation. The ideal 
      posture is one that is quite balanced, so try to sit on the floor quite 
      straight. Keep the back straight and push the lower back forward as if 
      something is pulling you from the chest upwards a little bit so that you 
      are lifting yourself up. The top of the head should be towards the 
      ceiling, keep your chin tucked in a little so that the neck is straight. 
      The posture is something that you can work with and improve, as it is 
      never perfect from the start.<P>Rather than using the cross-legged 
      posture, try to cultivate either the half lotus or the Burmese posture for 
      sitting meditation practice; when the knees are firmly on the floor there 
      is greater stability and it is easier to sit for longer periods. Use a 
      firm cushion to help push the pelvis forward, so that the belly softens 
      and the knees drop lower. <I>Hatha yoga</I> exercises are helpful in 
      building strength in the back and to help open the thighs, and make the 
      body more flexible. You should be careful not to pull the muscles, but do 
      try to exercise and stretch the legs.</P>
      <P>Some people sit on a low stool, which is tilted slightly forward to 
      straighten the back. If none of these postures are possible for you, and 
      you must sit on a chair, choose a straight backed firm chair, and support 
      your own back; do not lean on the back of the chair, do rest your feet 
      firmly on the ground. Experiment with these postures to find your own 
      limits. Work with your body to see if you can gradually cultivate a good, 
      straight and balanced posture. The more balanced you are, the more 
      comfortable you&#39;ll be and the easier you&#39;ll find it to sit for longer 
      periods; however some discomfort is natural, as we are unaccustomed to 
      sitting still for any time at all.</P>
      <P>Working with the posture is in itself a very good meditation, 
      especially when we feel very dull. At this time the breath is too refined 
      an object, so take this opportunity to use the body. The body is so 
      concrete; it feels so solid that it really grounds us and the feelings of 
      the body are always there definite, sharp and very present. So when the 
      mind starts getting into dull, confused states or very distracted 
      thinking, come back to something really definite like the bodily posture. 
      Just feel the body sitting, bring the mind within the body; fill the body 
      with the mind. Remind yourself, whenever the mind starts to wander - just 
      sitting. Let the mind sink back into the body. Body just sitting. Then you 
      can begin to experiment with improving the posture. Start by putting a bit 
      of strength into the back and neck. This is not only developing posture 
      for its own sake but it is also disciplining the mind itself by 
      cultivating awareness and energy in the mind. The state of the body 
      reflects the state of the mind. When our mind is dull or lazy the body 
      starts slumping, losing its strength and energy.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <FONT SIZE="6">
      <P>A</FONT>s for the natural exercise of concentration, this is what we 
      call <I>Samatha meditation</I>. This meditation is good for everyone 
      because we tend to create, think and analyse too much. Intellectually we 
      are very active and agile but this always leads to a sense of confusion 
      and complexity because the nature of thought and the conditioned world is 
      very complex. We are very complicated beings and when we try to understand 
      ourselves just by thinking it can be very confusing. One&#39;s mind seems like 
      a jungle of thoughts, ideas, perceptions and memories. So what we really 
      need is a firmer foundation of clarity and stability, where the mind can 
      begin to rest and focus on being still, content in the present moment and 
      not getting lost in thinking one thought after another. Moving away from 
      the realm of thought and complexity, towards simplicity. That is why we 
      practise the technique of anapanasati, the cultivation of mindfulness of 
      the in and out breath. It &#39;is a very good technique of meditation because 
      the breath is quite natural, it does not require any ego. The breath comes 
      in and goes out by itself; it doesn&#39;t require us to do anything. 
      anapanasati is quite different from breath control because it is using the 
      natural flow of the breath. There is no contriving or constructing, making 
      it into this or that, which is what we do with most other things. It is 
      just the natural flow of the breath. Allow your mind to rest, dwell with, 
      and get close to, the breath, which is in itself an extremely tranquil, 
      peaceful and soothing object. Just the rhythmic flowing in and flowing out 
      of the cooling, gentle touch of the breath.</P>
      <P>It requires a lot of patience before our minds become used to this 
      simple activity because we are used to exciting mental gymnastics and this 
      is just a very simple task, observing and staying with the breath. So we 
      must have patience and confidence in the teachings of the Buddha and in 
      our teachers. If we have confidence it will give us the resolve to 
      patiently bring the attention back to the breath, turning towards the 
      breath more fully. When the mind starts running off and gets interested in 
      something else, what does that mean? It means that we see greater value in 
      those other things; we think they will give us more excitement, more 
      happiness. We think thoughts of past or future plans are going to give us 
      more happiness than staying with the breath. That&#39;s why the mind moves 
      away from the breath: we always seek happiness.</P>
      <P>So establish your confidence in this teaching and then focus your 
      attention on the breath. Just turn towards it and sustain your attention, 
      be with it, be completely contented. If we become really concentrated, 
      this causes the mind to become joyous and happy, and the body to feel 
      rapture and bliss. This is happiness far greater than what we can derive 
      from the sensory world. It&#39;s a very good thing to keep in mind. It gives 
      us the incentive and the ability to resolve, each time we sit in 
      meditation, to really turn towards the breath, incline towards it, be 
      satisfied with it, knowing that the mind will be happy. Isn&#39;t that what we 
      all want?</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <FONT SIZE="6">
      <P>N</FONT>ow when we begin it is quite difficult. The breath is difficult 
      to find and to be with; you can&#39;t force the mind or strangle the stray 
      thoughts. You have to be very, very patient and very alert. It is not a 
      mechanical exercise. Notice the mind being with the breath, and then 
      notice the mind moving away to something else, notice and then bring the 
      attention back to the breath. Knowing at least that this is an inhalation 
      and this is an exhalation. When images, dialogues and memories arise, 
      begin to cut through them. It&#39;s like cutting your way through a jungle 
      made of thoughts, images, words, memories and plans. Keep coming back to 
      the reality of the breath. The breath is something, which is now, which is 
      definite. The breath comes in, this is an inhalation, and you know that. 
      The breath goes out, this is an exhalation, and you know that. Then begin 
      to know and incline towards the beginning and the end of the breath more 
      clearly. Know the beginning of the inhalation, know the end of the 
      inhalation. Know the beginning of and the end of the exhalation.</P>
      <P>So you are disciplining the mind by using a physical object, because 
      this object is now. It&#39;s a reality. There is nothing complex about the 
      breath it is very simple. As the mind begins to clear a little you notice 
      that the imagery and the internal noise begin to diminish. Then it is a 
      matter of focussing more closely on the breath; inclining towards it is 
      all you can really do. Allow the mind to sink into the breath, to touch 
      it, to get as close as you can to it and the more you do that the greater 
      the concentration and tranquillity will be.</P>
      <P>You can read all sorts of books on how to practise mindfulness of 
      breathing but it is just something you have to find your own way with, and 
      experiment with. Regular practice is very important because the skill is 
      cultivated through repetition, learning from each meditation period. 
      Sometimes you are peaceful, sometimes restless, but just keep going. 
      Tranquillity meditation is quite simple, it simplifies the mind and 
      focuses the attention.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <FONT SIZE="6">
      <P>I</FONT>t is the same with walking meditation. Use the touch of the 
      feet or the movement of the legs as your focus of attention. It is a very 
      concrete thing with a beginning and an end to focus on. Begin to simplify, 
      to move away from the world of thinking, projecting and complexity to the 
      world of now, this moment, this body. Walking just one step at a time. 
      Training the mind gently and firmly requires awareness and patience. If we 
      have expectations and no patience we will soon become disheartened. The 
      Buddha said that it is easier to go into battle single handed against a 
      thousand enemies armed to the teeth and to conquer them a thousand times 
      than it is to conquer one&#39;s own mind. It&#39;s not that difficult, but the 
      Buddha did want to stress that it is a difficult thing to do. It requires 
      a great deal of patience.</P>
      <P ALIGN="center">*</P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>o develop this foundation of concentration and 
      clarity is important as it gives emotional stability and the ability to 
      cut through all the doubt, foolishness and obsessiveness of the mind. When 
      the mind is centred and in a state of clarity and stillness it is a very 
      powerful and useful tool. The Buddha said that a well-trained mind is the 
      most useful thing and the untrained mind the most dangerous thing to have. 
      An untrained mind causes a lot of trouble to oneself and others, so begin 
      by dedicating quite a lot of time and patience to the cultivation of 
      concentration. Develop a good foundation in concentration by practising, 
      sharpening the attention, and repeating this practice of tranquillity 
      meditation in the morning and at night.</P>
      <P>What is the purpose of concentrating the mind? Is it just to experience 
      a blissful state? Obviously there is more to it than that. In Buddhism we 
      say that concentration is only one part; there is also morality and 
      wisdom. Wisdom is the most important, but not in the sense of knowledge. 
      It&#39;s not what we can hear from someone else, read in a book or think out 
      ourselves, but wisdom in the sense of really understanding the nature of 
      experience. This is why it is so important to have a well-trained mind, 
      sharp and clear, with the ability to be collected and look directly at the 
      experience. A clear mind can look so directly, intensely and so 
      penetratingly that we can see through experience and see it for what it 
      really is. What is the quality of mind that we need for reflection? It is 
      the mind that is still, empty, but fully awake; what we call <I>&quot;bare 
      awareness&quot;</I>. We practise Samatha meditation so we can bring the mind 
      into this state of calmness and stillness. When we sit meditation and 
      concentrate on the breath, even if we let go of the breath, we can just be 
      still and when the mind is silent there is this knowing, this awareness of 
      the present. Now it is good if we can stabilize that awareness even if we 
      start with only a few moments. Venerable Ajahn Sumedho says, &quot;To listen to 
      the silence of the mind&quot;. So what <I>Samatha meditation</I> does is to 
      give stability to the mind so that we can stay in that alert state of 
      knowing and emptiness for longer and longer periods.</P>
      <P ALIGN="center">*</P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>he Buddha said that this thing I call &quot;me&quot; is 
      made up of the body, feeling, perceptions, concepts and consciousness. 
      These are the five aggregates that make up a human being. These are the 
      things that we are attached to and that we take to be who we are. These 
      are the things that cause our problems; we have to reflect on and observe 
      them more closely in order to see them for what they are. How do we do 
      this insight meditation with reflection? We objectify what is in 
      consciousness and then observe its nature. Take the body for example. We 
      can be aware of the body just sitting. If the mind is quite still we can 
      be aware of the posture, the nature of the body, before we start labelling 
      it or making anything of it. Then there are the sensations of the body, 
      especially when they become very strong. If there is pain, we can make it 
      an object of our awareness. Stop thinking about it as being this or that, 
      just experience the sensation, see if we can stay with it. What is the 
      sensation actually like? Is it really you? Is it constant? What makes it 
      pain rather than pleasure? Why is the mind shrinking away from it? What 
      happens if we stay and abide calmly with it? Try turning towards the 
      sensation in order to understand its nature a bit more and reflect on it.</P>
      <P>The important thing is not just to react to every situation. For 
      example when there is an itch on your leg, you can scratch it and it&#39;s 
      gone, but you haven&#39;t learnt anything because you are acting mechanically 
      out of aversion and desire. There is no freedom there. I am not saying 
      that it is wrong to scratch but I am talking about insight, about freeing 
      the mind from the power of instinct, aversion and desire. If you have knee 
      pain and you decide to go to sleep rather than sit meditation that is not 
      bad, wrong or immoral in any way but there is no effort, patience or 
      reflection on that which is difficult to reflect on. There is no seeing, 
      and this is why it is very valuable to sometimes do that which is 
      difficult for us, in order to cultivate spiritual qualities and to develop 
      wisdom.</P>
      <P>Sometimes we can feel very tired during meditation and the body begins 
      to slump. What is that feeling of tiredness in the body? Notice what it 
      feels like instead of just reacting, giving in to it. Instead of just 
      feeling tired and laying down, stay and begin to observe. See the nature 
      of this state of the body, the lack of energy, and if you stay with it you 
      may also see it passing away.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <FONT SIZE="6">
      <P>V</FONT>enerable Ajahn Cha used to say that <I>Vipassana</I>, insight 
      meditation, had three signs: <I>impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and 
      non-self</I>. This practice of <I>Vipassana</I> means to continually 
      reflect on these three signs, make them your point of reference. The 
      easiest of the three signs is impermanence, the process of change. It 
      requires a lot of patience; normally we see the arising but we don&#39;t 
      bother to hang around to wait for the passing away, especially if it is 
      something unpleasant. For example we may get into a restless state, the 
      mind is agitated and the body doesn&#39;t want to sit still. If this arises 
      during your sitting, stay with it, don&#39;t give up and walk away. Be aware, 
      objectify and observe the restless state, get to know it, and have the 
      patience to stay around and observe its impermanent nature. It is within 
      the capacity of everyone to see the passing away of things, just ordinary 
      things like restlessness, sleepiness or a little bit of pain. Make them 
      fully conscious in your mind, and stay with them to see the beginning and 
      the end, the arising and cessation: <I>impermanence</I>.</P>
      <P>Impermanence is a very good subject to meditate on. We can observe it 
      in the body, in its various states of energy, pain, dullness and calm. We 
      can observe it in the mind - the mental states of restlessness, dullness, 
      peacefulness, calm and joy. Notice all these changing impermanent states 
      of body and mind, just as they are. Objectify them. Reflect on what comes 
      into the field of consciousness, whether that may be body, feeling, 
      perceptions, conceptions or moods. See them all as objects. Stay with them 
      and see them arising and passing away. Know that what you see cannot be 
      &quot;you&quot; because it is coming and going, cannot be &quot;yours&quot; because you cannot 
      make it stay forever. Thus, clearly seeing impermanence will help us see 
      non-self and unsatisfactoriness - they are actually three sides of the 
      same thing.</P>
      <P>This practice of insight meditation comes from a very passive state, 
      not a dull state of mind but an alert, reflective mind. A mind that is 
      very clear, no longer chasing or fighting experiences, but sticking around 
      to see the beginning and the passing away of that which is in the field of 
      consciousness, that which is being experienced. Please consider this very 
      carefully because this is really what insight meditation is. The technique 
      is not insight meditation. Some people say if you do this technique it&#39;s 
      insight and if you do that technique it is not. That is all rather silly. 
      It is not the object or the technique that makes it insight meditation. 
      What makes it insight meditation is this passive, alert, clear state of 
      mind that reflects its presence to seethe beginning and the end, the 
      arising and the passing away of the present object of experience. See its 
      impermanence whether or not that object is the breath. Concentration of 
      the breath can be insight meditation if you see the beginning and the end 
      of each on our breath; not just thinking about it but really knowing it, 
      experiencing it, seeing it clearly arising and passing. The Buddha said 
      that to have insight doesn&#39;t mean to have insight into one particular 
      thing. You can have insight into any thought, any mood, they are all <I>
      Sankhara</I>: conditioned phenomena, mortal conditions. They all have the 
      nature of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and non-self. Make the object 
      fully clear in the conscious mind and then with a passive, awake, alert 
      mind, be present and see its beginning and its end. This is the practice 
      of insight meditation.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <FONT SIZE="6">
      <P>T</FONT>ry to do this more and more in your lives, not only when you 
      meditate. Begin to notice the day, for example. It has a beginning, then 
      it changes and we call it night. Notice the changing colours and light and 
      how it will change into day again. Watch the changing seasons and the 
      weather; be continually aware of change.</P>
      <P>The Buddha said that to do good things and to give generously is a 
      wonderful, meritorious thing to do. To have confidence and faith in virtue 
      and to live a virtuous life based on morality is even more meritorious. To 
      cultivate the mind of loving-kindness is even more meritorious still. 
      However, to be aware of impermanence even for the snap of a finger is even 
      greater merit because to be truly aware of impermanence brings about 
      insight. So take an interest in noticing change, notice the arising and 
      passing away of all conditioned phenomena with the mind in <I>a passive 
      state of alertness, knowing, bare awareness</I>.</P>
      <P>In Forest Monasteries we just do what is being done at that time, we 
      follow the routine of the monastery. We become passive mentally and 
      physically but with an alert mind we watch the changing phenomena. 
      Everything is changing within you and around you. When food is offered we 
      receive it with gratitude. We are not choosing any more, just surrendering 
      to the present. If aversion or desire arise, we observe it and see it 
      passing away. In the lay life, too, this is a very good reflection. I 
      encourage you to really cultivate this passive, awake, alert state of 
      mind, objectifying experience to see the beginning and the passing away. 
      Instead of running about trying to control and change everything, try to 
      notice the natural change that happens. We are usually so busy trying to 
      control and shape everything we don&#39;t notice or really appreciate 
      impermanence. If we have an unpleasant sensation, we try and avoid it. If 
      we feel tired, we lie down and go to sleep. If we feel hungry, we eat. We 
      keep trying to control situations, to avoid the unpleasant and chase after 
      the pleasant, and that is why impermanence never becomes truly clear to 
      us. So in meditation we try to stay with what is happening now and learn 
      from it. <I>We are training ourselves to become patient, humble and 
      willing to stay around to see the arising and passing away, to notice the 
      changes</I>. It&#39;s the same with good health and sickness, strength and 
      weakness. Stop chasing after and getting away from the changing 
      conditions, stay around and use them for reflection.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <FONT SIZE="6">
      <P>P</FONT>ractise tranquillity meditation as much as you can to develop a 
      strong foundation. The stable mind can stop thinking, can stop going on 
      and on. Begin to abide in stillness and clarity. You can stay with the 
      breath or stay with bare awareness, silently and fully awake. The more you 
      can do that the more you can do reflecting on the changing phenomena we 
      normally think of as &quot;me&quot;. See them all as objects, stay with them and see 
      their arising and passing away. The more we see impermanence the clearer 
      unsatisfactoriness and non-self become, and the clearer we see that all 
      conditioned phenomena are impermanent. So really reflect on that, because 
      the more we see that the more we begin to incline towards a peaceful mind, 
      the mind that is empty, contented, and still, no longer clinging onto any 
      mortal condition. We are all very fortunate to have this opportunity to 
      practise.</P>
