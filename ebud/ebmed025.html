Not so long ago, I bought a monopoly game for my children with
the intention that all four of us my husband, the children and
myself - could sit down on weekends and play together.
<P>
At the time that I bought the game, it seemed to be a good idea,
as monopoly appears to be a game where adults can participate
without getting bored. But in actual practice, things did not
turn out as I had envisioned.
<P>
My seven-year old son Tet got very upset whenever he lost. After
the first game together, my husband never joined in again. As
for myself, I persevered only a few more times. Still, the children
continued playing whenever their friends come over.
<P>
On one particular day, my little son lost as usual. This time
it was too much for him and he got into a fit of anger. I thought,
'Now is the time to talk to him about playing games.' So when
he had cooled down a bit, I started to explain to him what a game
is all about and about winning and losing. He listened attentively,
but could not be reconciled to my ideas. I kept wondering how
much good my talk was doing him, but suddenly he piped up, &quot;Mommy
why is it when I play with balls or other toys I don't get angry
but when I play with money I get so mad?&quot; To be honest, I
was dumb- struck by his question. I thought to myself, 'My goodness,
why didn't I have that kind of wisdom when I bought the set?'
I could only marvel at the way the children are teaching me more
than I teach them.
<P>
While I was busy rationalizing and intellectually explaining away
the concept of winning and losing, obviously my little son found
it hard to follow such a discourse. He resorted to looking directly
into his own mind and taking a clear look at the cause of his
own problem. Meanwhile I, as the mother was too preoccupied with
my intention to teach him and failed to see his state of mind
at that particular moment.
<P>
I also noticed that from that time onwards my little son stopped
making a fuss over monopoly and began to relate better to the
game. Prior to this he would always blame his sister or others
for his losses and it was becoming a habit. When he saw what was
happening in himself, he must have assumed responsibility for
his own anger. That must have been the magic cure. If we adults
could learn to do the same, there would be little discord among
families and communities.
<P>
One fine day about a year ago, my nine- year-old daughter Win
asked me very sweetly, &quot;Do you know, Mom, what my friends
in school say about you? They said you look more like my grandmother
than my mother.&quot;
<P>
She did not criticize, nor judge nor express any opinion about
it, but the message got through to me immediately. Her friends
had made a straightforward comment without malice or ill intent,
and it went straight to my heart. Since then I have been trying
to dye my fast-greying hair and lose weight, to the delight of
my daughter.
<P>
Obviously, children in their innocence are more adept at looking
directly into themselves at others and at certain situations whereas
we adults tend to complicate and distort things with our rationalizations,
criticisms, and judgements. Hence, the fault is always with others
and the outside world.
<P>
I suppose we were also direct and innocent when we were young,
but as we grew older we lost this directness and innocence. How
did we become so distorted? What went wrong?
<P>
There is no simple answer. Maybe it was the conditioning that
attended our education, the inculcation of established values
in family and society.
<P>
Early on in life, we were taught to discriminate and judge for
ourselves in a polarized manner. In every aspect of life, everything
was split into opposites, good versus bad, success versus failure,
wealth versus poverty and so on. As our young minds got caught
up in this dualistic way of looking at things, we gradually lost
our original way of viewing the world as a totality.
<P>
In becoming educated, we are trained to be critical and logical
as proper preparation for adequate performance in our careers.
As our intellectual abilities are enhanced, we develop our minds
but not our hearts. As we lose more and more of our childhood
innocence, our lives become more and more competitive; confusion
and frustration almost inevitably result. We may find we need
to seek help, either from psychologists or from religion.
<P>
Many have found consolation in Buddhist meditation. For example,
vipassana meditation can be viewed as an inward-looking practice
which is strictly non-judgmental and non-discriminatory in nature.
It is an exercise in looking directly into ourselves in an effort
to undo all the conditioning that has taken place within our lifetime.
<P>
In fact meditation is nothing sophisticated. We are just relearning
what we have forgotten. We are actually learning to shed the sophistication
of our intellect and the accumulation of mental possessions. We
are learning to go back to the simplicity of our childhood, and
to our original nature which was so pure and untainted.
<P>
That is why many sages are esteemed for a childlike quality in
their nature. This does not mean the wise man has reverted to
childhood. A child is innocent but lacks the maturity and the
wisdom to handle his own life. Adults have the maturity to some
extent, but lack the innocence. This innocence bestows wisdom,
it can only be achieved through the practice of &quot;direct seeing&quot;
into one's own mind.
