<P>In 1979 four women arrived simultaneously at the
newly established Chithurst Monastery (Cittaviveka) in West Sussex, England
to live and practise Dhamma with the developing monastic community of monks
there. Two years earlier, the Venerable Ajahn Chah had sent four of his
Western disciples, headed by Ajahn Sumedho, to live in England and before
long there was much interest and a growing number of people wishing to undertake
the monastic training and lifestyle.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing to undertake the nuns' training, those first four women lived within
the eight-precept discipline, modelled on the white-robed <B><I>maechee</I></B> of the
Thai Theravadan tradition. But before long, it became obvious that a more
detailed and comprehensive training was required to help the women's community
live together and grow spiritually.<BR>
<BR>
Within the Theravadan tradition there is presently no Bhikkhuni ordination
available to women -- but the ten-precept form of the <B><I>samaneri</I></B> was possible,
so from that, with the help of a designated senior monk, a way of training
appropriate for Western women began to take shape. Eventually, the new training
code would draw from both the Bhikkhu and Bhikkhuni Vinayas, and has resulted
in what we have called the <I><B>Siladhara Vinaya training</B></I> -- a body of some 120
rules and monastic observances based on the <B><I>ten precepts</I></B>.<BR>
<BR>
As alms-mendicant nuns we are supported in the traditional way and so are
able to train in respect of the four requisites. We observe the traditional
Vassa (rains retreat) season and fortnightly Uposathas, reciting our training
rules regularly (when there is a sangha of at least four nuns living together).<BR>
<BR>
In our particular tradition, the Vinaya training is afforded great significance.
It forms an essential counterpart to the practice and understanding of Dhamma.
It serves to create a kind of boundary which can mirror kilesa (mental defilements),
creating the opportunity for relinquishing or transforming such afflictive
mind-states. Without such a boundary or container, the force of habit will
tend to hold sway. In the Pali scriptures, the Buddha, just before his parinibbana,
emphasised to Ananda, his long-term attendant:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Ananda, it may be that you will think:
  &quot;The Teacher's instruction has ceased, now we have no teacher!&quot;
  It should not be seen like this, Ananda, for what I have taught and explained
  to you as <B><I>Dhamma and Discipline</I></B> will, at my passing, be your teacher.&quot; (Digha-Nikaya 16)</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It was in 1984 that Amaravati Monastery was established
in Hertfordshire with the intention of functioning more as a Dhamma centre,
accommodating the growth of interest in both the monastic and lay Buddhist
lifestyles. As well as providing a training centre for the growing nuns'
community, it provided more facilities for guest accommodation, a retreat
centre and a large library.<BR>
<BR>
The Nuns' Order has been established for 14 years now, and as can be expected
of any new venture of such import, it has been through its ups and downs
as we learn through experience (as opposed to ideals) just what actually
works, what is supportive, and what is not. This rocky process of birth
and coming to maturity is a natural one it seems, and one of essential learning
experience too. Many women have come and gone over the years, testing the
waters for various periods of time and adding their own unique ingredients
to the developing form. We are still a relatively small community, with
thirteen <B><I>siladhara</I></B> and eight <I><B>anagarikas</B></I> (*), 
and perhaps the rocky waters are not entirely passed,
but the base now feels quite strong -- with a growing sense of stability,
maturity and ever-deepening commitment.<BR>
<BR>
It is largely through the benefit of the Vinaya training that a forward-moving
growth can take place. When a guiding principle is agreed upon and honoured
by the group, then there is the possibility of growing beyond the limitations
of individuals' whims and ways, beyond the restrictive and constrictive
structures of self-view, to the liberating freedom from &quot;me&quot; and
&quot;mine&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
The development of our community is now entering a new phase. Since the
beginning, the nuns have lived and trained in the double communities of
Amaravati and Cittaviveka, sharing the burden of the various duties and
teaching responsibilities both inside and outside of the monasteries. Over
the years, the monks and nuns have learnt a great deal from each other,
gradually developing skilful means of fostering and supporting a mutual
respect and spiritual friendship within the brahmacariya life.<BR>
<BR>
Now we have the opportunity to reside for the next two years in one of our
branch monasteries in south England and experiment with a small nuns' community
living alone there, while still maintaining a Nuns' Sangha at both Cittaviveka
and Amaravati. This may spread the community a little thinly for a while,
but it seems that a worthwhile commitment to make. It brings into focus
aspects of our training that will now need further clarification and definition
and as an experience will certainly create some new dynamics to work with
as well. But the timing of such a move seems right.<BR>
<BR>
To be able to cultivate the Path of the Buddha in such times and places
and with supportive conditions seems extremely fortunate. The way forward
is not always easy to discern, but if we continue to allow the guiding principles
of <B><I>Dhamma-Vinaya</I></B> to effect the transformation of our hearts and inform our
actions, then we can trust in the unfolding of the process, with the Triple
Refuge as both an inner and outer support.<BR>

nuns who commit themselves for at least two years before deciding on higher
ordination.</P>
