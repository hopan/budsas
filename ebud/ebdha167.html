    <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>o be honest and to
    begin by getting right to the point, I must state plainly that there is no serious
    contemporary Buddhist perspective for global problem-solving.</font><p><font
    face="Times New Roman">The World Fellowship of Buddhists, with its headquarters in
    Bangkok, has entirely avoided political, military and economic issues. It has not even
    dealt with environmental or human rights crises, nor has it promoted human cooperation.
    Members meet every few years to reaffirm how wonderful we Buddhists are.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the World Conference on Religion and Peace, with
    its head offices in Geneva and New York, has strong Buddhist financial support, especially
    from the Rishokoseikei in Japan, this body passes resolutions on global matters without
    doing anything significant from a Buddhist perspective. Indeed, contemporary Buddhists
    seem to be interested only at national, local, or denominational levels.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is gratifying to learn then that the Asian Buddhist
    Conference for Peace is organizing a fourth International Seminar on Buddhism and
    Leadership for Peace.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Efforts by the United Nations
    University</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Other organizations, as well as the ABCP, have attempted
    to promote the development of a Buddhist approach to global problem-solving. For example,
    the United Nations University is currently supporting a sub-project on Buddhist
    Perceptions of Desirable Societies in the Future.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At a meeting in Bangkok in 1986, a number or leading
    scholars and practicing Buddhists came together to examine how religious thinkers and
    activists perceive the current human predicament. The framework of the meeting was divided
    into three main parts: 1) a diagnosis of current problems, 2) an examination of
    specifically Buddhist responses to these problems, and 3) a projection of how it might be
    possible to progress from the contemporary situation towards a more desirable society.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the meeting apathy, confusion and selfishness were
    identified as the main causes of the hopelessness that engulfs so many of the world's
    people, although these were not explicitly related to religion. At one point, the slogan
    of the French revolution, &quot;Liberty, Equality and Fraternity,&quot; was discussed. Why
    did the Buddha not preach these values, rather than the Four Noble Truths--the existence
    of suffering, the causes of suffering, the cessation of suffering and the Noble Eightfold
    Path leading to the cessation of suffering?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The three values of the French Revolution are idealistic.
    The Buddha taught people to come to terms with, and surmount, the reality of human
    existence--the unavoidable problems of pain, loss, suffering, sickness and death. This
    approach was felt by many at the meeting in Bangkok to have a great deal to offer those
    engaged in solving contemporary global problems.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the Bangkok meeting, the United Nations University
    set up a subcommittee which identified ten relevant issues to be tackled by Buddhists in
    order to move towards a more desirable future society. They were: the individual and
    society in Buddhism; universalism and particularism; existing social practices which may
    lead to a more ideal society; sangha, state and people; Buddhism and the evolution of
    society; Buddhist eschatology, millennialism and the Buddha land; Buddhist education;
    Buddhist approaches to war and violence; science, technology and Buddhism; and women and
    family in Buddhism. Hopefully, the United Nations University will publish the relevant
    articles on these topics.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Recently, the United Nations University called for yet
    another meeting in Bangkok on the same theme of perceptions of desirable societies, but
    this time with respect to different religious and ethical systems. The conclusions were as
    follows:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have reviewed briefly the position of different
    religious currents in terms of their beliefs and values regarding:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Welfare and development,<br>
      - Justice, equity and human rights,<br>
      - Peace, reconciliation and nonviolence, and<br>
      - Identity, authenticity and universality.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is important to realize that many of the divergencies
    existing among religions are often complementary visions, which should not be seen as
    conflictual, but rather as differences which lead to deeper and more universal positions
    through a process of dialogue. It is crucial then that this process is guaranteed to take
    place by the religions, their institutions, and by society and the state.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These divergencies do not necessarily represent different
    religious beliefs but rather the positions of the religious thinkers or activists who
    choose either to be part of society, to accept its fundamental dynamics in order to
    transform it from within, or to stand outside it to develop a transcendental critical view
    of its values and institutions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I feel that the United Nations University's efforts are
    relevant to the theme of our international seminar. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Myth of Cakkravartin and
    Present-Day Global Problem-Solving</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unlike Muslims and Christians, contemporary Buddhists have
    no vision for global problem-solving. This is partly due to the fact that prior to western
    colonial expansion in the last century, Buddhism was divided into many schools, all of
    which were attached to national cultures and/or nation- states, each with subdivisions
    into various denominations or sects. Western Christianity, on the other hand, especially
    with its ties to the building of great empires such as the Roman and British empires, has
    evolved such that the white men's burden includes caring for the world as a universality
    or catholicism. Although Protestantism was divided very much like Buddhism, it managed to
    pull together, with all its differences, to work on global issues, especially since the
    creation of the World Council of Churches.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The spread of Islam increased side by side with Arab
    commercial success and the advancement of scientific knowledge, especially after the
    collapse of ancient Greek civilization. Although the Europeans replaced the Ottoman Empire
    in the nineteenth century, the rise of nationalism, pan-nationalism and economic success
    in the Middle East encouraged Muslims to have a more global outlook.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although former Buddhist kingdoms in South and Southeast
    Asia have regained their independence from the west, they have lost the Dhammic essence of
    their national identities. They have retained only state ceremonies which are often more
    feudal than Buddhist. They blindly adhere to outmoded customs which are irrelevant to
    contemporary society.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Despite the fact that Siam was not subjugated politically,
    she was colonized intellectually, culturally and educationally. The effects of this type
    of colonization are almost impossible to reverse.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In East Asia, Buddhism lost much of its true essence to
    Confucianism or Shintoism, even before the arrival of western influences.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The lofty Buddhist spirit remains in Asia only in small
    pockets for individual or local development where human needs are placed ahead of material
    or economic gains. At the national level, most people think only in terms of economic
    development. Hence, the rich get richer and the poor remain so, or become poorer. This is
    true for nations and individuals. And of course, no one is happy. The present social
    development systems lead to human rights abuses, a widening gap between the rich and the
    poor, environmental degradation and the aggressive destruction of natural resources.
    Unfortunately, it seems that Buddhist development models have not been established and,
    overall, responses from the Buddhist communities have been insufficient to counter these
    negative elements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before attempting to deal with the above-mentioned issues,
    we ought to look into our Buddhist traditions to see whether such a global concern for
    social justice existed in the past, in order to apply it meaningfully in the present and
    in the future.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In my opinion, it is very worthwhile to examine the
    Buddhist mythological tradition regarding kingship and the universal monarch who ruled for
    the well-being of all. How the myth was applied by Buddhist rulers of later generations is
    also interesting.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Aggana Sutta of the Digha Nikaya begins by portraying
    an ideal world of natural effortless existence. Ethereal, self-luminescent beings live in
    bliss and know no discrimination between polar opposites such as male and female, good and
    evil, rich and poor, ruler and subject. The earth itself is made of a delightful soft
    edible substance that looks like butter and is as sweet as honey.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Gradually, however, because of karma remaining from a
    previous world cycle, this Golden Age comes to an end. During a long period of decline
    manifest in the world and its beings, greed, grasping, sex, theft, violence and murder are
    introduced. Finally, sheer anarchy prevails, and in order to put an end to it, the beings
    get together to select from among their ranks a king to rule over them and maintain order.
    This is the Mahasommata, the Great Elect, and in return for fulfilling his functions as a
    monarch, the beings each agree to pay him a portion of their rice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such is the myth of the first kingship. The record also
    relates the legend of the Cakkravartin, (wheel-turning emperor), or universal monarch. A
    basic version of this appears in the Cakkravatti Sihandada Sutta, also of the Digha
    Nikaya.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This text, too, begins with a description of a Golden Age,
    the starting point of the world cycle. During this time, beings had beautiful bodies,
    life-spans of eighty thousand years, and wonderful effortless existences. This time,
    however, the Cakkravartin, Dalhanemi by name, is present from the beginning. He is, in
    fact, very much a part of the Golden Age for his presence is instrumental in maintaining
    the paradisiacal state. Because he knows what is good and rules through Dhamma, poverty,
    ill-will, violence, and wrongdoings do not exist in his domain.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Traditionally the Cakkravartin is portrayed as an
    extraordinary being. He is said to exhibit the thirty-two bodily marks of a Great Man
    (Mahapurusa) and to be endowed with the seven jewels, or emblems of sovereignty, the most
    important of which is the wheel (cakka). In the Sutta, this magnificent wheel appears in
    mid-air before Dalhanemi at the beginning of his reign as a sign of his righteousness. It
    then leads him in a great cosmic conquest of the four continents.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It takes him East, South, West and North as far as the
    great oceans, and, where the wheel rolls, he encounters no resistance. The power of his
    Dhamma, symbolized by his wheel, the Dhammacakka, is such that local kings immediately
    submit to him. Finally his wheel leads him back to his capital at the center of the world,
    and there it remains, miraculously suspended in mid-air over the royal palaces, as an
    emblem of sovereignty. After many years of reigning in peace over a contented and
    prosperous empire, however, Dalhanemi's wheel of Dhamma begins to sink. This is a sign of
    the approaching end of his reign, according to the Buddhist law of change (anicca), and
    when the wheel disappears altogether into the earth, the wise king entrusts his throne to
    his son and retires from this world to live as an ascetic in the forest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is important to note that the wheel of Dhamma is not
    automatically passed on from one Cakkravartin to the next. Dalhanemi's son must, in turn,
    prove worthy of his own wheel by calling it forth with his own righteousness. This fact
    sets the scene for the rest of the myth, which, like the story in the previous Sutta,
    traces the gradual degradation of this world and the beings in it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After a long succession of Dalhanemi's descendants who are
    perfect Cakkravartins, there comes a king who fails to follow Dhamma, and for whom the
    wheel does not appear. Consequently, there is resistance to his rule. Friction develops;
    the people fail to prosper; the universal monarch fails to support them; and one thing
    leads to another, as it is stated in the Sutta: &quot;From not giving to the destitute,
    poverty grew rife; from poverty growing rife, stealing increased; from the spread of
    stealing, violence grew apace; from the growth of violence, the destruction of life became
    common; from the frequency of murder, both the life span of the beings and their beauty
    wasted away.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The myth then goes on to trace the further decline in the
    quality and span of life, until a state of virtual anarchy is reached. In this respect,
    then, the myth of the Cakkravartin is quite similar to that of the Great Elect
    (Mahasommata).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Contrasting the two Suttas, one can draw different
    conclusions. In the former, the Great Elect is called upon only when the need for him
    arises. He functions as a stopgap against further anarchy, but the Golden Age itself
    requires and knows no king at all. In the latter, on the other hand, the ruler is a
    crucial part of the Golden Age. By his very presence and by his proper rule, he ensures a
    peaceful, prosperous, idyllic existence for all, and he will continue to do so as long as
    he is righteous enough to merit the wheel of Dhamma, that is, as long as he truly is a
    wheel-turning Cakkravartin. The conclusion one can draw from these two myths is that
    neither myth stops at the Golden Age, but each goes on to describe in no uncertain terms
    what happens when a ruler does not live up to the ideal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The suggestion is made, therefore, that there are really
    two possible types of rulers. One, a full-fledged Cakkravartin, is righteous and rules
    according to Dhamma, and so like Dalhanemi, ensures a Golden Age. Indeed there is a saying
    by the Buddha, in the Anguttara Nikaya stating that &quot;A universal monarch, a righteous
    and just king relies on the Dhamma. Respecting, revering and honouring the Dhamma, with
    the Dhamma as his standard, he provides for the proper welfare and protection of his
    people.&quot; The other, perhaps not truly worthy of the title Cakkravartin, is not so
    righteous, fails to rule according to the Dhamma, and is responsible for a cosmic
    catastrophe, the degradation of the world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These two myths have greatly influenced Buddhist monarchs
    in South and Southeast Asia. However, in history, Emperor Ashoka of ancient India was
    perhaps the only one who could really be called a Cakkravartin, if one is to accept the
    prevailing world view. He was the &quot;universal monarch&quot; who reigned as righteously
    as possible by extending his empire across almost all of the subcontinent.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Sinhalese, Burmese and Siamese kings were not, in
    fact, Cakkravartins, but they all wished to imitate the Great Emperor, and tried their
    best, at least in theory, to be just and righteous. In practice, however, it is
    questionable whether they actually &quot;respected, revered and honoured the Dhamma, while
    using the Dhamma as a standard, as a sign, as a sovereign, providing for the proper
    welfare and protection of the people.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Role of the Sangha</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The result was that the institution or the Sangha, the
    holy community of brothers and sisters, was developed to teach Dhamma to the rulers and to
    facilitate communication between the rulers and the ruled.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unlike the lay community, the Sangha reverses the process
    of degeneration of the human race described in the Buddhist creation myths: coercion is
    replaced by cooperation, private property by propertylessness, family and home by the
    community of androgynous wanderers, and hierarchy by egalitarian democracy. The Sangha
    symbolizes the unification of means and ends in Buddhist philosophy. That is, the movement
    working for the resolution of conflict must embody a sane and peaceful process itself. The
    discipline of the early monastic Sangha was designed to channel expected conflicts of
    interest among the monks and nuns into processes of peaceful democratic resolution. In
    order to spread peace and stability in their societies, the monastic Sangha sought to
    establish moral hegemony over the state, to guide their societies with a code of
    nonviolent ethics in the interest of social welfare.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the passing away of the Buddha, some 2530 years ago,
    the historical Sangha, however, has been divided vertically and horizontally by cultural,
    economic and political alliances. Sectors of the Sangha in many different countries became
    dependent on state patronage for their growing communities. With the growth of monastic
    wealth and land-holding came the integration of the Sangha into society as a priest-class
    of teachers, ritual performers, and chanters of magic formulas--a sector of the
    land-owning elite with its own selfish interests and tremendous cultural power.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With centralization and hierarchization of the Sangha came
    increasing elite and state control, so that instead of applying the ethics of nonviolence
    to the state, a part of the Sangha was increasingly called upon to rationalize violence
    and injustice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, at the base of society, frequently
    impoverished and poorly educated, there have always been propertyless and familyless
    radical clergy who maintain the critical perspective of the Buddha. To this day, scattered
    communities of Buddhists continue in a radical disregard, and sometimes fiery condemnation
    of the official &quot;state Buddhisms&quot; with their elite hierarchical structures and
    their legacies of secular accommodation and corruption.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In looking to the future of humankind, it is therefore
    necessary to look back. The state and its elites, with their natural tendency towards
    acquisitive conflict, should remain under the hegemony of the popular institutions that
    embody the process of nonviolent and democratic conflict resolution. In traditional
    Buddhist terms, the king should always be under the influence of the Sangha, and not vice
    versa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For those of us who are lay intellectuals, I feel it is
    imperative that we support the radical clergy to maintain this critical perspective of the
    Buddha. We should wholeheartedly support the Sangha in its efforts to lead the local
    communities towards self-reliance and away from domination by the elites and consumerism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Indeed many of the local and agrarian societies still have
    nonviolent means of livelihood, and respect for each individual as well as for animals,
    trees, rivers and mountains.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the government and multinational corporations
    have introduced various technological &quot;advances&quot; and chemical fertilizers and
    have advertised to make villagers turn away from their traditional ways of life and opt
    for jeans, coca-cola and fast food as well as worship of the state and its warlike
    apparatus, their efforts have been successfully countered by those of the critical Sangha.
    Some of them have even reintroduced meditation practices for farmers, established rice
    banks and buffalo banks which are owned by the communities and benefit them, rather than
    the commercial banks which link with international enterprises at the expense of the local
    population.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Importance of Socially Engaged
    Spirituality</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We should strengthen and extend the liberation potential
    within the Buddhist tradition to allow each local community to gain a global perspective
    making each aware of global problems, especially the suffering of the poor. If more people
    were conscious of the problem, it could be solved more efficiently.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We should also promote exchange and learning between
    Buddhists and non-Buddhists in order that they can cooperate meaningfully in a common
    struggle against the oppressive social forces that cause suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We should also try to enable peasants, fishermen,
    industrial workers, women and all oppressed factions in any country to discover their
    faith and the roots of their culture and draw inspiration and sustenance from them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, development in the past has ignored this
    vital source of human values. Indeed, activists, even those of agnostic tendency, should
    be open to the liberating dimensions of religions and cultures. Of course, many activists
    are anti-religious; perhaps against certain dogmas, forms, ceremonies or establishments;
    however, perhaps buddhism, with a small &quot;b&quot; could help them to discover, develop
    and strengthen a secular spirituality of struggle that does not make overt references to
    one specific tradition, but nourishes him or her for greater authenticity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For many of us who want to solve global problems there is
    the prevalent social engineering mentality which assumes that personal virtue can be more
    or less conditioned by a radical restructuring of society. On the other hand the opposite
    view is that radical social improvement is wholly dependent upon personal and spiritual
    change and changes in lifestyle. But a growing number of spiritually-minded people
    recognize that the &quot;inner&quot; work is massively discouraged by the social
    conditions which are the consequence of individual delusion and fear. Thus, an American
    Zen Buddhist poet and activist, Gary Snyder, remarks that the so called &quot;free
    world&quot; has become economically dependent on a fantastic system of greed that cannot
    be fulfilled, sexual desire which cannot be satiated, and a hate which has no outlet,
    except against oneself. Under these conditions, the odds are heavily against a spiritual
    lifestyle, especially when one lives in an affluent society in the west. Yet the so called
    &quot;socialist societies&quot; have, almost without exception, wanted to join the so
    called &quot;free world.&quot; This vicious circle must be broken socially as well as
    personally--a socially engaged spirituality is needed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Social activism in the past has been mostly preoccupied
    with what is &quot;out there.&quot; Opening up to what is &quot;in here&quot; and sharing
    it with others can bring great relief, but it also brings a disconcerting awareness of how
    much &quot;I&quot; need my busyness, our certainties or rationalizations and their
    malevolence. Just to maintain awareness of the boredom, frustration, indifference, anger,
    hostility, and triumph experienced by the activist without being carried away or cast down
    is an invaluable spiritual practice. But this is only possible if there is an adequate
    balance of daily meditation and periodic retreat, and also if there is awareness of social
    ills outside ourselves. These practices slowly dissolve the self-need that feeds on hope,
    setting us free to do just what the situation demands of us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through deepening awareness comes acceptance, and through
    acceptance comes a seemingly miraculous generosity of spirit and empowerment for the work
    that compassion requires of us. We can even take ourselves less seriously. With this
    critical self-awareness, we can genuinely understand and respect others of diverse
    religions and beliefs. We can even join hands with them humbly and knowingly in trying to
    develop our spaceship earth to be peaceful and with justice.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>A New Interpretation of the
    Buddhist Concept of Interrelatedness and the Application of the Five Precepts to the
    Contemporary Situation</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism, through its insistence on the interrelatedness
    of all life, its teachings of compassion for all beings, its nonviolence, and its caring
    for all existence, has been leading some contemporary Buddhists to broader and deeper
    interpretations of the relationship between social, environmental, racial and sexual
    justice and peace.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this area, we should be inspired by examples of such
    movements like that of Ven. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and his Garden of Liberation in Siam, not
    to mention the meditation practices of Ven. Phra Ajan Cha Subaddho and the scholarly work
    of Ven. Phra Debvedi (Payutto) which inspired not only Thai but foreign monks like Ven.
    Sumedho to carry the Buddhist message with social concern to Europe, North America,
    Australia and New Zealand. However, in this paper, I want only to concentrate on one
    Vietnamese monk, Thich Nhat Hanh, who teaches us to pay close attention to the minute
    particulars in our actions, as well as to the giant web of all life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He particularly stresses nondualism in his teachings and
    speaks of being peace in the moments in one's own life as part of making peace in the
    world. He stresses the continuity of inner and outer, calling the world our &quot;large
    self,&quot; and asks us to become it actively and to care for it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His Tiep Hien Order, created in Vietnam during the war, is
    in the lineage of the Zen school of Lin Chi. It is a form of engaged Buddhism in daily
    life, in society. The best translation of Tiep Hien, according to Thich Nhat Hanh, is the
    &quot;Order of Interbeing,&quot; which he explains in this way: &quot;I am, therefore you
    are, you are, therefore I am. That is the meaning of the word interbeing. We
    inter-are.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Order of Interbeing is designed explicitly to address
    social justice and peace issues, sensitizing the participant to test his/her behavior in
    relation to the needs of the larger community, while freeing him/her from limiting
    patterns. Even the way we take refuge in the Triple Gems is explained simply and
    beautifully: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>I take refuge in the Buddha,<br>
      the one who shows me the way in this life,<br>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thich Nhat Hanh revised the traditional five precepts to
    address issues of mind, speech and body:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">First, do not kill. Do not let others kill. Find whatever
    means possible to protect life. Do not live with a vocation that is harmful to humans and
    nature. Second, do not steal. Possess nothing that should belong to others. Respect the
    property of others, but prevent others from enriching themselves from human sufferings and
    the sufferings of other species on earth. Third, sexual expression should not take place
    without love and commitment. Be fully aware of the sufferings you may cause others as a
    result of your misconduct. To preserve the happiness of yourself and others, respect the
    rights and commitments of others. Fourth, do not say untruthful things. Do not spread news
    that you do not know to be certain. Do not criticize or condemn things that you are unsure
    of. Do not utter words that cause division and hatred, that can create discord and cause
    the family or the community to break. All efforts should be made to reconcile and resolve
    all conflicts. Fifth, do not use alcohol and any other intoxicants. Be aware that your
    fine body has been transmitted to you by several previous generations and your parents.
    Destroying your body with alcohol and other intoxicants is to betray your ancestors, your
    parents and also to betray the future generations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These precepts create a consciousness of, and a precedent
    for, social justice and peace work, grounded firmly in Buddhist principles in our
    individual beings and in our practice of mindfulness. As well, Thich Nhat Hanh often
    reminds us: &quot;Do not lose yourself in dispersion and in your surroundings. Learn to
    practice breathing in order to regain composure of body and mind, to practice mindfulness,
    and to develop concentration and understanding.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These guiding statements achieve an integration of the
    traditional five precepts with elements of the Noble Eightfold Path, and I believe Thich
    Nhat Hanh's decision to elaborate on the traditional precepts came from his observation
    that one can interpret these to encourage a withdrawal from the world, a passivity in the
    face of war and injustice, a separation of oneself from the common lot of humanity. In
    rewriting the precepts, he is countering that tendency. In directing us to focus on our
    interconnection with other beings, he is asking us to experience the continuity between
    the inner and the outer world, to act in collaboration, in mutuality with others in the
    dynamic unfolding of the truth that nurtures justice and creates peace.</font></p>

    Buddhists: A Hopeful Beginning for Global Problem-Solving?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some of us are trying to meet this challenge, and I hope
    what some of us are trying to do in connecting our being peace within to the outside world
    engagingly and mindfully, will contribute to a better world, with social justice,
    nonviolence and ecological balance--the Middle Way for each and for society at large, to
    live in harmony with one another and with nature.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Groups of young people in the west who believe in these
    principles and who try to act accordingly have established chapters of the Buddhist Peace
    Fellowship in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On top of that, some of us also have tried to meet with
    fellow Buddhists of like-mindedness in order to solve global problems concretely, taking
    some relevant issues of social justice which are near and dear to us, which we feel we
    could tackle individually and collectively with good friends (kalayamamitta) in other
    countries and cultures. Thus, last February, in a small city outside Bangkok, some
    forty-five Buddhists from all over the world, including a representative from the ABCP,
    met: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) to identify urgent social problems which exist in
      one's own country as well as those affecting other Buddhist communities; <br>
      (2) to explore the ways in which participants could cooperate in acting on these issues;
      and <br>
      (3) to establish a network among engaged Buddhists on a global level.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">They set up four working groups to explore different
    issues: education, women's issues, human rights, and spirituality and activism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is not appropriate to go into the details of this
    meeting here. However, since some Buddhists have become aware of the shortcomings of the
    World Fellowship of Buddhists and similar organizations, they are now determined to set up
    the International Network of Engaged Buddhists (INEB), with the following objectives: to
    promote understanding between Buddhist countries and various Buddhist sects, to facilitate
    and engage in solving problems in various countries, to help bring the perspective of
    engaged Buddhism to bear in working on these problems, to act as a clearinghouse of
    information on existing engaged Buddhist (and relevant non-Buddhist) groups and
    activities, and to aid in the coordination of efforts wherever possible.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">They will initially involve groups and individuals working
    in the following areas: alternative education and spiritual training, peace activism,
    human rights, women's issues, ecology, family concerns, rural development, alternative
    economics, communication, and concerns of monks and nuns. This may be expanded in the
    future.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I trust that this newly-established network will
    collaborate meaningfully with our host organizations in applying Buddhism to global
    problem-solving./. </font></p>
