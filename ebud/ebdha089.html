    An Essay in Buddhist Cosmology</font></h2>

    <hr width="25%">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the Agganna Sutta (&quot;On Knowledge of
    Beginnings&quot; Digha 27) the Buddha relates a myth of the
    origins of this planet and of the human race. He does this
    primarily to refute the false claims of the Brahmin Caste
    that they are a special creation &quot;born of the mouth of
    Brahma.&quot; But if we examine and consider this
    mythological sutta, there are many valuable teachings
    contained in the framework of the story, which encapsulates
    important aspects of the Buddhist cosmology.</p>
    <p>&quot;There comes a time when, sooner or later, after a
    long period, this world contracts. At a time of contraction
    beings are mostly born in the Abhassara Brahma world. And
    there they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight,
    self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious - and they
    stay like that for a very long period. But sooner or later,
    after a very long period, this world begins to expand
    again.&quot;</p>
    <p>Here we have a broad outline that agrees with a least one
    modern cosmological model: the alternately expanding and
    contracting universe. (Big Bang and Big Crunch.)</p>
    <p>But more importantly, a couple of key Buddhist principles
    are found here;</p>
    <p>ONE. The law of change, anicca. The universe is never
    static but is always evolving or devolving in a constant flux
    of changing forms.</p>
    <p>TWO. The Law of Dependent Origination. Nothing arises by
    chance or by the arbitrary fiat of a Creator but is causally
    arisen from previously existent factors. The new
    constellation of factors becomes in its turn the cause of
    further arisings.</p>
    <p>&quot;At that period there was just one mass of water and
    all was darkness, blinding darkness. Neither moon nor sun
    appeared (or; were manifest) no constellations or stars
    appeared, night and day were not distinguished, nor months
    and fortnights, no years or seasons, and no male or female,
    beings being reckoned just as beings. And sooner or later,
    after a very long period, savoury earth spread itself over
    the water where those beings were. It looked just like the
    skin that spreads itself over hot milk as it cools...&quot;</p>
    <p>Again this has striking resonances with the modern
    scientific view of the early earth as covered in impenetrable
    clouds, and the early ocean as being a soup of organic
    compounds.</p>
    <p>The next phase of the planet's evolution occurs when the
    divine beings become involved with insensate matter. The
    beings become curious and greedy and taste the nutritive
    foam. They then take on coarse material bodies.</p>
    <p>What is happening here? One way of seeing this is as a
    mythological explanation of the Dependent Origination link
    from Consciousness to Name and Form (Mind and Body.) This is
    vitally important and may be difficult to grasp because it is
    the opposite of modern assumptions. Mind, in this
    mythological framework, is not an epiphenomena of matter. The
    truth is closer to the reverse; Mind is the originator, if
    not of raw matter, at least of Form.</p>
    <p>No consciousness moment can possibly exist without a
    pre-existent consciousness. This would be creation ex nihilo
    and would violate the Dependent Origination. Thus each new
    consciousness arising in a womb is the continuation of a
    series pre-existing, of a being who has died. But how did
    life and consciousness arise in the first instance on this
    planet earth?</p>
    <p>In this sutta, the answer is given in the majestic image
    of Brahma beings from an old pre-existing world becoming
    involved in material form, thus adding the elements of life,
    consciousness, form and order to the wild primeval chaos.</p>
    <p>The Buddhist myth and modern evolutionary theory agree in
    seeing life as an ever-changing process. There are no static
    species, created once and for all, but only an ongoing and
    ever varying flux. However, Buddhist thought must reject the
    rigid reductionism of evolution by random mutation and
    natural selection only. Life, let alone mind, could never
    arise from such a process. Instead, Mind is seen as a
    pre-existing factor which is a vital component of the causal
    sequence giving rise to Life, Form and Being.</p>
    <p>The sutta goes on to describe the gradual devolution of
    these entities brought on by immorality and greed. Over the
    long course of eons their lives become shorter and their
    bodies coarser. Their food supply degenerates as well and
    they are forced to earn a living by the sweat of their brows.
    A key stage in the process is the episode where they begin to
    store their food, rather than gather it every day. This
    causes undue stress on the rice plants leading to their
    degeneration so that they no longer yield their daily harvest
    without the toil of plowing, sowing, reaping and threshing.</p>
    <p>This in turn leads to the institution of private property
    and the state, evils not known before. One cannot help but
    see this as a reflection of the Neolithic Revolution.</p>
    <p>In the Cakkavatti Sihananda Sutta (Digha 26) this history
    is continued into the present and beyond. It chronicles a
    continuous decline of morality and life span until the
    terrible period is reached when humans live only ten years
    and essentially revert to an animal like state. After this
    bottoming out, they will gradually return to a higher life in
    an evolving age.</p>
    <p>This myth diametrically opposes the popular modern myth;
    that of Progress. This myth assumes, somewhat arrogantly and
    very complacently, that we are more intelligent, healthier
    and generally better off than our poor benighted ancestors.</p>
    <p>While it would be absurd to argue for the literal
    interpretation of the sutta myth, it should be contemplated
    with the utmost respect. And it seems an open-minded
    consideration will find more than a grain of truth, if not in
    the details, then at least in the general picture.</p>
    <p>It is an anthropological fact that Cro-Magnon Man was a
    superior physically specimen, taller and even bigger brained
    than his modern descendants. Also, life spans may have been
    longer, possibly much longer, in the distant past. The oldest
    records of the Egyptian and Sumerian kings record reigns of
    many centuries each. Other ancient records, most notably the
    Hebrew text Genesis, also speak of people living several
    hundred years. This is too easily dismissed as mere legend.
    On what basis do we reject the testimony of the ancients?</p>
    <p>On a shorter time-scale, if we examine the birth and death
    records for the last century, longevity appears to be
    increasing only until we factor out the difference due to
    decreased infant mortality. If we factor that out, we find
    that life expectancy has declined by one full year since the
    1890's.</p>
    <p>With increasing pollution, climate change, declining food
    quality, new pestilences like AIDS and mad-cow disease not to
    mention radiation from faulty power plants and sundry other
    horrors, it seems a reasonable bet that life-expectancy will
    further decline in the coming decades, perhaps drastically.</p>
    <p>Technology itself can be seen as symptom of decline,
    rather than as an advance. Every stage from hunter-gather to
    agriculturist to industrialism to high tech has marked an
    increase in hours worked. Necessity is the mother of
    invention and technologies are often concocted to meet new
    needs due to environmental decline or loss of innate
    abilities. Thus, agriculture only became necessary when the
    big game became scarce at the end of the last ice-age.
    Writing became necessary when our mental powers of
    memorization began to fail.</p>
    <p>The Dharma too, has been in steady decline. From the first
    unspoken and unspeakable realization of Gotama the Buddha to
    the crystallization of that truth into language already
    marked a movement back from the transcendental. And each
    succeeding age has seen a further decline, from the crystal
    purity of the early suttas to the formalism of the
    commentaries through the extravagances of some schools of
    Mahayana to the sorry state of the sasana today. </p>
    <p>There have been periodic movements of rejuvenation and
    reform; Chan/Zen, the Thai Forest Movement, some trends even
    in the Vajrayana. But the overall picture is one of decline,
    which is exactly what the Buddha foretold. Today it is very
    hard to find the true Dharma. The East is falling under the
    evil spell of capitalistic materialism and the Dharma in the
    West is a fragile new bloom. Already it is under assault by
    movements of so-called rationalism which would reduce it to a
    minor branch of psychotherapy.</p>
    <p>But it is still possible to attain enlightenment. One
    should take the warning and strive in this very life, because
    it may be very long haul otherwise.</p>
