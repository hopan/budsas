    <td width="100%">&nbsp;<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">O</font><font
    face="Times New Roman">ne of the Pali words gaining popularity in our country nowadays is <strong>Theravada</strong>.
    You hear the word in Buddhist meetings and read it in Dhamma magazines. The government and
    the people alike use it fondly wherever and whenever occasion arises. What then is
    Theravada? The following is my humble attempt to explain the word grammatically,
    historically and doctrinally. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong>1. Grammatically:</strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The word Theravada is a compound of two
    members: <b>Thera</b> and <b>Vada</b>; <b>thera</b> means &quot;elder&quot;, especially
    &quot;an elderly Buddhist monk&quot;; here it stands for the inflected form <b>Theranam</b>,
    &quot;of the Elders&quot;; the second member <b>vada</b> coming from the root <b>vad</b>,
    &quot;to speak&quot; signifies &quot;speech&quot;, &quot;talk&quot;, &quot;word&quot;,
    &quot;doctrine&quot; or even &quot;ism&quot;. The word Theravada is frequently translated
    into English &quot;the Doctrine of the Elders&quot;; sporadic translations are &quot;the
    Way of the Elders&quot; and &quot;the School of the Elders&quot;; even &quot;old Wisdom
    School&quot; is met with.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Most probably the word first appears as the
    name of a Buddhist school in the <b>Dipavamsa</b>, the earlier Chronicle of Sri Lanka,
    dating the 4th century AD. The name is echoed in the <b>Mahavamsa</b>, the later but the
    better known and more important Chronicle of the 5th century. But it is the Commentaries
    and the Sub-commentaries on the Canonical texts that the name is defined and their
    definitions may be summed up as follows: only the texts (<b>paliyeva</b>) that were
    formulated at the first two Councils are to be known as Theravada, for they were
    safeguarded and handed down by such Great Elders as Maha Kassapa and others. They were so
    named in order to distinguish them from the views of the dissident Mahasanghika school. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong>2. Historically:</strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The history of Theravada as a school of
    Buddhism should begin with a quick survey of the life of Gotama Buddha himself. He was
    born as a Sakyan prince at a place near the Himalayas about six hundred years BC. Grieved
    at the ills of life such as old age, sickness and death, he renounced the world at the age
    of 29 and started seeking the way to Nibbana, &quot;Extinction&quot; of all forms of
    suffering. At 35 he achieved his goal and became Buddha. He then carried out his teaching
    mission for 45 years. At 80 he attained Parinibbana, &quot;Total Extinction&quot; (which
    is the Buddhist way of expressing his demise). Just before that event he left a message to
    his cousin and attendant monk, Ananda, part of which being:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="left"><strong><em><font face="Times New Roman"><i>When I am gone, the Dhamma
      (Doctrine) and Vinaya (Discipline) that I have taught and laid down shall be your Teacher!</i></font></em></strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This implies that the Buddha did not want to
    appoint any person to succeed him on his demise. The two Great Disciples Sariputta and
    Moggallana had already passed away; but Maha Kassapa who enjoyed the good reputation of
    being the Third Disciple was alive. But even a man of his stature would not become the
    Buddha&quot;s successor. By this injunction the Buddha made it clear that only his Dhamma
    and Vinaya would adequately and effectively serve as the sole guide to his followers.
    Dhamma-Vinaya therefore was the designation given by the Master himself to his twofold
    teaching (<b>pavacana</b>) about the time of his Parinibbana. There was no reason whatever
    to dub it Theravada.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When <font color="#800080"><strong>the First
    Council</strong></font> was held at Rajagaha three months after the Buddha&quot;s demise
    with the noble aim of consolidation the Dhamma-Vinaya &quot;before righteousness fades
    away and before unrighteousness shines forth&quot;. The Council was presided over by Maha
    Kassapa whose questions on the Vinaya and the Dhamma were answered by Upali and Ananda
    respectively. The answers were confirmed by 500 monks who recited both in unison and
    passed on from teacher to pupil orally. The name Theravada remained unheard of, at least
    publicly. It that Buddhism as one whole body with its original designation of Dhamma
    Vinaya stood in full bloom all over India.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">A century later <font color="#800080"><strong>the
    Second Council</strong></font> was held at Vesali under the collective leadership of Yasa,
    Revata and Sabbakami to discuss the &quot;ten points&quot; which in fact were the Buddha's
    certain disciplinary ruler relaxed and practised by imprudent Vajjian monks. The Council
    composed of 700 members decided the points unlawful and condemned the Vajjians who seceded
    from that Council to convene their own known as Maha sangha or Mahasangiti, the Great
    Council, since their number 10,000 far exceeded that of the former. It was the open and
    serious schism that took place in the Sangha, the Buddhist Order, for the first time. And
    with the schism emerged two factions of Theravadins, followers of Theravada, and
    Mahasanghikas or Mahasangitikas, those of the secession.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#800080"><strong>The Third
    Council </strong></font>in the tradition of Theravada was held in the 3rd century,
    according to the Chronicles and Commentaries, with Moggaliputta Tissa as its president and
    Asoka to the Moriyan Dynasty as its supporter. The venue of the Council was the imperial
    city Pataliputta. The purpose was to purify the religion and to restore peace to the
    Order, for many heretics who had joined the Sangha for convenient livelihood caused
    confusion and unfortunate incidents in the Sangha. At the conclusion of the Council,
    missionaries were despatched to nine countries including Sri Lanka and Suvannabhumi; to
    the former went Asoka,s son, Mahinda, leading a group of monks and to the latter,
    generally taken to be Myanmar, Sona and Uttara.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Scholars are of opinion that Theravada
    thrived in the country of Magadha in the east and the city of Ujjeni in the west. In his
    rock and pillar inscriptions, Asoka speaks of compassion, charity, truthfulness, purity
    and other virtues to be developed witch might be common to all the religions prevailing in
    the country: Buddhism, Brahmanism, Hinduism, Jainism, etc. From the inscriptions, we also
    know of his tolerance and even gifts to non-Buddhist sects. But that he was a devout
    Theravadin in his heart of hearts is evidenced by his famous Bhabru inscription in which
    he recommends for learning certain Buddhist texts which can be traced in the Pali Canon of
    the Theravada, the only school which employs that language for recording its scriptures.
    The inclusion of the Kathavatthu, a work of his time, in the Abhidhamma Pitaka is another
    piece of evidence, not to speak of his sending of his son Mahinda as a bhikkhu to
    propagate Theravada Buddhism in the Island as asserted in Buddhist works. In these works,
    however, the name Theravada is replaced by Vibhajjavada, the &quot;Doctrine of
    Analysis&quot; or the &quot;Religion of Reason&quot; though the two terms are identical.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The reign of Asoka was however marked by the
    split of Buddhism into 18 sects which according to one source were Theravada and
    Mahasanghika plus 10 branching out from the former and 6 from the latter. The misfortune
    caused by the split was not so great as one might guess, for it was a result of the rapid
    expansion of Buddhism. Just remember the Buddha&quot;s instruction given to his earliest
    60 disciples when he sent them to spread the Dhamma for the welfare and happiness of many:
    &quot;No two persons shall go in the same direction!&quot; The differences between one
    sect and another were due to the geographical factor rather than to doctrinal except in a
    few cases. And many of the sects disappeared after existing for some time. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">After its heyday during the time of Asoka,
    Theravada began to wane in northern India. When the mighty Gupta dynasty arose in AD 428,
    there must be a number of reasons for this sad turning point in the course of Theravada.
    One theory says that the decline was brought about by the lack of encouragement of the
    Gupta kings who as Hindu favored Sanskrit. In fact, it was a time of the revival or even
    the efflorescence of Sanskrit literature. Their devotion to Hinduism and love for Sanskrit
    did not help the existence of Theravada let alone its growth, for it is the only school of
    Buddhism that employs Pali as its language.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It was evident that some of the Guptas showed
    their interest in Buddhism by making some donations to it, but the recipients were the
    forms other than Theravada, such as Sarvastivada, an important offshoot of Theravada, and
    Mahayana, the giant incarnation, as it were, of Mahasanghika, both of which turned to
    Sanskrit as their sacred language. Pali Buddhism, Theravada, then moved to the south and
    settled itself along the east coast form which hailed later such Buddhist commentators as
    Dhammapala of Kancipura and Buddhadatta of Uragapura. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The establishment of Theravada after its
    introduction there by Mahinda from Pataliputra long before its journey to the south of
    India, one knows only too well. Its stronghold was the Mahavihara, &quot;the Great
    Monastery&quot; at Anuradhapura, to which Buddhaghosa, the greatest of commentators in
    Theravada tradition belonged. It was also a seat of learning producing a number of other
    writers in Pali. The existence of some antagonistic sects was not unknown but the
    Mahavihara was powerful enough to prevail over the opponents. In times of danger and
    adversity also Sri Lanka had good friends in Myanmar and Thai Buddhists who went to their
    rescue. Today she stands out as a land of missionary monks who are not only well versed in
    Buddhism but also modern educated and efficient enough to spread the Dhamma, especially in
    the west.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Nowadays Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand are
    the three stalwart Theravada states with close religious ties. Though Laos and Cambodia
    have lost much of their religious lustre both still deserve to be recognised as Theravada
    countries. In Vietnam, formerly a land of pure Mahayana, Theravada is somewhat developing.
    In the hill tracts of Bangladesh many of the Baruas, the Chakmas and the Maghs and their
    fellow countrymen in the Chttagong area still prove to be staunch Theravadins. So do the
    Shans in the frontier regions of South China.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">As for India, the land of the birth of
    Buddhism as well as of its death, signs of the revival of the Theravada school have been
    noticed. Mass conversions of Indians to Buddhism have recently taken place. At the most
    recent conversion ceremony some Mahatheras from Myanmar played a leading role reciting
    Pali formulas.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong>3. Doctrinally:</strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Now to explain Theravada doctrinally, only a
    few similarities and differences between Theravada and the three other schools mentioned
    above -- Mahasanghika, Sarvastivada and Mahayana -- will be touched upon as giving details
    is impossible here.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#800080"><strong>Theravada and
    Mahasanghika:</strong></font> In regard to Vinaya, the code of discipline known as
    Patimokkha in Theravada contains 227 rules while its counterpart, Pratimoksa, Mahasanghika
    119. The former&quot;s<b> Bhikkhu-vibhanga </b>and <b>Bhikkhuni-vibhanga</b> probably
    correspond to the latter&quot;s <b>Bhiksu-vinaya</b> and <b>Bhiksuni-vinaya</b>, which are
    now extant soly in Chinese. The only surviving work in its original language, Sanskrit,
    the <b>Mahavastu </b>of the Mahasanghika's Vinaya, has passages that are found parallel to
    those in the <b>Khuddakapatha</b>, the <b>Vimanavatthu</b>, <strong>Buddhavamsa</strong>
    and <strong>Dhammapada</strong> of the Pali Canon. An important doctrinal difference the
    two schools is that the Theravadins speak of the human nature of the Buddha where as the
    Mahasanghikas believe the supramundane nature of Buddhas which is more pronounced in the
    sect called Lokottaravada and in Mahayana.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#800080"><strong>Theravada and
    Sarvastivada:</strong></font> Though the Sarvastivada scriptures are in Sanskrit, they
    teach the views that are closest to Theravada. Like its patriarch school Theravada,
    Sarvastivada denies the transcendent powers ascribed to Bodhisattvas. But unlike
    Theravada, it questions the perfection of Arahats, whom Theravada hold in highest esteem
    as winners of Nibbana. Its monks observed 155 Vinaya rules. The school has its own
    Abhidhamma Pitaka, but the seven books are entirely different from the Theravada's. Two
    commentaries on the Abhidhamma still exist: <b>Vibhasha</b> and <b>Mahavibhasha</b>, and
    from this the Sarvastivadins are also known as Vabhashikas, &quot;those belonging to the
    Vibhashas&quot;. They believe that &quot;all is&quot; or &quot;all things exist&quot; (<b>Sarvam
    asti</b> in Sanskrit and <b>sabbam atthi</b> in Pali). That is to say not only the things
    in the present exist, but also the things in the past and future which are in continuity
    with the present. Hence the name of their school Sarvastivada.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#800080"><strong>Theravada and
    Mahayana:</strong></font> The name <strong>Mahayana</strong> along with the other name <strong>Hinayana</strong>
    its first appearance between the its century BC and the 1st century AD. Occurring in the <b>Saddharma
    Pundarika Sutra</b>, the &quot;Discourse on the Lotus of the Good Law&quot;, Mahayana --
    the &quot;Greater Vehicle&quot; -- is understood today by many as the name the school of
    Buddhism prevailing in Tibet, China, Korea, Japan and Mongolia, as opposed to the Hinayana
    until recently represented by Theravada.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Mahayana covers all forms Buddhism prevalent
    in those countries as it has incorporated many of the view held by the sects that had
    branched off from Mahasanghika and have disappeared now. The master who gave a clear
    definition to this school known sometimes as Northern Buddhism was Nagarjuna of the 2nd
    century A.D. In common with their brethren, the Theravadins, they believe the Four Noble
    Truths, the Eightfold Noble Path, the Dependent Origination, the Three Characteristics of
    Existence and a number of other basic tenets. Above all, both the schools accept Gotama
    Buddha as their Teacher. Mahayana built on Compassion and Wisdom has its own divergences,
    of course, of which only the most important one may be stated here, which is expressed by
    scholars as the <strong>Bodhisatva ideal</strong>. Every Mahayanist is a Bodhisatva,
    &quot;a being whose essence is Enlightenment&quot; as one translation goes. As such he
    sets his goal not only to attain Nirvana for himself but to provide all sentient beings
    with the same liberation from the woes of <b>samsara </b>or &quot;life-cycle&quot;. Hence
    their school is greater compared with Hinayana, the school of the &quot;Lesser
    Vehicle&quot; as its members strive only for their attainment of nirvana as Arahats.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The World Fellowship of Buddhists decided
    unanimously in Colombo in 1950 that the term Hinayana should be eliminated when referring
    to the Theravada School of Buddhism. The term Hinayana is now a thing of the past. If the
    term be used today it should mean any or all of the sects now sunk into oblivion. There
    exist at present only two schools of Buddhism: <font color="#800080"><strong>Theravada and
    Mahayana</strong></font>. The two must be friendlier with each other and be more united in
    contributing their shares to everlasting peace of the world.</font></p>
