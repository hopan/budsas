<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">L</font>ike many other people, I was first
  attracted to the Internet, and especially to E-mail, because it seemed to be a much more
  environmentally friendly way of transmitting information than the medium of print, which
  uses vast amounts of petroleum (the base of most kinds of ink) and trees (the base of most
  kinds of paper). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After sitting for two years on my university's committee
  for computer policy, I am much less sanguine about e-mail than I used to be. At my
  university, studies have shown that the cost of electricity alone for our computer network
  is about $50,000 per year. In my region of Canada, all electric power is generated by huge
  hydroelectric dams far away in the north and transmitted by massive power lines to the
  more heavily populated areas. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every single phase of the generation and delivery of
  electrical power is damaging to animal and plant life and disruptive to the ancient
  patterns of life of native peoples. The ubiquitous presence of computer terminals all over
  campus has been responsible for a significant breakdown in the quality of air in
  buildings, as a result of which new air-conditioning systems are being installed, which of
  course require even more electricity to operate them. The fee that a university must pay
  for being connected to the Internet is substantial. The cost of telephone lines for modem
  connections is also substantial. All told, this whole Internet business is costing my
  university many tens of thousands of dollars a year. Despite the very real costs of
  connectivity, the general perception is that the Internet is free, because at my
  university no individual user has to pay for using it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is also a growing perception that the Internet is
  democratic (which in this culture is uncritically perceived as something good) and
  egalitarian (also seen as something good) and economical. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">All these common perceptions about the Internet are false.
  It is anything but environmentally friendly, economical, democratic and egalitarian. Much
  delusion surrounds this toy of the rich. When I occasionally rail against the Internet,
  the main thing I am trying to do is to make people a little more aware of the fact that
  this is not a karma-free zone. Even here in cyberspace we have to think carefully about
  the consequences of our actions. The problem is that the very nature of the beast makes it
  difficult for us to be aware of the consequences of our actions. The sentient beings that
  suffer as a result of our using this device are far away from our sense faculties. We tend
  not to be aware of the things that are being neglected because an increasing percentage of
  educational budgets are being channeled into the Internet. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once one becomes a little more aware of all the indirect
  consequences of our increasing reliance on the Internet, one can no longer think of this
  tool as karmically neutral. The system does cause suffering, even death. And we who use it
  -- even with the purest of intentions -- are contributing to that systemic damage. I
  therefore submit that it is not unreasonable to give serious thought to the question of
  whether using the Internet is consistent with the principle of Right Livelihood. As with
  any important issue, it would be folly to arrive too quickly at a simplistic answer. While
  I would by no means suggest that the Internet is by its very nature opposed to Buddhist
  ethical principles, it is nevertheless a tool whose use deserves much more mindfulness
  than many of us have given it in the past.</font></p>
