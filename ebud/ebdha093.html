    <hr width="25%">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We practice meditation in order to cultivate peace, peace
    in our minds, peace in our lives. We can see that it is quite
    difficult to establish ourselves in peace, even under the
    most idyllic conditions. There will inevitably be some
    disruptions to the peacefulness of mind, usually internal
    disruptions. These disruptions are of great variety. But
    ill-will, aversion, anger or hatred are the disruptions that
    destroy the peace of mind most quickly, not only in times of
    meditation, but in the general daily course of living.
    Whenever anger, ill-will, or irritation arises it immediately
    destroys our peace of mind, our mental well-being. There are
    many things, many people, many situations which may trigger
    off this reaction in the mind, but we must be very clear that
    the problem is within us and not 'out there'.</p>
    <p>Most of the time we justify our reasons for being
    &quot;angry&quot;, for being disturbed, but that doesn't help
    us to experience peace and well-being in life. In fact the
    more we justify our anger, the more prone we are to indulge
    in it. The more we indulge in it, the more it becomes
    habitual and the more often we experience it. On many
    occasions, the Buddha taught about the dangers of indulging
    in thoughts of ill-will, anger and aversion. He encouraged
    his disciples to train by various means in order to reduce
    the power of this a version, to conquer this enemy, to free
    oneself from this bondage called anger. It is important to
    contemplate and see the faults of anger, see that it is a
    blemish, see that it is a trouble maker in our lives. The
    first step is quite often contemplating to see what is the
    result, what is the effect of this thing called ill-will,
    anger, on our lives, physically, mentally and socially.</p>
    <p>The Buddha pointed out some of the obvious faults. He
    compared ill-will, anger and aversion to an enemy. An enemy
    would wish harmful things towards one and would rejoice when
    harmful things happen to one, and anger achieves this very
    effectively.</p>
    <p>An enemy would not want you to be handsome or attractive,
    he or she would want you looking ugly and miserable. The
    Buddha said that anger does this to you. If we have the state
    of anger, and we have this state often, our features will not
    be pleasing to look at. Anger, hatred, ill-will and aversion
    has the effect of detracting from our physical appearance.
    When you are angry, when you are full of hatred and anger,
    your features are not pleasant, attractive or pleasing or in
    any way beautiful. Why? Because the features are an
    expression of the mental state. When the mind is agitated,
    negative, disturbed, the features become distorted. This is
    the first blemish, the first fault of indulging in an angry
    state of mind -- the physical appearance is not pleasing.</p>
    <p>The second disadvantage is that, like an enemy would not
    wish you to have well-being, nor to be able to rest at ease
    and feel peaceful and comfortable, but would want you to be
    miserable and suffer discomfort and pain, anger does that.
    When you are angry, when you. are irritated, you can't rest,
    you can't sleep, you can't eat. You suffer from lack of
    sleep, lack of good nutrition, you get ulcers and all sorts
    of physical health problems as a result of anger.</p>
    <p>The third disadvantage, the Buddha said, is that just as
    an enemy would not wish you to be prosperous and successful,
    anger makes it difficult to be prosperous, to be successful.
    If you are given to anger, if your mind is irritated, you
    will not have good judgement. When we are given to anger,
    ill-will, and aversion, many things go wrong in our lives:
    business, work, study. As a result of anger we make mistakes.
    If we indulge in anger often, express anger often, have an
    angry disposition, we will have a reputation, but not a good
    one. We will not have a reputation of being a responsible,
    level headed person, one that people will respect. We will be
    known as someone who can't control their emotions, short
    tempered. just as enemy would not want us to have friends and
    companions, if we give vent to anger, indulge in anger and
    hatred, we are not going to have too many friends and
    companions. It is not easy to live with someone who is always
    getting angry, upset and showing a lot of irritation.</p>
    <p>If one really indulges in anger and makes it a habit, a
    really strong habit, its consequences are more far-reaching
    than just this present life, in that it will be a cause and
    condition for an unhappy rebirth. A negative state of mind
    causes us to act in unskillful ways of body and speech, that
    is unwholesome kamma, which, if it becomes habitual, leads to
    an unhappy rebirth in a future life.</p>
    <p>So the Buddha pointed out these faults of ill-will, of
    anger, and hatred. How do we deal with anger? What can we do
    to try and reduce its power, to try and reduce its strength,
    to avoid these pitfalls, to avoid these consequences, to
    avoid this suffering? The Buddha gave many illustrations,
    many skillful means by which we can deal with anger. In one
    particular discourse the Buddha gave five. He said to try
    these things, develop these five things, one or another, to
    counteract anger and ill-will, to try and reduce the power of
    anger and ill-will.</p>
    <p>The first one, which is the direct opposite of anger and
    ill-will, is <b><i>loving kindness</i></b>. To cultivate
    goodwill, to establish the mind in loving kindness, metta is
    a wonderfully effective remedy for anger. This is a
    contemplation which weakens the tendency towards ill-will,
    towards the negative perception. Loving kindness is
    cultivating a more positive perception.</p>
    <p>Having the aspiration or the wish for goodwill, the
    well-being of oneself and others as one's wish or intention,
    one can cultivate this as a meditation, ill-will and aversion
    can't get through, can't come and disturb and irritate the
    mind that is well established in the perception of loving
    kindness, even in difficult situations. To counteract
    ill-will, and to develop goodwill, we are encouraged not to
    allow the mind to dwell only on the negative, only on what is
    wrong, only on what is faulted, but to intentionally,
    consciously, make the effort to see the good side as well.
    Loving kindness meditation is a very good thing to do. It is
    very important thing to do often, to find ways to bring into
    the mind positive perceptions and sustain them in the mind.</p>
    <p>The second way is the <b><i>development of compassion</i></b>.
    Compassion is the recognition of suffering and the wish to
    relieve suffering in oneself and others. Once we see
    suffering most of us will respond and wish to relieve it.
    When you have ill-will, aversion towards people, you quite
    often fail to realise that that person is suffering.
    Suffering takes many forms. When someone is being quite
    nasty, instead of just reacting, have you ever stopped to ask
    why they are being so nasty, so aggressive? Or why they are
    being so unreasonable? Emotionally, mentally, they are
    unhappy, that's why they are behaving like that. A happy
    person, a joyful person just doesn't behave like that. When a
    person is acting in an obnoxious way, if we are mindful, we
    can recollect and say: &quot;Well, maybe they're having a
    hard time. Maybe they've got a real problem.&quot; Once you
    see that they are suffering, you feel compassion and you
    won't be caught in a reaction of ill-will and anger. You'll
    be more forgiving and allowing. Remember to notice the
    suffering and you'll wish to relieve suffering and you won't
    react in a way to make the suffering worse. The enemy all of
    a sudden becomes someone you care for. Compassion is a very
    wonderful quality of mind, and it is quite easy to arouse,
    provided that we somehow remember to see, and to recognise,
    the suffering in life, in the hearts of all beings. That will
    change our perception of the person. Perception is very
    important because that's what affects the way we respond, the
    way we act.</p>
    <p>Another skillful means is to <b><i>develop equanimity</i></b>,
    non-reacting. If you can't develop loving kindness, and you
    can't feel compassion, develop equanimity. We can't make
    everything be just as we want it to be. It is not possible.
    Bring that into the mind, accept that things are just the way
    they are. People are just the way they are. There is just so
    much that we can do and then there is a great deal beyond our
    control, beyond what we can shape. Equanimity is an essential
    part of life if you want to remain sane. Otherwise you would
    go crazy, or just end up being a very irritated person,
    continually irritated by a world that just will not do what
    you want it to. Equanimity means appreciation, understanding,
    accepting, coming to terms with, being at peace with the fact
    that there is a limit to what one can do and can achieve. One
    just accepts that people are like that and then stands aside.
    just let it be. Be at peace.</p>
    <p>Another suggestion that the Buddha made is the idea of <b><i>actually
    avoiding</i></b>, not getting close to the situation, not
    getting involved. If you really can't cope with the situation
    or a particular person, then avoid the situation. Sometimes
    that's about the only thing that people can do. This not only
    means physically avoiding, but mentally as well. Sometimes
    you avoid them physically, but they are very present in your
    mind, aren't they? Mentally we continually bring up something
    over and over, it takes on life, we live with it. It's very
    unhealthy. Put it aside, forget it. Let it be.</p>
    <p>One last approach that the Buddha encouraged was to <b><i>contemplate
    the law of kamma</i></b>. There is justice. There is always
    justice. No-one gets away with anything. No-one escapes the
    fruit of their kamma. When anyone does unwholesome or
    unskillful kamma, when they rob, when they cheat, when they
    abuse, whether or not you take them to court, whether or not
    you beat them on the head, they cannot escape their kamma.
    Everyone inherits their own kamma. Contemplating the law of
    kamma is sometimes very good to try and help us rise up and
    accept some apparent injustices in life. This doesn't mean
    that we should not take steps to protect ourselves, or to try
    and correct injustices. but sometimes there is nothing we can
    do. To relieve that sense of injustice, righteous
    indignation, which is just a glorified way of saying 'I feel
    angry, resentful', contemplate the law of kamma.</p>
    <p>These are very useful, skillful means that we can utilise
    in order to reduce the power of ill-will and aversion. If we
    can reduce it , we are reducing self-torment. If we eliminate
    it, we eliminate an enemy, our own inner enemy. This is why
    the Buddha said:</p>
    <p>&quot;'Though one may conquer a thousand enemies on the
    battle field, single handed, and conquer them a thousand
    times over, yet greater is the one who conquers
    oneself.&quot;</p>
    <p>Conquering oneself means conquering one's defilements and,
    in this case, means conquering ill-will and aversion. I
    encourage all of you to contemplate the nature of ill-will,
    to begin to recognise the faults, the disadvantages and to
    endeavour to cultivate these skillful means: loving kindness,
    compassion, equanimity, avoiding, and contemplating kamma, so
    that we can be freed from those disadvantages, that
    suffering.</p>
