  <font COLOR="#800080"><h4><font face="Times New Roman">I. THE SHORT ANSWER</font></font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha died of old age, when he was eighty years old.
  The death was triggered by his body reaction to a dish of wild mushroom. He died
  peacefully and mindfully.<br>
  </font></p>
  <font COLOR="#800080"><h4><font face="Times New Roman">II. THE LONG ANSWER</font></font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to know the last day of the Buddha, we should
  read books on his life or better still, read the recorded suttas. The best source is the
  Maha Parinibbana Sutta (Kinh Dda.i Ba't Nie^'t Ba`n) from the Pali collection of the Digha
  Nikaya (Tru+o+`ng Bo^. Kinh), or the Wandering Sutra (Kinh Du Ha`nh) from the
  Sanskrit/Chinese collection of the Digha Agama (Tru+o+`ng A Ha`m). There is a separate
  Chinese sutra, The Maha Parinirvana Sutra, which was also translated into Vietnamese, but
  this script has been widely regarded as being composed at a very late stage (about 200-400
  AD). <br>

  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">II.2. The last meal</font></h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last meal offered to the Buddha was prepared by Cunda,
    the metalworker [1]: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;... And Cunda, the metalworker, after the night
    had passed, had choice food, hard and soft, prepared in his abode, together with a
    quantity of sukara-maddava, ...&quot; </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;.... And with the sukara-maddava prepared by him
    (Cunda), he served the Blessed One; and with the other food, hard and soft, he served the
    community of bikkhus.&quot; </i></font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thereafter, the Blessed One spoke to Cunda,
    saying: &quot;Whatever, Cunda, is left over of the sukara-maddava, bury that in a pit. For
    I do not see in all this world, with its gods, Maras and Brahmas, among the host of
    ascetics and brhamins, gods and men, anyone who could eat it and entirely digest it except
    the Tathagata alone.&quot;</font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the translation from the Pali script,
    &quot;SUKARA-MADDAVA&quot; was not translated in the English version [1; 2; 3], although
    Walshe translated it as &quot;pig's delight&quot; [2]. However, the Vietnamese versions
    contain the words &quot;na^'m&quot; (mushroom) and &quot;mo^.c nhi~&quot; (edible black
    fungus) [4; 5; 6]. In some other books, which I forgot the exact titles, the terms
    &quot;pork meat, boar meat&quot; were used. According to many Pali scholars [1; 2]: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i><b>sukara: </b>pig, boar<br>
    <i><b>maddava:</b> delicate, well-liked, soft, tender</i> </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, <i><b>sukara-maddava</b></i> may nean: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) the tender parts of a pig or boar<br>
    (2) what is enjoyed by pigs or boars, which may be referred to a mushroom or truffle, or a
    yam or tuber. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In some other commentaries, sukara-maddava was also
    mentioned as a &quot;medicinal plant&quot; in classic Indian medicine, or as &quot;young
    bamboo shoots trampled by pigs&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the current scholar monks agree with the meaning of
    &quot;mushroom or truffle&quot;, and I concur with them. According to the monastic rules,
    the monks are not allowed to eat meat from animals specifically killed to make food for
    them. The meaning of sukara-maddava as &quot;pork/boar meat&quot; is thus not appropriate
    here. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">II.3. The last hours</font></h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3.1 <i>&quot;And soon after the Blessed One had eaten the
    meal provided by Cunda, a dire sickness fell upon him, even dysentery, and he suffered
    sharp and deadly pains. But the Blessed One endured them mindfully, clearly understanding
    and unperturbed. </i></font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Then the blessed One spoke to the venerable
    Ananda, saying: &quot;Come, Ananda, let us go to Kusinara.&quot; </font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3.2 He was thirsty and asked Ananda to get some water from
    a nearby stream which was quite muddy and turbid. However, when Ananda took the bowl to
    the stream, the water became clear, pure and pleasant.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3.3 He met Pukkusa of the Malla clan, taught him about the
    state of calmness of those who had gone forth from the world (ie. the monks and nuns).
    Pukkasa was impressed, asked to be ordained, and took refuge in the Triple Gems. It is
    noted that in this part of the Sutta, as well as in many other Discourses, the Pali
    recitation of the 3 Refuges which is still recited in many Theravadin countries in present
    time was presented: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Buddham Saranam Gachami </b>(I take the refuge in the
      Buddha)<br>
      <b>Dhammam Saranam Gachami</b> (I take the refuge in the Dhamma) <br>
      <b>Sangham Saranam Gachami</b> (I take the refuge in the Sangha) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3.4 When ordaining Pukkusa, the Buddha and Ananda accepted
    new robes offered by him. When Ananda helped the Buddha changing robe, he observed the
    skin of the Buddha becoming exceedingly clear and radiant. The Buddha told him that there
    were only two occasions when the Tathagata's body was in such state: Nibanna
    (Enlightenment) and Parinibanna (Final Passing Away). The Buddha told Ananda that He would
    enter Parinibbana in the last watch of that night. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3.5 He then took a rest, and advised Ananda to tell Cunda,
    the metalworker, not to have any remorse because of that last meal. He told Ananda that
    there were two equally important meals which had been offered to him: the one offered to
    him before Enlightenment and the one before Parinibanna.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He then spoke of the importance of generosity, moral
    conduct, and mind training (Dana, Sila, Bhavana - Bo^' thi', Tri` gio+'i, Thie^`n ddi.nh):
    </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Who gives, his virtues shall increase;<br>
      Who is self-curbed, no hatred bears;<br>
      Whoso is skilled in virtues, evil shuns,<br>
      And by the rooting out of lust and hate<br>
      And all delusion, comes to be at peace&quot;. </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3.6 The Buddha went to Mallas's sala grove, in the
    vicinity of Kusinara, and asked Ananda to prepare a couch for him, between the twin sala
    trees, with the head to the north. He then instructed Ananda on how to respect and
    venerate Him: </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;... Whatever bikkhu or bikkhuni, layman or
    laywoman, abides in the Dhamma, lives uprightly in the Dhamma, walks in the way of the
    Dhamma, it is by such a one that the Tathagata is respected, venerated, esteemed,
    worshipped and honoured in the highest degree. Therefore, Ananda, thus should youtrain
    yourselves: 'We shall abide by the Dhamma, live uprightly in the Dhamma, walk in the way
    of the Dhamma.' ...&quot; </font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3.7 The Budhha advised all beings present at the site,
    including many deities, that: </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Impermanent are all compounded things. How could
    this (his imminent death) be otherwise?&quot; </font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3.8 The Buddha advised Ananda on the four places a pious
    person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence: His birth place, the place
    where He became enlightened, the place where He gave the first discourse (Setting the
    Dhamma Wheel in Motion), the place where He passed away. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3.9 When Ananda asked how should he treat the Buddha's
    body after death, the Buddha said: </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Do not hinder yourselves, Ananda, to honour the
    body of the Tathagata. Rather you should strive, Ananda, and be zealous on your own
    behalf, for your own good. Unflinchingly, ardently and resolutely you should apply
    yourselves to your own good.&quot;</font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3.10 When Ananda was weeping, the Buddha told him: </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Enough, Ananda! Do not grieve, do not lament. For
    have I not taught from the very beginning that with all that is dear and beloved, there
    must be change, separation and severence? Of that which is born, come into being,
    compounded, and subject to decay, how can one say: 'May it not come to dissolution' ?
    There can be no such state of things ... Now you should put forth energy, and soon you too
    will be free from the taints.&quot; </font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3.11 The Buddha taught Sabhadda, a wandering ascetic,
    about the Noble Eightfold Path, and admitted him into the Order. Sabhada was the last
    disciple.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3.12 The Buddha told Ananda and other bikkhus that after
    his death, they should abide to his teaching as their teacher: </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ananda, what I have taught and explained to you
    as Dhamma and discipline will be your teacher when I am gone.&quot; </font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3.13 The Buddha asked all the monks whether they had any
    doubts or uncertainty about the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, or about the path or the
    practice. He asked them three times but they all kept silent.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3.14 And the Buddha addressed the monks, saying: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i><b>&quot; Behold now, bikkhus, I declare to you: all
    conditioned things are of a nature to decay. Strive on with earnestness.&quot; </b></i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These were the last words of the Tathagata.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3.15 The Buddha then entered the first jhana, the second
    jhana, the third jhana, the fourth jhana. Then he entered the sphere of Infinite Space,
    the sphere of Infinite Conciousness, the sphere of Nothingness, the sphere of
    Neither-perception-nor-nonperception. Then, he attained the cessation of feeling and
    perception.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Leaving the attainment of cessation of feeling and
    perception, he entered the sphere of Neither-perception-nor-nonperception, the sphere of
    Nothingness, the sphere of Infinite Conciousness, the sphere of Infinite Space. Then he
    entered the fourth jhana, the third jhana, the second jhana, the first jhana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Leaving the first jhana, he entered the second jhana, the
    third jhana, the fourth jhana.Leaving the fourth jhana, the Blessed One immediately passed
    away.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h4><font face="Times New Roman">II.4. What can I learn ?</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every time I read the Maha Parinibbana Sutta [1; 2], I
  always discover something new to my understanding of the Dhamma: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) The Buddha reached Enlightenment when he was 35 years
    old, but he still lived on to the age of 80, to teach the Dhamma and the path to
    liberation. His body, however, was just like our body consisting of the five heaps
    (skandas: form, feeling, perception, volition, and conciousness), and thus subjected to
    decay and death. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) The food prepared by Cunda, the metalworker, was not
    poisonous, but could be regarded as a catalyst triggering his death. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) Enduring the pain with calmness and mindfulness, he
    continued to teach the Dhamma to his followers to the last moment, and accepted two more
    disciples. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(4) He was also very thorough in instructing Ananda not to
    blame Cunda for the last meal, by summarising his teaching in Generosity - Moral Conduct -
    Mind Training, instructing the people to revere the Dhamma, instructing the monks how to
    keep the Dhamma alive as their guide and teacher after his death, and also made sure that
    his teachings were fully understood by his disciples by asking them three times. His final
    words were again a Dhamma on the impermanent nature of things, and an advice to his
    disciples to continue their training effort. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(5) He approached the final moment with dignity, peace and
    mindfulness as he had always advocated: entering into all stages of meditative
    absorptions, and without attachment, leaving them behind before passing away.</font></p>
