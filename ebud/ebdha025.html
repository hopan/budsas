<P>Members of the Sangha, The Honourable Philip Ruddock, Minister For Immigration

and Multicultural Affairs, Councillors of Fairfield City Council, Distinguished

Guests, Our Compatriots, Fellow Buddhists,</P>



<P>The celebration of Vesak Day 2621 in the year 2541 according to the

Buddhist Calendar is jointly organised by the United Vietnamese Buddhist

Congregation of New South Wales and the ACT. We are deeply honoured by

your presence here today. On behalf of the organising committee we would

like to thank you all for coming and celebrating Vesak with us. On the

day of the full moon day in the fourth lunar month, in the Lumbini Gardens

near the city of Kapilavastu located in the Himalayan foothills in what

now southern Nepal the Historic Buddha was born to Queen Mahamaya and King

Suddhodana of the warrior caste Shakya clan. The birth of Buddha, like

that of the founders of other religions is shrouded in the myth and magical

events. One of the Buddhist scriptures recounts &quot; ...that, having

thus been born, the Buddha without any help or support walked seven steps

towards each quarter of the world. At every step as he walked there sprang

a lotus flower from the earth beneath his feet. Then He announced &quot;

No further births have I to endure, for this is my last body. Now shall

I destroy and pluck out by the roots the sorrow that is caused by birth

and death (Samsara) &quot;.</P>



<P>Living in a democratic society such as ours, it is probably hard to

understand the complexity of Indian social structures at that time. There

were four main castes (or Savarnas meaning literally &quot;colours&quot;:

the Brahmin or priestly caste who monopolised all the privileges that the

White South Africans of the now defunct apartheid regime would have envied;

the &quot;Kshatriya&quot;, or warrior caste who were the ruling elite;

the &quot;Vaishya&quot; the merchant caste and the Shudra, the artisan

caste who were the working class people. There was absolutely no social

mobility between these castes because one's caste was inherited at one's

parents at birth, a situation that was prescribed in the Vedic scriptures,

unlike the social class which is a man made institution. There is a lower

caste, the Untouchables, now called &quot;haridjan&quot; who have been

deprived of every basic human right. It was an untouchable, Ambedkar, who

revived Buddhism in India which led the greatest mass conversion to Buddhism

in modern Indian history.</P>



<P>The birth of the Buddha in a country full of social inequality must

be seen as the beginning of a new era in which human dignity is respected.

A new era in which human beings are no longer the playthings of omniscient

deities. Human beings deserve respect and equal treatment regardless of

their origins or social standing.</P>



<P>Buddhism is a religion of loving kindness and compassion which is not

restricted to human beings. but is extended to all sentient beings. Let

me recount a story of the Buddha and his cousin, Devadatta, who later became

the Buddhaï¿½s adversary. One day Prince Siddharta was walking in the royal

garden when suddenly a white swan pierced by an arrow, fell on the ground

in front of him. The Prince knelt down, holding the quivering bird, said

to it softly: &quot; Do not be afraid. I am here to look after you. Let

me see your wound&quot; Gently He removed the arrow and tended the wound.

The bird seemed to be reassured and lay quietly. Taking off his jacket,

the Prince laid it over the swan to pick it up and to go to seek medical

when Devadatta tushed up to Him saying; &quot;Have you seen the swan I

shot dove ?&quot;. Seeing the bird wrapped safely in the Prince's jacket,

Devadatta said angrily. &quot;It is mine. I shot it down. You have stolen

my quarry&quot; However the Prince refused to give the swan to Devadatta

who eventually had to give up his prey. This is not just a story about

two boys who squabble over marbles. This is a story of the two opposing

forces: one protecting life and the other destroying it. I should remind

you that the Buddha did not just have concern for human beings or animals

alone, He talked about ALL sentient beings. To put it in more modern terms;

the Buddha was concerned about the whole eco-system which includes all

animate or inanimate existence. At the 14th General Conference of the World

Fellowship of Buddhists sixty Buddhist scholars, monks and laity proclaimed

&quot;A Green Buddhist Declaration&quot; showing their concern about the

rapid destruction of our environment in the name of development and progress.</P>



<P>On the path to enlightenment a follower usually starts with sila or

code of ethics. To follow the Buddha footsteps we have to apply these ethical

principles in our everyday life. If we appeal to others to respect our

freedom and rights, we must respect theirs. If we have a look around we

can see discrimination, social injustice ...which are still practised in

many parts of the world. Even in many institutionalised religions, people

are still coerced into accepting the absolute order from above. Bertrand

Russell in his key speech delivered at Battersea Town Hall, London in 1927

said:</P>



<P>We want to stand upon our two feet and look fair and square at the world-

its good facts its bad facts, its beauty and its ugliness; see the world

as it is and be not afraid of it. Conquer the World by intelligence and

not merely by being slavishly subdued by the terror that comes from it..

We ought to stand up and look the world frankly in the face. We ought to

make the best we can of the world and if it is not so good as we wish,

after all it will still be better than what these others have made of it

in all these ages. A good world needs knowledge, kindness and courage..

It does not need a regretful hankering after the past or a fettering of

the free intelligence by the words uttered long ago by ignorant men. It

needs a fearless outlook and a free intelligence.</P>



<P>As we have said, the Buddha extends compassion to all beings. He is

the greatest teacher ever of humankind and celestial creatures He is the

enlightened one, while all beings have the potential for enlightenment.

It is the delusion which clouds our perception. We are all suffering, defiled

and unable to transcend the cycle of birth and death. Liberation from this

cycle only comes when we know how to become the master of our existence.</P>



<P>Knowing the karmic effects of our actions, we know what existence has

in store for us. There is no punishment or reward meted out to us by some

God out there. What we are doing today will decide what we will become

in another plane of existence in innumerable universes. Our birth may take

place in different realms of existence. It is believed that there are other

realms of existence in which beings manifest themselves, according to their

moral or immoral karma. The Buddha's teachings are in tune with contemporary

thinkers which recognise the necessity and freedom: human beings are not

the play things in a hopelessly deterministic game, but they have full

freedom to choose a probable course of Karmic events: they may be tied

up endlessly by their own karmic actions, or they may mitigate and transform

their karma by being enlightened. (Tinh Tien, Buddhism is the Liberation

Path for Human Beings, in Buddhism in the New Century, Giao Diem, USA 1996,

p.49)</P>



<P>To celebrate Vesak Day in a significant way, we must remember that Buddhism

is a spiritual experimental religion. Praising the Lord Buddha is not good

enough. We should start contemplating deeply in order to be able to see

things as they are and then apply all the Buddhist precepts in our daily

life. We have to contribute positively to our own life, to the life of

our family and to society at large. We must refrain from harming not only

other human beings, but to all forms of life and the environment. For example

we have to refrain from needlessly cutting down trees, or polluting our

air and rivers (protect our ecosystem) or hunting just for pleasure. We

should choose the right livelihood (right thought, right speech, right

action...)This is the best way to respect freedom and equality of all sentient

beings.</P>



<P>With sadness we realise that a large number of people still do not enjoy

basic human rights in many parts of the world, Vietnam included. I just

want to quote a few simple words spoken by His Holiness Dalai Lama: Everyone

wants to be happy. And they have a right to be so. Nobody has more rights

than another to enjoy happiness. This is a deeply moving statement. We

have to widen our vision about the world and change the way we look at

other human beings. We have to look deeply into our inner world and try

to discard our prejudices, transform self and develop compassion towards

everyone and everything. Let everyone and everything enjoy happiness. In

my opinion this is the best way to celebrate Vesak Day.</P>



<P><i><b>May all sentient beings persevere in following the path to enlightenment.<BR>
May all beings develop love and compassion and may we all mitigate our karmic effects and transcend the cycle of death and rebirth. <BR>
We take refuge in the Lord Buddha Shakyamuni.</b></i></P>
