      <b><i><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">About the Author</font></i></b></p>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">Ajahn Jagaro was born John Cianciosi in 1948, in Italy,
      and migrated with his parents to Australia at the age of ten. After completing a Diploma
      in Applied Chemistry and working for a short time, he took leave of his home to travel in
      Asia. With no clear aim in mind, his travels eventually took him to a Buddhist monastery
      in Bangkok, where a casual interest in meditation developed into a decision to take
      ordination as a Buddhist monk in 1972.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">After a year spent in Bangkok and Southern Thailand, he
      travelled to the north-east, where he met his teacher, Venerable Ajahn Chah, the
      well-known forest meditation teacher, and spent the next ten years in and around Ajahn
      Chah's monastery, Wat Pah Pong, and its many branches.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1979, Ajahn Chah invited Venerable Jagaro to become the
      senior monk, or Abbot, at Wat Pah Nanachat, a monastery not far from Wat Pah Pong. Wat Pah
      Nanachat had some years previously been established by Ajahn Chah and Ajahn Sumedho (his
      senior Western disciple, who now lives in England, Abbot of Amaravati Buddhist Centre) as
      a centre for Westerners interested in training in the monastic lifestyle of the forest
      tradition. During his time at Wat Nanachat, Ajahn Jagaro gained invaluable experience in
      dealing with monastic administrative duties, in addition to developing a reputation in
      Thailand as a gifted teacher.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In February, 1982, he was invited to Perth, Western
      Australia, as resident monk for the Buddhist Society of Western Australia. Interest there
      was sufficient to see the establishment of Bodhinyana Forest Monastery in Serpentine, 60
      kms south of Perth, where he led a small community of Buddhist monks and nuns of varying
      nationalities and acted as mentor for the Buddhist Society of Western Australia up until
      1995. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1995, Ajahn Jagaro made the difficult decision to
      disrobe, expressing his gratitude for his contact with Ajahn Chah and all his Dhamma
      friends within the Buddhist Community.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>Buddhism and Vegetarianism</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">O</font>n a previous occasion when I gave a
    talk on Buddhism and vegetarianism there were some very strong reactions from some members
    of the audience. People who have strong reactions to talks are people who have very strong
    feelings about the topic, which means they have very strong views about the topic. This is
    a great danger, because as soon as we develop very strong, fixed views about anything, it
    tends to make us rather rigid. We develop a closed mind, which makes us over-react to
    anything that is said. If it's not in agreement with us it must be against us. That's all
    we see - black and white - and that is a great shame. The Buddha warned against attachment
    to views and opinions as one of the fundamental causes of suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We see this over and over again in every aspect of life.
    Most of the conflicts that we are involved in during our lives arise out of disagreement
    with regard to certain views about things. These conflicts and due to attachment to our
    views and our perceptions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, we need views, we cannot live without them. A
    view is the way we see something, the way we understand something, our preference with
    regard to the variety of choices available in regard to things. This is quite natural. As
    long as we think, perceive, or have been conditioned in a certain way, we will have views,
    and on some topics these may be very strong and fixed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vegetarianism is one such topic. This evening I will talk
    about the topic as a contemplation. It is not my intention to sit here and tell you what
    the final word on Buddhism and vegetarianism is. That is neither my intention nor the
    Buddhist way. My understanding comes from my experience, from my perspective, from my
    contemplation. You may agree or you may not; it doesn't matter as long as you reflect
    clearly on the matter and come to your own conclusions. I take a neutral position because
    I do not feel that this particular topic can be seen simply in terms of black and white. I
    take the Buddhist position as I understand it.</font></p>
    <font COLOR="#000080"><b>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Scriptural basis</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">L</font>et's begin with a fundamental
    question: Is it a prerequisite for a Buddhist to be a vegetarian according to the
    teachings of the Buddha, as far as we can assess? I would have to say, No, according to
    the Buddhist scriptures it is not a prerequisite for a person to be a vegetarian in order
    to be a Buddhist.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People say, &quot;Well how do you know what the Buddha
    taught, anyway?&quot; It's true. I don't know from personal experience; if I was there, I
    don't remember it. So what do we have to rely on? We have to rely on these scriptures that
    have been handed down through the centuries. As to whether we can trust these scriptures
    depends on whether we accept them as accurate recordings of the Buddha's teaching or not.
    In the Theravada tradition we have what we call the Pali Canon, the Buddhist scriptures.
    There are many volumes, the <i>Vinaya Pitaka</i>, the discipline for monks and nuns, the <i>Suttanta
    Pitaka</i>, which contains the discourses or teachings given by the Buddha, and finally
    the <i>Abhidhamma Pitaka</i>, which is the system of philosophy and psychology developed
    from the basic texts. Most scholars agree that the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the 'higher
    teaching', was developed by teachers of later periods from the basic texts of the <i>Suttas</i>
    as a system of analysis for easier explanation and for use in debate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So there are three collections of scriptures. My research
    is limited to the <i>Vinaya</i> and the <i>Suttas</i>, the books of discipline and the
    books of discourses. From my studies I have great confidence that what is presented in
    these scriptures accurately represents what the Buddha taught. However, I do not claim
    that every word in these scriptures is exactly the word of the Buddha. There have been
    some changes, some additions and some alterations through the ages, but the essence is
    there. In essence the texts are a very true and accurate record of what the Buddha taught.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">My basis for this reasoning is simply the fact that the
    people who passed on these teachings and checked them were disciples, monks and nuns who
    had tremendous respect for the Buddha, just as monks today have, and I don't think that
    many monks would dare to intentionally change the teachings of the Buddha. Very few monks
    would be prepared to do that. Any alterations that have taken place were simply an
    expedient means for making recitation more convenient. There may have been accidental
    alterations, but I do not think that the texts were corrupted intentionally, certainly not
    in any serious or major way.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is verified in particular with regard to the Books of
    Discipline, which deal with the monastic discipline. Through the ages Buddhism slowly
    spread from the Ganges Valley throughout India, moving south to Sri Lanka, across to Burma
    and Thailand, then north towards Tibet and eventually China. Over the centuries it began
    to fragment into various schools. Some of these schools flourished in different parts of
    India and more distant locations, and so had very little or no contact with each other.
    When we compare the Books of Discipline, however, there's remarkable similarity between
    these different schools. They are so similar that they must have originally come from the
    same source.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So there is good reason for confidence in what we call the
    Pali Canon and to accept that it does represent the teachings of the Buddha. In any case,
    this is the evidence we have to deal with, because there is no one here who can say,
    &quot;I heard the Buddha say differently.&quot; These scriptures are the most
    authoritative or the most definitive representation of the Buddha's teachings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we study these scriptures very carefully we will find
    that nowhere is there any injunction to either lay people or to monks with regard to
    vegetarianism. There is not a single mention of it as a Buddhist injunction on either the
    monks and nuns or lay people. If the Buddha had made vegetarianism a prerequisite it would
    have to be somewhere in the scriptures. Quite to the contrary, one does find a number of
    instances where the Buddha speaks about food, especially on the rules pertaining to the
    monks, indicating that, during the time of the Buddha, the monks did sometimes eat meat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you'll bear with me I would first like to present to
    you some of this historical evidence. In these scriptures, particularly in the Books of
    Discipline, there are many references to what monks are and are not allowed to do. A lot
    of these rules have to do with food; there are rules about all sorts of things pertaining
    to food, some of them very unusual. If the monks had to be vegetarian then these rules
    would seem to be completely useless or irrelevant.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For instance there is one rule which forbids monks from
    eating the meat of certain types of animals, such as horse, elephant, dog, snake, tiger,
    leopard and bear. There are about a dozen different types of meat specified by the Buddha
    which are not allowed for monks. That he made a rule that certain types of meat were not
    to be eaten by monks would indicate that other types of meat were allowable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is another rule: a monk was ill, and as he was quite
    sick a devout female disciple asked him if he had ever had this illness before and what
    did he take to cure it? It was some sort of stomach problem, and he said that he'd had it
    before and last time he had some meat broth which helped to relieve the symptoms. So this
    woman went off looking for meat to prepare a meat broth for the sick monk. However it was
    an <i>uposatha</i> (observance) day, so there was no meat available anywhere. It was a
    tradition in India not to slaughter animals on such days. Out of great devotion this lady
    decided that the monk could not be left to suffer, so she cut a piece of her own flesh and
    made a meat broth. She took it to the monk, offered it to him, and apparently he drank it
    and recovered. When the Buddha heard about this, he made a rule that monks are not allowed
    to eat human flesh. Thank goodness for that!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So here is another strange rule that would be completely
    pointless if there had been a stipulation that the monks never eat meat. There are many
    similar instances both in the Rules of Discipline and in the Discourses. When the Buddha
    heard a charge that Buddhist monks caused the killing of animals by eating meat, he stated
    that this was not so. He then declared three conditions under which monks were not to eat
    meat: if they have seen, heard or they suspect that the animal was killed specifically to
    feed them, then the monks should refuse to accept that food. At other times, when the
    monks go on almsround, they are supposed to look into their bowls and accept whatever is
    given with gratitude, without showing pleasure or displeasure. However, if a monk knows,
    has heard or suspects that the animal has been killed specifically to feed the monks, he
    should refuse to receive it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many more examples than I have given here,
    scattered throughout the scriptures, indicating that it was not a requirement that either
    the monks or the lay people be vegetarian.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, we can see that throughout the history of
    Buddhism there has not been one Buddhist country were vegetarianism was the common
    practice of the Buddhist people. This would indicate that it hasn't been the practice
    right from the very beginning. Although some Mahayana monks, in particular the Chinese,
    Vietnamese and some of the Japanese, are vegetarian, the majority of lay people are not.
    Historically, right up to the present day, Buddhist people in general haven't been
    strictly vegetarian. This would seem to support the conclusion drawn from an examination
    of the scriptures, that it has never been a prerequisite for people who want to be
    Buddhists to be vegetarian.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course it can be argued, and it often is argued, by
    vegetarian monks in particular, but also by lay people, that the scriptures were altered.
    They argue that the Buddha did teach vegetarianism, but those monks who wanted to eat meat
    went and changed every reference to it in all the texts. They didn't have a computer to
    just punch in 'reference to meat' and get a whole list. The scriptures were initially
    handed down by word of mouth and many monks were involved. No one had it on a disk so that
    it could be changed in half an hour. It would have been very difficult to change as there
    are many references to it throughout the scriptures. You could change it in one place but
    then it would be inconsistent with other references. It is highly unlikely that the monks
    could have achieved consistency in changing so many references throughout the scriptures,
    so I think the claim of corruption of the scriptures by meat-loving monks is a bit
    far-fetched. I think the scriptures are accurate. I think that the Buddha did not make it
    a prerequisite for people, nor do I think that it was laid down as a rule of training for
    monks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another point of contention arises over the Buddha
    teaching, as one of the training rules for everybody who wanted to be his disciple, that
    they are not to kill any living creature. The very first precept for a lay Buddhist is: '<i><b>Panatipata
    veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami</b></i>.' (I undertake the training rule of not killing
    any living creature.) This is a training for every Buddhist monk, nun, novice, postulant,
    layman and laywoman, which is absolutely fundamental to the training in harmlessness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There appears to be an inconsistency, it doesn't seem to
    add up, but this is simply due to not thinking clearly about the topic. Obviously the
    Buddha saw a great difference in these two trainings - the training of not killing and the
    training regarding diet. They operate at different levels.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was very pragmatic. When he laid down training
    rules, he laid down rules that people could keep, that they had a good likelihood of
    keeping. For instance, he did not lay down a training rule saying that you must not
    over-eat. The monks are supposed to be alms mendicants and he laid down a lot of rules
    about eating for monks - they are allowed to eat only in the morning, when they eat they
    are not supposed to make chomping or slurping sounds, they are not supposed to drop grains
    of rice, they are not supposed to scrape the bowl, they are not supposed to look around -
    yet he didn't make one rule about over-eating. You can really stuff yourself and not break
    a rule. You would think that the Lord Buddha would have made a rule about that. Why not,
    when he made all these other rules? It's up to the individual to train oneself to eat in
    moderation. It is something you take responsibility for and train yourself toward
    gradually, but it is not a rule to start with.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a big difference between eating meat and killing
    animals, although it can be argued that when we eat meat we indirectly support the killing
    of animals. There's something to that, and I'll go into it in greater detail later on.
    There is a big difference between the two, however, because the killing of animals refers
    to <i><b>intentionally</b></i> depriving an animal of life or <i><b>intentionally</b></i>
    causing or directly telling somebody else to kill an animal. That is what the first
    precept is about - the intention to kill an animal. That is the purpose behind the action.
    There is intention, there is purpose and there is the actualisation of that purpose in
    killing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you drove your car here this evening I'm sure that you
    killed something - on your windscreen there would have been a few smashed insects. When we
    drive from the monastery where I live in Serpentine to Perth, which is approximately 60
    kilometres, the windscreen gets covered with dead insects, especially in the mornings and
    evenings. I know when I get into the car and ask someone to drive me somewhere that some
    insects are going to die. I know that, but that is not my intention for getting into a car
    and being driven somewhere. I don't say, &quot;Let's go for a spin to see how many insects
    we can squash.&quot; If that was my intention then I would be killing, intentionally
    killing. But we don't do that. We get into a car to go from A to B for a purpose. Perhaps
    some beings get killed, but it's not our intention to kill them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is not killing - there is death but you are not
    creating the <i>kamma</i> of killing animals. This rule is the foundation of the Buddhist
    training in harmlessness: you refrain from intentionally killing living creatures.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When people eat meat what is their intention? How many
    people eat meat with the intention to kill cows, pigs and sheep? If their intention in
    eating is to kill more cows, that would be very close to killing. If you consider why
    people really eat meat you will see that it is for very different reasons. Why did people
    in more basic, rural societies, such as in northern Thailand where I lived, where most of
    the people were Buddhist, eat meat? They ate frogs, grasshoppers, red ants, ant larvae
    .... all sorts of things. Why? For protein, they had to survive, they had to have food and
    it's very hard to get food. What did a caveman eat? He ate whatever he could get. Due to
    the fundamental drive to survive he would eat whatever he could get. That has a lot to do
    with what we eat - the primary instinct of survival. It depends on what is available.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then there is the cultural influence, the way your tastes
    are conditioned by your upbringing. If you are accustomed to certain types of food, you
    find those kinds of food agreeable. That is why you buy them. That is the sort of food
    that you know how to cook. Why are most Australians non-vegetarian? They eat meat because
    that is what they are conditioned to eat. That is part of the conditioning of the
    Australian culture.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So when most people who are not vegetarians eat meat, it
    is not because they want to kill animals. It's just that that is what they have been
    conditioned to eat since childhood. It is part of their culture, that is what they know
    how to cook and that is what they know how to eat. It agrees with them, that is why they
    eat it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You might say it's ignorance. Well, most people are
    ignorant; most people have limited scope in their overall understanding of options and
    possibilities; most people live according to their conditioning. It doesn't have to be
    that way, but that is how it is for most people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is important to make this distinction. Eating meat is
    not the same as killing animals, because the intention is different. The Buddha laid down
    this rule, to refrain from intentionally killing any living creature, as the first step
    towards respecting life, both human and animal. It's just a start, not the end. And most
    people can't even do that. How many people in the world can truly refrain from killing
    living beings? We could get into an idealistic battle as to why everybody should be
    vegetarian, but you have to admit that the great majority of people on this planet cannot
    even keep to the level of not intentionally killing. If they could keep to that level,
    things would be a lot better. The Buddha had a pragmatic approach to things, so he said to
    at least start at this level.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus far I have given you reasons why Buddhism doesn't
    make vegetarianism compulsory. Does Buddhism then encourage the eating of meat? Nowhere in
    the scriptures do we read that the Buddha said, &quot;Eat more meat, it is good for
    you.&quot; Nowhere does it say to &quot;give the man meat.&quot; There is not a single
    reference to giving the monks more meat. The scriptures certainly do not encourage the
    eating of meat; there are no references to it, no suggestion of encouragement for it. What
    are we to make of this? Simply that each individual must consider this matter carefully,
    come to his or her own conclusions and take responsibility for them.</font></p>
    <font COLOR="#000080"><b>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ethical considerations</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">N</font>ow we must consider whether
    vegetarianism is compatible with the teachings of the Buddha. I would say wholeheartedly
    that it is compatible. Vegetarianism is a very beneficial practice for one who is
    developing two conditions which every Buddhist should be trying to develop: compassion and
    wisdom. That is what we endeavour to cultivate through the spiritual path. Compassion
    means feeling with, feeling for, being sensitive to the pain of others. The natural
    outcome of developing such compassion is that we do not want to kill, we do not want to
    hurt others.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through wisdom we begin to realise that not only do our
    actions have direct results, but also indirect results. This is the arising of
    understanding. I've often referred to one of the fundamental laws of nature, called
    Dependent Origination or Conditioned Arising - &quot;When this is, that comes to be.&quot;
    In other words, certain conditions bring about certain results. As we develop greater
    clarity of mind and greater awareness, we begin to see the relationship. Whatever we do
    has its consequences. The way we live gives rise to causes and results. We begin to see
    that this is a fundamental law of nature and we become a lot more aware of how we are
    living and the consequences of our actions. As we become more compassionate and wise we
    will start to direct our lives so that we become more harmless, or contribute less to the
    suffering and destruction in life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now let's consider this on a broader scale than just
    vegetarianism, because this topic of 'Buddhism and Vegetarianism' is far too narrow. We
    cannot discuss vegetarianism as if it was an isolated thing all by itself. There's much
    more to it; it involves the ecology, it involves every aspect of life. Perhaps 'Buddhism
    and Ecology' or 'Buddhism and Life' would be more fitting titles.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once we realise that how we live has its consequences,
    what effect will this have on how we live and how we regard what we are doing? Everything
    we do and say has its consequences, because we are part of a system. Every person sitting
    here is part of the system, the whole universe. There is one system and you are part of
    it. Everything you do has an effect on the universe.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You may think, &quot;What can I do to affect the movement
    of the planets and the galaxies?&quot; Perhaps very little, but according to the
    relationship of interdependence, everything you do affects everything else. If you can't
    see it as a whole you can certainly see it in this room. What you do here this evening
    will affect everybody else. What I do is affecting you. What we do affects the outside.
    Everything we do has its long range effect on everything else.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So when we eat meat, that has its consequences. What are
    the consequences? We are directly supporting an industry that is based on rearing animals,
    quite often under terrible conditions, for the sole purpose of slaughter. The meat can
    then be available in neatly wrapped little packages so that we can buy it can eat it. Our
    intention when we cook and eat meat is not to kill animals - I don't think anyone has that
    intention - however the fact remains that by the acts of buying, cooking and eating, we
    indirectly support the killing of the animal. It's not killing, but it is supporting.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, with that understanding, certain individuals may
    decide not to support killing. They won't want to be part of it; they will want to remove
    themselves from it. If there is one reason why a Buddhist should decide to be a
    vegetarian, it should be based on this perspective. There is only one good, valid reason,
    and that is compassion - not wanting to contribute to the suffering any more than one has
    to.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vegetarianism is a matter of individual choice and
    responsibility, not something that can be forced, but it is certainly praise-worthy and
    compatible with the Buddha's teaching. But does it stop there? Are you now pure? You've
    become vegetarian, but are you blameless? Are your hands clean?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let me tell you that as long as you are alive on this
    planet, as long as you are a member of this system, your hands will never be clean. It
    doesn't matter what you eat, you are always contributing to death and destruction,
    regardless of what you do. You can be a vegetarian, but you still contribute to
    destruction just because you are part of this system. You can't escape it. You are sitting
    on chairs, where do they come from? The chairs are on the carpet: where does the carpet
    come from? The electricity? Air-conditioning? The building, the motor car, the trains, the
    buses, where does all that come from? It's all interrelated. Everything is interrelated.
    We're always involved in the whole system, and as long as we live in this system we are
    always contributing. We make use of the air-conditioning, we make use of the electricity,
    which means that we are in a way supporting the building of dams, which entails the
    destruction of forests. There can be no doubt about it. You are wearing clothes, you are
    wearing shoes. If you don't wear leather shoes, you wear plastic shoes. Who makes the
    plastic shoes? The chemical companies, the ones that make napalm and poisons. You are
    supporting them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As I said, the training for a monk is to accept what one
    is given and not to ask for anything special. Most of the food we get is vegetarian, but
    not all. So I can be accused of contributing. I confess, my hands are not clean. Even if I
    am vegetarian, as I can be most of the time, my hands are still not clean. Where do you
    think the fruit and vegetables come from? How do those vegetable gardens get to be so free
    of trees and bushes? What happened to all the trees and bushes? Those huge fields of wheat
    and corn and the orchards - what happened to all the forests? - gone with the ploughing
    and spraying. We have nice vegetables, but for them to be nice vegetables you've got to do
    something about the insects.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On an individual basis, if you really are compassionate,
    if you really are wise, you can do as much as you can to minimise the damage. But when you
    consider that there are some six billion people on this planet, that's a lot of people to
    feed and clothe, so there has got to be a lot of destruction, either directly or
    indirectly. Life is like that.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What I am saying is not fatalistic. It is simply making us
    aware of reality. Within this reality we all can and should consider carefully what we are
    doing, how we are living and what we are consuming. How much are we contributing to death
    and destruction? It's not just a matter of vegetarianism. That is praise-worthy if done
    properly, and, as I said, compatible with the teachings of the Buddha, but there's more to
    it than that - much more.</font></p>
    <font COLOR="#000080"><b>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Treading lightly</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">E</font>ven if one isn't vegetarian there's
    a lot to do. Nowadays we are beginning to understand this. We cannot continue to consume
    more and more, demand more and more, want more and more of everything and expect that this
    limited planet with its limited resources can supply it for us. One of the fundamental
    teachings of Buddhism is to be contented with little. It doesn't mean starving yourself,
    it's just a matter of being contented, of not being continually caught in the obsession to
    get more, which is basically the present-day consumer society syndrome, isn't it? Nearly
    all of us in Western society are suffering from it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have an American student who complains because there is
    such a limited range of food here in Australia. We've only got three kinds of this type of
    chocolate, she says, whereas in America they have twenty kinds. Twenty kinds of chocolate,
    one hundred and twenty kinds of ice-cream to choose from - a marvellous achievement for
    the human race, the apex of human civilisation. This is consumerism, where the word is
    'more, more, more'. It's always more, with little or no emphasis on contentment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You can see where this is going to lead, this hungry ghost
    syndrome of forever wanting more, of never being satisfied. It's going to destroy the
    whole planet. The planet is limited and the consequences are very far reaching. One hungry
    ghost is not so bad, but when you start getting millions of them, this wanting more and
    more is going to consume the whole world. It already is consuming the world at an alarming
    rate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was pointing to a very fundamental principle:
    craving is the source of the problem and it can never be satisfied by feeding it.
    Contentment, being satisfied with few needs, is so important. Of course this had to be a
    personal judgement. The Buddha can't sit down and say, &quot;I allot twenty grams of
    cheese per person per day.&quot; That's ridiculous! The Buddha was an enlightened being
    and he wanted people to become enlightened, to become responsible. The Buddha doesn't take
    responsibility away from you, it is up to each individual. He offers guidelines which each
    one of us must use in considering our lives, reflecting on what we are doing, the
    consequences thereof, and taking responsibility. How much are we willing to give up? Each
    person must find his or her own limit. For some people that may be one car, for others two
    cars; some people may only want a bicycle - that is their assessment of their need.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The more we stress compassion and understanding of the
    consequences of actions, the more people will be able to make the right choices, to
    simplify, to develop more contentment and know moderation. This is much more important
    than just vegetarianism. Vegetarianism is just one factor, just one aspect of the whole
    picture. The whole is much greater because it deals with how much we consume, even of
    fruit and vegetables, clothing, shoes, power, air, fuel, everything - because all
    consumption brings about destruction.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the Buddhist way of life: beginning to cultivate
    compassion and understanding, and from there beginning to redirect our lives by making the
    right choices. It's up to each individual to decide how far he can go, but the direction
    is toward trying to tread as lightly as possible on the planet, so that our lives won't be
    the cause of so much destruction.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is a personal thing. It does no good going around
    pointing fingers at people and demanding that they stop: &quot;You'd better stop using
    bleached toilet paper otherwise we'll imprison you.&quot; If society reaches that point,
    then banning such a product may be a good thing, but you can't do so until sufficient
    people appreciate and understand the need for it. The main thrust of Buddhism is always to
    encourage compassion and understanding. From there, everything else will come about in
    accordance with the individual's response and sense of personal responsibility.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You can see why I feel quite confident that the Buddha
    would not have made vegetarianism compulsory, because that is not the way he would
    approach it. His main concern would be to set a fundamental standard, but even that would
    be voluntary. It is then up to you whether you follow it or not. It is up to the
    individual, through the teaching, to become more compassionate and wise, to take
    responsibility for one's life. Whether you make a rule or not, what matters is whether
    people are going to keep it. The Buddha's approach, the main thrust of his teaching, was
    to try to encourage more understanding and compassion, so that the individual would make
    the appropriate choices - not only vegetarianism, but about many other things.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vegetarianism is a very noble choice, but that choice
    should be made from the right stand point - out of compassion and understanding. Having
    made such a choice, don't pollute it with aversion for those who are not vegetarian. The
    goodness generated by such a choice then becomes corrupted, and in some ways you will be
    worse than non-vegetarians. We make our choice out of compassion. If we are in a position
    to explain, we explain it to others according to reason and logic, not by being critical
    of them for not being vegetarian.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I respect people who are vegetarian. They are acting very
    nobly; it is a gesture of renunciation. It is a small thing but noble, and very much in
    keeping with the Buddha's teaching of compassion and understanding. But don't stop there.
    Even if you are not vegetarian don't think there is nothing else you can do. There's a lot
    to be done in every area of life, in the way we speak, in the way we act, in everything.
    Be one who treads lightly, be one who doesn't add unnecessarily to the suffering of
    humanity and all other sentient beings on this planet. Once we have the intention to at
    least try, to move in the right direction, we are good disciples of the Buddha. Each
    person has to walk at his or her own pace.</font></p>
