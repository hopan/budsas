        <hr width="25%" noshade color="#000000" align="center">
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Ajaan Geoff, thirty years ago you
        were a student at Oberlin College.&nbsp; Now you're the abbot of a
        Buddhist monastery near San Diego.&nbsp; Could you tell us a little
        about how you got from there to here?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The route was a lot less roundabout than
        you might think.&nbsp; Like many college students, I was obsessed with
        deciding what to do with my life.&nbsp; Business, government,
        academia:&nbsp; I couldn't see myself finding happiness in any of
        them.&nbsp; I didn't want to lie on my deathbed, looking back at a life
        frittered away.&nbsp; Fortunately, in my sophomore year, I was
        introduced to Buddhist meditation, and I took to it like a duck to
        water.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">After graduation I decided to take a
        break in my education to go teach in Thailand—to get some perspective
        on my life, and maybe find a good meditation teacher.&nbsp; While I was
        there I met Ajaan Fuang, perhaps the first truly happy person I had ever
        met.&nbsp; He embodied the dharma [the teachings of the Buddha] in a way
        that I found appealing: wise, down-to-earth, no-nonsense, and with a sly
        sense of humor.&nbsp; Whatever happiness and wisdom he had, he told me,
        was due entirely to the training.&nbsp; That was when I realized I had
        found something to which I could devote my entire life.&nbsp; So I
        ordained to train with him, and I've never regretted my choice.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">Ajaan Fuang trained you as a
        meditation monk, but for the past several years you've also been
        translating and explaining the Pali sutta(s)[the early Buddhist&nbsp;
        texts].&nbsp; How do you find that studying the suttas helps with
        meditation?</font></em></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha in the suttas asks all the
        right questions.&nbsp; We all know that what we see is shaped by the
        views we bring to things, but we're often not aware of the extent to
        which our views are shaped by the questions we ask ourselves.&nbsp; The
        Buddha had the good sense to see that some questions are skillful—they
        really do point you to freedom, to the total cessation of suffering—while
        others are unskillful: they take you to a dead end, tie you up in knots,
        and leave you there.&nbsp; The suttas are helpful in showing how to
        avoid getting involved in unskillful questioning.&nbsp; If you listen
        carefully to their advice and take it to heart, you find that it really
        opens your eyes to how you approach meditation and life in general.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>There are currents in modern
        dharma teaching that de-emphasize the importance of the historical
        discourses.&nbsp; One might say, for example, “Don't we often hear
        that the Buddha said not to believe texts and traditions?”</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, he didn't say to reject them out
        of hand, either.&nbsp; Have you ever noticed how American dharma is like
        the game of Telephone?&nbsp; Things get passed on from person to person,
        from one generation of teachers to the next, until the message gets
        garbled beyond recognition.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I once received a postcard on which the
        sender had rubber-stamped the message, “‘Don't believe anything
        outside your own sense of right and wrong.'—The Buddha.”&nbsp; That
        was apparently meant to be a quote from the Kalama Sutta, but when you
        actually read the sutta, you find that it says something much more
        sophisticated than that:&nbsp; You don't believe something just because
        it's handed down in the texts or taught by your teachers, but you don't
        accept it just because it seems logical or fits in with your
        preferences, either.&nbsp; You have to put it to the test, check it in
        terms of actual cause and effect.&nbsp; If you then find that it leads
        to harm and is criticized by wise people, you stop doing it.&nbsp; If
        it's beneficial and praised by wise people, you stick with it.&nbsp;
        Notice, though, that you don't go solely by your own perception of
        things.&nbsp; You look for wise people and check your perceptions
        against theirs.&nbsp; That way you make sure you're not simply siding
        with your own preconceived notions.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>And so the suttas can serve
        as kalyana mitta(s), or “wise friends?”</strong></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no real substitute for spending
        time in close contact with a really wise person, but the suttas can
        often be the next best thing—especially in a country like ours where
        wise people, in the Buddhist sense of the term, are so few and far
        between.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>You mentioned that the suttas
        label certain questions as unskillful.&nbsp; Some of these may be fairly
        obscure philosophical issues that no longer interest anyone, but can you
        point to any that are relevant to meditators at present?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The big one is, “Who am I?”&nbsp;
        There are dharma books telling us that the purpose of meditation is to
        answer this question, and a lot of people come to meditation assuming
        that that's what it's all about.&nbsp; But the suttas list it as a
        fruitless line of inquiry.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Why is that?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Good question (laughs).&nbsp; As far as
        I can see, the response is this:&nbsp; What sort of experience would
        give you an answer to that question?&nbsp; Can you imagine any answer to
        that question that would put an end to suffering?&nbsp; It's easier to
        be skillful in any given situation when you don't saddle yourself with
        set ideas about who you are.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Might the anatta doctrine be
        considered the Buddha's answer to the question, “Who am I?”?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">No.&nbsp; It's his answer to the
        question, “What is skillful?”&nbsp; Is self-identification
        skillful?&nbsp; Up to a point, yes.&nbsp; In the areas where you need a
        healthy, coherent sense of self in order to act responsibly, it's
        skillful to maintain that sense of coherence.&nbsp; But eventually, as
        responsible behavior becomes second nature and you develop more
        sensitivity, you see that self-identification, even of the most refined
        sort, is a form of clinging.&nbsp; It's a burden.&nbsp; So the only
        skillful thing is to let it go.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>How would you respond to those
        who say they get a sense of oneness with the universe when they
        meditate, that they're interconnected to all things, and that it
        relieves a lot of suffering?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">How stable is that feeling of
        oneness?&nbsp; When you feel like you've come to the stable ground of
        being from which all things emanate, the suttas ask you to question
        whether you're simply reading that feeling into your experience.&nbsp;
        If the ground of being were really stable, how would it give rise to the
        unstable world we live in?&nbsp; So whatever it is you're experiencing—it
        may be one of the formless states—it's not the ultimate answer to
        suffering.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">On an affective level, a sense of
        connectedness may relieve the pain of isolation, but when you look
        deeper, you have to agree with the Buddha that interconnectedness and
        interdependence lie at the essence of suffering.&nbsp; Take the weather,
        for instance.&nbsp; Last summer we had wonderful, balmy weather in San
        Diego—none of the oppressive heat that usually hits in August—and
        yet the same weather pattern brought virtually non-stop rain to southern
        Alaska, drought to the Northeast, and killer hurricanes with coffins
        floating out of their graves in North Carolina.&nbsp; Are we supposed to
        find happiness in identifying with a world like this?&nbsp; The suttas
        are often characterized as pessimistic in advocating release from
        samsara, but that's nothing compared to the pessimism inherent in the
        idea that staying interconnected is our only hope for happiness.Yet so
        many people say the desire for release is selfish.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Which makes me wonder if they understand
        how we can be most helpful to one another.&nbsp; If the path to release
        involved being harmful and cold-hearted, you could say it was selfish;
        but here it involves developing generosity, kindness, morality, all the
        honorable qualities of the mind.&nbsp; What's selfish about that?&nbsp;
        Everyone around you benefits when you can abandon your greed, anger, and
        delusion.&nbsp; Look at the impact that Ajaan Mun's quest for release
        has had for the last several decades in Thailand, and now it's spreading
        throughout the world.&nbsp; We'd be much better off if we encouraged one
        another to find true release so that those who find it first can show
        the way to anyone else who's interested.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>And the way to that release
        starts with the question, “What is skillful?”</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right.&nbsp; It's the first question the
        Buddha recommends that you ask when you visit a teacher.&nbsp; And you
        can trace this question throughout the suttas, from the most basic
        levels on up.&nbsp; There is a wonderful passage where the Buddha is
        teaching Rahula, his seven-year-old son [Ambalannhika Rahulovada Sutta,
        M 61].&nbsp; He starts out by stressing the importance of being truthful—implying
        that if you want to find the truth, you first have to be truthful
        yourself—and then he talks about using your actions as a mirror.&nbsp;
        Before you do anything, ask yourself: “Is what I intend to do here
        skillful or unskillful?&nbsp; Will it lead to well-being or harm?”&nbsp;
        If it looks harmful, you don't do it.&nbsp; If it looks okay, you go
        ahead and give it a try.&nbsp; While you're doing it, though, you ask
        yourself the same questions.&nbsp; If it turns out&nbsp; that it's
        causing harm, you stop.&nbsp; If not, you continue with it.&nbsp; Then
        after you've done it, you ask the same questions—“Did it bring about
        well-being or harm?”—and if you see that what originally looked okay
        actually ended up being harmful, you talk it over with someone else on
        the path and resolve never to make that mistake again.&nbsp; If it
        wasn't harmful, you can take joy in knowing that you're on the right
        track.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>So the Buddha is giving basic
        lessons in how to learn from your mistakes.</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, but if you look carefully, you'll
        see that these questions contain the seeds for some of his most
        important teachings:&nbsp; the role of intention in our actions; the way
        causality works—with actions giving immediate results along with
        long-term results; and even the four noble truths: the idea that
        suffering is caused by past and present actions, and that if we're
        observant we can find how to act more and more skillfully to a point of
        total freedom.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>And how would you apply this to
        meditation?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It starts with your life.&nbsp; We all
        know that meditation involves disentangling yourself from the narratives
        of your life so that you can look directly at what you're doing in the
        present.&nbsp; Now, some narratives are easier to disentangle than
        others.&nbsp; If you're acting in unskillful ways in daily life—lying,
        having illicit sex, taking intoxicants—you'll find that you're
        creating some pretty sticky narratives, all coated with denial and
        regret.&nbsp; So you apply the Buddha's line of questioning to your
        day-to-day life in order to clean up your act and provide yourself with
        new narratives that are easier to let go.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the same time, in doing this, you're
        developing the precise skills you'll need on the meditation
        cushion.&nbsp; Getting into the present moment is a skill, and it
        requires the same questioning attitude: observing what the mind is
        doing, seeing what works, what doesn't work, and making adjustments
        where needed.&nbsp; Once you get into the present moment, you use the
        same line of questioning to investigate the present, taking it apart in
        terms of cause and effect: present action, past action, present
        results.&nbsp; Once you've taken apart every mental state that clouds
        the brightness of your awareness, you then turn the same questions on
        that bright awareness itself, until there's nothing left to question or
        take apart any further—not even the act of questioning itself.&nbsp;
        That's where liberation opens up.&nbsp; So these simple questions can
        take you all the way to the end of the practice.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Was this how you were taught
        meditation in Thailand?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes.&nbsp; The one piece of advice Ajaan
        Fuang stressed more than any other was, “Be observant.”&nbsp; In
        other words, he didn't want me simply to follow a method blindly without
        monitoring how it was working out.&nbsp; He handed me Ajaan Lee's seven
        steps on breath meditation and told me to play with them—not in a
        desultory way, but the way Michael Jordan plays basketball:&nbsp;
        experimenting, using your ingenuity, so that it becomes a skill.&nbsp;
        How else can you expect to gain insight into the patterns of cause and
        effect within the mind unless you play with them?</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Are there any other questions
        from the suttas that strike you as particularly relevant to the American
        dharma scene?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Two jump immediately to mind.&nbsp; One
        has to do with evaluating teachers.&nbsp; The suttas recommend that a
        student look carefully at a person's whole life before accepting him or
        her as a teacher:&nbsp; Does this person embody the precepts?&nbsp; Can
        you detect any overt passion, aversion, or delusion in what this person
        says or does?&nbsp; Only if someone can pass these tests should you
        accept him or her as a teacher.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This calls into question an attitude
        that's becoming increasingly prevalent here in the US.&nbsp; A teacher
        once said, not too long ago, “As long as a teacher points at the truth
        with one hand, it doesn't matter what he or she does with the other
        hand.”&nbsp; Now, is the dharma something you can point to with only
        one hand?&nbsp; Can the other hand ever really be invisible?&nbsp;
        There's a real drive at the moment to turn out teachers to fill the
        demand for retreat leaders, but if they feel they can afford a
        one-handed attitude, we'll end up with teachers who are little more than
        mindfulness technicians or yogi-herders:&nbsp; people whose job is to
        get students safely through the retreat experience, but whose personal
        life may be teaching an entirely separate lesson.&nbsp; Is that what we
        want?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If it is, we are setting people up for
        trouble.&nbsp; So far the mindfulness community has avoided many of the
        scandals that have ravaged other American Buddhist communities, largely
        because it hasn't been a community.&nbsp; It's more a far-flung network
        of retreat clientele.&nbsp; The teachers' personal lives haven't had
        that much direct bearing on the lives of the students.&nbsp; But now
        local communities are beginning to develop, where students and teachers
        have close, long-term contact with one another.&nbsp; Can we imagine
        that what each teacher does with that other hand is<b> </b>not<b> </b>going
        to have an impact on the students' lives and their respect for the
        dharma?&nbsp; If we don't start now to rely more on the suttas' method
        for evaluating teachers, we'll have to start reinventing the dharma
        wheel after people get hurt, which would be a great shame.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>And the other question?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Renunciation.&nbsp; What do we have to
        give up if we want true happiness?&nbsp; Do we have unlimited time and
        energy to pursue an unlimited number of goals?&nbsp; Or do we need to
        sacrifice some of the good things in life in order to gain the most
        valuable form of happiness?&nbsp; This is a huge blind spot in American
        Buddhism.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, just out of curiosity, I went
        through a pile of Western dharma books and magazines, looking up the
        topic of renunciation.&nbsp; Most of them didn't even mention it.&nbsp;
        From the few that did, I learned that renunciation means, one, giving up
        unhealthy relationships; two, abandoning your controlling mindset; and
        three, dropping your fear of the unknown.&nbsp; Now, we don't need the
        Buddha to tell us those things.&nbsp; We can learn the first lesson from
        our parents, and the other two from a good therapist.&nbsp; But the
        Buddha recommended giving up a lot of things that most well-meaning
        parents and therapists would tell their children and patients to hold
        onto tightly.&nbsp; And yet you don't see any mention of this in
        American dharma.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Is that because Americans tend to
        live more comfortable lifestyles?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not necessarily.&nbsp; Modern mass
        culture, whether Asian or American, is a lot more indulgent than
        traditional culture, but that may be because it's a lot more frenetic
        and stressed out as well.&nbsp; The Buddha himself said that, when he
        was starting out on the path of practice, his heart didn't leap up at
        the idea of renunciation.&nbsp; Nobody wants to hear that true happiness
        involves giving up the things we like, but at least in Asia there are
        dharma masters who, through their words and actions, keep pumping that
        lesson into the culture.&nbsp; So it's always there for honest, mature,
        reflective people to hear.&nbsp; But here in the West, the dharma has
        been so shaped by the marketplace that the lesson is very seldom
        modeled.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Last year <b>Tricycle</b> printed an
        article bemoaning how the dharma is being used to sell mass-market
        commodities, but a deeper problem is that the dharma has become a
        commodity itself.&nbsp; I was in a bookstore recently with a student,
        and as we looked at the many shelves filled with books on Buddhism, he
        asked me, “Do you get the impression that these books were written to
        make money?”&nbsp; How can you expect to learn the hard lessons of
        renunciation from a book that had to get past marketing directors and
        sales reps?&nbsp; And given the financial needs of most teachers, how
        can you expect even well-meaning teachers not to shape their message to
        conform with what people<b> want </b>to hear, as opposed to what they <b>should</b>
        hear?</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>You've written on what you call
        the “economy of gifts,” in which the dharma can be offered freely
        with no strings attached.&nbsp; How do you think such an economy could
        be implemented here in America?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's a long, uphill process, but yes, it
        can happen.&nbsp; You have to start small—a few good monasteries here
        and there, a few dana-based organizations such as the Dhamma Dana
        Publication Fund and now the Dharma Seed Tape Library and eventually
        people will catch on to what a good thing it is.&nbsp; Of course, the
        fact that dharma is free doesn't necessarily guarantee that it's going
        to be top-quality, but at least it hasn't been filtered through the sort
        of bottom-line concerns that we needlessly take for granted.&nbsp; It's
        only when we appreciate the need to have the bottom line totally out of
        the picture that American dharma will have a chance to mature.&nbsp;
        Which makes me wonder if Dana-based dharma will always be something of a
        fringe phenomenon in our country.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>From our discussion so far, you
        seem to see the Pali suttas as offering not only right questions, but
        also right answers.</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The right answers are the skillful
        choices you make in your life as you pursue the right questions.&nbsp; I
        think it was Thomas Pynchon who said, “As long as they can get you to
        ask the wrong questions, they don't have to worry about the answers.”&nbsp;
        There should be a corollary to that:&nbsp; As long as you honestly stick
        to the right questions, you're sure to arrive at answers that will make
        a difference.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Of course, many people in our
        society are uncomfortable with the notion of right and wrong--especially
        in the area of religion.</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I don't think it's so much that they are
        uncomfortable with the notion of right and wrong.&nbsp; It's just that
        they've shifted their reference points.&nbsp; Being judgmental is now
        wrong; being non-judgmental is right.&nbsp; This, I think, comes from
        two factors.&nbsp; One is that we're tired of fervid monotheists who
        demonize anyone who differs from their view of The One True Way.&nbsp;
        We've seen the harm that comes from sectarian religious strife, and it's
        obviously pointless.&nbsp; So we want to avoid it at all costs.&nbsp;
        The other factor is that we ourselves have been subject to evaluation
        all of our lives, some of it pretty unfair—in school, at work, in our
        relationships—so when we come to retreats we want respite.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This becomes a problem, though, when
        people confuse being judgmental with the act of exercising
        judgment.&nbsp; And again, the difference is a question of skill.&nbsp;
        Being judgmental—hypercritical, quick to dismiss the opinions of
        others—is obviously unskillful.&nbsp; But in our rush not to be
        judgmental, we can't abandon our critical abilities, our powers of
        judgment.&nbsp; We have to learn how to use them skillfully.&nbsp; It's
        all very fine not to pass judgment when you're on the sidelines of an
        issue and don't want to get involved.&nbsp; But here we're all out on
        the playing field, facing aging, illness, and death.&nbsp; Our skill in
        exercising judgment is going to make all the difference in whether we
        win or lose.&nbsp; The team we're facing has never been taught to be
        uncritical.&nbsp; They play hard, and they play for keeps</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha himself was quite critical of
        teachers who wasted their time—and that of their students—by asking
        the wrong questions.&nbsp; He was especially critical of those who
        misunderstood the nature of karma, because how we comprehend the power
        of our actions is what will make all the difference in how skillfully we
        choose to think and act.&nbsp; So refraining from judgment is not the
        answer to the question of how we face the differing teachings we find
        available.&nbsp; In fact, a knee-jerk nonjudgmental stance can often be
        a very unskillful way of passing judgment.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>How so?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's a refusal to take differences
        seriously, and that totally short-circuits any attempt to develop
        skill.&nbsp; You often find this associated with a
        lowest-common-denominator approach to the truth:&nbsp; the assumption
        that whatever the major traditions of the world hold in common must be
        true, while their differences are only cultural trappings.&nbsp; But
        that's assuming they're all asking the same questions, or that the only
        important questions are the ones they all ask.&nbsp; Where does that
        leave people who think outside the box?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I've seen some elaborate attempts to
        create a perennial philosophy from the common ground of the world's
        great traditions, but they center on the question, “Who am I?”&nbsp;
        That, they tell us, is the question at the heart of everyone's spiritual
        quest.&nbsp; But the training I got from Ajaan Fuang taught me to
        question the assumption that that's a fruitful line of inquiry.&nbsp;
        Does the fact that everybody else is asking it mean he was wrong?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another approach is to assume that all
        traditions take you to the same place, but that they've found different
        skillful ways of doing it—the old “many paths lead to the top of the
        mountain” idea.&nbsp; But the reports we get from people who have been
        up this mountain say that it has plenty of wrong turns, false summits,
        and sudden drop-offs.&nbsp; One tradition will say, “When you reach
        this point, turn left.”&nbsp; Another will say, “If you turn left at
        that point you'll get stuck at a dead-end.”&nbsp; If we plan to stay
        on the valley floor, it's okay for us to stay out of the argument.&nbsp;
        But can we claim some sort of higher moral ground for not getting
        involved in the fray?&nbsp; Do we have more comprehensive maps of the
        mountain showing that dangers are imaginary, and that left turns and
        right turns are all okay?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Or suppose that one tradition says, “The
        summit looks like this.”&nbsp; Another says, “No, that's a false
        summit.&nbsp; The real one looks like this.”&nbsp; The first one
        responds, “No, you're at the false summit.”&nbsp; Do we know the
        limitations of language better than they do, so that we can dismiss
        their differences as purely linguistic?&nbsp; If we want to go up the
        mountain, we have to choose one guide or the other—or maybe a third
        guide, if we decide that the first two were both on the wrong path.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>So how would you choose?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One, take a good look at the
        teachers.&nbsp; If people are skilled mountaineers, they should have no
        trouble negotiating the valley.&nbsp; Can they get around without
        injuring themselves or others?&nbsp; Has their experience of the summit
        been so overwhelming that they're willing to sacrifice personal comfort
        so that others can get there as well?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Two, look at the tradition.&nbsp; What
        kinds of questions does it focus on?&nbsp; What kinds does it
        allow?&nbsp; What kinds does it not allow?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Does it
        encourage the tenacity and maturity needed to stick to a hard line of
        questioning?&nbsp; Does it foster the kind of ingenious, observant mind
        that would recognize a false path or figure out a way past an unexpected
        obstacle?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, take a good look at yourself.
        Are you up for the adventure?&nbsp; It may sound more than a little
        intimidating, but the Buddha asked of his students simply that they be
        honest enough to admit and learn from their mistakes, and sensible
        enough to give up a lesser happiness when they see that, by doing so,
        they'll gain a higher one. Are you up to that? If so, you've got what it
        takes.</font></p>
