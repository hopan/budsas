      Etymology </FONT></B><A HREF="#contents">[Contents]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">BODHISATTVA (Pali: Bodhisatta) is a being 
      who aspires for Bodhi or Enlightenment. The concept of bodhisattva 
      (meaning Buddha-to-be) is one of the most important concepts in Buddhism. 
      Etymologically the term can be separated into two parts,
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">bodhi</SPAN> and
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">sattva</SPAN>:
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">bodhi</SPAN> from the root
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">budh,</SPAN> to be awake, means 
      'awakening' or 'enlightenment' and <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">'</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">sattva'</SPAN> 
      derived from <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">sant,</SPAN> the present 
      participle of the root <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">as,</SPAN> 'to 
      be', means 'a being' or, literally, 'one who is', 'a sentient being.' 
      Hence, the term is taken to mean 'one whose essence is Enlightenment' or 
      'enlightened knowledge'. By implication it means a seeker after 
      enlightenment, a Buddha-to-be. There is also a suggestion that the Pali 
      term may be derived from <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">bodhi</SPAN> and
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">satta,</SPAN> (Skt.
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">sakta </SPAN>from
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">sanj</SPAN>) 'one who is attached to or 
      desires to gain enlightenment.'</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In original Pali Buddhism, the term 
      bodhisatta is used more or less exclusively to designate Gautama Buddha 
      prior to his enlightenment.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The concept of bodhisattva, along with 
      that of Buddha and of the <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">cakravartin</SPAN> 
      (world-ruler), was in vogue in India even before the appearance of Gautama 
      Buddha. When Prince Siddhartha, who later became Gautama Buddha, took 
      conception in the womb of Queen Maya, a seer predicted that Suddhodana's 
      future son would be either a world-ruler (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">cakravartin</SPAN>) 
      or a Buddha. Once, answering a question by a Brahmin, the Buddha himself 
      admitted that he is neither a god nor a <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">
      yakkha</SPAN>, but a Buddha, meaning thereby one of a succession of 
      Buddhas (A. II, p. 38).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">states that the teaching it contains is 
      not of a single Buddha but of all the Buddhas. The Amagandha Sutta is 
      similarly recorded as a discourse not of Gautama Buddha but of a past 
      Buddha named Kassapa (Sn. vv. 239 ff.).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">
      Sammasambodhi</SPAN> or Perfect Enlightenment is an impersonal universal 
      phenomenon occurring in a particular context both in time and in space and 
      a Buddha is thus a person who <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">
      re-discovers</SPAN> the Dhamma, which had become lost to the world and 
      proclaims it anew (Pug. p. 29). When Gautama Buddha appeared, however, he 
      himself as well as others used the term bodhisattva to indicate his career 
      from the time of his renunciation up to the time of his enlightenment. 
      Later, its use was extended to denote the period from Gautama's conception 
      to the enlightenment and, thereafter, to all the Buddhas from their 
      conception to Buddhahood. By applying the doctrine of
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">karma</SPAN> and of rebirth, which had 
      general acceptance even in pre-Buddhist India, the use of the term was 
      further extended to refer to the past lives not only of Gautama Buddha, 
      but also of those rare beings who aspire for Perfect Enlightenment.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The oldest Theravada tradition, as 
      contained, for example, in the Mahapadana Suttanta (D. ii, p. 1) gives 
      details of six Buddhas prior to Gautama. This discourse is attributed to 
      the Buddha himself, who gives the time, caste, family, length of life etc. 
      of these predecessors of his. In the Buddhavamsa, a later work belonging 
      to the Khuddaka Nikaya, the number increases to twenty-five with Gautama 
      Buddha as the last and this number remains fixed in Theravada tradition.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However, these enumerations by no means 
      imply that they are exhaustive. In the Mahapadana Suttanta the Buddha 
      starts the story of the six Buddhas merely by saying that ninety-one
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">kappas</SPAN> ago there was such and such 
      a Buddha, implying thereby that such beings were not limited in number. 
      From this it follows that, if the Buddhas are innumerable, the 
      bodhisattvas too must be innumerable.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When prince Siddhartha attained 
      Enlightenment he did so as a human being and lived and passed away as 
      such. As mentioned earlier, he himself admitted that he was a Buddha and 
      not a <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">deva</SPAN> or any such 
      supernatural being. He was only the discoverer of a lost teaching. His 
      greatness was that he found out what his contemporaries could not discover 
      at all or discovered only incompletely. He was a genius by birth who 
      achieved the highest state possible for man. Both intellectually and 
      morally he was a great man, a superman (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">mahapurisa</SPAN>). 
      In all the stages of his life, from conception onwards, something 
      extraordinary was seen in him.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><A NAME="What_is_a_Buddha"></A><B>
      <FONT SIZE="4">What is a Buddha?</FONT></B> <A HREF="#contents">[Contents]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In order to understand who a bodhisattva 
      is, it would be useful to explain briefly who a Buddha is. The 
      Buddha-concept in Theravada Buddhism is not a personality cult; neither is 
      the Buddha an object of glorified devotion. He is neither a theoretical 
      metaphysician nor a materialist. He is not a religious teacher who demands 
      unquestioned loyalty like a Messiah. He is a man who has perfected himself 
      by realising his 'self' to the highest degree possible for man. Only a man 
      can become a Buddha.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There may be other supernatural beings 
      inhabiting perhaps other planets in a given solar system. But they are not 
      capable of becoming fully enlightened unless there are planets similar to 
      our own where humans live. Even if such beings are leading happier lives 
      in their non-human spheres, still they are subject to the laws of change 
      and evolution (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">anicca</SPAN> or
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">vaya-dhamma</SPAN>), and as such not free 
      from birth and death and their attendant conflicts: hence they are not 
      released from <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">dukkha</SPAN>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A Buddha is a human being who has realised 
      that there is a happier state than this world of conditioned phenomena. 
      After a persevering mental struggle, he realises this unconditioned state 
      (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">asankhata</SPAN>) which is free from 
      duality. This freedom from duality implies the absence of any conflict (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">dukkha</SPAN>). 
      Therefore, this state is described as free from both sorrow and happiness 
      in the ordinary sense. It is the highest happiness (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">parama-sukha</SPAN>) 
      in the transcendental sense. As such it is not subject to change and is, 
      therefore, imperishable (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">avyaya</SPAN>) 
      and, therefore, permanent (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">dhuva</SPAN>). 
      It is this that is described as <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">Nirvana</SPAN>. 
      The Buddha is the person who realised this for the first time by his own 
      effort and proclaimed it to the world and hence, he is the Teacher (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">sattha</SPAN>). 
      Arhants are his disciples who follow his teaching. Bodhisattvas are those 
      who aspire to be fully enlightened ones or Buddhas, in preference to 
      merely becoming arhants.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Strictly speaking, the life of the Buddha 
      commenced only from the time of his enlightenment and his life before this 
      event was that of the bodhisattva. The Buddha himself used the term in 
      this sense and, it is more than probable that he occasionally referred to 
      his previous existences in his discourses to the people in order to 
      elucidate a particular doctrinal point. The Jatakas found in the
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">Sutta Pitaka</SPAN> such as the 
      Mahagovinda Sutta (D.&nbsp;II, pp.&nbsp;220&nbsp;ff.), the Mahasudassana Sutta (D.&nbsp;II, 
      pp.&nbsp;169&nbsp;ff.) and the Makhadeva Sutta (M. II, 74 ff.) etc. bear out this 
      view. Besides these, there seems to have been neither a Jataka collection 
      as such, nor the developed concept of the bodhisattva practising
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">paramitas</SPAN>, until a much later 
      period. Hence it would appear that the concept of the bodhisattva could be 
      divided into two parts, the original concept and the concept developed by 
      later Buddhists.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><A NAME="The_Second_Council"></A>
      <FONT SIZE="4"><B>The Second Council </B></FONT><A HREF="#contents">[Contents]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The division of Schools which began at the 
      second Council with the separation of the Mahasanghikas also made its 
      contribution to the development of the bodhisattva cult in later 
      literature as it marked the remote beginnings of Mahayana Buddhism.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The earliest use of the term bodhisattva 
      in literature seems to be when the Buddha refers to the days prior to his 
      enlightenment, in such contexts as &quot;in the days before my enlightenment&quot; 
      or &quot;when as yet I was only a bodhisattva&quot; (M.&nbsp;1, pp.&nbsp;114, 163; M.&nbsp;III, 
      p.&nbsp;119). Then, we have the Pali suttas referred to above, in which the 
      Buddha recounts a previous existence of his after the fashion of the later 
      Jataka stories. In the Buddhavamsa and in the later commentaries we see 
      how the concept has been extended not only in relation to Gautama's own 
      previous lives, but also as a general concept.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the Buddhavamsa which belongs to the 
      Khuddaka-nikaya of the Pali Canon, are found the life-stories of 
      twenty-five Buddhas of whom Gautama was the last. The names by which he 
      was known during his &quot;apprenticeship&quot; as a bodhisattva under each of the 
      twenty-four Buddhas, are also given. The chronicle describes the ten
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">paramitas</SPAN>, the eight conditions 
      necessary for the fulfillment of Buddhahood and the bodhisattva's decision 
      to postpone his entry into Nibbana. The other early work that describes 
      the bodhisattva's career is the Mahavastu (circa 1st or 2nd century BCE), 
      a Sanskrit work of the Mahasanghikas.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Since the Buddha's teaching is not 
      fatalistic but a course of mental training implying constant change until 
      the realisation of the unconditioned state of Nirvana, everyone has the 
      ability not merely to attain release but also to be authoritative teachers 
      (i.e., perfect Buddhas) as well. People with lesser ability may rest 
      content with mere arhantship or by becoming Pratyeka Buddhas.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Just as the Theravadins in course of time 
      began to lay greater stress on intellectual development than on religious 
      practice and realisation, those who advocated the bodhisattva ideal, as a 
      protest against the theoretical teaching of the Theravadins, went to the 
      other extreme of making it too practical by making the bodhisattva 
      somewhat like a saviour as exemplified by Avalokitesvara. Everyone tries 
      to be a Buddha to save others while passively believing in the saving 
      grace of the bodhisattvas. The pendulum swung from one extreme to the 
      other. Gautama Buddha's teaching of practical psychological ethics and 
      that of the avoidance of extremes was falling into oblivion.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In this evolution of thought the 
      altruistic motives which had become more or less mere intellectual 
      concepts among the Theravadins began to be greatly emphasised. As a 
      result, individual responsibility, on which the Buddha has laid great 
      stress, began to be overlooked. This tendency was developed to its 
      extreme, specially in the Far East, the results of which are to be seen in 
      the concept of Buddha Amitabha and of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara as 
      embodiments of compassion, an all-merciful divine father, whose sole aim 
      is to deliver all living beings from suffering.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This development was the natural result of 
      the intrinsic human nature which seeks for external protection and 
      consolation either in a male or a female divinity. It is an extension of 
      the father-mother concept and can be found in any developed religious 
      system. But Gautama Buddha firmly believed that Buddhas are only 
      pathfinders and teachers who, out of compassion for all living beings, 
      preach the doctrine of deliverance which has to be individually realised 
      by the wise. As such, the idea of salvation, except through the teaching 
      which every person has to follow individually, is foreign to him. This is 
      why the Buddha's teaching is regarded as too demanding in practice.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It was shown earlier how, by the 
      application of the doctrines of karma and rebirth, the life of the 
      bodhisattva was extended backwards to an innumerable number of existences. 
      The doctrine of karma implies that intellectual and moral greatness cannot 
      be produced without great effort. The necessary training and discipline 
      cannot be practised to perfection in a single lifetime. However, this did 
      not mean that enlightenment could not be obtained in a given time. On the 
      contrary, it was often asserted that such attainment is possible in this 
      very life (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">dittheva dhamme)</SPAN> 
      provided the devotee has the required qualification for arhantship and it 
      is the duty of every follower to attempt such achievement.</FONT></P>

      Bodhisattva Siddhartha</FONT></B> <A HREF="#contents">[Contents]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is of interest to see how the concept 
      of the bodhisattva has developed down the ages. The historical facts about 
      the Buddha are not difficult to determine. He began his life as 
      Siddhartha, son of a local rajah in north India in the 6th century BCE. At 
      first he quite enjoyed sensual pleasures but his attitude to such 
      self-indulgence was quite different from that of the ordinary man. Even 
      while enjoying pleasure, he intuitively felt that true and lasting 
      happiness could never be found by giving into each and every sensual 
      attraction. That would lead to moral and intellectual ruin, resulting in 
      becoming subject to more and more suffering. He was sure of this.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He got married and begot a son and still 
      he felt that that was not the ultimate fulfillment of human life. His 
      inner urge could not stop at anything short of full and complete 
      self-realisation, not only for his own private release, but also for the 
      good of humanity as a whole. This made him think. First he took to a 
      self-mortifying life, and when that failed, he, after a severe mental 
      struggle, achieved perfection by becoming a Buddha and then a teacher.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">During the rest of his career of 
      forty-five years, he gave his findings to the rest of humanity by oral 
      preaching (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">dhamma-desana</SPAN>), which 
      was the best method of disseminating knowledge in those days when writing 
      and reading of books were not common. There was nothing mystic about the 
      Buddha. He was a practical man, a psychiatrist who, after realising the 
      cause of man's troubles, was eager to convey the benefits of his 
      realisation to the rest of humanity, which he did quite successfully.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is no reason to doubt these simple 
      facts of history. But, in course of time, these facts became mixed up with 
      much legend and the Buddha's teaching became more or less a devotional 
      cult. Its rationalistic and practical nature began to go underground. The 
      higher life (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">brahmacariya</SPAN>) was 
      thought of as something impracticable and gradually Buddhism lost its 
      pragmatic character. Coupled with these tendencies there was the inborn 
      human need for a father-figure or a mother-figure to fall back upon. All 
      these led to the creation of a Buddhology.</FONT></P>

      <FONT SIZE="4"><B>The Paramitas</B></FONT> <A HREF="#contents">[Contents]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For the artist, literary as well as 
      plastic, the Buddha became an object of study and devotion. He was 
      analysed from every possible angle and various theories regarding his 
      career were evolved as for instance, when the original triple 
      classification (of the path of release) <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">
      sila</SPAN> (morality), <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">samadhi</SPAN> 
      (mind-culture) and <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">panna</SPAN> (wisdom) 
      was resolved into ten <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">paramitas</SPAN>. 
      The bodhisattva became a special kind of Godlike character, the like of 
      whom could hardly be an actuality. It was as a part of this development 
      that the main events of the bodhisattva's life were portrayed as being 
      accompanied by miracles.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A bodhisattva's career should start with 
      his making a resolution before a Buddha (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">abhinihara-karana</SPAN> 
      or <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">mslapranidhana</SPAN>) to become a 
      Buddha for the welfare and liberation of all creatures. In later 
      literature this <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">abhinihara</SPAN> is

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">All the <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">

      the time, the continent, the place of birth, his mother and the life span

      devas</SPAN>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The conception of the bodhisattva is 
      attended by various miracles. Both in Pali and Sanskrit sources an attempt 
      is made to show that at the actual moment of conception there is no 
      physical union of father and mother. With regard to the general life of a 
      bodhisattva as given in the books, the following account from the 
      Dictionary of Pali proper Names, G.P. Malalasekera (II,&nbsp;pp.&nbsp;3247), may be 
      quoted: &quot;On the day of his conception, the Bodhisattva's mother takes the 
      vows of fasting and celibacy at the conclusion of a great festival, and 
      when she has retired to rest she dreams that the Four Regent Gods take her 
      with her bed, bathe her in the Anotatta lake, clad her in divine garments 
      and place her in a golden palace surrounded by all kinds of luxury. As she 
      lies there the Bodhisattva in the form of a white elephant enters her womb 
      through her right side. The earth trembles and all the ten thousand 
      world-systems are filled with radiance. Immediately the four Regent Gods 
      assume guard over mother and child.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Throughout the period of pregnancy, which 
      lasts for ten months exactly, the mother remains free from ailment and 
      sees the child in her womb sitting cross-legged. At the end of the ten 
      months she gives birth to the child, standing in a grove, never indoors. 
      Suddhavasa brahmas, free from all passion, first receive the child in a 
      golden net and from them the Four Regent Gods take him on an antelope skin 
      and present him to his mother.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Though the bodhisattva is born free of 
      the mucous otherwise present at birth, two showers of water, one hot, the 
      other cold, fall from the sky and bathe mother and child. The child then 
      takes seven strides to the north, standing firmly on his feet, looks on 
      all sides, and seeing no one anywhere to equal him, announces his 
      supremacy over the whole world and the fact that this is his last birth. 
      Seven days after birth his mother dies. She dies because she must bear no 
      other being.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;The Bodhisattva's last birth is attended 
      by miracles. Soothsayers, being summoned, see on the child's body the 
      thirty-two marks of a Great Man (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">mahapurisa</SPAN>) 
      and declare that the child will become either a Cakkavatti or a Buddha. 
      His father, desiring that his child shall be a Cakkavatti, rather than a 
      Buddha, brings him up in great luxury, hiding from him all sin and 
      ugliness of the world. But the destiny of a Bodhisattva asserts itself, 
      and he becomes aware of the presence in the world of old age, disease, 
      death, and the freedom of mind to be found in the life of a recluse. Urged 
      by the desire to discover the cause of suffering in the world and the way 
      out of it, the Bodhisatta leaves the world on the day of his son's birth.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot; Having left the world, the Bodhisattva 
      practises the austerities, the period of such practices varying... On the 
      day the Bodhisattva attains to Buddhahood, he receives a meal of milk-rice 
      (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">payasa</SPAN>) from a woman and a gift 
      of <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">kusa</SPAN>-grass, generally from an
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">A</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">jivaka</SPAN>, 
      which he spreads under the Bodhi tree for his seat. The size of this seat 
      varies.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Before the enlightenment the Bodhisattva 
      has five great dreams: (i) that the world is his couch with the Himalay√&nbsp; 
      as his pillow, his left hand resting on the eastern sea, his right on the 
      western and his feet on the southern; (ii) that a blade of
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">tiriya</SPAN> (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">kusa</SPAN>) 
      grass, growing from his navel touches the clouds; (iii) that white worms 
      with black heads creep up from his feet, covering his knees; (iv) that 
      four birds of varied hues from the four quarters of the world fall at his 
      feet and become white; (v) that he walks to and fro on a heap of dung, by 
      which he remains unsoiled.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot; The next day the Bodhisattva sits 
      cross-legged on his seat facing the east, determined not to rise till he 
      has attained his goal. The gods of all the worlds assemble to do him 
      honour, but Mara comes with his mighty hosts and the gods flee. All day, 
      the fight continues between Mara and the Bodhisattva; the parami alone are 
      present to lend their aid to the Bodhisattva, and when the moment comes, 
      the goddess of the earth bears witness to his great sacrifices, while Mara 
      and his armies retire discomfited at the hour of sunset, the gods then 
      returning and singing a paean of victory.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Meanwhile the bodhisattva spends the 
      night in deep concentration; during the first watch he acquires knowledge 
      of past lives, during the second watch he develops the divine eye, while 
      during the last watch he ponders over and comprehends the Paticcasamuppada 
      doctrine. Backwards and forwards his mind travels over the chain of 
      causation and twelve times the earth trembles. With sunrise, omniscience 
      dawns on him, and he becomes the Supremely Awakened Buddha, uttering his
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">udana</SPAN> of victory while the whole 
      world rejoices with him.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><A NAME="Ideals"></A><B><FONT SIZE="4">The 
      Hinayana and Mahayana Ideals of Arahant and Bodhisattva</FONT></B>
      <A HREF="#contents">[Contents]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If the bodhisattva ideal of the Mahayana 
      be regarded as a protest against the arhant ideal of the Hinayana, there 
      is an important fact that needs clarification. This is the charge of 
      selfishness brought against the arhant. In this connection there is much 
      misunderstanding. The charge of selfishness has to be leveled not against 
      the arhants but against those Theravada monks who have portrayed 
      arhantship as a selfish ideal by their own behaviour and writings and 
      thereby made the higher religious life (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">brahmacariya</SPAN> 
      or <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">adhisila</SPAN>) appear as something 
      unpracticable.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha has clearly shown, both by 
      example and precept, the value of working for the welfare of others. The 
      spirit of his teaching is that one should enlighten oneself first and then 
      try to help those that can be helped as clearly expressed in the 
      well-known words of the Buddha when he addressed the first sixty arhants 
      to devote themselves to the service of others (Vin.&nbsp;1, pp.&nbsp;1920). He also 
      discouraged mere philosophy and speculation if it had no practical value.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But, quite in contrast to this noble 
      example of the Teacher, his later followers, instead of following by 
      practice the religious life he discovered and promulgated, began to make 
      mere academic study thereof as an end in itself. They became speculators 
      and philosophers, with very little practice. The Hinayana monk became more 
      or less a fossilised antique living in a world of his own.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The protest of the Mahayanist was against 
      this fossilisation and resultant indolence, and not against the arhant 
      ideal as such. The Buddha and arhants who helped mankind after they had 
      achieved their own release, have to be absolved of this charge of 
      selfishness. Yet, on the other hand, when the bodhisattva ideal was 
      advocated, the pendulum swung to the other extreme of mere bodhisattva 
      worship. The extreme intellectualism of the Hinayana was replaced by the 
      extreme emotionalism of developed Mahayana. The true spirit of the 
      Buddha's teaching lies in between, in a harmonious combination of 
      intellect and emotion, of head and heart, of theory and practice. That 
      would be the perfection of character as understood in Buddhism.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Pali Canon shows little interest 
      either in philosophical speculation or in the personality of the 
      bodhisattvas who are simply treated as &quot;larval forms&quot; of the Buddha. 
      Gautama himself would not have denied the possibility of becoming a Buddha 
      to anyone who is intellectually and morally mature. The significant fact 
      is that it became quite incredible that a superior being such as a Buddha 
      should suddenly be produced in a human family. He was not to be explained 
      as an incarnation. Hence it was quite logical and edifying to treat him as 
      a product of a long evolution of virtue, extending over several existences 
      of good deeds and noble aspirations, culminating in a being superior to 
      both gods and men.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Such a being remains in the Tusita heaven 
      in his penultimate existence biding the appropriate time to be born among 
      men. In this manner the Pali Canon, quite logically, recognises the 
      bodhisattva as a rare type of man appearing at a certain stage in time and 
      space. It leaves the matter at that. But later works like the
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">Buddhavamsa</SPAN>,
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">Cariyapitaka</SPAN>, the Pali 
      commentaries and the Mahayana sstras went on developing the bodhisattva 
      concept in such a way that he became an object of devotion and his human 
      nature gradually disappeared. The Mahayanists, in trying to remedy the 
      situation, ended up by making him a saviour.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">According to the Hinayana view, the 
      bodhisattva's penultimate life is spent in the Tusita heaven where he 
      enjoys the power and splendour of any Indian deity. But, as it did not 
      admit more than one Buddha at a time, there was evidently also only one 
      bodhisattva at a time in Tusita. In Mahayana, however, the multiplication 
      of not only celestial Buddhas but also of celestial bodhisattvas became 
      such a popular theme that as time went on their numbers became endless.</FONT></P>

      Bodhisattva Ideal and Everyday Life</FONT></B> <A HREF="#contents">[Contents]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The bodhisattva ideal, with its more 
      practical attitude to life, emphasises the value of family life. 
      Renunciation of household life never meant running away from life. Nirvana 
      was to be sought not outside <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">samsara</SPAN> 
      but within it. Gautama Buddha never recommended a 'life of aloofness or of 
      perennial seclusion.' He was not an escapist and wanted none to be so. 
      What he taught was that owing to ignorance (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">avijja</SPAN>), 
      people do not see things as they really are, and as such they are given to 
      their desires, which in turn prolong their suffering. His method was to 
      remove this veil of ignorance so that there would be light.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is the removal of mental illusion, 
      resulting in a psychological revolution, which makes one free from the 
      trammels of ordinary birth, disease and death. This cannot be achieved by 
      running away from life. The problem has to be solved by facing and 
      overcoming it, by changing the inner self, the mind where lies the cause 
      of the problem. It is a change of attitude and outlook, resulting from the 
      removal of ignorance. Such a person lives in the world, but is not of the 
      world.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If a person can become enlightened after 
      leading a family life, as prince Siddhartha himself did, he would 
      certainly be a more useful man than a sanctimonious ascetic living in the 
      jungle. And it is this kind of pure social life that the bodhisattva ideal 
      recommends. The ancient emphasis on inward life is given a new 
      application. The godly and efficient layman so envisaged is exemplified in 
      the figure of Vimalakirti, described in the
      <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">Vimalakirtinirdesa</SPAN>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This wealthy householder who was residing 
      at Vaisali, lived &quot;only for the sake of the necessary means of saving 
      creatures; abundantly rich, ever careful of the poor, pure in 
      self-discipline, obedient to all precepts, removing all anger by the 
      practice of patience, removing all sloth by the practice of diligence, 
      removing all distractions of mind by intent meditation, removing all 
      ignorance by fullness of wisdom; though he was but a simple layman, yet 
      observing the pure monastic discipline; though living at home, yet never 
      desirous of anything; though possessing a wife and children, always 
      exercising pure virtues; though surrounded by his family, holding aloof 
      from worldly pleasures; though using the jeweled ornaments of the world, 
      yet adorned with spiritual splendour; though eating and drinking, yet 
      enjoying the flavour of the rapture of meditation; though frequenting the 
      gambling house, yet leading the gamblers into the right path; though 
      coming in contact with heresy, yet never letting his true faith be 
      impaired; though having a profound knowledge of worldly learning, yet ever 
      finding pleasure in the things of the spirit as taught by the Buddha; 
      though profiting by all professions, yet far above being absorbed by them; 
      benefitting all beings, going wheresoever he pleases; ever teaching the 
      young and ignorant, when entering the hall of learning; manifesting to all 
      the error of passion when in the hours of debauchery; persuading all to 
      seek the higher things when at the shop of the wine-dealer; preaching the 
      law when among wealthy people; teaching the katriyas patience; removing 
      arrogance when among Brahmans; teaching justice to the great ministers;

      ladies of the court; persuading the masses to cherish virtue.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The bodhisattva concept had its influence 
      in the evolution of kingship in Sri Lanka, too. For some time between the 
      fourth and the eleventh centuries CE, the kings of Sri Lanka began to be 
      regarded not as ordinary human beings but as bodhisattvas. The 
      Jetavanarama slab-inscription of Mahinda IV and the Pritidanakamanapa 
      inscription of Nissanka Malla are instances where the rulers refer to 
      themselves as bodhisattvas. The Rajatarangani (p. 470 and the 
      Nikayasamgrahava, ed. Kumaranatunga, p.&nbsp;24) also bear evidence to this. 
      Parakramabahu II says that he would become a Buddha (Mahavamsa, ch.&nbsp;86, 
      stz.&nbsp;7).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Charles Eliot mentions that in China there 
      is a system of admission into the Order consisting of three stages: 
      admission (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">pabbajja</SPAN>), higher 
      ordination (upasampada) and the acceptance of the bodhisattva vows (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">shou-pu-sa-chich</SPAN>). 
      The burning of the candidate's head from three to eighteen places is said 
      to be an essential part of the ceremony of taking the bodhisattva-vows (<SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic">Hinduism

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The worship of bodhisattvas needed 
      iconographical representation and this need has been more than fulfilled 
      by the creation of an abundance of bodhisattva images, especially in those 
      countries that accepted Mahayana. Buddhist art became the richer through 
      these artistic creations. In the subsequent phases of the bodhisattva-cult 
      these deified personages were given many forms in order to symbolise their 
      multifarious functions. Sometimes they were given many heads and many arms 
      which practice has sometimes led to the creation of such figures as 
      exemplified by the thousand-armed Avalokitesvara from Japan.</FONT></P>

      publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's 
      discourses, standard reference works, as well as original contemporary 
      expositions of Buddhist thought and practice. These works present Buddhism 
      as it truly is -- a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for 
      the past 2500 years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first 
      arose.</FONT></P>
