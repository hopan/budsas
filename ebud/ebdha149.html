<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">L</font>ast month was Black history month
  and this month is women's history month. Why do we need all these months, when we have our
  history and we're all connected? We know that most of the people involved with writing and
  publishing history books have been men, so it's not surprising that some of the history of
  women has been overlooked. It's important for women to hear this history because it gives
  us models, examples of what we can accomplish. I think it's equally important for men to
  hear because it's part of the total picture, and we need to see it all. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yesterday, we had a one-day women's retreat dedicated to
  the first Buddhist nun, Pajapati. She was a very important figure in Buddhist history; the
  first woman disciple of the Buddha and the founder of the order of nuns. She also happened
  to be the Buddha's stepmother. Pajapati's name means &quot;leader of a great
  assembly.&quot; As this name was given to her at birth, there was obviously some
  foreseeing that the events in her life would be extraordinary. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What was the world like for women 2,500 years ago? Well,
  it wasn't that terrible in India at that time. It was before some of the customs like
  purdah, the practice of secluding women, and suttee, the practice of sacrificing a widow
  on her husband's funeral pyre. They didn't have so many child marriages. Things weren't
  too bad. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, a woman was defined by her family connections. If
  she had a husband, she had status. If she had a son, she had some status. If she didn't
  have those relationships and had no money, she didn't have much status. Because there
  weren't many jobs for women in those days, a woman's life was almost completely defined by
  her connections to men. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Into this world, Pajapati and her sister Maya were born
  into the Koliyan clan, whose territory bordered on that of the Sakya's. The Buddha's
  father, King Suddhodana, was chief of the Sakya clan, and when he was looking for a wife,
  he went to the Koliyan clan and found these two sisters. He married both of them and took
  them back to his palace. It wasn't unusual at that time for powerful men to have more than
  one wife or even a harem. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Maya became pregnant, and as was the custom, she returned
  to her family home to give birth. On her way, she stopped in the garden at Lumbini to see
  the beautiful flowers there. She reached up her arm to pick a blossoming branch of the
  ashok tree when she felt her initial labor pains and then, right there in the garden, gave
  birth to a boy. Regrettably, Maya died seven days after her son, Siddhartha Gautama, was
  born. Her sister Pajapati became the stepmother of this child. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Siddhartha grew up and left home at the age of 29. He
  wandered, studied, and finally attained enlightenment six years later. Pajapati was
  already in her late 50's or early 60's when he returned home. At that time, the Sakya clan
  was estranged from the Buddha, but Pajapati and her husband Suddhodana welcomed him back.
  They took the teachings from him and were converted to his path. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Soon after the Buddha began teaching, many men began to
  follow him to hear his discourses. Many became monks. Wives and mothers lost their status
  because their husbands and sons left home. Prostitutes' livelihoods were threatened
  because many men became celibate. In many ways, women's lives were turned upside-down
  because so many men began to follow this great religious leader. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the same time, it didn't seem likely that women would
  be allowed to follow a spiritual path and make the same journey. It just wasn't done.
  Women in those days didn't have the freedom to become homeless, to renounce the world, to
  go out and study and meditate. It wasn't heard of. And the Buddha himself was not a social
  reformer. He wasn't trying to change the world in the sense of recreating the social
  structure. He was trying to help people change their own worlds. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the wife of a chief and an elder in the clan, Pajapati
  was highly respected, and her eminence increased because she had access to the Buddha's
  teachings. After her husband Suddhodana died, many women came to Pajapati for advice, for
  guidance, and for teachings, and Pajapati soon had 500 woman followers. It probably wasn't
  exactly 500; the Buddhist scriptures tend to use these numbers to mean &quot;a whole
  lot.&quot; Many of these women were from the Sakya clan, and a lot of them were from
  Siddhartha's harem. (There's a legend that as a young man Siddhartha performed so
  impressively in a sporting exhibition that every Sakyan man sent a woman from his family
  to be part of Siddhartha's harem; the number given was 40,000! Now, I doubt that, but it
  was a great many.) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, during this time many men were leaving home.
  Pajapati's son Nanda went to follow the Buddha. Her nephew Rahula, that is, the Buddha's
  son, went to follow the Buddha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, an incident occured that resulted in even
  more men leaving society. The Koliyans and the Sakyans became involved in a dispute over
  the right to draw water from a river in the area. There was a big battle and a lot of men
  were killed. Some of the women went to the Buddha and asked him to intercede. He came and
  spoke to the men, and as a result many of them decided to give up fighting totally and
  follow the Buddha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The women turned to Pajapati. They turned to her for
  comfort and support and they turned to her to resolve the ultimate questions of birth and
  suffering and death. And they turned to her to find a new family with the other women who
  were left without a social identity. They trusted her because she had the same experience,
  because she was also alone. And they trusted her because of her position and her wisdom;
  I'm sure this must have been what came from within her. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Eventually, Pajapati decided that women should have the
  same opportunity that men had. She went to the Buddha, who was in Kapilavatthu at the
  time, and said to him &quot;It would be great, Lord, if women were allowed to renounce
  their homes and enter into the homeless state under the dharma and the discipline of the
  Tathagata.&quot; She continued, &quot;We want to renounce too, we want to follow the path
  as well. Will you allow it?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the Buddha's reply was, &quot;Don't set your heart on
  women being able to do this.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">She asked two more times. And two more times the Buddha
  refused. Pajapati bowed respectfully and left in tears. But that wasn't the end of it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The women decided to take things into their own hands.
  They shaved their heads and put on saffron colored robes like the monks wore. They
  followed Pajapati barefoot for a long distance to see the Buddha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now this must have been quite a sight! All these women,
  500 of them, walking down the road, doing something no woman had ever done before in terms
  of becoming a renunciate. They traveled to where the Buddha was at the time and stood
  outside his quarters. Their feet were injured and swollen and they were covered with dust.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">They stood outside, and Ananda, the Buddha's main
  assistant and head disciple, came out and asked what was wrong. Pajapati replied,
  &quot;Because the blessed one does not permit women to renounce their homes and enter into
  the homeless state under the dharma and the discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata, we are
  unhappy.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda decided to intercede. He went to the Buddha and
  said, &quot;Look and see what you've got out here. A whole bunch of women. They want to be
  ordained, they want to become renunciants.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the Buddha said &quot;Don't set your heart on women
  being able to do this.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And Ananda asked him two more times, and two more times
  the Buddha refused. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda asked him &quot;Lord, is it because women don't
  have the capacity to become enlightened? Is that why you won't ordain them?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha replied, &quot;No, women are perfectly capable
  of becoming enlightened. If they entered this study they could become just as fully
  attained.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda continued: &quot;If women are able to realize
  perfection, and since Pajapati was of great service to you as your aunt, nurse and foster
  mother--she even suckled you at her own breast after your mother died--it would be good if
  women were allowed to enter into homelessness. Especially if you look out here and see
  their sincerity and determination.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I think at that point the Buddha probably felt that
  resisting them wasn't going to help, because these women were quite determined. He agreed
  to ordain the women as nuns under the condition that they accept eight special rules. He
  also predicted that the lifespan of the Buddhist teachings would be reduced by half, from
  1,000 to 500 years, as a consequence of allowing women to ordain. Of course, here we are
  2,500 years later and the dharma's still with us so that prediction wasn't borne out. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today, research suggests that the eight special rules were
  probably not given by the Buddha, but added later. I like to think that. The first of
  these rules said that an ordained woman, even if she'd been ordained for one hundred
  years, still must bow down to a monk who had been ordained for only one day. Another
  prohibited nuns from reproving monks in any way, but monks were allowed to reprove nuns.
  Now this was only a problem because it prevented women from teaching monks, because if
  they couldn't tell them when they were wrong there was no way to do the teaching. But
  monks were expected to teach the nuns. There were six other rules, but the general idea
  was that the nuns would not have as much freedom. They also had to take more precepts than
  the monks did. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pajapati accepted the deal. But as she thought about it
  later, she decided to talk to the Buddha again. She said, &quot;Maybe it would be better
  if these rules about salutations, standing up in the presence of another, paying
  reverence, and the proper performance of duties were taken by both Bhikkus and Bhikkunis,
  monks and nuns, according to seniority rather than according to gender.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha supposedly said this wasn't possible and
  wouldn't agree to it. He said &quot;Even those teachers of false dharma don't permit such
  conduct in relation to women. How much less can the Tathagata allow?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again...I wasn't there, but that's what has come down in
  legend. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On ordination, Pajapati received a subject of meditation
  and through it was able to realize perfection. She wrote: &quot;I have reached the state
  where everything stops. The extinction of senses, feeling, consciousness. This achievement
  is synonymous with Nirvana, the highest attainment.&quot; There's no doubt that Pajapati
  was an enlightened person. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When she was 120 years old and felt herself near death,
  she sent for her son, the Buddha. Despite the fact that there were monastic rules
  prohibiting monks from visiting sick nuns, the Buddha came. When she died, miracles
  occurred, both then and at her cremation, which later were said to be equaled only by
  those that took place at the death of the Buddha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pajapati was held in very high esteem during the time she
  was alive, in her own culture. The book that tells us about Pajapati, the Therigatha, is
  part of the Pali canon. It's a collection of poems written by the first nuns and is
  considered to be perhaps the oldest work ever written by women. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I'd like to share a couple of these poems that were
  written by Pajapati's disciples. They give a better picture of what it was like for the
  women of that era to be able to have the freedom and opportunity to follow a spiritual
  path, to have support for it, and to be able to attain their own awakening. The first poem
  is actually one by Pajapati. She says: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">Homage to you Buddha<br>
    best of all creatures<br>
    who set me and many<br>
    others free from pain.<br>
    All pain is understood<br>
    The cause, the craving<br>
    is dried up.<br>
    The Noble eight-fold way unfolds.<br>
    I have reached the state where everything stops.<br>
    I have been mother, son, father, brother, grandmother,<br>
    knowing nothing of the truth<br>
    I journeyed on.<br>
    But I have seen the Blessed one.<br>
    This is my last body and I will not go from birth to birth again.<br>
    Look at the disciples all together.<br>
    Their energy, their sincere effort<br>
    this is homage to Buddhas.<br>
    Maya gave birth to Gautama for the sake of us all.<br>
    She has driven back the pain of the sick and dying.</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another disciple of Pajapati was her daughter
  Sundari-Nanda. Sundari in Pali means &quot;beautiful.&quot; She was considered to be the
  most beautiful woman in her country. She was the daughter of Suddhodana and Pajapati and
  therefore a half-sister of the Buddha. She was not as interested in the fact that she was
  beautiful as she was in becoming awakened. She was known to have a natural ability in
  religious practice, and was declared by the Buddha to be foremost among the nuns in
  meditative power. This is her poem, and it begins: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha says:<br>
    Nanda look at the body diseased, impure, rotten.<br>
    Focus the mind on all this foulness.<br>
    Then the Buddha made an image of a lovely woman<br>
    and it aged before Nanda's eyes.<br>
    He went on:<br>
    Your body is like this, and this is like your body.<br>
    It stinks of decay, only a fool would love it.<br>
    Nanda replied:<br>
    So day and night without letting up I looked at it this way.<br>
    And by my own wisdom I perceived it fully.<br>
    I saw. Watching carefully I plumbed to the very origin<br>
    and saw this body as it really is, inside and out.<br>
    Deep inside myself, I have lost interest in passion.<br>
    I am carefree, quenched, calm and free. </font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here's a poem by Pajapati's nurse, who was one of her
  disciples. This woman had been her nurse since she was a child. She also followed Pajapati
  and became a nun. She says: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">It was 25 years since I left home<br>
    And I haven't had a moment's peace<br>
    Uneasy at heart<br>
    steeped in a longing for pleasure<br>
    I held out my arms and cried out<br>
    as I entered the monastery.<br>
    I went up to a nun I thought I could trust<br>
    She taught me the dharma<br>
    the elements of body and mind<br>
    the nature of perception and earth water fire and wind.<br>
    I heard her words and sat down beside her<br>
    Now I've entered the six realms of sacred knowledge.<br>
    I know I have lived before<br>
    the eye of heaven is pure<br>
    and I know the minds of others.<br>
    I have great magic powers and have annihilated<br>
    all the obsessions of the mind.<br>
    The Buddha's teaching has been done. </font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The details aren't so important as the fact that all of
  these women are saying &quot;Now I've had the chance to find this within myself.&quot;
  They were given this opportunity because of the strength of those 500 women, and
  especially Pajapati. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The way we can look at it today, when not everyone who
  wants to follow a spiritual path is going to renounce the world--where many Buddhists
  practitioners are leading family lives--is simply the fact that there are equal chances.
  There's nothing to say that a woman is less capable than a man. Except our cultures. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When I was returning from Sri Lanka on Singapore Airlines,
  I was wearing robes. The flight attendant asked me where I'd been. I told her I'd been to
  a conference on women in Buddhism where we talked about women becoming enlightened. And
  she said to me, &quot;Oh, women can't become enlightened, can they?&quot; That is a
  problem, when a mistaken idea stands in the way of our own ability to search. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And regrettably, even in some current literature you see
  things like this entry in the Shambhala Dictionary, which I generally feel is a good
  source of information. This is what it says about Bhikkunis, or nuns: &quot;The order of
  nuns has never played an important role in the Buddhist Sangha. The number of nuns
  compared to that of monks is extremely small.&quot; This is not true. Certainly not in the
  Mahayana tradition. I believe in Taiwan you will find more nuns than monks. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it goes; we need to continue to work on correcting the
  history. Another book, &quot;In The Buddhist Religion: A Historical Introduction&quot; by
  Robinson and Johnson, says: &quot;As the order of nuns is said to have been instituted by
  the Buddha at Ananda's repeated plea, Gautama's foster mother Pajapati and her attendants
  became its first members. Queen Khema Theri, wife of King Bimbisara, was converted and
  became a prominent nun. Despite the example of such wise and saintly women, the female
  order never became nearly so important as the male one. It is perhaps not surprising that
  an order founded so reluctantly should not have flourished. After the first generation,
  few distinguished nuns are mentioned.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But that's not all the literature out there, and here is a
  bibliography [*] of texts on women in Buddhism that you might be interested in looking at.
  Although many of the books are histories of women in Buddhism, we needn't only look back
  in time for role models. One book, &quot;Meetings With Remarkable Women,&quot; by Lenore
  Friedman, includes a profile of our Abbess, Ven. Karuna Dharma. &quot;Turning the
  Wheel,&quot; by Sandy Boucher is one of my favorites because it describes how American
  women have contributed to and transformed Buddhism in the West. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ultimately, we connect with our True Selves and there are
  no categories, and that includes gender categories. But as we travel along the path, we
  can benefit from hearing how practitioners from both the past and present have faced the
  challenges in life that uniquely confront women. And we, in turn, can share our
  understanding with others. </font></p>
