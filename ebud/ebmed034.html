    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are lots of people who are ashamed to talk about
    their own defilements, but who feel no shame at talking about
    the defilements of others. Those who are willing to report
    their own diseases -- their own defilements -- in a
    straightforward manner are few and far between. As a result,
    the disease of defilement is hushed up and kept secret, so
    that we don't realize how serious and widespread it is. We
    all suffer from it, and yet no one is open about it. No one
    is really interested in diagnosing his or her own
    defilements.... </p>
    <p>We have to find a skillful approach if we hope to wipe out
    this disease, and we have to be open about it, admitting our
    defilements from the grossest to the most subtle levels,
    dissecting them down to their minutest details. Only then
    will we gain from our practice. If we look at ourselves in a
    superficial way, we may feel that we're already fine just as
    we are, already know all we need to know. But then when the
    defilements let loose with full force as anger or delusion,
    we pretend that nothing is wrong--and this way the
    defilements become a hidden disease, hard to catch hold of,
    hard to diagnose.... </p>
    <p>We have to be strong in fighting off defilements, cravings
    and illusions of every sort. We have to test our strength
    against them and bring them under our power. If we can bring
    them under our power, we can ride on their backs. If we
    can't, they'll have to ride on our backs, making us do their
    work, pulling us around by the nose, making us want, wearing
    us out in all sorts of ways. </p>
    <p>So are we still beasts of burden? Are we beasts of burden
    because defilement and craving are riding on our backs? Have
    they put a ring through our noses? When you get to the point
    when you've had enough, you have to stop--stop and watch the
    defilements to see how they come into being, what they want,
    what they eat, what they find delicious. Make it your
    sport--watching the defilements and making them starve, like
    a person giving up an addiction...See if it gets the
    defilements upset. Do they hunger to the point where they're
    salivating? Then don't let them eat. No matter what, don't
    let them eat what they're addicted to. After all, there are
    plenty of other things to eat. You have to be hard on
    them--hard on your &quot;self&quot;-- like
    this...&quot;Hungry? Well go ahead and be hungry! You're
    going to die? Fine! Go ahead and die!&quot; If you can take
    this attitude, you'll be able to win out over all sorts of
    addictions, all sorts of defilements--because you're not
    pandering to desire, you're not nourishing the desire which
    exists for the sake of finding flavor in physical things.
    It's time you stopped, time you gave up feeding these things.
    If they're going to waste away and die, let them die. After
    all, why should you keep them fat and well fed? </p>
    <p>No matter what, you have to keep putting the heat on your
    cravings and defilements until they wither and waste away.
    Don't let them raise their heads. Keep them under your thumb.
    This is the sort of straightforward practice you have to
    follow. If you have endurance, if you put up a persistent
    fight until they're all burned away, then there's no other
    victory which can come anywhere near, no other victory which
    is anywhere near a match for victory over the cravings and
    defilements in your own heart. </p>
    <p>This is why the Buddha taught us to put the heat on the
    defilements in all our activities--sitting, standing, walking
    and lying down. If we don't do this, they'll burn us in all
    our activities.... </p>
    <p>If you consider things carefully, you'll see that the
    Buddha's teachings all are exactly right, both in how they
    tell us to examine the diseases of defilement, and in how
    they tell us to let go, destroy and extinguish defilement.
    All the steps are there, so we needn't go study anywhere
    else. Every point in his doctrine and discipline shows us the
    way, so we needn't wonder how we can go about examining and
    doing away with these diseases. This becomes mysterious and
    hard to know only if you study his teachings without making
    reference to doing away with your own defilements. People
    don't like to talk about their own defilements, so they end
    up completely ignorant. They grow old and die without knowing
    a thing about their own defilements at all. </p>
    <p>When we start to practice, when we come to comprehend how
    the defilements burn our own hearts, that's when we gradually
    come to know ourselves. To understand suffering and
    defilement and learn how to extinguish defilement gives us
    space to breathe.... </p>
    <p>When we learn how to put out the fires of defilement, how
    to destroy them, it means we have tools. We can be confident
    in ourselves--no doubts, no straying of into other paths of
    practice, because we're sure to see that practicing in this
    way, contemplating inconstancy, stress and not-selfness in
    this way at all times, really gets rid of our defilements. </p>
    <p>The same hold true with virtue, concentration and
    discernment. They're our tools--and we need a full set. We
    need the discernment which which comes with Right View, and
    the virtue which comes with self-discipline. Virtue is very
    important. Virtue and discernment are like our right and left
    hands. If one of our hands is dirty, it can't wash itself.
    You need to use both hands to keep both hands washed and
    clean. Thus wherever there is virtue, you have to have
    discernment. Wherever there is discernment, you have to have
    virtue. Discernment is what enables you to know; virtue is
    what enables you to let go, to relinquish, to destroy your
    addictions. Virtue isn't just a matter of the five or eight
    precepts, you know. It has to be deal with the finest
    details. Whatever your discernment sees as a cause of
    suffering, you have to stop, to let go. </p>
    <p>Virtue is something which gets very subtle and precise.
    Letting go, giving up, renouncing, abstaining, cutting away
    and destroying: All of these things are an affair of virtue.
    This is why virtue and discernment have to go together, just
    as our right and left hands have to help each other. They
    help each other wash away defilement. That's when your mind
    will be able to become centered, to be bright and clear.
    These things show their benefits right at the mind. If we
    don't have these tools, it's as if we had no hands or feet:
    We wouldn't be able to get anywhere at all. We have to use
    our tools--virtue and discernment--to destroy defilement.
    That's when our minds will benefit.... </p>
    <p>This is why the Buddha taught us to keep training in
    virtue, concentration and discernment. We have to keep fit in
    training these things. If we don't keep up the training as we
    should, our tools for extinguishing suffering and defilement
    won't be sharp, won't be of much use. They won't be a match
    for the defilements. The defilements have monstrous powers
    for burning our mind in the twinkling of an eye. Say that
    mind is quiet and neutral: The slightest sensory contact can
    set things burning in an instant by making us pleased or
    displeased. Why? </p>
    <p>Sensory contact is our measuring stick for seeing how firm
    or weak our mindfulness is. Most of the time it stirs things
    up. As soon as there's contact by way of the ear or eye, the
    defilements are very quick. When this is the case, how can we
    keep things under control? How are we going to gain control
    over our eyes? How are be going to gain control over our
    ears, our nose, our tongue, our body and mind? How can we get
    mindfulness and discernment in charge of these things? This
    is a matter of practice, pure and simple...our own affair,
    something by which we can test ourselves, to see why
    defilements flare up so quickly when sensory contact takes
    place. </p>
    <p>Say, for instance, that we hear someone criticizing
    someone else. We can listen and not get upset. But say that
    the thought occurs to us, &quot;They're actually criticizing
    me.&quot; As soon as we concoct up this &quot;me&quot;, we're
    immediately angry and displeased. If we concoct very much of
    this &quot;me&quot;, we can get very angry. Just this fact
    should enable us to observe that as soon as our
    &quot;self&quot; gets involved, we suffer immediately. This
    is how it happens. If no sense of self comes out to get
    involved, we can remain calm and indifferent. When they
    criticize other people we can stay indifferent, but as soon
    as we conclude that they're criticizing us, our
    &quot;self&quot; appears and immediately gets involved--and
    we immediately burn with defilement. Why? </p>
    <p>You have to pay close attention to this. As soon as your
    &quot;self&quot; arises, suffering arises in the very same
    instant. The same holds true even if you're just thinking.
    The &quot;self&quot; you think up spreads out into all sorts
    of issues. The minds gets scattered all over the place with
    defilement, craving and attachments. It has very little
    mindfulness and discernment watching over it, so it gets
    dragged all over the place by defilement and craving. </p>
    <p>And yet we don't realize it. We think we're just fine. Is
    there anyone among us who realizes that this is what's
    happening? We're too weighted down, weighted down with our
    own delusions. No matter how much the mind is smothered in
    the defilement of delusion, we don't realize it, for it keeps
    us deaf and blind.... </p>
    <p>There are no physical tools you can use to detect or cure
    this disease of defilement, because it arises only at sensory
    contact. There's no substance to it. It's like a match in a
    matchbox. As long as the match doesn't come into contact with
    the friction strip on the side of the box, it won't give rise
    to fire. But as soon as we strike it against the side of the
    box, it bursts into flame. If it goes out right then, all
    that gets burned is the matchhead. If it doesn't stop at the
    matchhead, it'll burn the matchstick. If it doesn't stop with
    the matchstick, and meets up with anything flammable, it can
    grow into an enormous fire. </p>
    <p>When defilement arises in the mind, it starts from the
    slightest contact. If we can be quick to put it out right
    there, it's like striking a match which flares up--chae-- for
    an instant and then dies down right in the matchhead. The
    defilement disbands right there. But if we don't put it out
    the instant it arises, and let it start concocting issues,
    it's like pouring fuel into a fire. </p>
    <p>We have to observe the diseases of defilement in our own
    minds to see what their symptoms are, why they are so quick
    to flare up. They can't stand to be disturbed. The minute you
    disturb them, they flare up into flame. When this is the
    case, what can we do to prepare ourselves beforehand? How can
    we stock up on mindfulness before sensory contact strikes? </p>
    <p>The way to stock up is to practice meditation, as when we
    keep the breath in mind. This is what gets our mindfulness
    prepared, so that we can keep ahead of defilement, so that we
    can keep it from arising as long as we have our theme of
    meditation as an inner shelter for the mind. </p>
    <p>The mind's outer shelter is the body, which is composed of
    physical elements, but its inner shelter is the theme of
    meditation we use to train its mindfulness to be focused and
    aware. Whatever theme we use, that's the inner shelter for
    the mind which keeps it from wandering around, concocting
    thoughts and imaginings. This is why we need a theme of
    meditation. Don't let the mind chase after its preoccupations
    the way ordinary people who don't meditate do. Once we have a
    meditation theme to catch this monkey of a mind so that day
    by day it becomes less and less willful, it will gradually
    calm down, calm down until it can stand firm for long or
    short periods, depending on how much we train and observe
    ourselves. </p>
    <p>Now, as for how we do breath meditation: The texts say to
    breathe in long and out long--heavy or light--and then in
    short and out short, again heavy or light. Those are the
    first steps of the training. After that we don't have to
    focus on the length of the in-breath or out-breath. Instead,
    we simply gather our awareness at any one point of the
    breath, and keep this up until the mind settles down and is
    still. When the mind is still, you then focus on the
    stillness of the mind at the same time you're aware of the
    breath. </p>
    <p>At this point you don't focus directly on the breath. You
    focus on the mind which is still and at normalcy. You focus
    continuously on the normalcy of the mind at the same time you
    are aware of the breath coming in and out, without actually
    focusing on the breath. You simply stay with the mind, but
    you watch it with each in-and-out breath. Usually when you
    are doing physical work and your mind is at normalcy, you can
    know what you're doing, so why can't you be aware of the
    breath? After all, it's part of the body. </p>
    <p>Some of you are new at this, which is why you don't know
    how you can focus on the mind at normalcy with each
    in-and-out breath without focusing directly on the breath
    itself. What we're doing here is practicing how to be aware
    of the body and mind, pure and simple, in and of
    themselves.... </p>
    <p>Start out by focusing on the breath for about 5, 10 or 20
    minutes. Breathe in long and out long, or in short and out
    short. At the same time, notice the stages in how the mind
    feels, how it begins to settle down when you have mindfulness
    watching over the breath. You've got to make a point of
    observing this, because usually you breathe out of habit,
    with your attention far away. You don't focus on the breath,
    you're not really aware of it. This leads you to think that
    it's hard to stay focused there, but actually it's very easy.
    After all, the breath comes in and out on its own, by its
    very nature. There's nothing at all difficult about
    breathing. It's not like other themes of meditation. For
    instance, if you're going to practice recollection of the
    Buddha, or buddho, you have to keep on repeating buddho,
    buddho, buddho. </p>
    <p>Actually, if you want, you can repeat buddho in the mind
    with each in-and-out breath, but only in the very beginning
    stages. You repeat buddho to keep the mind from concocting
    thoughts about other things. Simply by keeping up this
    repetition you can weaken the mind's tendency to stray, for
    the mind can take on only one object at a time. This is
    something you have to observe. The repetition is to prevent
    the mind from thinking up thoughts and clambering after them.
    </p>
    <p>After you've kept up the repetition--you don't have to
    count the number of times--the mind will settle down to be
    aware of the breath with each in-and-out breath. It will
    begin to be still, neutral and at normalcy. </p>
    <p>This is when you focus on the mind instead of the breath.
    Let go of the breath and focus on the mind--but still be
    aware of the breath on the side. You don't have to make note
    of how long or short the breath is. Make note of the mind
    which stays at normalcy with each in-and-out breath. Remember
    this carefully so that you can put it into practice. </p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">The Posture:</font></h3>
    <p>For focusing on the breath, sitting is a better posture
    than standing, walking or lying down, because the sensations
    that come with the other postures often overcome the
    sensations of the breath. Walking jolts the body around too
    much, standing for a long time can make you tired, and if the
    mind settles down when you're lying down, you tend to fall
    asleep. With sitting it's possible to stay in one position
    and keep the mind firmly settled for a long time. You can
    observe the subtleties of the breath and the mind naturally
    and automatically. </p>
    <p>Here I'd like to condense the steps of breath meditation
    to show how all four of the tetrads mentioned in the texts
    can be practiced at once. In other words, is it possible to
    focus on the body, feelings, the mind and the Dhamma all in
    one sitting? This is an important question for all of us. You
    could, if you wanted to, precisely follow all the steps in
    the texts so as to develop strong powers of mental absorption
    (jhana), but it takes a lot of time. It's not appropriate for
    those of us who are old and have only a little time left. </p>
    <p>What we need is a way of gathering our awareness at the
    breath long enough to make the mind firm, and then go
    straight to examining how all formations are inconstant,
    stressful and not-self, so that we can see the truth of all
    formations with each in-and-out breath. If you can keep at
    this continually, without break, your mindfulness will become
    firm and snug enough for you to give rise to the discernment
    which will enable you to gain clear knowledge and vision. </p>
    <p>So what follow are the steps in practicing a condensed
    form of breath meditation....Give them a try until you find
    they give rise to knowledge of your own within you. You're
    sure to give rise to knowledge of your very own. </p>
    <p>The first thing when you are going to meditate on the
    breath is to sit straight and keep your mindfulness firm.
    Breathe in. Breathe out. Make the breath feel open and at
    ease. Don't tense your hands, your feet, or any of your
    joints at all. You have to keep your body in a posture that
    feels appropriate to your breathing. At the beginning,
    breathe in long and out long, fairly heavily, and gradually
    the breath will shorten--sometimes heavy and sometimes light.
    Then breathe in short and out short for about 10 or 15
    minutes, and then change. </p>
    <p>After a while, when you stay focused mindfully on it, the
    breath will gradually change. Watch it change for as many
    minutes as you like, then be aware of the whole breath, all
    of its subtle sensations. This is the third step, the third
    step of the first tetrad: sabba-kaya-patisamvedi--focusing on
    how the breath affects the whole body by watching all the
    breath sensations in all the various parts of the body, and
    in particular the sensations related to the in-and-out
    breath. </p>
    <p>From there you focus on the sensation of the breath at any
    one point. When you do this right, and for a fairly long
    while, the body--the breath--will gradually grow still. The
    mind will grow calm. In other words, the breath grows still
    together with the awareness of the breath. When the
    subtleties of the breath grow still, at the same time that
    your undistracted awareness settles down, the breath grows
    even more still. All the sensations in the body gradually
    grow more and more still. This is the fourth step, the
    stilling of bodily formations. </p>
    <p>As soon as this happens, you begin to be aware of the
    feelings which arise with the stilling of the body and mind.
    Whether they are feelings of pleasure or rapture or whatever,
    they will appear clearly enough for you to contemplate them. </p>
    <p>The stages through which you have already passed--watching
    the breath come in and out, long or short--should be enough
    to make you realize--even though you may not have focused on
    the idea--that the breath is inconstant. It's continually
    changing, from in long and out long to in short and out
    short, from heavy to light and so forth. This should enable
    you to read the breath, to understand that there's nothing
    constant to it at all. It changes on its own from one moment
    to the next. </p>
    <p>Once you have realized the inconstancy of the body, i.e of
    the breath, you'll be able to see the subtle sensations of
    pleasure and pain in the realm of feeling. So now you watch
    feelings, right there in the same place where you have been
    focusing on the breath. Even though they are feelings which
    arise from the stillness of the body or mind, they are
    nevertheless inconstant even in that stillness. They can
    change. So these changing sensations in the realm of feeling
    exhibit inconstancy in and of themselves, just like the
    breath. </p>
    <p>When you see change in the body, change in feelings and
    change in the mind,this is called seeing the Dhamma, i.e.
    seeing inconstancy. You have to understand this correctly.
    Practicing the first tetrad of breath meditation contains all
    four tetrads of breath meditation. In other words, you see
    the inconstancy of the body, and then contemplate feeling.
    You see the inconstancy of feeling, and then contemplate the
    mind. The mind, too, is inconstant. This inconstancy of the
    mind is the Dhamma. To see the Dhamma is to see this
    inconstancy. </p>
    <p>When you see the true nature of all inconstant things,
    then keep track of that inconstancy at all times, with every
    in-and-out breath. Keep this up in all your activities to see
    what happens next. </p>
    <p>What happens next is dispassion. Letting go. This is
    something you have to know for yourself. </p>
    <p>This is what condensed breath meditation is like. I call
    it condensed because it contains all the steps all at once.
    You don't have to do one step at a time. Simply focus at one
    point: Focus on the body, and you'll see the inconstancy of
    the body. When you see the inconstancy of the body, you'll
    have to see feeling. Feeling will have to show its
    inconstancy. The mind's sensitivity to feeling, or its
    thoughts and imaginings, are also inconstant. All of these
    things keep on changing. This is how you know inconstancy....
    </p>
    <p>If you can become skilled at looking and knowing in this
    way, you'll be struck with the inconstancy, stressfulness and
    not-selfness of your &quot;self&quot;, and you'll meet with
    the genuine Dhamma. The Dhamma which is constantly changing
    like a burning fire, burning with inconstancy, stress and
    not-selfness, is the Dhamma of the impermanence of all
    formations. But further in, in the mind or in the property of
    consciousness, is something special, beyond the reach of any
    kind of fire. There, there is no suffering or stress of any
    kind at all. This thing which lies &quot;inside&quot;: You
    could say that lies within the mind, but it isn't really in
    the mind. It's simply that the contact is there at the mind.
    There's no way that you can really describe it. Only the
    extinguishing of all defilement will lead you to know it for
    yourself. </p>
    <p>This &quot;something special&quot; within exists by its
    very nature, but defilements have it surrounded on all sides.
    All these counterfeit things--the defilements--keep getting
    in the way and take possession of everything, so that this
    special nature remains imprisoned inside at all times.
    Actually, there is nothing in the dimension of time which can
    be compared with it. There's nothing by which you can label
    it, but it is something which you can pierce through to
    see--i.e. by piercing through defilement, craving and
    attachment into the state of mind which is pure, bright and
    silent. This is the only thing that's important. </p>
    <p>But it doesn't have only one level. There are many levels,
    from the outer bark to the inner bark and on to the sapwood
    before you reach the heartwood. The genuine Dhamma is like
    the heartwood, but there's a lot to the mind which isn't
    heartwood: The roots, the branches and leaves of the tree are
    more than many, but there's only a little heartwood. The
    parts which aren't heartwood will gradually decay and
    disintegrate, but the heartwood doesn't decay. That's one
    kind of comparison we can make. It's like a tree which dies
    standing. The leaves fall away, the branches rot away, the
    bark and sapwood rot away, leaving nothing but the true
    heartwood. That's one comparison we can make with this thing
    we call deathless, this property which has no birth, no
    death, no changing. We can also call it nibbana or the
    Unconditioned. It's all the same thing. </p>
    <p>Now, then. Isn't this something worth trying to break
    through to see?... </p>
