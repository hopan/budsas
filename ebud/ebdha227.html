        the first two centuries following the Buddha's parinibbana there took
        place, within the early Buddhist community, a move towards a
        comprehensive and precise systematization of the teachings disclosed by
        the Master in his discourses. The philosophical systems that emerged
        from this refined analytical approach to the doctrine are collectively
        called the Abhidhamma. Both the Theravada and the Sarvastivada, the two
        major conservative schools in the early Sangha, had their own
        Abhidhammas, each based on a distinct Abhidhamma Pitaka. It is likely
        too that other schools had also developed philosophical systems along
        similar lines, though records of them did not survive the passage of
        time.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All the different modes of
        analysis and classification found in the Abhidhamma stem from a single
        philosophical principle, which gave direction and shape to the entire
        project of systematization. This principle is the notion that all the
        phenomena of empirical existence are made up of a number of elementary
        constituents, the ultimate realities behind the manifest phenomena.
        These elementary constituents, the building blocks of experience, are
        called <i>dhammas</i>.1 The <i>dhamma</i> theory is not merely one
        principle among others in the body of Abhidhamma philosophy but the base
        upon which the entire system rests. It would thus be quite fitting to
        call this theory the cornerstone of the Abhidhamma. But the <i>dhamma</i>
        theory was intended from the start to be more than a mere hypothetical
        scheme. It arose from the need to make sense out of experiences in
        meditation and was designed as a guide for meditative contemplation and
        insight. The Buddha had taught that to see the world correctly is to see
        -- not persons and substances -- but bare phenomena (<i>suddhadhamma</i>)
        arising and perishing in accordance with their conditions. The task the
        Abhidhamma specialists set themselves was to specify exactly what these
        &quot;bare phenomena&quot; are and to show how they relate to other
        &quot;bare phenomena&quot; to make up our &quot;common sense&quot;
        picture of the world.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>dhamma</i> theory
        was not peculiar to any one school of Buddhism but penetrated all the
        early schools, stimulating the growth of their different versions of the
        Abhidhamma. The Sarvastivada version of the theory, together with its
        critique by the Madhyamikas, has been critically studied by a number of
        modern scholars. The Theravada version, however, has received less
        attention. There are sound reasons for believing that the Pali
        Abhidhamma Pitaka contains one of the earliest forms of the <i>dhamma</i>
        theory, perhaps even the oldest version. This theory did not remain
        static but evolved over the centuries as Buddhist thinkers sought to
        draw out the implications of the theory and to respond to problems it
        posed for the critical intellect. Thus the <i>dhamma</i> theory was
        repeatedly enriched, first by the Abhidhamma commentaries and then by
        the later exegetical literature and the medieval compendia of
        Abhidhamma, the so-called &quot;little finger manuals&quot; such as the <i>Abhidhammattha-
        sangaha</i>, which in turn gave rise to their own commentaries.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the present paper I will
        attempt to trace the main stages in the origin and development of the <i>dhamma</i>
        theory and to explore its philosophical implications. Part&nbsp;I will
        discuss the early version of the theory as represented by the Abhidhamma
        Pitaka. At this stage the theory was not yet precisely articulated but
        remained in the background as the unspoken premise of Abhidhamma
        analysis. It was during the commentarial period that an attempt was made
        to work out the implications of early Abhidhamma thought, and it is this
        development that I will treat in Part&nbsp;II. Finally, in Part&nbsp;III,
        I will discuss two other topics that received philosophical study as a
        consequence of the <i>dhamma</i> theory, namely, the category of the
        nominal and the conceptual (<i>pannatti</i>) and the theory of the
        twofold truth. Both of these were considered necessary measures to
        preserve the validity of the <i>dhamma</i> theory in relation to our
        routine, everyday understanding of ourselves and the world in which we
        dwell.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A</font></font><font face="Times New Roman">lthough
        the <i>dhamma</i> theory is an Abhidhammic innovation, the antecedent
        trends that led to its formulation and its basic ingredients can be
        traced to the early Buddhist scriptures which seek to analyse empiric
        individuality and its relation to the external world. In the discourses
        of the Buddha there are five such modes of analysis. The first, the
        analysis into <i>nama</i> and <i>rupa</i>,2 is the most elementary in
        the sense that it specifies the two main components, the mental and the
        corporeal aspects, of the empiric individual. The second is that into
        the five <i>khandhas</i> (aggregates): corporeality (<i>rupa</i>),
        sensation (<i>vedana</i>), perception (<i>sanna</i>), mental formations
        (<i>sankhara</i>), and consciousness (<i>vinnana</i>).3 The third is
        that into six <i>dhatus</i> (elements): earth (<i>pathavi</i>), water (<i>apo</i>),
        temperature (<i>tejo</i>), air (<i>vayo</i>), space (<i>akasa</i>), and
        consciousness (<i>vinnana</i>).4 The fourth is that into twelve <i>ayatanas</i>
        (avenues of sense-perception and mental cognition): the eye, ear, nose,
        tongue, body, and mind; and their corresponding objects: visible form,
        sound, smell, taste, touch, and mental objects.5 The fifth is that into
        eighteen <i>dhatus</i> (elements), an elaboration of the immediately
        preceding mode obtained by the addition of the six kinds of
        consciousness which arise from the contact between the sense organs and
        their objects. The six additional items are the visual, auditory,
        olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and mental consciousnesses.6</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now the purposes for which
        Buddhism resorts to these analyses are varied. For instance, the main
        purpose of the <i>khandha</i>-analysis is to show that there is no ego
        either inside or outside the five <i>khandhas </i>which go to make up
        the so-called empiric individuality. None of the <i>khandhas</i> belongs
        to me (<i>n'etat mama</i>), they do not correspond to &quot;I&quot; (<i>n'eso'ham
        asmi</i>), nor are they my self (<i>n'eso me atta</i>).7 Thus the main
        purpose of this analysis is to prevent the intrusion of the notions of
        &quot;mine,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; and &quot;my self&quot; into what is
        otherwise an impersonal and egoless congeries of mental and physical
        phenomena. On the other hand, the analysis into eighteen <i>dhatus</i>
        is often resorted to in order to show that consciousness is neither a
        soul nor an extension of a soul-substance but a mental phenomenon which
        comes into being as a result of certain conditions: there is no
        independent consciousness which exists in its own right.8 In similar
        fashion each analysis is used to explain certain features of sentient
        existence. It is, in fact, with reference to these five kinds of
        analysis that Buddhism frames its fundamental doctrines. The very fact
        that there are at least five kinds of analysis shows that none of them
        can be taken as final or absolute. Each represents the world of
        experience in its totality, yet represents it from a pragmatic
        standpoint determined by the particular doctrine which it is intended to
        illuminate.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Abhidhammic doctrine of
        <i>dhammas</i> developed from an attempt to draw out the full
        implications of these five types of analysis. It will be seen that if
        each analysis is examined in relation to the other four, it is found to
        be further analysable. That the first, the analysis into <i>nama</i> and
        <i>rupa</i>, is further analysable is seen by the second, the analysis
        into the five <i>khandhas</i>. For in the second, the <i>nama</i>-component
        of the first is analysed into sensation, perceptions, mental formations,
        and consciousness. That the analysis into <i>khandhas</i>, too, can be
        further analysed is shown not only by the use of the term <i>khandha</i>,
        which means &quot;group,&quot; but also by the next analysis, that into
        six <i>dhatus</i>. For in the latter, the <i>rupa</i>-component of the
        former is analysed into four, namely, earth water, temperature, and air.
        That the analysis into six <i>dhatus</i> is also further analysable is
        seen from the fact that consciousness, which is reckoned here as one
        item, is made into four in the <i>khandha</i>-analysis. That the same
        situation is true of the analysis into twelve <i>ayatanas</i> is shown
        by the next analysis, that into eighteen <i>dhatus,</i> because the
        latter is an elaboration of the former. This leaves us with the last,
        the <i>dhatu</i>-analysis with eighteen items. Can this be considered
        final? This supposition too must be rejected, because although
        consciousness is here itemized as sixfold, its invariable concomitants
        such as sensation (<i>vedana</i>) and perception (<i>sanna</i>) are not
        separately mentioned. It will thus be seen that none of the five
        analyses can be considered exhaustive. In each case one or more items is
        further analysable.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This, it seems to me, is
        the line of thought that led the Abhidhammikas to evolve still another
        mode of analysis which in their view is not amenable to further
        analysis. This new development, which is more or less common to all the
        systems of Abhidhamma, is the analysis of the world of experience into
        what came to be known as <i>dharmas</i> (Skt) or <i>dhammas </i>(Pali).
        The term <i>dhamma</i>, of course, looms large in the discourses of the
        Buddha, found in a variety of senses which have to be determined by the
        specific context. In the Abhidhamma, however, the term assumes a more
        technical meaning, referring to those items that result when the process
        of analysis is taken to its ultimate limits. In the Theravada
        Abhidhamma, for instance, the aggregate of corporeality (of the <i>khandha</i>-analysis)
        is broken down into twenty-eight items called <i>rupa-dhammas</i>. The
        next three aggregates -- sensation, perception, and mental formations --
        are together arranged into fifty-two items called <i>cetasikas</i>. The
        fifth, consciousness, is counted as one item with eighty-nine varieties
        and is referred to as <i>citta</i>.9</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the <i>dhamma</i>-analysis
        is an addition to the previous five modes of analyses. Its scope is the
        same, the world of conscious experience, but its divisions are finer and
        more exhaustive. This situation in itself does not constitute a radical
        departure from the earlier tradition, for it does not as yet involve a
        view of existence that is at variance with that of early Buddhism. There
        is, however, this situation to be noted: Since the analysis into <i>dhammas</i>
        is the most exhaustive, the previous five modes of analysis become
        subsumed under it as five subordinate classifications.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The definition and
        classification of these <i>dhammas</i> and the explanation of their
        inter-connections form the main subject matter of the canonical
        Abhidhamma. The Abhidhammikas presuppose that to understand any given
        item properly is to know it in all its relations, under all aspects
        recognized in the doctrinal and practical discipline of Buddhism.
        Therefore, in the Abhidhamma Pitaka, they have classified the same
        material in different ways and from different points of view. This
        explains why, in the <i>Dhammasangani</i> and other Abhidhamma
        treatises, one encounters innumerable lists of classifications. Although
        such lists may appear repetitive, even monotonous, they serve a useful
        purpose, bringing into relief, not only the individual characteristic of
        each <i>dhamma</i>, but also its relations to other <i>dhammas</i>.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With this same aim in view,
        in bringing out the nature of the <i>dhammas</i>, the Abhidhamma resorts
        to two complementary methods: that of analysis (<i>bheda</i>) and that
        of synthesis (<i>sangaha</i>). The analytical method dominates in the <i>Dhammasangani</i>,
        which according to tradition is the first book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka;
        for here we find a complete catalogue of the <i>dhammas</i>, each with a
        laconic definition. The synthetical method is more characteristic of the
        <i>Patthana</i>, the last book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka; for here we
        find an exhaustive catalogue of the conditional relations of the <i>dhammas</i>.
        The combined use of these two methods shows that, according to the
        methodological apparatus employed in the Abhidhamma, &quot;a complete
        description of a thing requires, besides its analysis, also a statement
        of its relations to certain other things.&quot; 10 Thus if analysis
        plays an important role in the Abhidhamma's methodology, no less
        important a role is played by synthesis. Analysis shows that the world
        of experience is resolvable into a plurality of factors; synthesis shows
        that these factors are not discrete entities existing in themselves but
        inter-connected and inter-dependent nodes in a complex web of
        relationships. It is only for the purpose of definition and description
        that things are artificially dissected. In actuality the world given to
        experience is a vast network of tightly interwoven relations.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This fact needs emphasis
        because the Abhidhammic doctrine of <i>dhammas</i> has sometimes been
        represented as a radical pluralism. Such an interpretation is certainly
        not admissible. It is mostly Stcherbatsky's writings,11 mainly based on
        the Sarvastivada sources, that has given currency to this incorrect
        interpretation. &quot;Up to the present time,&quot; observes Nyanaponika
        Thera, &quot;it has been a regular occurrence in the history of physics,
        metaphysics, and psychology that when a whole has been successfully
        dissolved by analysis, the resultant parts come again to be regarded as
        little Wholes.&quot; 12 This is the kind of process that culminates in
        radical pluralism. As we shall soon see, about a hundred years after the
        formulation of the <i>dhamma</i>-theory, such a trend surfaced within
        certain schools of Buddhist thought and culminated in the view that the <i>dhammas</i>
        exist in all three periods of time. But the Pali Abhidhamma Pitaka did
        not succumb to this error of conceiving the <i>dhammas</i> as ultimate
        unities or discrete entities. In the Pali tradition it is only for the
        sake of definition and description that each <i>dhamma</i> is postulated
        as if it were a separate entity; but in reality it is by no means a
        solitary phenomenon having an existence of its own. This is precisely
        why the mental and material <i>dhammas</i> are often presented in
        inter-connected groups. In presenting them thus the danger inherent in
        narrowly analytical methods has been avoided -- the danger, namely, of
        elevating the factors resulting from analysis to the status of genuinely
        separate entities. Thus if analysis shows that composite things cannot
        be considered as ultimate unities, synthesis shows that the factors into
        which the apparently composite things are analysed (<i>ghana-vinibbhoga</i>)
        are not discrete entities.13</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If this Abhidhammic view of
        existence, as seen from its doctrine of <i>dhammas</i>, cannot be
        interpreted as a radical pluralism, neither can it be interpreted as an
        out-and-out monism. For what are called <i>dhammas</i> -- the component
        factors of the universe, both within us and outside us -- are not
        fractions of an absolute unity but a multiplicity of co-ordinate
        factors. They are not reducible to, nor do they emerge from, a single
        reality, the fundamental postulate of monistic metaphysics. If they are
        to be interpreted as phenomena, this should be done with the proviso
        that they are phenomena with no corresponding noumena, no hidden
        underlying ground. For they are not manifestations of some mysterious
        metaphysical substratum, but processes taking place due to the interplay
        of a multitude of conditions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In thus evolving a view of
        existence which cannot be interpreted in either monistic or pluralistic
        terms, the Abhidhamma accords with the &quot;middle doctrine&quot; of
        early Buddhism. This doctrine avoids both the eternalist view of
        existence which maintains that everything exists absolutely (<i>sabbat
        atthi</i>)14 and the opposite nihilistic view which maintains that
        absolutely nothing exists (<i>sabbat natthi</i>).15 It also avoids, on
        the one hand, the monistic view that everything is reducible to a common
        ground, some sort of self-substance (<i>sabbat ekattat</i>)16 and, on
        the other, the opposite pluralistic view that the whole of existence is
        resolvable into a concatenation of discrete entities (<i>sabbat
        puthuttat</i>).17 Transcending these two pairs of extremist views, the
        middle doctrine explains that phenomena arise in dependence on other
        phenomena without a self-subsisting noumenon which serves as the ground
        of their being.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The inter-connection and
        inter-dependence of these <i>dhammas</i> are not explained on the basis
        of the dichotomy between substance and quality. Consequently, a given <i>dhamma</i>
        does not inhere in another as its quality, nor does it serve another as
        its substance. The so-called substance is only a product of our
        imagination. The distinction between substance and quality is denied
        because such a distinction leaves the door open for the intrusion of the
        doctrine of a substantial self (<i>attavada</i>) with all that it
        entails. Hence it is with reference to causes and conditions that the
        inter-connection of the <i>dhammas</i> should be understood. The
        conditions are not different from the <i>dhammas</i>, for it is the <i>dhammas</i>
        themselves that constitute the conditions. How each <i>dhamma</i> serves
        as a condition (<i>paccaya</i>) for the origination of another (<i>paccayuppanna</i>)
        is explained on the basis of the system of conditioned genesis (<i>paccayakara-naya</i>).18
        This system, which consists of twenty-four conditions, aims at
        demonstrating the inter-dependence and dependent co-origination (<i>paticca-samuppada</i>)
        of all <i>dhammas</i> in respect of both their temporal sequence and
        their spatial concomitance.</font></p>

        after its formulation, as a reaction against it, there emerged what came
        to be known as <i>puggalavada</i> or &quot;personalism,&quot; 19 a
        philosophical theory that led to a further clarification of the nature
        of <i>dhammas</i>. Now here it may be noted that according to the early
        Buddhist discourses there is no denial as such of the concept of the
        person (<i>puggala</i>), if by &quot;person&quot; is understood, not an
        enduring entity distinct from the five <i>khandhas</i> nor an agent
        within the <i>khandhas</i>, but simply the sum total of the five
        causally connected and ever-changing <i>khandhas</i>. From the point of
        view of the <i>dhamma</i>-analysis, this can be restated by substituting
        the term <i>dhamma</i> for the term <i>khandha</i>, for the <i>dhammas </i>are
        the factors that obtain by analysis of the <i>khandhas</i>.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">However, this way of
        defining the concept of person (<i>puggala</i>) did not satisfy some
        Buddhists. In their opinion the <i>dhamma </i>theory as presented by the
        Theravadins led to a complete depersonalization of the individual being
        and consequently failed to provide adequate explanations of such
        concepts as rebirth and moral responsibility. Hence these thinkers
        insisted on positing the person (<i>puggala</i>) as an additional
        reality distinct from the <i>khandhas</i> or <i>dhammas</i>. As recorded
        in the <i>Kathavatthu</i>, the &quot;Points of Controversy,&quot; the
        main contention of the Puggalavadins or &quot;Personalists&quot; is that
        the person is known in a real and ultimate sense (<i>saccikatthaparamatthena
        upalabbhati</i>).20 Against this proposition a number of
        counter-arguments are adduced, which need not concern us here. What
        interests us, however, is that in denying that the person is known in a
        real and ultimate sense, the Theravadins admit that the <i>khandhas</i>
        or <i>dhammas</i> are known in a real and ultimate sense. Thus in their
        view what is real and ultimate is not the person but the <i>khandhas </i>or
        <i>dhammas</i> that enter into its composition.21</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now the use of the two
        words, <i>saccikattha</i> and <i>paramattha</i> (&quot; real and
        ultimate&quot; ) as indicative of the nature of <i>dhammas</i> seems to
        give the impression that in denying the reality of the person the
        Theravadins have overstressed the reality of the <i>dhammas</i>. Does
        this amount to the admission that the <i>dhammas</i> are real and
        discrete entities existing in their own right? Such a conclusion, it
        appears to us, is not tenable. For if the <i>dhammas </i>are defined as
        real and ultimate, this means, not that they partake of the nature of
        absolute entities, but that they are not further reducible to any other
        reality, to some kind of substance which underlies them. That is to say,
        there is no &quot;behind the scenes&quot; substance from which they
        emerge and to which they finally return. This means, in effect, that the
        <i>dhammas</i> represent the final limits of the Abhidhammic analysis of
        empirical existence. Hence this new definition does not erode the
        empirical foundation of the <i>dhamma </i>theory as presented by the
        Theravadins. Moreover, this view is quite consonant with the statement
        occurring in the earlier texts that the <i>dhammas </i>come to be
        without having been (<i>ahutva sambhonti</i>) and disappear without any
        residue (<i>hutva pativenti</i>).22</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Why, unlike the <i>dhammas,
        </i>the person (<i>puggala</i>) is not recognized as real and ultimate
        needs explanation. Since the person is the sum total of the causally
        connected mental and corporeal <i>dhammas </i>that constitute the
        empiric individual, it lends itself to further analysis. And what is
        subject to analysis cannot be an irreducible datum of cognition. The
        opposite situation is true of the <i>dhammas</i>. This brings into focus
        two levels of reality: that which is amenable to analysis and that which
        defies further analysis. Analysability is the mark of composite things,
        and non-analysability the mark of the elementary constituents, the <i>dhammas</i>.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Another doctrinal
        controversy that has left its mark on the Theravada version of the <i>dhamma
        </i>theory is the one concerning the theory of tri-temporal existence (<i>sarvamastivada</i>).
        What is revolutionary about this theory, advanced by the Sarvastivadins,
        is that it introduced a metaphysical dimension to the doctrine of <i>dhammas</i>
        and thus paved the way for the erosion of its empirical foundation. For
        this theory makes an empirically unverifiable distinction between the
        actual being of the <i>dhammas </i>as phenomena and their ideal being as
        noumena. It assumes that the substances of all <i>dhammas</i> persist in
        all the three divisions of time -- past, present, and future -- while
        their manifestations as phenomena are impermanent and subject to change.
        Accordingly, a <i>dhamma</i> actualizes itself only in the present
        moment of time, but &quot;in essence&quot; it continues to subsist in
        all the three temporal periods. As is well known, this resulted in the
        transformation of the <i>dhamma </i>theory into a <i>svabhavavada</i>,
        &quot;the doctrine of own-nature.&quot; It also paved the way for a
        veiled recognition, if not for a categorical assumption, of the
        distinction between substance and quality. What interests us here is the
        fact that although the Theravadins rejected this metaphysical theory of
        tri-temporal existence, including its qualified version as accepted by
        the Kasyapiyas,23 it was not without its influence on the Theravada
        version of the <i>dhamma </i>theory.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This influence is to be
        seen in the post-canonical exegetical literature of Sri Lanka where, for
        the first time, the term <i>sabhava</i> (Skt <i>svabhava</i>) came to be
        used as a synonym for <i>dhamma</i>. Hence the recurrent definition:
        &quot;<i>Dhammas</i> are so called because they bear their own
        nature&quot; (<i>attano sabhavat dharenti ti dhamma</i>).24 Now the
        question that arises here is whether the Theravadins used the term <i>sabhava</i>
        in the same sense as the Sarvastivadins did. Did the Theravadins assume
        the metaphysical view that the substance of a <i>dhamma</i> persists
        throughout the three phases of time? In other words, does this amount to
        the admission that there is a duality between the <i>dhamma</i> and its <i>sabhava</i>,
        between the bearer and the borne, a dichotomy which goes against the
        grain of the Buddhist doctrine of <i>anatta</i>?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This situation has to be
        considered in the context of the logical apparatus used by the
        Abhidhammikas in defining the <i>dhammas</i>. This involves three main
        kinds of definition. The first is called agency definition (<i>kattu-sadhana</i>)
        because it attributes agency to the thing to be defined. Such, for
        example, is the definition of <i>citta </i>(consciousness) as &quot;that
        which thinks&quot; (<i>cinteti ti cittat</i>).25 The second is called
        instrumental definition (<i>karana-sadhana</i>) because it attributes
        instrumentality to the thing to be defined. Such, for example, is the
        definition of <i>citta </i>as &quot;that through which one thinks&quot;
        (<i>cinteti ti etena cittat</i>).26 The third is called definition by
        nature (<i>bhava-sadhana</i>) whereby the abstract nature of the thing
        to be defined is brought into focus. Such, for example, is the
        definition,&quot; The mere act of thinking itself is <i>citta</i> (<i>cintanamattam
        eva cittat</i>).&quot; 27</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The first two kinds of
        definition, it is maintained, are provisional and as such are not valid
        from an ultimate point of view.28 This is because the attribution of
        agency and instrumentality invests a <i>dhamma</i> with a duality when
        it is actually a unitary and unique phenomenon. Such attribution also
        leads to the wrong assumption that a given <i>dhamma</i> is a substance
        with inherent qualities or an agent which performs some kind of action.
        Such definitions are said to be based on tentative attribution (<i>samaropana</i>)29
        and thus are not ultimately valid.30 It is as a matter of convention (<i>vohara</i>),
        and for the sole purpose of facilitating the grasp of the idea to be
        conveyed,31 that a duality is assumed by the mind in defining the <i>dhamma</i>,
        which is actually devoid of such duality.32 Thus both agency and
        instrumental definitions are resorted to for the convenience of
        description, and as such they are not to be understood in their direct
        literal sense. On the other hand, what is called definition by nature (<i>bhavasadhana</i>)
        is the one that is admissible in an ultimate sense.33 This is because
        this type of definition brings into focus the real nature of a given <i>dhamma
        </i>without attributing agency or instrumentality to it, an attribution
        which creates the false notion that there is a duality within a unitary <i>dhamma</i>.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is in the context of
        these implications that the definition of <i>dhamma</i> as that which
        bears its own nature has to be understood. Clearly, this is a definition
        according to agency (<i>kattu-sadhana</i>), and hence its validity is
        provisional. From this definition, therefore, one cannot conclude that a
        given <i>dhamma</i> is a substantial bearer of its qualities or
        &quot;own-nature.&quot; The duality between <i>dhamma</i> and <i>sabhava</i>
        is only an attribution made for the convenience of definition. For in
        actual fact both terms denote the same actuality. Hence it is
        categorically stated that apart from <i>sabhava</i> there is no distinct
        entity called a <i>dhamma</i>,34 and that the term <i>sabhava</i>
        signifies the mere fact of being a <i>dhamma</i>.35</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If the <i>dhamma</i> has no
        function distinct from its <i>sabhava</i>,36 and if <i>dhamma</i> and <i>sabhava</i>
        denote the same thing,37 why is the <i>dhamma</i> invested with the
        function of bearing its own-nature? For this implies the recognition of
        an agency distinct from the <i>dhamma</i>. This, it is observed, is done
        not only to conform with the inclinations of those who are to be
        instructed,38 but also to impress upon us the fact that there is no
        agent behind the <i>dhamma</i>.39 The point being emphasized is that the
        dynamic world of sensory experience is not due to causes other than the
        self-same <i>dhammas</i> into which it is finally reduced. It is the
        inter-connection of the <i>dhammas</i> through causal relations that
        explains the variety and diversity of contingent existence and not some
        kind of transempirical reality which serves as their metaphysical
        ground. Nor is it due to the fiat of a Creator God40 because there is no
        Divine Creator over and above the flow of mental and material
        phenomena.41</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Stated otherwise, the
        definition of <i>dhamma</i> as that which bears its own-nature means
        that any <i>dhamma</i> represents a distinct fact of empirical existence
        which is not shared by other <i>dhammas</i>. Hence <i>sabhava</i> is
        also defined as that which is not held in common by others (<i>anannasadharana</i>),42
        as the nature peculiar to each <i>dhamma</i> (<i>avenika-sabhava</i>),43
        and as the own-nature is not predicable of other <i>dhammas</i> (<i>asadharana-sabhava</i>)<i>.</i>44
        It is also observed that if the <i>dhammas </i>are said to have
        own-nature (<i>saka-bhava </i>=<i> sabhava</i>), this is only a
        tentative device to drive home the point that there is no other-nature (<i>para-bhava</i>)
        from which they emerge and to which they finally lapse.45</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now this commentarial
        definition of <i>dhamma</i> as <i>sabhava</i> poses an important
        problem, for it seems to go against an earlier Theravada tradition
        recorded in the <i>Patisambhidamagga</i>. This canonical text
        specifically states that the five aggregates are devoid of own-nature (<i>sabhavena-sunnat</i>).46
        Since the <i>dhammas </i>are the elementary constituents of the five
        aggregates, this should mean that the <i>dhammas</i>, too, are devoid of
        own-nature. What is more, does not the very use of the term <i>sabhava</i>,
        despite all the qualifications under which it is used, give the
        impression that a given <i>dhamma</i> exists in its own right? And does
        this not amount to the admission that a <i>dhamma</i> is some kind of
        substance?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The commentators were not
        unaware of these implications and they therefore took the necessary
        steps to forestall such a conclusion. This they sought to do by
        supplementing the former definition with another which actually
        nullifies the conclusion that the <i>dhammas</i> might be
        quasi-substances. This additional definition states that a <i>dhamma</i>
        is not that which bears its own-nature, but that which is borne by its
        own conditions (<i>paccayehi dhariyanti ti dhamma</i>).47 Whereas the
        earlier definition is agent-denotation (<i>kattusadhana</i>) because it
        attributes an active role to the <i>dhamma</i>, elevating it to the
        position of an agent, the new definition is object-denotation (<i>kamma-sadhana</i>)
        because it attributes a passive role to the <i>dhamma</i> and thereby
        downgrades it to the position of an object. What is radical about this
        new definition is that it reverses the whole process which otherwise
        might culminate in the conception of <i>dhammas</i> as substances or
        bearers of their own-nature. What it seeks to show is that, far from
        being a bearer, a <i>dhamma</i> is being <i>borne</i> by its own
        conditions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Consonant with this
        situation, it is also maintained that there is no other thing called a <i>dhamma</i>
        than the &quot;quality&quot; of being borne by conditions.48 The same
        idea is expressed in the oft-recurrent statement that what is called a <i>dhamma</i>
        is the mere fact of occurrence due to appropriate conditions.49 In point
        of fact, in commenting upon the <i>Patisambhidamagga</i> statement that
        the five aggregates -- and, by implication, the <i>dhammas</i> -- are
        devoid of <i>sabhava</i>, the commentator observes that since the
        aggregates have no self-nature, they are devoid of own-nature.50 It will
        thus be seen that although the term <i>sabhava</i> is used as a synonym
        for <i>dhamma</i>, it is interpreted in such a way that it means the
        very absence of <i>sabhava</i> in any sense that implies a substantial
        mode of being.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Another common definition
        of <i>dhamma</i> is that which bears its own characteristic, <i>salakkhana</i>.51
        Since <i>salakkhana</i> is used in the same sense as <i>sabhava</i>,
        this definition carries more or less the same implications. That each <i>dhamma</i>
        has its own characteristic is illustrated with reference to colour,
        which is one of the secondary material elements. Although colour is
        divisible as blue, yellow, etc., the characteristic peculiar to all
        varieties of colour is their visibility (<i>sanidassanata</i>).52 Hence
        it is also called <i>paccatta-lakkhana</i>, individual characteristic.53
        As in the case of <i>dhamma</i> and <i>sabhava</i>, so in the case of <i>dhamma</i>
        and <i>salakkhana</i>, too, their duality is only a convenient
        assumption made for the purpose of definition. For it is a case of
        attributing duality to that which has no duality.54 And since it is only
        an attribution it is based on interpretation (<i>kappanasiddha</i>)55
        and not on actuality (<i>bhavasiddha</i>).56 Hence the definition of
        earth element (<i>pathavi-dhatu</i>) as &quot;that which has&quot; the
        characteristic of solidity (<i>kakkha&quot;atta-lakkhana</i>)57 is said
        to be invalid from an ultimate point of view, because of the assumed
        duality between the earth element and its characteristic. The correct
        definition is the one which states that solidity itself is the earth
        element, for this does not assume a distinction between the
        characteristic and what is characterized thereby.58</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As the own-characteristic (<i>salakkhana</i>)
        represents the characteristic peculiar to each <i>dhamma</i>, the
        universal characteristics (<i>samanna-lakkhana</i>) are the
        characteristics common to all the <i>dhammas</i>. If the former is
        individually predicable, the latter are universally predicable.59 Their
        difference goes still further. As the own-characteristic is another name
        for the <i>dhamma</i>, it represents a fact having an objective
        counterpart. It is not a product of mental construction (<i>kappana</i>)60
        but an actual datum of objective existence and as such an ultimate datum
        of sense experience. On the other hand, what is called universal
        characteristic has no objective existence because it is a product of
        mental construction, the synthetic function of mind, and is superimposed
        on the ultimate data of empirical existence.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On this interpretation, the
        three characteristics of conditioned reality (<i>sankhata-lakkhana</i>)
        -- namely, origination (<i>uppada</i>), cessation (<i>vaya</i>), and the
        alteration of that which exists (<i>thitassa annathatta</i>) -- are
        universal characteristics (<i>samanna-lakkhana</i>). Because they have
        no objective reality they are not elevated to the status of <i>dhammas</i>.
        If they were to be so elevated, that would undermine the very foundation
        of the <i>dhamma</i> theory. If, for instance, origination (<i>uppada</i>),
        subsistence (<i>thiti</i>), and dissolution (<i>bhanga</i>)61 are
        postulated as real and discrete entities, then it would be necessary to
        postulate another set of secondary characteristics to account for their
        own origination, subsistence, and dissolution, thus resulting in an
        infinite regress (<i>anavatthana</i>).62 This is the significance of the
        commentarial observation: &quot;It is not correct to assume that
        origination originates, decay decays, and cessation ceases because such
        an assumption leads to the fallacy of infinite regress.&quot; 63 The
        difference between the particular characteristic and the universal
        characteristic is also shown in the way they become knowable (<i>neyya</i>),
        for while the particular characteristic is known as a datum of sense
        perception (<i>paccakkha-nana</i>), the universal characteristic is
        known through a process of inference (<i>anumananana</i>).64</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In what sense the <i>dhammas</i>
        represent the final limits into which empirical existence can be
        analysed is another question that drew the attention of the Theravada
        commentators. It is in answer to this that the term <i>paramattha</i>
        came to be used as another expression for <i>dhamma</i>. It was noted
        earlier that the use of this term in this sense was occasioned by the
        Theravadins' response to the Puggalavadins' assertion that the person
        exists as real and ultimate. In the Abhidhammic exegesis this term <i>paramattha</i>
        is defined to mean that which has reached its highest (<i>uttama</i>),65
        implying thereby that the <i>dhammas</i> are ultimate existents with no
        possibility of further reduction. Hence own-nature (<i>sabhava</i>) came
        to be further defined as ultimate nature (<i>paramattha-sabhava</i>).66</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The term <i>paramattha</i>
        is sometimes paraphased as <i>bhutattha</i> (the actual).67 This is
        explained to mean that the <i>dhammas</i> are not non-existent like an
        illusion or mirage or like the soul (<i>purisa</i>) and primordial
        nature (<i>pakati</i>) of the non-Buddhist schools of thought.68 The
        evidence for their existence is not based either on conventions (<i>sammuti</i>)
        or on mere scriptural authority (<i>anussava</i>).69 On the contrary,
        their very existence is vouchsafed by their own intrinsic nature.70 The
        very fact of their existence is the very mark of their reality. As the <i>Visuddhimagga</i>
        observes: &quot;It (= <i>dhamma</i>) is that which, for those who
        examine it with the eye of understanding, is not misleading like an
        illusion, deceptive like a mirage, or undiscoverable like the self of
        the sectarians, but is rather the domain of noble knowledge as the real
        unmisleading actual state.&quot; 71 The kind of existence implied here
        is not past or future existence, but present actual and verifiable
        existence (<i>satvijjamanata</i>).72 This emphasis on their actuality in
        the present phase of time rules out any association with the
        Sarvastivadins' theory of tri-temporal existence. Thus, for the
        Theravadin, the use of the term <i>paramattha</i> does not carry any
        substantialist implications. It only means that the mental and material <i>dhammas</i>
        represent the utmost limits to which the analysis of empirical existence
        can be pushed.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The description of <i>dhammas</i>
        as <i>paramattha</i> means not only their objective existence (<i>paramatthato
        vijjamanata</i>) but also their cognizability in an ultimate sense (<i>paramatthato
        upalabbhamanata</i>).73 The first refers to the fact that the <i>dhammas</i>
        obtain as the ultimate, irreducible data of empirical existence. The
        second refers to the fact that, as such, the content of our cognition
        can also be finally analysed into the self-same elements. This is not to
        suggest that it is only the <i>dhammas</i> that become objects of
        knowledge; for it is specifically stated that even <i>pannattis</i>,
        i.e. concepts, which are the products of the synthetical function of the
        mind and hence lack objective counterparts, are also knowable (<i>neyya</i>).74</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In point of fact, in the
        technical terminology of the Abhidhamma, the term <i>dhamma</i> is
        sometimes used in a wider sense to include anything that is knowable.75
        In this sense, not only the ultimate realities -- the <i>dhammas</i>
        proper -- but also the products of mental interpretation are called <i>dhammas</i>.
        To distinguish the two, the latter are called <i>asabhava-dhammas</i>,
        i.e. <i>dhammas</i> devoid of objective reality.76 The use of this term
        in this wider sense is reminiscent of its earlier meaning as shown in
        the Pali Nikayas, where it is used in a very general sense to include
        all cognizable things on the empirical level. However, there is this
        situation to be noted: Although both <i>dhammas</i> and concepts (<i>pannattis</i>
        or <i>asabhava-dhammas</i>) constitute the content of knowledge, it is
        into the <i>dhammas</i> that the content of knowledge can be finally
        analysed. Thus there is a close parallelism between the <i>dhammas</i>
        on the one hand and the contents of knowledge on the other. That is to
        say, the ultimate irreducible data of cognition are the subjective
        counterparts of the ultimate irreducible data of objective existence.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If the term <i>paramattha</i>
        brings into focus the irreducibility of the <i>dhammas</i>, the term <i>aviparitabhava</i>
        shows their irreversibility.77 This term means that the essential
        characteristic of a <i>dhamma</i> is non-alterable and non-transferable
        to any other <i>dhamma</i>.78 It also means that it is impossible for a
        given <i>dhamma</i> to undergo any modification of its specific
        characteristic even when it is in association with some other <i>dhamma</i>.79
        The same situation remains true despite the differences in the time
        factor, for there is no modification in the nature of a <i>dhamma</i>
        corresponding to the divisions in time.80 Since a <i>dhamma</i> and its
        intrinsic nature are the same (for the duality is only posited for
        purposes of explanation), to claim that its intrinsic nature undergoes
        modification is to deny its very existence.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The relative position of
        the <i>dhammas</i> is another aspect of the subject that requires
        clarification. Do they harmoniously blend into a unity or do they divide
        themselves into a plurality? In this connection we may do well to
        examine two of their important characteristics. One is their actual
        inseparability (<i>satsatthata</i>, <i>avinibbhogata</i>),81 the other
        their conditioned origination (<i>sappaccayata</i>).82</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The first refers to the
        fact that in a given instance of mind or matter, the elementary
        constituents (= <i>dhammas</i>) that enter into its composition are not
        actually separable one from another. They exist in a state of
        inseparable association forming, so to say, a homogeneous unity. This
        idea is in consonance with an earlier tradition recorded in the early
        Buddhist discourses. For example, in the Mahavedalla Sutta of the
        Majjhima Nikaya it is said that the three mental factors -- sensation (<i>vedana</i>),
        perception (<i>sanna</i>), and consciousness (<i>vinnana</i>) -- are
        blended (<i>satsattha</i>) so harmoniously that it is impossible to
        separate them from one another and thus establish their identity.83 The
        same idea finds expression in the <i>Milindapanha</i>.84 When Nagasena
        Thera is asked by King Milinda whether it is possible, in the case of
        mental factors which exist in harmonious combination (<i>ekato bhavagata</i>),
        to separate them out and establish a plurality as: &quot;This is
        contact, and this sensation, and this mentation, and this
        perception,&quot; and so on, the elder answers with a simile:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Suppose, O king, the
        cook in the royal household were to make a syrup or a sauce and were to
        put into it curds, and salt, and ginger, and cumin seed, and pepper and
        other ingredients. And suppose the king were to say to him: Pick out
        for me the flavours of the curds and of the salt, and of the ginger, and
        of the cumin seed, and of the pepper, and of all the things you have put
        into it.' Now would it be possible, great king, separating off one from
        another those flavours that had thus run together, to pick out each one,
        so that one could say: Here is the sourness, and here the saltiness,
        and here the pungency, and here the acidity, and here the astringency,
        and here the sweetness'?&quot; 85</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In like manner, it is
        maintained, we should understand the position of the mental <i>dhammas</i>
        in relation to one another.86</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This situation is true of
        the material <i>dhammas</i>, too. In this connection the <i>Atthasalini </i>adds
        that the material <i>dhammas</i>, such as colour, taste, odour, etc.,
        cannot be separated from one another like particles of sand.87 The
        colour of the mango, for instance, cannot be physically separated from
        its taste or odour. They remain in inseparable association. This is what
        is called positional inseparability (<i>padesato avinibbhogata</i>).88
        On the basis of this principle of positional inseparability it is
        maintained that there is no quantitative difference (<i>pamanato</i>)
        among the material elements that enter into the composition of material
        objects. The difference is only qualitative. And this qualitative
        difference is based on what is called <i>ussada</i>, i.e. intensity or
        extrusion.89 To give an example: As the four primary elements of matter
        are invariably present in every instance of matter, for they are
        necessarily co-existent (<i>sahajata</i>) and positionally inseparable (<i>padesato
        avinibbhoga</i>),90 the question arises why there is a diversity in
        material objects. The diversity, it is maintained, is not due to a
        difference in quantity (<i>pamana</i>) but to a difference in intensity
        (<i>ussada</i>).91 That is to say, in a given material object one
        primary element is more intense than the others. For instance, in a
        relatively solid thing such as a stone, although all the primary
        elements are present, the earth element is more intense or
        &quot;extruded&quot; than the others. So is the water element in
        liquids, the heat element in fire, and the air element in gases.92</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The best illustration for
        the relative position of the material elements is given in the <i>Visuddhimagga</i>
        where it is said: &quot;And just as whomsoever the great creatures such
        as the spirits grasp hold of (possess), they have no standing place
        either inside him or outside him and yet they have no standing
        independently of him, so too these elements are not found to stand
        either inside or outside each other, yet they have no standing
        independently of one another.&quot; 93 This explanation is justified on
        the following grounds: If they were to exist inside each other, then
        they would not perform their respective functions. If they were to exist
        outside each other, then they would be resolvable.94 The principle of
        positional inseparability is also resorted to as a critique of the
        distinction between substance and quality. Hence it is contended that in
        the case of material elements which are positionally inseparable it is
        not possible to say: &quot;This is the quality of that one and that is
        the quality of this one.&quot; 95</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The foregoing observations
        should show that the mental as well as the material <i>dhammas</i> are
        not actually separable one from another. In the case of the mental <i>dhammas</i>,
        the term used is <i>satsattha</i> (conjoined); in the case of the
        material <i>dhammas</i>, the term used is <i>avinibbhoga</i>
        (inseparable). This raises the question why the <i>dhammas</i> are
        presented as a plurality. The answer is that, although they are not
        actually separable, yet they are distinguishable (<i>vibhagavanta</i>)
        one from another.96 It is this distinguishability that serves as the
        foundation of the <i>dhamma </i>theory. Hence it is often mentioned in
        the Pali sub-commentaries that the real nature of the things that are
        distinguishable can be brought into focus only through analysis.97 This
        distinguishability is possible because although the <i>dhammas</i> are
        harmoniously blended (<i>ekato bhavagata</i>), they are cognized
        severally (<i>gocarananattata</i>)98 and are thus established as if they
        were separate entities. It is, however, maintained that material <i>dhammas</i>
        are much more easily distinguished than mental <i>dhammas</i>.99 Thus,
        for instance, the distinction between colour, odour, taste, tactation,
        etc., is easy even for an ordinary person to make, while to distinguish
        mental phenomena one from another is said to be the most difficult task
        of all. This situation is well illustrated in the following reply given
        by Nagasena Thera to King Milinda:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Suppose, O king, a
        man were to wade down into the sea, and taking some water in the palm of
        his hand, were to taste it with his tongue. Would he distinguish whether
        it were water from the Jumna, or from the Aciravati, or from the Mahi?
        More difficult than that, great king, is it to distinguish between the
        mental conditions which follow on the exercise of any one of the organs
        of sense, telling us that such is contact, and such sensation, and such
        idea, and such intention, and such thought.&quot; 100</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The other characteristic
        which was referred to earlier is the conditioned origination (<i>sappaccayata</i>)
        of the <i>dhammas</i>. This is akin to the conception discussed above,
        for it also seeks to explain the nature of the <i>dhammas</i> from a
        synthetic point of view. In this connection five postulates are
        recognized as axiomatic, either implicitly or explicitly:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) It is not empirically
          possible to identify an absolute original cause of the
          &quot;dhammic&quot; process. Such a metaphysical conception is not in
          accord with Buddhism's empirical doctrine of causality, the purpose of
          which is not to explain how the world began but to describe the
          uninterrupted continuity of the satsaric process whose absolute
          beginning is not conceivable.101 In this connection it must also be
          remembered that as a system of philosophy the Abhidhamma is
          descriptive and not speculative.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) Nothing arises
          without the appropriate conditions necessary for its origination. This
          rules out the theory of fortuitous origination (<i>adhiccasamuppannavada</i>).102</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) Nothing arises from
          a single cause. This rules out theories of a single cause (<i>ekakaranavada</i>).103
          Their rejection is of great significance, showing that the Abhidhammic
          view of existence rejects all monistic theories which seek to explain
          the origin of the world from a single cause, whether this single cause
          is conceived as a personal God or an impersonal Godhead. It also
          serves as a critique of those metaphysical theories which attempt to
          reduce the world of experience to an underlying transempirical
          principle.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) Nothing arises
          singly, as a solitary phenomenon.104 Thus on the basis of a single
          cause or on the basis of a plurality of causes, a single effect does
          not arise. The invariable situation is that there is always a
          plurality of effects. It is on the rejection of the four views
          referred to above that the Abhidhammic doctrine of conditionality is
          founded.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(v) From a plurality of
          conditions a plurality of effects takes place. Applied to the <i>dhamma
          </i>theory, this means that a multiplicity of <i>dhammas</i> brings
          about a multiplicity of other <i>dhammas</i>.105</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One implication that
        follows from the conditionality of the <i>dhammas</i> as discussed so
        far is that they invariably arise as clusters. This is true of both
        mental and material <i>dhammas</i>. Hence it is that whenever
        consciousness (<i>citta</i>) arises, together with it there arise at
        least seven mental concomitants (<i>cetasika</i>), namely, contact (<i>phassa</i>),
        sensation (<i>vedana</i>), perception (<i>sanna</i>), volition (<i>cetana</i>),
        one-pointedness (<i>ekaggata</i>), psychic life (<i>arupa-jivitindriya</i>),
        and attention (<i>manasikara</i>). These seven are called universal
        mental factors (<i>sabbacitta-sadharana</i>) because they are invariably
        present even in the most minimal unit of consciousness. Thus a psychic
        instance can never occur with less than eight constituents, i.e.
        consciousness and its seven invariable concomitants. Their relation is
        one of necessary conascence (<i>sahajata</i>). We thus can see that even
        the smallest psychic unit or moment of consciousness turns out to be a
        complex correlational system. In the same way, the smallest unit of
        matter, which is called the basic octad (<i>suddhatthaka</i>), is in the
        ultimate analysis a cluster of (eight) material elements, namely, the
        four primary elements -- earth, water, fire, and air -- and four of the
        secondaries, colour, odour, taste, and nutritive essence (<i>oja</i>).
        None of these eight material elements arises singly because they are
        necessarily conascent (<i>niyata-sahajata</i>) and positionally
        inseparable (<i>padesato avinibbhoga</i>).106 It will thus be seen that
        in the sphere of mind as well as in the domain of matter there are no
        solitary phenomena.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is in the light of these
        observations that the question posed earlier as to whether the <i>dhammas</i>
        exhibit a unity or a plurality has to be discussed. The answer seems to
        veer towards both alternatives although it appears paradoxical to say
        so. In so far as the <i>dhammas</i> are distinguishable, one from
        another, to that extent they exhibit plurality. In so far as they are
        not actually separable, one from another, to that extent they exhibit
        unity. The reason for this situation is the methodological apparatus
        employed by the Abhidhammikas in explaining the nature of empirical
        existence. As mentioned earlier, this consists of both analysis (<i>bheda</i>)
        and synthesis (<i>sangaha</i>). Analysis, when not supplemented by
        synthesis, leads to pluralism. Synthesis, when not supplemented by
        analysis, leads to monism. What one finds in the Abhidhamma is a <i>combined
        use</i> of both methods. This results in a philosophical vision which
        beautifully transcends the dialectical opposition between monism and
        pluralism.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">W</font></font><font face="Times New Roman">hat
        emerges from this Abhidhammic doctrine of <i>dhammas</i> is a critical
        realism, one which (unlike idealism) recognizes the distinctness of the
        world from the experiencing subject yet also distinguishes between those
        types of entities that truly exist independently of the cognitive act
        and those that owe their being to the act of cognition itself. How does
        this doctrine interpret the &quot;common-sense&quot; view of the world,
        a kind of naive realism in the sense that it tends to recognize
        realities more or less corresponding to all linguistic terms? In other
        words, what relation is there between the <i>dhammas</i>, the ultimate
        elements of existence, and the objects of common-sense realism? What
        degree of reality, if any, could be bestowed on the latter?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is in their answers to
        these questions that the Abhidhammikas formulated the theory of <i>pannatti</i>
        -- concepts or designations -- together with a distinction drawn between
        two kinds of truth, conventional (<i>sammuti</i>) and absolute (<i>paramattha</i>).
        This theory assumes significance in another context. In most of the
        Indian philosophies which were associated with the <i>atma</i>-tradition
        and subscribed to a substantialist view of existence, such categories as
        time and space came to be defined in absolute terms. The problem for the
        Abhidhammikas was how to explain such categories without committing
        themselves to the same metaphysical assumptions. The theory of <i>pannatti
        </i>was the answer to this.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What may be described as
        the first formal definition of <i>pannatti </i>occurs in the <i>Dhammasangani</i>.107
        Here the three terms, <i>pannatti</i>, <i>nirutti,</i> and <i>adhivacana
        </i>are used synonymously and each term is defined by lumping together a
        number of appropriate equivalents. In Mrs. Rhys Davids' translation:
        &quot;That which is an enumeration, that which is a designation, an
        expression (<i>pannatti</i>), a current term, a name, a denomination,
        the assigning of a name, an interpretation, a distinctive mark of
        discourse on this or that <i>dhamma</i>.&quot; 108 Immediately after
        this definition, a &quot;predication of equipollent terms,&quot; 109 it
        is observed that all the <i>dhammas</i> constitute the pathway of <i>pannattis</i>
        (<i>sabbe dhamma pannatti-patha</i>).110</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As shown by this
        definition, designation is the <i>pannatti</i>; what is designated
        thereby is the <i>pannatti-patha</i>. Whether the term <i>pannatti</i>,
        as used here, denotes the individual names given to each and every <i>dhamma</i>
        only, or whether it also denotes names assigned to various combinations
        of the <i>dhammas</i>, is not explicitly stated. According to the
        Abhidhamma, it may be noted, every combination of the objectively real <i>dhammas</i>
        represents a nominal reality, not an objective reality. The fact that
        the term <i>pannatti</i> includes names of both categories, the
        objective and the nominal, is suggested not only by what is stated
        elsewhere in the Abhidhamma Pitaka,111 but also by the later
        exegesis.112 We may conclude then that according to the <i>Dhammasangani</i>
        definition, <i>pannatti</i> denotes all names, terms, and symbols that
        are expressive of the real existents as well as of their combinations in
        different forms.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Another important fact that
        should not be overlooked here is that according to the later exegesis <i>pannatti
        </i>includes not only names (<i>nama</i>) but also ideas corresponding
        to them (<i>attha</i>).113 Since the assignment of a designation creates
        an idea corresponding to it, we may interpret the above definition to
        include both. It is true, of course, that the <i>dhammas</i> do not
        exist in dependence on the operation of the mind, on their being
        designated by a term and conceptualized by mind. Nevertheless the
        assignment of names to the <i>dhammas</i> involves a process of
        conceptualization. Hence <i>pannatti</i> includes not only the names of
        things, whether they are real or nominal, but also all the concepts
        corresponding to them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This theory of <i>pannatti</i>,
        presented as ancillary to the doctrine of <i>dhammas</i>, is not a
        complete innovation on the part of the Abhidhamma. Such a theory is
        clearly implied in the early Buddhist analysis of empirical existence
        into the aggregates, sense bases, and elements, and the only really new
        feature in the <i>pannatti </i>theory is its systematic formulation.
        Accordingly the term &quot;person&quot; becomes a common designation (<i>sammuti</i>)
        given to a congeries of dependently originated psycho-physical factors:
        &quot;Just as there arises the name chariot' when there is a set of
        appropriate constituents, even so there comes to be this convention
        living being' when the five aggregates are present.&quot; 114 There
        is, however, this important difference to be noted: the early Buddhist
        idea of <i>sammuti</i> is not based on a formulated doctrine of real
        existents. Although what is analysed is called <i>sammuti</i>, that into
        which it is analysed is not called <i>paramattha</i>. Such a development
        is found only in the Abhidhamma, as we have already seen.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We should note that in the
        Abhidhamma, a clear distinction is drawn between <i>sammuti</i> and <i>panntti</i>.
        <i>Pannatti</i>, as we have seen, refers to terms (<i>nama</i>)
        expressive of things both real (<i>paramattha</i>) and convention-based
        (<i>sammuti</i>) and the ideas corresponding to them (<i>attha</i>). In
        contrast, <i>sammuti</i> is used in a restricted sense to mean only what
        is convention-based. It is this meaning that finds expression in the
        compound <i>sammuti-sacca</i> (conventional truth). That for the
        Abhidhamma <i>sammuti</i> is not the same as <i>pannatti</i> is also
        seen by the fact that in the <i>Dhammasangani</i> definition of <i>pannatti</i>
        quoted above, the term <i>sammuti</i> does not occur among its synonyms.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Although the theory of <i>pannatti</i>
        is formally introduced in the works of the Abhidhamma Pitaka, it is in
        the Abhidhamma commentaries that we find more specific definitions of
        the term along with many explanations on the nature and scope of <i>pannattis</i>
        and on how they become objects of cognition. For example, because <i>pannattis</i>
        are without corresponding objective reality, the commentaries call them <i>asabhava-dhammas</i>
        -- things without a real nature -- to distinguish them from the real
        elements of existence.115 Since <i>sabhava</i>, the intrinsic nature of
        a <i>dhamma</i>, is itself the <i>dhamma</i>, from the point of view of
        this definition what is qualified as <i>asabhava</i> amounts to an <i>abhava</i>,
        a non-existent in the final sense. It is in recognition of this fact
        that the three salient characteristics of empirical reality --
        origination (<i>uppada</i>), subsistence (<i>thiti</i>), and dissolution
        (<i>bhanga</i>) -- are not applied to them. For these three
        characteristics can be predicated only of those things which answer to
        the Abhidhammic definition of empirical reality.116 Again, unlike the
        real existents, <i>pannattis</i> are not brought about by conditions (<i>paccayatthitika</i>).
        For this same reason, they are also defined as &quot;not positively
        produced&quot; (<i>aparinipphanna</i>). Positive production (<i>parinipphannata</i>)
        is true only of those things which have their own individual nature (<i>avenika-sabhava</i>).117
        Only a <i>dhamma</i> that has an own-nature, with a beginning and an end
        in time, produced by conditions, and marked by the three salient
        characteristics of conditioned existence, is positively produced.118</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Further, <i>pannattis </i>differ
        from <i>dhammas</i> in that only the latter are delimited by rise and
        fall; only of the <i>dhammas </i>and not of the <i>pannattis </i>can it
        be said, &quot;They come into being having not been (<i>ahutva sambhonti</i>);
        and, after having been, they cease (<i>hutva pativenti</i>).&quot; 119 <i>Pannattis</i>
        have no own-nature to be manifested in the three instants of arising,
        presence, and dissolution. Since they have no existence marked by these
        three phases, such temporal distinctions as past, present, and future do
        not apply to them. Consequently they have no reference to time (<i>kalavimutta</i>).120
        For this self-same reason, they have no place in the traditional
        analysis of empirical existence into the five <i>khandhas</i>, for what
        is included in the <i>khandhas</i> should have the characteristics of
        empirical reality and be subject to temporal divisions.121 Another
        noteworthy characteristic of <i>pannattis </i>is that they cannot be
        described either as conditioned (<i>sankhata</i>) or as unconditioned (<i>asankhata</i>),
        for they do not possess their own-nature (<i>sabhava</i>) to be so
        described.122 Since the two categories of the conditioned and the
        unconditioned comprise all realities, the description of <i>pannattis</i>
        as exempt from these two categories is another way of underscoring their
        unreality.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What the foregoing
        observations amount to is that while a <i>dhamma</i> is a truly existent
        thing (<i>sabhavasiddha</i>), a <i>pannatti </i>is a thing merely
        conceptualized (<i>parikappasiddha</i>).123 The former is an existent
        verifiable by its own distinctive intrinsic characteristic,124 but the
        latter, being a product of the mind's synthetic function, exists only by
        virtue of thought. It is a mental construct superimposed on things and
        hence possesses no objective counterpart. It is the imposition of
        oneness on what actually is a complex (<i>samuhekaggahana</i>) that
        gives rise to <i>pannattis</i>.125 With the dissolution of the
        appearance of unity (<i>ghana-vinibbhoga</i>),126 the oneness disappears
        and the complex nature is disclosed:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus as when the component
        parts such as axles, wheels, frame, poles, etc., are arranged in a
        certain way, there comes to be the mere term of common usage
        &quot;chariot,&quot; yet in the ultimate sense, when each part is
        examined, there is no chariot, and just as when the component parts of a
        house such as wattles, etc., are placed so that they enclose a space in
        a certain way, there comes to be the mere term of common usage
        &quot;house,&quot; yet in the ultimate sense there is no house, and just
        as when trunk, branches, foliage, etc., are placed in a certain way,
        there comes to be the mere term of common usage &quot;tree,&quot; yet in
        the ultimate sense, when each component is examined, there is no tree,
        so too, when there are the five aggregates (as objects) of clinging,
        there comes to be the mere term of common usage &quot;a being,&quot;
        &quot;a person,&quot; yet in the ultimate sense, when each component is
        examined, there is no being as a basis for the assumption &quot;I
        am&quot; or &quot;I.&quot; 127</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In a similar way should be
        understood the imposition of oneness on what is complex.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Two kinds of <i>pannatti</i>
        are distinguished. One is called <i>nama-pannatti </i>and the other <i>attha-pannatti</i>.
        The first refers to names, words, signs, or symbols through which
        things, real or unreal, are designated: &quot;It is the mere mode of
        recognizing (<i>sannakaramatta</i>) by way of this or that word whose
        significance is determined by worldly convention.&quot; 128 It is
        created by worldly consent (<i>lokasanketa-nimmita</i>) and established
        by worldly usage (<i>lokavoharena siddha</i>).129 The other, called <i>attha-pannatti</i>,
        refers to ideas, notions, or concepts corresponding to the names, words,
        signs, or symbols. It is produced by the interpretative function of the
        mind (<i>kappana</i>) and is based on the various forms or appearances
        presented by the real elements when they are in particular situations or
        positions (<i>avattha-visesa</i>).130 Both <i>nama-pannatti </i>and <i>attha-pannatti
        </i>thus have a psychological origin and as such both are devoid of
        objective reality.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Nama-pannatti </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">is
        often defined as that which makes known (<i>pannapanato pannatti</i>)
        and <i>attha-pannatti</i> as that which is made known (<i>pannapiyatta
        pannatti</i>).131 The former is an instance of agency definition (<i>kattu-sadhana</i>)
        and the latter of object definition (<i>kamma-sadhana</i>). What both
        attempt to show is that <i>nama-pannatti</i> which makes <i>attha-pannatti</i>
        known, and <i>attha-pannatti</i> which is made known by <i>nama-pannatti</i>,
        are mutually inter-dependent and therefore logically inseparable. This
        explains the significance of another definition which states that <i>nama-pannatti</i>
        is the term's relationship with the ideas (<i>saddassa atthehi sambandho</i>)
        and that <i>attha-pannatti</i> is the idea's relationship with the terms
        (<i>atthassa saddehi sambandho</i>).132 These two pairs of definition
        show that the two processes of conceptualization and verbalization
        through the symbolic medium of language are but two separate aspects of
        the same phenomenon. It is for the convenience of definition that what
        really amounts to a single phenomenon is treated from two different
        angles, which represent two ways of looking at the same thing.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The difference is
        established by defining the same word, <i>pannatti</i>, in two different
        ways. When it is defined as subject it is <i>nama-pannatti</i> -- the
        concept as name. When it is defined as object it is <i>attha-pannatti</i>
        -- the concept as meaning. If the former is that which expresses (<i>vacaka</i>),
        the latter is that which is expressible (<i>vacaniya</i>).133 In this
        same sense, if the former is <i>abhidhana</i>, the latter is <i>abhidheya</i>.134
        Since <i>attha-pannatti</i> stands for the process of conceptualization
        it represents more the subjective and dynamic aspect, and since <i>nama-pannatti</i>
        stands for the process of verbalization it represents more the objective
        and static aspect. For the assignment of a term to what is constructed
        in thought -- in other words, its expression through the symbolic medium
        of language -- invests it with some kind of relative permanence and
        objectivity. It is, so to say, crystallized into an entity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now the definition of <i>attha-pannatti</i>
        as that which is made known by <i>nama-pannatti</i> gives rise to the
        question as to what its position is in relation to the real existents (<i>dhammas</i>).
        For if the real existents, too, can be made known (= <i>attha-pannatti</i>),
        on what basis are the two categories, the real and conceptual, to be
        distinguished? What should not be overlooked here is that according to
        its very definition <i>attha-pannatti</i> exists by virtue of its being
        conceived (<i>parikappiyamana</i>) and expressed (<i>pannapiyamana</i>).
        Hence it is incorrect to explain <i>attha-pannatti</i> as that which is
        conceptualizable and expressible, for its very existence stems from the
        act of being conceptualized and expressed. This rules out the
        possibility of its existing without being conceptualized and expressed.
        In the case of the <i>dhammas</i> or real existents the situation is
        quite different. While they can be made known by <i>nama-pannatti</i>,
        their existence is not dependent on their being known or conceptualized.
        Where such a real existent is made known by a <i>nama-pannatti</i>, the
        latter is called <i>vijjamana-pannatti</i>,135 because it represents
        something that exists in the real and ultimate sense (<i>paramatthato</i>).
        And the notion or concept (=&nbsp;<i>attha-pannatti</i>) corresponding
        to it is called <i>tajja-pannatti</i>, the verisimilar or appropriate
        concept.136 This does not mean that the real existent has transformed
        itself into a concept. It only means that a concept corresponding to it
        has been established.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If the doctrine of <i>dhammas</i>
        led to its ancillary theory of <i>pannatti</i> as discussed above, both
        in turn led to another development, i.e. the distinction drawn between
        two kinds of truth as <i>sammuti</i>-<i>sacca</i> (conventional truth)
        and <i>paramattha-sacca</i> (absolute truth). Although this distinction
        is an Abhidhammic innovation it is not completely dissociated from the
        early Buddhist teachings. For the antecedent trends that led to its
        formulation can be traced to the early Buddhist scriptures themselves.
        One such instance is the distinction drawn in the Anguttara Nikaya
        between <i>nitattha</i> and <i>neyyattha</i>.137 The former refers to
        those statements which have their meaning &quot;drawn out&quot; (<i>nita-attha</i>),
        i.e. to be taken as they stand, as explicit and definitive statements.
        The latter refers to those statements which require their meaning
        &quot;to be drawn out&quot; (<i>neyya-attha</i>). The distinction
        alluded to here may be understood in a broad way to mean the difference
        between the direct and the indirect meaning.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The distinction is so
        important that to overlook it is to misrepresent the teachings of the
        Buddha: &quot;Whoever declares a discourse with a meaning already drawn
        out as a discourse with a meaning to be drawn out and (conversely)
        whoever declares a discourse with a meaning to be drawn out as a
        discourse with a meaning already drawn out, such a one makes a false
        statement with regard to the Blessed One.&quot; 138 It seems very likely
        that this distinction between <i>nitattha</i> and <i>neyyattha</i> has
        provided a basis for the emergence of the subsequent doctrine of double
        truth. In point of fact, the commentary to the Anguttara Nikaya seeks to
        establish a correspondence between the original sutta-passage and the
        Theravada version of the two kinds of truth.139</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One interesting feature in
        the Theravada version of the theory is the use of the term <i>sammuti</i>
        for relative truth. For in all other schools of Buddhist thought the
        term used is <i>satvti</i>. The difference is not simply that between
        Pali and Sanskrit, for the two terms differ both in etymology and
        meaning. The term <i>sammuti</i> is derived from the root <i>man</i>, to
        think, and when prefixed with <i>sam</i> it means consent, convention,
        general agreement. On the other hand, the term <i>satvati</i> is derived
        from the root <i>va</i>, to cover, and when prefixed with<i> sam</i> it
        means covering, concealment. This difference is not confined to the
        vocabulary of the theory of double truth alone. That elsewhere, too,
        Sanskrit <i>satvati </i>corresponds to Pali <i>sammuti</i> is confirmed
        by other textual instances.140 Since <i>sammuti</i> refers to convention
        or general agreement, <i>sammuti-sacca</i> means truth based on
        convention or general agreement. On the other hand, the idea behind <i>satvati-satya</i>
        is that which covers up the true nature of things and makes them appear
        otherwise.141</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The validity of the two
        kinds of statement corresponding to <i>sammuti</i> and <i>paramattha</i>
        is set out as follows:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Statements referring to
        convention-based things (<i>sanketa</i>) are valid because they are
        based on common agreement; statements referring to ultimate categories (<i>paramattha</i>)
        are valid because they are based on the true nature of the real
        existents.142</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As shown here, the
        distinction between the two truths depends on the distinction between <i>sanketa</i>
        and <i>paramattha</i>. Now, <i>sanketa</i> includes things which depend
        for their being on mental interpretations superimposed on the category
        of the real.143 For instance, the validity of the term &quot;table&quot;
        is based, not on an objective existent corresponding to the term, but on
        mental interpretation superimposed on a congeries of material <i>dhammas
        </i>organized in a particular manner. Although a table is not a separate
        reality distinct from the material <i>dhammas</i> that enter into its
        composition, nevertheless the table is said to exist because in common
        parlance it is accepted as a separate reality. On the other hand, the
        term <i>paramattha</i> denotes the category of real existents (<i>dhammas</i>)
        which have their own objective nature (<i>sabhava</i>). Their difference
        may be set out as follows: When a particular situation is explained on
        the basis of terms indicative of the real elements of existence (the <i>dhammas</i>),
        that explanation is <i>paramattha-sacca</i>. When the self-same
        situation is explained on the basis of terms indicative of things which
        have their being dependent on the mind's synthetic function (i.e. <i>pannatti</i>),
        that explanation is <i>sammuti-sacca</i>. The validity of the former is
        based on its correspondence to the ultimate data of empirical reality.
        The validity of the latter is based on its correspondence to things
        established by conventions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As pointed out by K.N.
        Jayatilleke in his <i>Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge</i>, one
        misconception about the Theravada version of double truth is that <i>paramattha-sacca</i>
        is superior to <i>sammuti-sacca</i> and that &quot;what is true in the
        one sense is false in the other.&quot; 144 This observation that the
        distinction in question is not based on a theory of degrees of truth
        will become clear from the following free translation of the relevant
        passages contained in three commentaries:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Herein references to living
        beings, gods, Brahma, etc., are <i>sammuti-katha</i>, whereas references
        to impermanence, suffering, egolessness, the aggregates of the empiric
        individuality, the spheres and elements of sense perception and
        mind-cognition, bases of mindfulness, right effort, etc., are <i>paramattha-katha</i>.
        One who is capable of understanding and penetrating to the truth and
        hoisting the flag of arahantship when the teaching is set out in terms
        of generally accepted conventions, to him the Buddha preaches the
        doctrine based on <i>sammuti-katha</i>. One who is capable of
        understanding and penetrating to the truth and hoisting the flag of
        arahantship when the teaching is set out in terms of ultimate
        categories, to him the Buddha preaches the doctrine based on <i>paramattha-katha.</i>
        To one who is capable of awakening to the truth through <i>sammuti-katha</i>,
        the teaching is not presented on the basis of <i>paramattha-katha,</i>
        and conversely, to one who is capable of awakening to the truth through <i>paramattha-katha</i>,
        the teaching is not presented on the basis of <i>sammuti-katha</i>.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is this simile on
        this matter. Just as a teacher of the three Vedas who is capable of
        explaining their meaning in different dialects might teach his pupils,
        adopting the particular dialect which each pupil understands, even so
        the Buddha preaches the doctrine adopting, according to the suitability
        of the occasion, either the <i>sammuti</i>- or the <i>paramattha-katha</i>.
        It is by taking into consideration the ability of each individual to
        understand the Four Noble Truths that the Buddha presents his teaching
        either by way of <i>sammuti</i> or by way of <i>paramattha</i> or by way
        of both. Whatever the method adopted the purpose is the same, to show
        the way to Immortality through the analysis of mental and physical
        phenomena.145</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As shown from the above
        quotation, the penetration of the truth is possible by either teaching,
        the conventional or the ultimate, or by the combination of both. One
        method is not singled out as superior or inferior to the other. It is
        like using the dialect that a person readily understands, and there is
        no implication that one dialect is either superior or inferior to
        another. What is more, as the commentary to the Anguttara Nikaya states
        specifically, whether the Buddhas preach the doctrine according to <i>sammuti</i>
        or <i>paramattha</i>, they teach only what is true, only what accords
        with actuality, without involving themselves in what is not true (<i>amusa'va</i>).146
        The statement: &quot;The person exists&quot; (= <i>sammuti-sacca</i>) is
        not erroneous, provided one does not imagine by the person a substance
        enduring in time. Convention requires the use of such terms, but as long
        as one does not imagine substantial entities corresponding to them, such
        statements are valid.147 On the other hand, as the commentators observe,
        if for the sake of conforming to the ultimate truth one would say,
        &quot;The five aggregates eat&quot; (<i>khandha bhunjanti</i>),
        &quot;The five aggregates walk&quot; (<i>khandha gacchanti</i>), instead
        of saying: &quot;A person eats,&quot; &quot;A person walks,&quot; such a
        situation would result in what is called <i>voharabheda</i>, i.e. a
        breach of convention resulting in a breakdown in meaningful
        communication.148</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Hence in presenting the
        teaching the Buddha does not exceed linguistic conventions (<i>na hi
        Bhagava samannat atidhavati</i>),149 but uses such terms as
        &quot;person&quot; without being led astray by their superficial
        implications (<i>aparamasat voharati</i>).150 Because the Buddha is able
        to employ such linguistic designations as &quot;person&quot; and
        &quot;individual&quot; without assuming corresponding substantial
        entities, he is called &quot;skilled in expression&quot; (<i>vohara-kusala</i>).151
        The use of such terms does not in any way involve falsehood.152
        Skilfulness in the use of words is the ability to conform to conventions
        (<i>sammuti</i>), usages (<i>vohara</i>), designations (<i>pannatti</i>),
        and turns of speech (<i>nirutti</i>) in common use in the world without
        being led astray by them.153 Hence in understanding the teaching of the
        Buddha one is advised not to adhere dogmatically to the mere superficial
        meanings of words.154</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The foregoing observations
        should show that according to the Theravada version of double truth, one
        kind of truth is not held to be superior to the other. Another
        interesting conclusion to which the foregoing observations lead is that
        as far as the Theravada is concerned, the distinction between <i>sammuti-sacca</i>
        and <i>paramattha-sacca</i> does not refer to two kinds of truth as such
        but to two ways of presenting the truth. Although they are formally
        introduced as two kinds of truth, they are explained as two modes of
        expressing what is true. They do not represent two degrees of truth of
        which one is superior or inferior to the other. This explains why the
        two terms, <i>katha</i> (speech) and <i>desana</i> (discourse), are
        often used with reference to the two kinds of truth.155 In this respect
        the distinction between <i>sammuti</i> and <i>paramattha</i> corresponds
        to the distinction made in the earlier scriptures between <i>nitattha</i>
        and <i>neyyattha</i>. For, as we saw earlier, no preferential
        value-judgement is made between <i>nitattha</i> and <i>neyyattha</i>.
        All that is emphasized is that the two kinds of statement should not be
        confused. The great advantage in presenting <i>sammuti</i> and <i>paramattha</i>
