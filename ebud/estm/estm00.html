    BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF THE AUTHOR</b><br>
    </strong></font><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman"><b>(1896 - 1997)</b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman"><em><b>(Written By Mrs.
    Claudine W. Iggleden in 1985)</b></em></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">--ooOoo--</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <b>Venerable Sayadaw U Thittila</b>, <i><b>Aggamahapandita</b></i>,
    author of the following talks on the Buddhist Teaching, was born in 1896 in the town of <b><i>Pyawbwe</i></b>,
    central Burma, the centre of a rice growing district.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His father died when he was only three years old. When he
    was nine his elder and only brother died, and when he was fourteen his elder and only
    sister also died. His mother married again, a physician, but his stepfather, too, died
    later. However, at the young age of seven or eight years he was even then regularly
    frequenting the local monastery, the <b>Padigon Vihara</b>, almost daily. where he and a
    friend were taught certain scriptures by the much respected and learned incumbent there, <b>Sayadaw
    U Kavinda</b>. By the age of ten he was learning to recite certain <i>suttas</i>, and by
    the age of fifteen when he was ordained a <i>samanera</i> he already knew by heart the
    primer to <i>Abhidhamma</i> studies, the <i>Abhidhammatthasangaha</i>, also the <i>Mahasatipatthana
    Sutta </i>and <i>Kaccayana's</i> Pali Grammar. It was, though, at the age of twelve when
    his teacher, the Ven. U Kavinda, took him to Mandalay to hear a sermon on <i>Abhidhamma</i>
    that he made the decision to become a <i>bhikkhu</i>. His full ordination at the age of
    twenty eventually took place much further south in lower Burma, at Moulmein in 1916, on
    which occasion <b>Sayadaw U Okkantha</b> was his preceptor. Prior to that, when he was
    still fifteen, he and three other young <i>samaneras </i>went with their same first
    teacher to live in the forest for the practice of meditation. They spent eight months
    there, and lived amongst wild creatures of many kinds including large snakes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was not long after that he entered the <b>Masoyein
    Monastery College</b> at Mandalay. There, after intensive studies under the tuition of his
    second teacher and hard task master, <i>Sayadaw U Adiccavamsa</i>, he was selected from
    among an entry of five thousand candidates as the<i> Pathamakyaw Scholar </i>of all Burma
    in 1918. This success merely aroused in him the resolve to train and study for a further
    exceedingly strenuous long period in order to enter for the highest of all monastic
    examinations, th<i> Panyattisasanahita</i> (Mandalay). In 1923, of the one hundred and
    fifty entrants for that examination only four passed, of which he was one. Over the years
    since then the questions set for that examination have gradually been modified so that the
    possibility of attaining a pass is slightly greater than in those earlier days, and there
    are fewer and fewer now who know of the extremely high qualifications required in order to
    have been successful in those previous times. As a result of his studies for that
    achievement he could memorize stanzas by hearing them read once, and he had of necessity
    to memorize a total of fifteen volumes from the<i>Tipitaka </i>to enable entry for the
    oral section alone. His success accorded him the right to appointment as the head of a
    monastery of three hundred bhikkhus, even at that relatively young age, as the result of
    which he became head of the education department and school at a monastery specially
    founded in Rangoon for his teacher, the Ven. Adiccavarnsa. and himself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some few years later, in 1933, he went to India where he
    spent a year at <i>Santiniketan</i> studying English and <i>Sanskrit,</i> following which
    period he journeyed to Ceylon with the aim of studying English. Unfortunately, however,
    due to ill health because of wrong feeding, coupled with the failure of his plans to come
    to fruit, he had to reconsider this original idea and in due course returned to India to
    stay atAdyar. It was at Adyar that he eventually had the opportunity to learn English from
    English people, and at the same time acquire a basic knowledge of some of the manners and
    customs with which he was not acquainted.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During his time in India he was elected president of the
    South India Buddhist Associations, and he also undertook the management of the Buddhist
    Free Elementary School at <i>Perambur</i>. In an appreciation by members of the South
    India Buddhist Associations, dated 7th May 1938 at Madras, it records that since the
    founding of the Society in South India in 1903 many bhikkhus and missionaries had visited
    them, ' ... but no one has evinced such selfless and untiring interest in the cause of the
    revival of Buddhism in South India as you have done in your short stay of four years.' The
    appreciation continues by saying that he was well known to Buddhists of Bangalore, Kolar,
    Wallajah, Wanniveda, Chakkra mallar, Konjeevaram, etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To further improve his knowledge of English, and in
    particular to study English educational methods and family upbringing and training of
    English children, he left Adyar for England in the summer of 1938. Having all his life
    lived under British colonial rule he was interested to learn at first-hand how the English
    lived and behaved in their own land, and to observe whether any of the educational methods
    and training of children might be of benefit to Burmese children at home. His knowledge of
    English by the time of his arrival was fairly good, if limited, but sufficient for him to
    accept an invitation by the then secretary of the<b> Buddhist Society</b> in London to
    give a general talk on the <i>Dhamma</i>. This very first talk in England was also the
    very first time he had ever addressed an English audience. His second talk, however,
    entitled 'World Fellowship Through Buddhism'. was given in France at the invitation of Sir
    Francis Younghusband, president and founder of the World Congress of Faiths, and took
    place at the Sorbonne University in Paris. Following those two talks he decided that
    before accepting any further invitation to speak in public he should improve his English,
    and so he took steps to attend a course at the London Polytechnic until March 1939.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The conditions for any bhikkhu in the West in those days
    were exceptionally hard, bhikkhu-life being unheard of and unknown to the inhabitants of
    that part of the world. With the outbreak of war in that year, apart from two most
    generous friends with whom he first became acquainted in Adyar, Ven. U Thittila was left
    unsupported in any way and quite penniless; he was in almost unheard of circumstances for
    any member of the <i>Sangha</i>. Still undeterred, however, he did everything he possibly
    could for the individuals suffering under wartime conditions, eventually finding support
    for himself in various ways which included broadcasting on the Burma Service of the B.B.C.
    and joining the Burmese / English Dictionary committee of which Dr. Stewart was the
    founder. During those war years, when the giving of public talks was impossible and his
    quest for information regarding educational methods and family training of children was at
    a standstill, he was friend and helper to very many, but few indeed ever knew of the
    sometimes acute privations he had on occasions to endure.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the war drew to a close he was gradually able to resume
    giving talks again under various different auspices, including two separate series of
    seventeen talks each to members of the Workers' Educational Association. He visited people
    in hospital, inmates in prison, and through some helpful contacts he was able to have at
    last the opportunity to visit certain schools, at some of which he was invited to give
    talks. His wish to observe how English children were brought up and trained by their
    parents was then also made possible by the readiness of a few different families, who upon
    introduction invited him to stay in their homes for that purpose. Of the children with
    whom he was associated he was able to study in depth their school life and home influence,
    and as he stayed with the families of differing religious backgrounds he was able to
    augment his knowledge of not only the Western way of life but the conditions to which many
    young people were subjected from a very early age.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So far as the <i>Dhamma</i> is concerned, perhaps the most
    outstanding feature was his introduction of the <i>Abhidhamma Pitaka </i>(the
    psycho-ethical analysis of things in their ultimate sense as against their conceptual
    form) to the West by way of commencing to teach the small manual, <i>Abhidhammatthasangaha</i>,
    to a class of students interested in the Buddhist Teaching and who had specifically
    requested him to deal with that section. For the very first time in the West, the primer
    to the third <i>Pitaka </i>was systematically taught for a consecutive period of over four
    years, and this instruction became the bedrock and yardstick for those who sought to learn
    something of the fundamental teaching of the Buddha. His patience and skill, also his
    great care of his students in helping them to overcome their difficulties between the
    Western way of considering religious and philosophical matters in comparison with the
    Buddhist presentation of things, was evidence of the difference between a real teacher and
    an academic instructor. He helped them, too, in any facet of their lives, being frequently
    requested to give his advice which he never failed in offering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In March 1949, the <em>&quot;Sasana Kari Vihara&quot;</em>
    in London was founded by a group of nine Burmese <i>kappiyas</i> for the purpose of
    supporting the work of Ven. U Thittila in England; thus for the first time since his
    arrival in the West he experienced something nearer to the Eastern traditional support of
    the Sangha, and became no longer dependent merely upon his own efforts for survival. His
    personal achievement in teaching continued unabated, and in the two years from March 1949
    to March 1951 records show that he carried out in excess of two hundred and fifty teaching
    engagements, quite apart from fulfilling all the other types of duties which normally fall
    to a bhikkhu in the ordinary course of events. Being then the only resident bhikkhu in
    England, those other duties absorbed a very considerable proportion of his time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, because of the unavoidable floating nature
    of the Burmese community in England, constant support for the <i>Sasana Kari Vihara</i>
    was never certain, and in 1952 when Ven. U Thittila was invited to lecture on <i>Abhidhamma</i>
    at Rangoon University to M.A. and B.A. students he decided to accept at a time when funds
    for the vihara had become virtually insufficient to maintain even one bhikkhu. Thus his
    departure for Rangoon, after fourteen years in what must almost at times have seemed like
    wilderness conditions, left an irreplaceable gap in the lives of many of his English
    students. However, they continued his <i>Abhidhamma </i>classes, studying on a revisionary
    basis all that he had taught them since the commencement.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although originally he accepted the university appointment
    for one year only, his work there continued in the end for eight successive years. His
    very great learning and undoubted skills in teaching were acknowledged during this period
    when, in 1956, he received the highest government award in that field by the conferring
    upon him of the title <i><b>Agga Maha Pandita</b></i>. It was an honour which originally
    carried with it some small annual material benefits for the receiver.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1959 he accepted an invitation from the Association for
    Asian Studies at the University of Michigan, U.S.A., to lecture in America. Travelling all
    over the U.S.A., unattended by any <i>dayaka</i> or helper, encountering climates ranging
    from extreme cold with deep snow to blazing sun with extreme heat, he spent nearly six
    months delivering well over a total of one hundred and sixty lectures at various
    universities and arranged meetings. This was the planned programme, but as a result of his
    talks he found himself constantly the guest of many of the hospitable American people who
    heard him speak, and the additional inquiries and personal questions arising from this
    extra dimension greatly extended what was already a very demanding schedule. His itinerary
    included a flight from Los Angeles to Hawaii, where at Honolulu University he was
    requested particularly to give twelve talks, ten of them on Abhidhamma. And it was while
    still in the American continent that he visited Toronto in Canada. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Over the years he has accepted three invitations at
    different times to go to Australia, during which visits the practice of meditation and
    study of the text of <i>Dhammapada</i> ranked high in interest. He has journeyed to Japan
    where he had the opportunity to observe and discuss with Japanese Zen masters their
    methods and training of Zen meditation students, and has also visited both Singapore and
    Hongkong. On other occasions he has travelled for specific purposes to Indonesia,
    Cambodia, Nepal, and more than once to Thailand, quite apart from passing through that
    country many times in the course of other longer travels.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Europe, prior to 1960, he had also upon invitation
    given talks in Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Holland. Norway, Sweden and Denmark,
    and yet again in France many years after his original first pre-war talk in 1938. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1964, at the instigation of two of his English <i>Abhidhamma</i>
    students, he accepted an invitation to visit England again to continue teaching <i>Abhidhamma</i>.
    The form of teaching on that occasion, however, took on a dual purpose, and in the two
    years that followed, as well as teaching the subject he translated into English from the
    Pali, for the very first time that it had ever been done, the second of the seven books of
    the <i>Abhidhamma Pitaka, Vibhanga</i>. It was published by the Pali Text Society in 1969
    under the title of 'The Book of Analysis.'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Upon his return to Burma in 1966 he did not again leave
    for abroad until his two recent visits to England, one in 1982 and again in 1983. At the
    very considerable age of eighty-seven years, he yet again upon invitation conducted a
    course of weekly classes during the summer months of 1983, dealing with the application of
    <i>Abhidhamma</i> knowledge to ordinary everyday life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the years from 1966-1982 in Burma, due to his
    knowledge, evident practice, practical experience and inevitable seniority in age, he
    became invited and accepted the position of <i><b>Ovadacariya </b></i>(spiritual adviser
    or instructor) to the central council of the <i><b>Sangha Mahanayaka</b></i> of the whole
    country, Burma; to the trustees of the Shwedagon Pagoda, Sule Pagoda, Kaba Aye Pagoda and
    to most other well known pagodas in Rangoon. He is also examiner for the well known <i>Abhidhamma</i>
    Propagation Society in Rangoon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sparse information given in this extremely brief
    sketch of some of the main events in the Sayadaw's life, confirms a remark made one day by
    an astrologer in Mandalay who once happened to see the Sayadaw there when he was a young <i>samanera</i>.
    The astrologer commented that only one tenth of anything that that particular young
    bhikkhu did would ever become known.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The difficulty in collecting information is compounded by
    the fact that the Sayadaw very seldom speaks of himself, or mentions his endless
    achievements in the vast field of his experiences. Beneath his quiet and retiring bearing
    lies a profound depth of knowledge of the Buddhist Teaching, and to spread this knowledge
    has been his great endeavour throughout his life. He has striven, often in the face of
    surprising opposition, to carry out his aim. Even his original idea to learn English and
    go to the West, met with an opposition that made his initial departure a very difficult
    thing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Over the years since the war he has taught and helped
    countless Western-born people, although of his English pupils from the actual war years
    and just after, so many are now no more. However, by those who still remember him during
    his fourteen years presence in England, from 1938-1952, and who on subsequent visits have
    continued to receive teaching and guidance from him, he is deeply regarded and with much
    gratitude. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a skilled teacher, in accordance with the order of<i>
    pariyatti, patipatti and pativedha</i> (learning, practice and realization), he has always
    been at pains to deal with first things first. He has always realized that strangers,
    newcomers to the word Buddhism, having been brought up and educated from childhood in a
    totally different religious environment, would have absolutely no concept at all of the
    Buddhist Teaching. His method, therefore, has been first to explain very simply and
    gradually exactly what and who a Buddha is. Once such people have become acquainted with
    some knowledge and a correct idea of the nature of a Buddha, he later, still in very
    simple terms, gains the further interest of his listeners by the very reasonableness and
    logic of what he has to say in connection with right living in ordinary everyday life, and
    what in accordance with Buddhist teaching is required if one is to improve oneself
    morally, intellectually and spiritually. He always speaks to people at their level of
    appreciation and interest, feeding them slowly with information that will build their
    confidence. Like a wise farmer, he tills the soil before sowing the seed. He prepares the
    ground; then, selecting suitable seed for the varying soils he plants carefully at the
    proper season, realizing that to use the same seed in all the differing soils would be
    unsuitable and unproductive. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On recognizing some people's almost total ignorance of the
    Dhamma, the Sayadaw has never been dismayed; he has never ever considered abandoning any
    mission on encountering such utter lack of comprehension, but actually striven all the
    harder to offer to those individuals something which could act as a next step for them,
    something which could serve as an aid to movement in the right direction. Knowing that
    morality is the soil in which development and understanding grow, he has sought, always,
    to introduce, maintain and increase people's knowledge of, and tendency to practise, at
    least the basic five precepts in their ordinary life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And so, dealing with first things first, he will speak to
    the uninformed of right thought, right speech and right action in their ordinary everyday
    life. As he says, 'How we think, speak, behave and react when we have come away from
    meditation centres and returned to everyday life, is the clue as to how far, if at all, we
    have actually improved or advanced morally and mentally. Is our annoyance at things, our
    anger, less; are we more kindly, better behaved, more considerate towards others? Is our
    greed for the things we like and try to get hold of in everyday existence, is that greed
    really less?'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Approaching his ninetieth year the Sayadaw is still active
    and teaching, at the same time making available to others his great knowledge and vast
    experience of practice under conditions which none but the most highly disciplined and
    principled could have ever emerged unscathed morally or mentally. The inflexibility of his
    determination as a very young person to learn every aspect of the Buddhist Teaching
    absolutely thoroughly, and his inflexibility to live always appealing to the highest
    within himself, has enabled the spreading of the true Dhamma to reach large numbers in the
    world who otherwise may never have heard of it, nor had the chance to meet one of its most
    genuinely humble, compassionate and dedicated exemplars, one of its most profoundly
    learned exponents.</font></p>
