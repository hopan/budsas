    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>32.
    WHAT DID THE BUDDHA DO FOR THE WORLD</b></strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">I am going to talk about what has been
    contributed to the world in mental and spiritual wealth by him we call the Buddha, a title
    which means the Awakened or Enlightened One. He was so called because he was awakened or
    enlightened as to the inner nature of man, and the destiny that lies before man as regards
    his inward. psychical nature.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha is a great benefactor of
    humanity, because he taught men that there is no need for them to look outside themselves
    to any being supposed to be superior to themselves for help to reach the highest condition
    of mind and heart possible for them. He told men that they could find within themselves,
    and must find within themselves, all strength required for this task. He told men that
    they could be strong, strong enough in themselves to achieve their own deliverance from
    delusion, ill-will and selfishness, selfish craving. He pulled men to their feet with his
    gospel of self- help, and asked them to go forward by their own strength towards the goal
    he pointed out to them. And he told them that they could do this if they but tried.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">It follows from the Buddha's proclamation
    of self-help as the one true way to deliverance from evil, that he condemned all
    sacrifices, performed in the name of religion, of any kind and particularly those that
    involved blood-shed, the killing of animals. You are familiar with the idea that 'sin' or
    evil can be atoned for, or done away with, by killing some animal in the name of God of
    the people who have such a religion.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In India, in the time of the Buddha, there
    were animal sacrifices. A great horse sacrifice is specially mentioned in one of the
    Buddhist Scriptures and there still are such today. If you go down the street in Calcutta
    where the temple of Pali stands, a feeling of nausea and repulsion and almost illness
    comes over you from the fumes hanging in the air of the goats there sacrificed to the
    goddess <i>Kali</i>, just as one feels when one passes near one of the big
    slaughter-houses.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">From such horrors the Buddha did the world
    the service of proclaiming that they are alike useless and cruel, unnecessary and futile
    as a means of pleasing or placating any god. Men should purify and elevate themselves by
    their own good deeds till they stand higher than any gods, certainly higher than any that
    require death as tributes to their power, or to win their favour. And he also condemned
    the cruelty of taking life from creatures that are so entirely in our power that it is
    shameful to anyone of fine feeling to take advantage of them, as so many men do, in
    slaying them to save themselves, as they imagine, from the consequences of their own
    misdeeds. All shedding of blood, taking of life, as a part of religion, is the very
    antithesis of all that his religion means. The Buddhist religion means looking on all
    beings, all living creatures of every kind, high or low, as sharers of life, with equal
    rights to live their lives to the full, uninterfered with by any other creature.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">More than that, the Buddha adjures man to
    practise active loving-kindness towards all beings, including animals. Societies for the
    prevention of cruelty to animals did not begin in the West. Long ago, in the days of
    Emperor <i>Asoka</i> of India, as we find recorded in durable characters on stone pillars
    in different spots in Northern India to this day, that great emperor ordered the
    establishment of hospitals for both man and beast in his great domains, and advised his
    subjects to practise kindly and considerate behaviour towards all living beings. Not only
    to abstain from hurting and killing animals, but actively to tend them when ill and guard
    them from hurt, was one of the edicts of the great Emperor Asoka, which he had learned to
    practise in his own life after he had learned the teaching of the Buddha on this point.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Another contribution to the world's
    welfare, was made by the Buddha when he condemned slavery in every shape and form. It was
    not William Wilberforce who was the pioneer of the movement for the abolition of slavery,
    it was very long before he did it. It was done 2,500 years ago when the Buddha began his
    teaching and laying down as a rule for the right manner of earning ones living, that one
    should not engage in any form of trafficking in human beings. Human beings might be
    engaged for service in the house and elsewhere, but it was enjoined that they must be
    treated with as much consideration as the members of one's own family as regards their
    personal rights, and even invited to share in little treats on special occasions.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In the pacifist movement the Buddha also
    was the great pioneer. One of our Scriptures tells us of a case where two sets of people
    had come to the verge of warfare over the right to take water from a river. They were all
    ready to shed each other's blood and destroy their lives when the Buddha appeared on the
    scene and enquired what the dispute was about. They told him that it was about some water
    each claimed the right to take. The Buddha asked them which was the more precious fluid,
    blood or water? Of course, he was told 'blood!' 'So then', he said, 'you are going to
    spill and destroy what is more precious for that which is less precious. Is that the
    conduct of sensible men? Go away together and see if you cannot compose your differences
    in some more reasonable way than this'. And the war was stopped through the Buddha's good
    advice and influence.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">He had not a good word to say to
    'conquerors'. 'Conquest engendereth hatred, for he who is conquered is wretched', he once
    said. And because the conquered one is wretched he wants to get out of his wretchedness
    and plans and schemes to conquer in turn his conqueror; and so the whole miserable
    business of revenge and counter-revenge goes on and on without any end to it. Against this
    insanity the Buddha advised men to have sane reasonable ways and not to be like ravening
    beasts of prey who are guided by nothing but their unreasoning greed.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The Temperance Movement that has made such
    progress in the West was also a movement that had its beginning in the word of the Buddha,
    which enjoined on his followers to abstain from using intoxicating liquors because they
    cause mental distraction and dullness. The idea of hospitals is another great thing which
    the world owes to the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In connection with the establishment of
    hospitals there is a story about the Buddha. When he was wandering about teaching and
    preaching and visiting various communities, he once found among them a monk, who was very
    ill, and no one caring for him and keeping him clean. The Buddha at once looked after him,
    and calling the Bhikkhus together told them that those who were ill must always be looked
    after by those who were well. 'Those who succour the sick, succour me', he said.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Another great service the Buddha did the
    world was to declare the absolute wrongness of all distinctions between man and man based
    on birth. In his own country, India, such distinctions were and still are, the foundation
    on which the whole social system of the land was, and still is, built, i.e., caste. In
    India every Hindu has his lot in life determined and fixed for him just by the fact that
    his father was of this or that or the other of the four great castes of the Brahmins or
    teachers, the warriors or soldiers, the merchants or traders, and the hand-workers or
    peasants.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha made the unheard-of, the
    hitherto unparalleled declaration for an Indian to make, that a man's birth had nothing
    whatever to do with what he was fitted to be taught in religion or in anything else. He
    asserted the absolute equality of all men, no matter how or where they had been born, in
    their right to an open path to the highest truth their mind could receive. That was a
    terribly shocking thing to say to the upper classes of his countrymen. But he did it, and
    he was himself of the highest class as the castes were then classified, since his father
    was a king. And he not only said it, but he acted on it to the fullest extent. Once when
    thirsty, he asked for some water to drink from a peasant. The peasant looking at the noble
    features of the Prince, and his robe of a holy man, said timidly: 'Sir. I cannot give you
    anything to drink or eat, I am not of high caste'. The Buddha replied: 'Friend. I don't
    ask you for caste, I ask you for water'.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">So you see, Buddhism is a religion of
    understanding. To acquire understanding, right understanding of what we are, and where we
    are, and what we have to do and then to do it, that is the whole of the Buddhist teaching.</font></p>

    NATURE OF MAN AND HIS DESTINY</b></strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><strong><i>(Extract from
    talk of above title)</i></strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Everyone reacts according to his own
    particular nature, there fore knowing how and why we differ in thought and outlook in
    life, we are able to make ample allowances for all types and are thus able to live more
    harmoniously with others. When we are young spiritually it is mostly physical and
    emotional pleasure that appeals to us, and while we remain young in evolution we shall not
    grow out of this stage. When we grow older in evolution, literature and study appeal to
    us. and we gain happiness through our intellectual pursuits. Finally, when we grow older
    still, we realize that spiritual happiness is the highest because it is real and lasting.
    This is our goal.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">We can increase that growth at will, just
    as we can develop our muscles with constant exercise. With practice we can grow towards
    perfection; intellectually through the attainment of perfect knowledge, emotionally
    through the control and use of the emotions, spiritually through the attainment of perfect
    realization, physically through the attainment of perfect health and control of the body.
    The lower our nature is, to the greater extent our pleasure is dependent upon outside
    sources; the higher our nature is, the more influence we have over our happiness.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">How can we develop or change ourselves?
    The word alchemy is made up of two Arabic words, 'al kimia'. the secret art of changing or
    fusion. There are two kinds of alchemy, physical and spiritual, and in both, men are doing
    the same thing, trying to find out the same great secret, how to change base, worthless,
    common things, into pure, valuable rare gold. The physical alchemist tries to change or
    transmute other metals into gold, while the spiritual alchemist tries to change the lower
    human passions of anger, jealousy, hate, etc.. into the pure gold of peace, kindness, love
    and generosity.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Many spiritual alchemists who have
    succeeded in changing all that was base, common and bad in their nature, into purity,
    goodness and love, are now willing to teach us how to do the same. They are so pure, so
    strong and so beautiful that we cannot but love and reverence them; they are the masters
    of wisdom, and what they have done we can do if only we persevere. They tell us that the
    only failure is in ceasing to try.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Just as at the end of a school year or
    term there is an examination, which some pupils succeed in passing while others fail, so
    at the end of a term or period in the life of a person there is an examination in
    spiritual alchemy, and only those who are of pure gold in character pass. Those who fail
    have to come back to school and try again.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">We have all come back to school, and each
    one of us is now busy at two kinds of work, reaping and sowing: reaping the result of what
    we have sown in our past lives, and sowing seeds of joy and sorrow, pain and pleasure, for
    reaping in our lives to come. According to the Buddhist Teaching the main purpose of life
    should be to learn how to pass the final examination in spiritual alchemy, and thereby
    succeed in changing all that is base, common and bad in our nature into purity, goodness
    and love, and thus to reach our goal, the goal of perfect peace, happiness and
    enlightenment.</font></p>

    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>34.
    WHAT <em>KAMMA</em> IS</b></strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Kamma </i>is a Pa!i word meaning
    action. It is called <i>Karma </i>in Sanskrit. In its general sense <i>Kamma </i>means all
    good and bad actions. It covers all kinds of intentional actions whether mental, verbal or
    physical - thoughts, words and deeds. In its ultimate sense <i>Kamma </i>means all moral
    and immoral volition. The Buddha says:<b> 'Mental volition, O Bhikkhus, is what I call
    action <i>(Kamma). </i>Having volition one acts by body, speech and thought'. </b><i>(Anguttara
    Nikaya III.).</i> </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma is neither fatalism nor a doctrine
    of predetermination. The past influences the present but does not dominate it, for <i>Kamma
    </i>is past as well as present. The past and present influence the future; the past is the
    background against which life goes on from moment to moment, the future is yet to be. Only
    the present moment exists, and the responsibility of using the present moment for good or
    for ill lies with each individual.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Every action produces an effect and it is
    a cause first and effect afterwards, we therefore speak of <i>Kamma </i>as 'the law of
    cause and effect'. Throwing a stone, for example, is an action. The stone strikes a glass
    window and breaks it. The break is the effect of the action of throwing, but it is not the
    end. The broken window is now the cause of further trouble. Some of one's money will have
    to go to replace it, and one is thus unable to save the money or to buy with it what one
    wants for some other purpose, and the effect upon one is a feeling of disappointment. This
    may make one irritable, and if one is not careful one may allow the irritability to become
    the cause of doing something else which is wrong and so on. There is no end to the result
    of action, no end to <i>Kamma, </i>so we should be very careful about our actions, so that
    their effect will be good. It is therefore necessary for us to do a good, helpful action
    which will return to us in good <i>Kamma </i>and make us strong enough to start a better <i>Kamma.</i></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Throw a stone into a pond and watch the
    effect. There is a splash and a number of little rings appear round the place where it
    strikes. See how the rings grow wider and wider till they become too wide and too tiny for
    our eyes to follow. The little stone disturbs the water in the pond, but its work is not
    finished yet. When the tiny waves reach the edges of the pond, the water moves back till
    it pushes the stone that has disturbed it.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The effects of our actions come back to us
    just as the waves do to the stone, and as long as we do our action with evil intention the
    new waves of effect come back to beat upon us and disturb us. If we are kind and keep
    ourselves peaceful. the returning waves of trouble will grow weaker and weaker till they
    die down, and our good <i>Kamma </i>will come back to us in blessings. If we sow a mango
    seed, for instance, a mango tree will come up and bear mangoes, and if we sow a chili
    seed, a chili plant will grow and produce chilis. The Buddha says:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><b>According to the seed that's sown,<br>
      So is the fruit ye reap therefrom,<br>
      Doer of good will gather good,<br>
      Doer of evil, evil reaps,</b> <br>
      <b>Sown is the seed, and thou shalt taste,<br>
      The fruit thereof.</em><br>
      </b><i>(Samyutta Nikaya </i>Vol. 1.).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Everything that comes to us is right. When
    anything pleasant comes to us and makes us happy, we may be sure that our <i>Kamma </i>has
    come to show us that what we have done is right. When any thing unpleasant comes to us,
    hurts us or makes us unhappy, our <i>Kamma </i>has come to show us our mistake. We must
    never forget that <i>Kamma </i>is always just. It neither loves nor hates, neither rewards
    nor punishes. It is never angry, never pleased, it is simply the law of cause and effect.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Kamma </i>knows nothing about us. Does
    fire know us when it burns us? No. It is the nature of fire to burn, to give out heat. If
    we use it properly it gives us light, cooks our food for us or burns anything we wish to
    get rid of, but if we use it wrongly it burns us and our property. Its work is to burn and
    our affair is to use it in the right way. We are foolish if we grow angry and blame it
    when it burns us because we have made a mistake.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">There are inequalities and manifold
    destinies of men in the world. One is, for example, inferior and another superior. One
    perishes in infancy and another at the age of eighty or a hundred. One is sick and infirm,
    and another strong and healthy. One is handsome another ugly. One is brought up in luxury
    and another in misery. One is born a millionaire another a pauper. One is a genius and
    another an idiot.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">What is the cause of the inequalities that
    exist in the world? Buddhists cannot believe that this variation is the result of blind
    chance. Science itself is indeed all against the theory of 'Chance', in the world of the
    scientist all works in accordance with the laws of cause and effect. Neither can Buddhists
    believe that this unevenness of the world is due to a God-Creator.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">One of the three divergent views that
    prevailed at the time of the Buddha was: 'Whatsoever happiness or pain or neutral feeling
    a person experiences, all that is due to the creation of a Supreme Deity'. <i>(Gradual
    Sayings, </i>I.). Commenting on this fatalistic view the Buddha said: 'So, then, owing to
    the creation of a Supreme Deity men will become murderers, thieves, unchaste, liars,
    slanderers, abusive, babblers, covetous, malicious, and perverse in view. Thus for those
    who fall back on the creation of a God as the essential reason, there is neither the
    desire to do, nor necessity to do this deed or abstain from that deed'. (ibid).</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Referring to the naked ascetics who
    practised self-mortification, the Buddha said: 'if, 0 Bhikkhus, beings experience pain and
    happiness as the result of God's creation, then certainly these naked ascetics must have
    been created by a wicked God, since they are at present experiencing such terrible pain', <i>(Devadaha
    Sutta, </i>No. 101. <i>Majjhima Nikaya, </i>11.).</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism the inequalities
    that exist in the world are due, to some extent, to heredity and environment and, to a
    greater extent, to a cause or causes <i>(Kamma) </i>which are not only present but
    proximate or remote past. Man himself is responsible for his own happiness and misery. He
    creates his own heaven and hell. He is master of his own destiny, child of his past and
    parent of his future.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">THE LAWS OF COSMIC ORDER</font></strong></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Although Buddhism teaches that <i>Kamma </i>is
    the chief cause of the inequalities in the world yet it does not teach fatalism or the
    doctrine of predestination, for it does not hold the view that everything is due to past
    actions. The law of cause and effect <i>(Kamma) </i>is only one of the twenty-four causes
    described in Buddhist philosophy (see Compendium of Philosophy, p. 191), or one of the
    five orders <i>(Niyamas) </i>which are laws in themselves and operate in the universe.
    They are:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>1. Utu Niyama, </i></b>physical inorganic order,
      e.g., seasonal phenomena of winds and rains. The unerring order of seasons, characteristic
      seasonal changes and events, causes of winds and rains, nature of heat, etc., belong to
      this group</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>2. Bija Niyama, </i></b>order of germs and seeds
      (physical organic order), e.g., rice produced from rice seed, sugary taste from sugarcane
      or honey, peculiar characteristics of certain fruits, etc. The scientific theory of cells
      and genes and physical similarity of twins may be ascribed to this order.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>3. Kamma Niyama, </i></b>order of act and result,
      e.g., desirable and undesirable acts produce corresponding good and bad results. As surely
      as water seeks its own level so does <i>Kamma, </i>given opportunity, produce its
      inevitable result, not in the form of a reward or punishment but as an innate sequence.
      This sequence of deed and effect is as natural and necessary as the way of the moon and
      stars.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>4. Dhamma Niyama, </i></b>order of the norm, e.g.,
      the natural phenomena occurring at the advent of a Bodhisatta in his last birth.
      Gravitation and other similar laws of nature, the reason for being good, and so forth may
      be included in this group.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>5. Citta Niyama. </i></b>order of mind, of psychic
      law, e.g., processes of consciousness, arising and perishing of consciousness,
      constituents of consciousness, power of mind, etc. Telepathy, telesthesia,
      retro-cognition, premonition, clairvoyance, clairaudience, thought reading, all psychic
      phenomena which are inexplicable to modern science are included in this class. <i>(Abhidhammavatara.).</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">These five orders embrace everything in
    the world and every mental or physical phenomenon could be explained by them. They being
    laws in themselves, require no lawgiver and <i>Kamma </i>as such is only one of them. </font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">CLASSIFICATION OF KAMMA</font></strong></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Kamma </i>is classified into four kinds
    according to the time at which results are produced. There is <i>Kamma </i>that ripens in
    the same lifetime. <i>Kamma </i>that ripens in the next life, and <i>Kamma </i>that ripens
    in successive births. These three types of <i>Kamma </i>are bound to produce results as a
    seed is to sprout. But for a seed to sprout, certain auxiliary causes such as soil, rain,
    etc.. are required. In the same way for a <i>Kamma </i>to produce an effect, several
    auxiliary causes such as circumstances, surroundings, etc., are required. It sometimes
    happens that for want of such auxiliary causes <i>Kamma </i>does not produce any result.
    Such <i>Kamma </i>is called <i>'Ahosi Kamma' </i>or <i>'Kamma </i>that is ineffective'.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Kamma </i>is also classified into
    another four kinds according to its particular function. There is Regenerative <i>(Janaka)
    Kamma </i>which conditions the future birth: Supportive <i>(Upatthambaka) Kamma </i>which
    assists or maintains the results of already-existing <i>Kamma, </i>Counteractive <i>(Upapilaka)
    Kamma </i>which suppresses or modifies the result of the reproductive <i>Kamma </i>and
    Destructive <i>(Upaghataka) Kamma </i>which destroys the force of existing <i>Kamma </i>and
    substitutes its own resultants.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">There is another classification according

    </i>the highly refined mental states called <i>Jhanas </i>are weighty because they produce
    resultants more speedily than the ordinary unrefined mental states. On the opposite side,
    the five kinds of immediately effective serious crimes are weighty. These crimes are:
    matricide, patricide, the murder of an <i>Arahanta</i> (holy-one or perfect saint), the
    wounding of a Buddha and the creation of a schism in the Sangha.</font></p>

    thoughts. It is this <i>Kamma </i>which, if there is no weighty <i>Kamma, </i>determines
    the conditions of the next birth. Habitual <i>(Acinna) </i>Kamma is the action which one

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>FREE-WILL</b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Kamma, </i>as has been stated above, is
    not fate, is not irrevocable destiny. Nor is one bound to reap all that one has sown in
    just proportion. The actions <i>(Kamma) </i>of men are not absolutely irrevocable and only
    a few of them are so. If, for example, one fires off a bullet out of a rifle, one cannot
    call it back or turn it aside from its mark. But if, instead of a lead or iron ball
    through the air, it is an ivory ball on a smooth green board that one sets moving with a
    billiard cue, one can send after it and at it another ball in the same way, and change its
    course. Not only that, if one is quick enough, and one has not given it too great an
    impetus, one might even get round to the other side of the billiard-table, and send
    against it a ball which would meet it straight in the line of its course and bring it to a
    stop on the spot. With one's later action with the cue, one modifies, or even in
    favourable circumstances, entirely neutralizes one's earlier action. It is in much the
    same way that <i>Kamma </i>operates in the broad stream of general life. There, too, one's
    action <i>(Kamma) </i>of a later day may modify the effects of one's action <i>(Kamma) </i>of
    a former day. If this were not so, what possibility would there ever be of a man's getting
    free from all <i>Kamma </i>forever. It would be perpetually self-continuing energy that
    could never come to an end. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Man has, therefore, a certain amount of
    free-will and there is almost every possibility to mould his life or to modify his
    actions. Even a most vicious person can by his own free-will and effort become the most
    virtuous person. One may at any moment change for the better or for the worse. But
    everything in the world including man himself is dependent on conditions, and without
    conditions nothing whatsoever can arise or enter into existence. Man therefore has only a
    certain amount of free-will and not absolute free-will. According to Buddhist philosophy,
    everything. mental or physical, arises in accordance with laws and conditions. If it were
    not so, there would reign chaos and blind chance. Such a thing, however, is impossible,
    and if it would be otherwise, all laws of nature which modern science has discovered would
    be powerless.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The real, essential nature of action <i>(Kamma)
    </i>of man is mental. When a given thought has arisen in one's mind a number of times,
    there is a definite tendency to recurrence of that thought.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">When a given act has been performed a
    number of times, there is a definite tendency to the repetition of that act. Thus each
    act, mental or physical, tends to constantly produce its like, and be in turn produced. If
    a man thinks a good thought, speaks a good word, does a good deed, the effect upon him is
    to increase the tendencies to goodness present in him, is to make him a better man. If on
    the contrary, he does a bad deed in thought, in speech or in action, he has strengthened
    in himself his bad tendencies, he has made himself a worse man. Having become a worse man,
    he will gravitate to the company of worse men in the future, and incur all the unhappiness
    of varying kinds that attends life in such company. On the other hand, the man of a
    character that is continually growing better, will naturally tend to the companion ship of
    the good, and enjoy all the pleasantness and comforts and freedom from the ruder shocks of
    human life which such society connotes.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In the case of a cultured man, even the
    effect of a greater evil may be minimized, while the lesser evil of an uncultured man may
    produce its effect to the maximum according to the favourable and unfavourable conditions.

    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">LESSONS TAUGHT BY KAMMA</font></strong></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The more we understand the law of <i>Kamma,
    </i>the more we see how careful we must be of our acts, words and thoughts, and how
    responsible we are to our fellow beings. Living in the light of this knowledge, we learn
    certain lessons from the doctrine of <i>Kamma.</i></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>1) PATIENCE</b>. Knowing that the Law is our great
      helper if we live by it, and that no harm can come to us if we work with it, knowing also
      that it blesses us just at the right time, we learn the grand lesson of patience, not to
      get excited, and that impatience is a check to progress. In suffering, we know that we are
      paying a debt, and we learn, if we are wise, not to create more suffering for the future.
      In rejoicing, we are thankful for its sweetness, and learn, if we are wise, to be still
      better. Patience brings forth peace, success, happiness and security.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>2) CONFIDENCE</b>. The Law being just, perfect, it is
      not possible for an understanding person to be uneasy about it. If we are uneasy and have
      no confidence, it shows clearly that we have not grasped the reality of the law. We are
      really quite safe beneath its wings, and there is nothing to fear in all the wide universe
      except our own misdeeds. The Law makes man stand on his own feet and rouses his
      self-confidence. Confidence strengthens, or rather deepens, our peace and happiness and
      makes us comfortable, courageous; wherever we go the Law is our protector.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>3) SELF-RELIANCE</b>. As we in the past have caused
      ourselves to be what we now are, so by what we do now will our future be determined. A
      knowledge of this fact and that the glory of the future is limitless, gives us great
      self-reliance, and takes away that tendency to appeal for external help, which is really
      no help at all. 'Purity and impurity belong to oneself, no one can purify another' says
      the Buddha.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>4) RESTRAINT</b>. Naturally, if we realize that the
      evil we do will return to strike us, we shall be very careful Jest we do or say or think
      something that is not good, pure and true. Knowledge of <i>Kamma </i>will restrain us from
      wrong-doing for others' sakes as well as for our own.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>5) POWER</b>. The more we make the doctrine of <i>Kamma
      </i>a part of our lives, the more power we gain, not only to direct our future, but to
      help our fellow beings more effectively. The practice of good <i>Kamma, </i>when fully
      developed, will enable us to overcome evil and limitations, and destroy all the fetters
      that keep us from our goal, <i>Nibbana.</i></font></p>

    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>35.
    WHAT IS DEATH?</b></strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism death is 'the
    temporary end of a temporary phenomenon'. It is not the complete annihilation of the
    being, for although the organic life has ceased, the kammic force which hitherto actuated
    it is not destroyed. Our forms are only the outward manifestations of the invisible kammic
    force. This force carries with it all characteristics which usually lie latent but may
    rise to the surface at any moment. When the present form perishes another form takes its
    place according to a good or bad volitional impulse <i>(kamma </i>that was the most
    powerful) at the moment before death.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">At death the kammic force remains entirely
    undisturbed by the disintegration of the physical body, and the passing away of the
    present consciousness conditions the coming into being of a fresh one in another birth.
    The stream of consciousness flows on. It constantly flows on like a river 'receiving from
    the tributary streams of sense constant accretions to its flood, and ever dispensing to
    the world around it the thought-stuff it has gathered up by the way'. (Compendium of
    Philosophy, p. 12). The continuity of flux at death is unbroken in point of time, and
    there is no breach in the stream of consciousness and so there is no room whatever for an
    intermediate stage between this life and the next or between any two lives. The only
    difference between the passing of one ordinary thought moment (or one unit of
    consciousness) to another, and of the dying thought-moment (consciousness) to the
    rebirth-consciousness, is that in the former case the change is invisible and in the
    latter case a marked perceptible death is visible. Rebirth takes place immediately.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">It may be asked: is the place always ready
    to receive this rebirth? The answer is: as a point in the ground is always ready to
    receive the falling stone, so there is always an appropriate place to receive the rebirth
    which is conditioned by the natural law of <i>kamma.</i></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Death being a momentary incident, rebirth
    is immediate. Some years ago it might have been doubtful about such rapidity in the
    transmission of the life-force; but in these days of scientific methods of investigation
    we know of such rapid transmission of energy in wireless telegraphy and telephony. Solid
    walls do not prevent the radio waves from reaching an appropriate receiving set within a
    room. The transmission of the life-force from one existence to another may be compared to
    a receiving set that responds to the particular wave-length sent out from a distance of
    thousands of miles. It is more like the tuning-fork which vibrates in response to a
    particular note of a particular wave-length in the musical scale. So long as a musical
    note sets up vibrations in the air, so long will some tuning-fork that is responsive to
    that particular note, vibrate in unison. When the vibrations of the musical note cease,
    the tuning-fork will cease to vibrate to that note. And so it is with that restless kammic
    force, or life-force, which continues to bring about births through appropriate germ
    plasms or other life-conditions till that restless kammic force ceases to exist in the
    peace of <i>Nibbana.</i></font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">IS THE NEW BEING THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS ONE?</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the words of the late <i>Bhikkhu Silacara:</i></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">'This new being which is the present
      manifestation of the stream of kamma-energy is not the same as, and has no identity with
      the previous one in its line; the aggregate that makes up its composition being different
      from, and having no identity with, those that make up the being of its predecessor. And
      yet it is not an entirely different being, since it has the same stream of <i>kamma </i>energy,
      though modified perchance just by having shown itself in that last manifestation, which is
      now making its presence known in the sense perceptible world as the new being'.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">If we were to obtain a quick motion
    picture of any particular individual's life from his birth to his death, the most striking
    fact that would attract our attention would be the changefulness that we should find
    running right through the series of pictures. The infant changes to the child, the child
    to the adult, and the adult to the decrepit old person who collapses to death. This change
    goes on in every part of the individual's body; and not only in the body but in the mind
    also. So that any adult individual who surveys his own existence will realize that the
    child that was, is now no more. That child had a different body, in size as well as in
    form, different likes and dislikes, and different aspirations. That child is almost a
    stranger to the present adult individual. And yet the adult individual is responsible for
    whatever he has done in his childhood because there is a continuity (or identity) in the
    process of life-force from childhood to manhood, as a child becomes a man.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In exactly the same way the new being has
    the same stream of kammic energy, or life-force, as its predecessor, so it is responsible
    for whatever its predecessor has done. This new being has as much identity with the

    and nothing more.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">This is well expressed in the <i>Milinda

    it would not be correct to say that the milk was the same thing as the curds, or the
    butter, or the ghee, but that they are produced out of it, so he points out the continuity
    of a person or a thing as being maintained in the same way.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">There is also the illustration of a wave
    of water in a lake or the ocean. A certain mass of water is raised up as a wave. As the

    'passing on'.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The present being, present existence, is
    conditioned by how one faced circumstances in the last, and in all past existences. One's
    present position in character and circumstances is the result of all that one has been up
    to the present; but what one will be in the future depends on what one does now in the
    present. The true Buddhist regards death as a momentary incident between one life and its
    successor, and views its approach with calmness. His only concern is that his future
    should be such that the conditions of that life may provide him with better opportunities
    for perfecting himself. Holding, as he does, the great doctrine of <i>kamma, </i>he
    perceives that it is within his power to alter or modify the quality of the life force
    that continues in the next birth, and that his future environment will depend entirely on
    what he does, upon how he behaves, in this and in his previous lives.</font></p>

    HOW REBIRTH TAKES PLACE</b></b></strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Every birth is conditioned by a past good
    or bad kamma (action) which predominates at the moment of death. Our forms are only the
    outward manifestations of the invisible kammic force, and this force carries with it all
    our characteristics which usually lie latent, but may rise to the surface at unexpected
    moments. The death of a person is merely the temporary end of a temporary phenomenon, the
    present form perishing and another taking its place in accordance with the thought that
    was most powerful at the death moment.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">One unit of consciousness perishes only to
    give birth to another, persistently flowing on like a river. When a person is about to
    die, no renewed physical function recurs as from the seventeenth thought moment reckoned
    backwards from the point of death. The material qualities of the body which are produced
    by kamma, temperature, mind and nutriment from food, arise no more, this critical stage
    being comparable to the flickering of a lamp just before it becomes extinguished. Now to
    this dying man one of three things appear very vividly before his mind's eye, namely,
    kamma, kamma nimitta or gati nimitta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>KAMMA</b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">By kamma is meant some action of his,
    whether good or bad; and if it is his WEIGHTY KAMMA, which is one of the four kinds of
    kamma, or action, that condition the future birth, such weighty kamma will certainly
    produce results in this life or in the next. Weighty kamma can be good or bad; such a
    thing as jhanic practice, for example, being good, and killing, which is bad, especially
    so in the case of the most serious crimes involving matricide, patricide, the murder of an
    <i>arahant</i> or the mere wounding even of a Buddha. As said above, weighty kamma such as
    that just mentioned, will for certain produce results in this life or the next.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">If a dying man has no such weighty kamma
    as the object of his dying thought he may take an action, kamma, done immediately prior to
    the death moment; this is known as <i>asanna</i>, DEATH PROXIMATE KAMMA. Owing to the
    great part it plays in determining the future birth, much importance is attached to the
    type of object of the final dying thought moment; and the custom of reminding the dying
    man of his good deeds, and making him do good deeds on his death-bed, still prevails in
    Burma, Ceylon and other Buddhist countries.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes a bad person may die happily and
    receive a good birth, if fortunately he remembers or does a good act at the last moment,
    but although he enjoys a good rebirth this does not mean he will be exempt from the
    effects of the evil deeds he performed during his previous lifetime. On occasions, a good
    person may die unhappily by suddenly remembering an evil act of his, or by harbouring some
    unpleasant thought perchance compelled by unfavourable circumstances. These, however, are
    exceptional cases, for as a rule the last thought moment is conditioned by the general
    conduct of a person. In any event it is always advisable to remind the dying person of his
    good deeds, and to turn his attention away from all worldly bonds and worries.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">HABITUAL KAMMA is next in priority of
    effect. It is the type of action that one habitually performs and remembers, and these
    habits, whether good or bad, become second nature as it were, tending to form the
    character of a person. In one's leisure moments one frequently reverts to a characteristic
    type of thought; a miser, for instance, will constantly be thinking of his money and may
    not be able to detach his mind from his cherished possessions; a social worker will be
    interested in his social activities; a spiritual adviser will be always intent on his
    spiritual work. Thus each one of us may be dominated by our habitual doings, especially at
    our death moment.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In the absence of all these as objects of
    the dying thought moment, some casual act is presented from the accumulated reserves of
    the endless past. Each being has his reserve fund, so to speak, of CUMULATIVE KAMMA which
    may at any time become the object of the dying thought moment.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">So one of these four actions, kammas,
    naturally appears very vividly before the mind's eye of the dying man. i.e., weighty
    kamma, death proximate kamma, habitual kamma, cumulative kamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>KAMMA NIMITTA</b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In the case of kamma nimitta the object of
    the dying thought moment is that thing appearing in the form of a sight, sound, smell,
    taste, touch or idea which has been dominantly associated with the performance of a
    particular kamma, such as knives in the case of a butcher, patients in the case of a
    doctor, an object of worship in the case of a devotee, etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>GATI NIMITTA</b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">This means that the object of the dying
    thought moment takes the form of some sign of the place where the dying man will take
    rebirth, a thing which frequently happens to dying persons. Symbols of one's destiny may
    be forests, mountainous regions, mother's womb, celestial mansions, etc. When these
    indications of the future birth occur, and if they are bad, they can be turned into good.
    This is done by influencing the thoughts of the dying man so that his good thoughts may
    now act as good proximate kamma, and counteract the influence of the bad kamma which would
    otherwise affect his subsequent birth. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Taking kamma, kamma nimitta or gati
    nimitta for its object, the dying man's thought process reaches the actual death
    consciousness, the final conscious state in this life. With the cessation of this final
    conscious state, death actually occurs. Death is merely the temporary end of a temporary
    phenomenon, it is not the complete annihilation of the being. Although the organic life
    has ceased, the force which hitherto actuated it is not destroyed; just as electric light
    is only the outward visible manifestation of invisible electric energy, even so are we
    only the outward manifestation of invisible kammic energy. When the electric light bulb
    breaks, the light is extinguished but the current remains, and light again becomes
    manifest upon concurrence with another suitable bulb. In the same way the kammic force
    remains entirely undisturbed by the disintegration of the physical vehicle.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The final conscious state in a life that
    is ceasing, conditions the immediately succeeding conscious state; however, this
    immediately succeeding conscious state will be occurring in and as the very first state of
    consciousness in the new life, and so the process continues. The succeeding consciousness
    inherits all the past activities, but the new being, which is the present manifestation of
    the stream of kammic energy, is not the same as the previous one. However, to the extent
    that it inherits the same past causal conditions, neither can it be said to be entirely
    different.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The stream of consciousness flows on, the
    transition of the flux being so instantaneous that there is no room whatsoever for an
    intermediate state. According to Tibetan Buddhist works, there is an intermediate state
    where beings remain for some days or for some weeks, or until the forty-ninth day; and
    according to Theosophical teachings, between every two lives we have a beautiful holiday
    in heaven, called <i>Devachan</i>, in which we think over all that happened to us in our
    previous life and digest all our experiences gained in our past lives.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism the continuity of
    flux at death is unbroken in point of time, and there is no breach in the stream of
    consciousness. The only difference between the passing of one thought moment to another,
    and of the dying thought moment to the rebirth consciousness, is that in the former case
    the change is invisible and in the latter case a marked perceptible death is visible.
    Rebirth is instantaneous.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">You may ask, is the place always ready to
    receive this rebirth?' The answer is that in the same way as a point in the ground is
    always ready to receive the falling stone, so is there always an appropriate place to
    receive the rebirth which is conditioned by kamma.</font></p>

    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>37. A
    BUDDHIST IN WARTIME</b></strong></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In the event of war being thrust upon his
    country, you may ask whether a Buddhist ought to volunteer for military service. From a
    Buddhist point of view the answer is. 'No'. On no account, and for no reason whatsoever
    should a Buddhist volunteer to go and kill.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">You may say that Buddhists should never
    become escapists from reality, but what is this reality you speak of? Presumably you mean
    by it the world in which you live, the life about you in which you and all of us take a
    greater or lesser part; but of what does it consist, what is this <i>samsara </i>in which
    we have our being? If you examine it closely you will find that it is a gigantic compound
    result, arisen from causes inextricably intermingled. It is subject to constant change,
    even as the causes underlying it are changing incessantly; indeed, you yourself, all of
    us, are changing continuously from year to year, from day to day. from moment to moment.
    You are not the man you were last week, nor even the man you were a few minutes ago. Such
    is samsara, an ever-changing compound. Can this rightly be called reality?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Now the counterpart of samsara is Nibbana,
    which, when literally translated, means 'no craving', that indescribable state where
    craving, hatred and delusion are not, and where change - the result of craving, hatred and
    delusion - has come to an end, whence there is no more suffering. The Buddha was able to
    describe Nibbana, and we find his description in <i>Udana</i> VIlI.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A study of that passage will show that
    Nibbana is the real, in contradistinction to the unreal world of everyday life which man
    has created for himself. A Buddhist, that is, a follower of the Buddha, aims to seek
    Nibbana, the real. In doing so he will follow that path pointed out by his Master who
    realized Nibbana so long before him. The Buddhist layman will follow, therefore, at least
    the five precepts laid down by the Buddha, the first of which enjoins him not to kill any
    living creature. If this precept is carried into practice logically and consistently it is
    clear what the Buddhist's conduct should be in the event of war, even if the war is
    'forced upon his country by an aggressor nation.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Majjhima Nikaya (Vol. I) we find
    the following passage. 'Yea, disciples, even if highway robbers with a two-handed saw
    should take and dismember you limb by limb, whoso grew darkened in mind thereby would not
    be fulfilling my injunctions. Even then, disciples, thus must ye school yourselves,
    'unsullied shall our minds remain, neither shall evil word escape our lips. Kind and
    compassionate ever, we will abide loving of heart nor harbour secret hate. And those
    robbers will we permeate with a stream of loving thought unfailing; and forth from them
    proceeding, enfold and permeate the whole wide world with constant thoughts of
    loving-kindness, ample, expanding. measureless, free from enmity, free from ill-will'.
    Thus, my disciples, thus must ye school yourselves'.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Not to escape from reality, therefore, but
    in order to find the real, will the Buddhist layman obey the first precept, and he will do
    so even if it should bring him into conflict with mass opinion. Escapists from reality are
    those who, rather than think for themselves, allow themselves to be swept along by mass
    hysteria and slogans, who dare not be different from their fellows.</font></p>

    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>38. THE
    THREE REFUGES - <em>TISARANA</em></b></strong></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We begin our Buddhist meetings by reciting
    the formula of the three refuges (<i>tisarana</i>):</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><em>Buddham saranam gacchami</em> - I go
    to the Buddha for refuge<br>
    <em>Dhammam saranam gacchami</em> -</b> <b>I go to the Dhamma for refuge<br>
    <em>Sangham saranam gacchami</em> - I go to the Sangha for refuge</b></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">These three are also called the triple
    gem, or the threefold jewels (<i>tiratana</i>). <i>Ratana</i> means that which gives
    delight, pleasure, that which pleases. There are seven kinds of jewels, i.e., gold, silver
    and the other five of precious stones. These are called jewels, <i>ratanas</i>, because
    they give us delight, pleasure, but of a worldly, material nature, and therefore we take
    them as ornaments and not as refuges; whereas the other threefold jewels, the Buddha,
    Dhamma and Sangha, give us real spiritual pleasure and happiness, and therefore we take
    them not as ornaments but as our guides and refuges against the evil power of ignorance,
    greed, hatred and illwill.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We go to the Buddha for refuge because he
    had boundless compassion for man's weakness, sorrow, disappointment and suffering, and
    because he found for us the path of deliverance by his own ceaseless effort through
    countless lives. He has given us great encouragement and inspiration to fight against evil
    until we overcome it. He is our supreme teacher.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We go to the Dhamma for refuge because it
    enables one who follows it to attain the end of all dissatisfaction and suffering through
    the attainment of enlightenment, perfect wisdom and perfect equanimity. The best way to
    follow the Buddha and pay homage to him is to follow the Dhamma in our lives. In following
    the Dhamma there are three stages: study, practice and realization. First we should study
    the pure Dhamma preached by the Buddha, followed by the <i>arahats</i> and <i>theras</i>.
    and which is now known in the West as <i>Theravada</i>, the author of which is the Buddha
    himself. Dhamma means truth; thus the teaching of the Buddha is called Dhamma since it
    enables one to see the truth. Because it consists of three divisions it is also called <i>Tipitaka</i>.
    The divisions are entitled Vinaya. Sutta and Abhidhamma. and they are so called because of
    their differences in treatment and analysis. Until recently there has never been any
    doubt. dispute or argument about the divisions, but one has heard some people say now that
    Abhidhamma is not the teaching of the Buddha himself, but a later development. Well, the
    answer to that is not far to seek, and one of the simplest answers is that if the
    Abhidhamma is not the Buddha's teaching, and therefore not the third division, what then
    would be the third division in its place? If there is no third division why do we have the
    original old, well recognized word Tipitaka. which means threefold division?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We should study not only the Pali canon
    but also the commentaries, especially by <i>Buddhaghosa</i> who re-wrote the old vast
    commentaries which existed before his time and to which he often referred in his
    commentaries. His explanations are not based on his own opinion, but are based on the
    Buddha's teachings themselves. We cannot do without his commentaries, which the theras of
    that time and their unbroken descendants down to the present day have regarded as correct
    and the most helpful. When one translates from the Pali into one's own language a verse by
    the Buddha, one will of course use one's own knowledge of the term and subject, and one's
    own common sense. but it is wiser first to consult the commentaries and sub-commentaries
    for the orthodox meaning. There are commentaries on all the teachings of the Buddha, but
    unfortunately very few of them have been translated into English; we need more Pali
    scholars like Miss Horner (deceased 1981), there is a lot to be done yet in this respect.
    We should study pure Dhamma, and spread pure Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The second stage in following the Dhamma
    is to practise it in daily life. Since we are subject to birth, old age, sickness, death,
    and we suffer from dissatisfaction and unhappiness, we are sick people. The Buddha is
    compared to an experienced and skilful physician. and the Dhamma is compared with the
    proper medicine; but however efficient the physician may be, and however wonderful the
    medicine may be, we cannot be cured unless and until we ourselves actually take the
    medicine. I think many of us are in need of some medicine to cure us of our
    misunderstanding of one another, our impatience. irritability, lack of sympathy and metta
    (loving-kindness). Right understanding. patience. tolerance, goodwill and loving-kindness
    are the primary and elementary principles of Buddhism. For the average person this may
    prove to be difficult to practise. but we should be trying to rise above the average.
    Buddhists should be good examples to others by practising what they preach: examples are
    better than any preaching. Only by practice can realization, the understanding of things
    as they really are, devoid of concept, be achieved. The only way in which we can truly
    express our gratitude and veneration for the Buddha, our Master, who with infinite
    compassion showed us the road to the end of suffering, is by practising the Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Lastly we go the the Sangha for refuge.
    because the Sangha is the living stream through which the Dhamma flows to us.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Sangha literally means group. but here it
    means a group of saints who have reached the <i>aryan</i> noble stage. There are eight
    stages, from the first of initiation to the eighth of arahatta. perfect saint. A bhikkhu
    who has not attained to any of the states, but sincerely follows the Dhamma, belongs to
    the Sangha.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The Sangha is the point at which the
    Buddha-Dhamma makes direct contact with humanity', it is the bridge between living men and
    absolute truth. The Buddha greatly emphasized its importance as a necessary institution
    for the well-being of mankind; for, if there had not been the Sangha. the Buddha-Dhamma
    would have become a mere legend and tradition after the passing of the Buddha. Not only
    has the Sangha preserved the word of the Master, but also the unique spirit of the Noble
    Teaching. It cannot exist, however, without the support of the lay Buddhists, <i>upasakas</i>
    and <i>upasikas</i>. Those who help to maintain the Sangha, benefit both themselves and
    others, for in so doing they not only acquire merit but they are helping to keep alive and
    spread the Noble Teaching.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The task of each and every Buddhist is
    first to make the Buddha Dhamma a living reality, by studying it and practising it in
    everyday life. When we live in accordance with the Dhamma we can speak about it with
    authority. Secondly, a Buddhist's task is to spread the pure Buddha-Dhamma, or to help the
    Sangha who devote their whole lives to the study, practice and spreading of the pure
    Dhamma - which is excellent in the beginning, in the middle and in the end. Thereby we
    become helpers of humanity and messengers of peace and happiness.</font></p>

    WHAT BURMA IS DOING FOR BUDDHISM</b></strong></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The Parliament of the Union of Burma
    passed unanimously the following resolution, moved by the Religious Affairs Minister, on
    the 1st October 1951:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">'That not being satisfied with the
      measures usually undertaken hitherto by the peoples and governments of the world for the
      solution of the problems confronting mankind, by promoting the material well-being of man
      in his present existence in the form of ameliorating his living conditions and standard of
      life; and also being fully aware of the fact that such measures would result only in a
      partial solution of the problems, this Parliament declares its firm belief that it is
      necessary to devise and undertake such measures for the spiritual and moral well-being of
      man as would remove these problems and help man to overcome Greed, Hatred and Delusion
      which are at the root of all the violence, destruction and conflagration consuming the
      world.'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In pursuance of the above resolution and
    in furtherance of its general plan for the spiritual and moral uplift of man, the
    Government of the Union of Burma have provided one million pounds to form the central fund
    for the purpose of making necessary preparations for holding the Sixth Great Buddhist
    Council in Rangoon. This project involves two principal pro grammes of work:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Preparation of the Buddhist Texts.<br>
      (b) Erections of necessary buildings for the Great Council. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The holding of the Sixth Great Council
    will be the most momentous event not only in the history of Burma but also of Asia and the
    Buddhist world. Throughout the history of nearly 2500 years since the demise of the
    Buddha, there have been five Great Buddhist Councils held for the purpose of
    re-examination and recension of the teaching of the Buddha with a view to preserving the
    same in its pristine purity. The First Great Council was held soon after the demise of the
    Buddha with the support of King Ajatasattu. a most devoted follower of the Buddha and a
    powerful king of North India, when all the principal disciples assembled together at the
    city of Rajagaha and proceeded to recite, classify and arrange all the teachings of the
    Buddha.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In that Great Council in 546 B.C., soon
    after the Buddha's death, it was considered necessary to entrust different portions of the
    teachings of the Buddha to different groups of disciples who came to be known as the
    Reciters of the Texts. The groups of monks to whom these portions of the Texts were
    entrusted, and their pupils after them, preserved the Texts by learning and reciting them,
    and thus the original teachings of the Buddha were handed down by word of mouth from
    teacher to pupil for over four centuries, until the Texts were committed to writing for
    the first time in Ceylon in 29 B.C. To these groups of monks we owe the preservation of
    the original teachings of the Buddha in the form of Pali Texts.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The Second Great Council was held at
    Vesali in 443 B.C. with the support of <b>King Kalasoka</b>, and the Third Great Council
    at Pataliputta in 308 B.C. with the support of <b>Emperor Asoka</b>. through whose good
    offices and religious zeal Buddhism spread to almost all the then known countries of the
    world. The Fourth Great Council was held in Ceylon in about 29 B.C. where the Texts were
    committed to writing for the first time, as it was then felt that it would no longer be
    safe under modern conditions to leave such vital teachings to human memory. The Fifth
    Great Council was held when the Texts were recorded on 729 marble slabs at Mandalay,
    Burma, in 1871 with the support of King Mindon.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The forthcoming Great Council will have
    the collaboration and participation of the learned monks of Ceylon, Siam. Cambodia, India,
    Pakistan, Nepal etc., and thus have a much wider significance than any of the previous
    Great Councils. Five hundred Buddhist monks in Burma who are well versed in the study and
    practice of the teachings of the Buddha, take the responsibility of re-examining the
    Texts; for that purpose they are organized into ten groups so that each group would be
    responsible for a particular portion of the Texts. A large group of lay scholars edits the
    first draft of the Texts in Pali and also makes original draft Burmese translations for
    submission to the respective groups of monks. In each of the Buddhist countries as far as
    possible, national groups of monks have been organized on similar lines. The preparation
    may take about three years and the first meeting of the Great Council will take place on
    the Vesakha, the full moon day of May 1954. The Council will go on till the completion of
    its task on the Vesakha, the full moon of May 1956 which will coincide with the completion
    of the 2500th year of the Buddhist era, i.e. 2500th anniversary of the Buddha's passing
    away.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The buildings which have been newly
    erected for holding the Sixth Great Council, include one large assembly hall, one
    ordination hall, one library, a few blocks of hostels and dormitories, small meditation
    huts and such other buildings as may be required for use as a sanatorium, lecture
    theatres, staff residential flats and quarters. offices, press etc. When the Sixth Great
    Council is over, these buildings will be used for the new Buddhist University which is
    expected to become not only the seat of Buddhist learning, culture and civilization but
    also the spiritual centre of South East Asia. radiating such irresistible and
    over-powering rays of Wisdom, Truth and Righteousness as will dispel from the earth those
    dark and evil forces rooted in Greed, Hatred, and Delusion which are now threatening to
    swamp and swallow the whole of Asia and of the world.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">All these achievements of the past, and
    plans and preparations for the future, are the outcome of the unprecedented and happy
    unity of purpose and harmony of action between the community of monks and the Government
    and the people of Burma, in spite of all the troubles and tribulations following in the
    wake of her newly won independence. They have passed through dark days, and there is still
    a long and difficult road ahead of them; but they are confident that it is the strength of
    Buddhism that has borne them through countless tribulations, and they look to it with
    supreme confidence to enable them to help the troubled and benighted world in achieving
    peace, prosperity and happiness.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">May all beings throughout the universe
    share the merits of our work and may peace be established in the world.</font></p>

    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>40. THE
    SPIRITUAL BASIS OF ASIAN CULTURE</b></strong></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">While Western cultures stem from a dozen
    different sources; from the old magics of the dawn of time, persisting longer in the cold
    western climes; from the Greek tradition; from the Norse tradition; from the blending and
    play on those of the impacts of the Hebrews, the Huns and the Arabs, with Christianity as
    a moulding force, the culture of Asia is firmly rooted in the religions of Asia.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The genuine culture of Asia is based
    entirely on the spiritual principles of its religions. The cultural life of the Asian
    countries would not exist without this spiritual basis.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">So much so that this highlights the
    difference in our culture as compared with Western culture, and has given rise to the myth
    of 'the unchanging East'. Asia changes and is changing gradually, developing slowly and
    consistently to more and more beautiful forms like the opening of a thousand-petalled
    lotus which appears so often in our imagery.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Take away our religion and what of culture
    is left? Just what would be left if you took away from the lotus the life-giving waters
    ...nothing but the odour of decay.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">This applies not only to Buddhism but to
    the two great faiths of Hinduism and Islam as well.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">What is Buddhism?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The answer is in the Dhammapada:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">'Sabbapapassa akaranam,<br>
      kusalassa upasampada,<br>
      sacitta-pariyodapanam,<br>
      etam Buddhana sasanam.</font></strong></em></p>
      <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Not to do any evil,<br>
      to cultivate good, <br>
      to purify one's thoughts,<br>
      - this is the Teaching of the Buddhas.'</font></strong></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Inasmuch as the Hindus and the Moslems
    teach these as eternal truths and verities, we honour these great faiths therefore. Where
    the Buddhist bases his actions, his culture, his whole life on the law of cause and effect
    working through Kamma. the Hindu postulates a Supreme Being as the author of Kamma and the
    Moslem regards the tremendous laws of day and night, of life and death, of growth and
    decay' as 'manifesting the power of Allah and attesting his sovereignty'.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Though difference there is, there is not
    so much difference here as may at first appear, for the great laws of decay and death and
    the greater law of love is recognized by all.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">This is the thread that joins and
    harmonizes all Asian culture. This is the thread that the materialists have sought to
    snap, in vain. That is true, but the danger is not over, and indeed is intensifying. Why
    is this? Why is there to be seen everywhere a decline in spiritual values? It is simply
    because the spiritual has for some time now been neglected for the purely material values.
    Spiritual and moral concepts of some Asians as well as of some Westerners have been
    deteriorating rapidly. There has been an over-emphasis on purely material value.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Nobody would deny that material values are
    values. On one occasion the Buddha knew that a certain man was ripe for salvation and
    would understand the Doctrine. But he demanded that the man who was hungry, first be fed.
    Only then would he be able to pay the requisite attention to the Teaching. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">It is useless preaching spiritual things
    to hungry people, to the sore oppressed. On the other hand it is just as useless to preach
    materialism to people who are spiritually starved. For this materialism, in the absence of
    any spiritual force, will turn and rend itself, will inspire the leaders of a country or a
    movement to make plays for power, through greed, that will destroy the people and destroy
    that which would make for the very material prosperity they seek. We have seen instances
    of this in history right up to the present day.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Only by maintaining the spiritual force in
    its full power can we get the best out of the material advances which modern science is
    everywhere making.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In the world as a whole there is enough
    material and no lack of intellect. What then is lacking? The spiritual basis of culture is
    lacking, the world is disturbed and peace eludes us. Men distrust each other. Conflicts,
    greed-based conflicts, racial, political, religious, economic, bring war due to the lack
    of a spiritual basis of culture.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The word 'culture' is here used in the
    sense of refinement of thought and activity in human life. This term 'culture' is very
    wide in its significance. It includes religion, philosophy, ethics, politics, economics,
    every human activity. The basic inspiring principles of a man's life or that of a race or
    that of a country, along with the way of life adopted, constitute the basis of their
    culture. It is therefore impossible to expect oneness or uniformity or identity of
    culture. In a profound harmony, it is the variety that gives depth and feeling.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">But if culture is to amount to anything
    worth having and really worthy of the name, it must be spiritually based. With Asians it
    has been, and still is, spiritually based and a part of and not apart from their
    religions.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A so-called material culture leads, as we
    have seen, to conflict, to war, to greed and to desolation.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Taking all nations as one whole, there is
    in the world to-day sufficient wealth and ability to abolish unemployment, poverty, much
    of disease and hardship, and certainly all of cruelty and oppression. The world possesses
    all that it needs, and the discovery of new sources of power can, if scientists will but
    unite in a commonwealth of humanity, give all mankind the leisure to work for good and for
    happiness, instead of for mere subsistence. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">This is the disease and the remedy. But
    how are we to persuade this sick world patient to take the remedy?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We must show him that the materialist way
    of looking for gold on the earth all the time, averting his gaze from the stars and the
    sun and the moon, will but lead him into a bog, just as he will fall into a bog if he
    keeps his gaze forever on the stars and never looks about him.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We must give him a remedy, persuade him to
    take it, and persuade him to walk on the way of Truth and Enlightenment, to a better and
    more prosperous living here, that will give him leisure to walk the way of salvation. Here
    is the safe way and the safe remedy.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The only way to impart this remedy is by
    making it practical, by education, true education; by imparting it with vigour. If we can
    propagate the Truth with half as much vigour as the materialists propagate untruth, we
    shall save the world.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To establish lasting peace and happiness,
    a genuine religious, spiritual awakening is absolutely necessary. That awakening is here,
    but energy is required to keep it awakening. What is of importance is not mere faith,
    rituals and ceremonies in religion but lives of compassion and love and reason and justice
    based on the moral, spiritual principles of religion. True religion is an education of the
    heart, and exercise of the heart and of the mind. True education is the free development
    of personality and character and conduct within a framework of morality, of love for one's
    neighbour. It is not mere acquisition of information, but information of such a character
    that it inspires and embodies in itself the capacity for its use in the expression of
    personality. No doctrine merely held in the mind has any driving force; no doctrine is of
    any value unless it is applied. One must study and apply the Teaching; applying it first
    to oneself, only then can wisdom come. The Buddha said: <b>'A beautiful thought or word
    which is not followed by a corresponding action is like a bright-hued flower that bears no
    fruit'.</b></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Man has been described as 'a thinking
    animal', and between man and animal there is no great gulf. But man, along with animal
    instincts and sensual feeling, has memory and reason to guard and to guide him. As a moral
    being, guided by moral conscience, man rather than living lower than the animals by
    neglecting and spurning reason and human feeling, can use his ability to rise to supreme
    heights if he will make up his mind to endure the hard climb.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">And there is something in man that
    welcomes a challenge, especially if the challenge is shown to be a challenge to himself,
    calling on him to rise and act and to act and rise, to rise indeed above the world.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">This indeed is the very essence of
    religion, of true religion: the very essence of spirituality. Not the preaching of 'Be
    good and you will be happy'. Not the teaching of mere rite and ritual, but the positive
    action, the striving, the improving, the loving, the comradeship of men of goodwill.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">This is what must be propagated to keep
    the present awakening of spiritual values a real progressive awakening; to oppose with it
    the negativistic materialisms which deny spiritual values and make vague promises of
    heaven on earth, evolution after evolution.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">There has been too much defeatism on the
    part of religions. We are an army with banners. The Buddha pointed out that: For lofty
    virtue, for high endeavour, for sublime wisdom - for these things do we wage war;
    therefore are we called warriors'.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The sun of reasoned spirituality is rising
    and the dark clouds of materialism cannot stand before it.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We shall win if you march with us.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>41. <em>PALI</em>
    AND BUDDHISM</b></strong></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Pali</em> is the original language in
    which the Buddha spoke and all the Buddhist scriptures were written. The serious student
    of Buddhism is undoubtedly to derive more advantage from a knowledge of Pali than from the
    knowledge of any other language. In the first place he thereby gains access to the vast
    stores of a noble literature. The advantage of being able to read the original Buddhist
    scriptures called <i>Tipitakas</i> or three baskets of the canon, which have been
    estimated by some English translators of them to be eleven times the size of the Christian
    Bible, and the commentaries on them, is incalculable.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">It is true that most of the Buddhist
    scriptures and some of their commentaries have been translated into many Asian languages
    and also some European languages, and that those translations were honest attempts to get
    at the truth. Unfortunately, however, some of them are totally incorrect and misleading,
    or, at the very least, ambiguous. The English rendering, for example, of the Pali words, <i>sati
    </i>(mindfulness) by insight, understanding or reason; <i>nama-rupa </i>(mind and matter)
    by image and ideal; <i>sankhara</i> (kamma-formations, 50 mental properties or conditioned
    things) by tendencies or conceptions and Nibbana (extinction of greed) by annihilation or
    nothingness, are some of the worst interpretations by some Western scholars. The Italian
    proverb that translators are traitors, is worth remembering in this regard.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The readers who rely on such mistaken
    terms have often misunderstood the true meaning and the true nature of such fundamental
    principles of Buddhism as the Eightfold Path, the Four Noble Truths, the Paticcasamuppada,
    the Five Groups of Existence and the doctrine of Anatta, which is the essence of the whole
    Teaching of the Buddha. The Dhamma, therefore, should only be described by those who have
    not only confidence in it but also a proper knowledge of Pali, otherwise the writer is
    likely to miss the true nature of it which alone makes the Teaching a living thing capable
    of swaying the lives of men. Without this vital point his effort is bound to be not only
    futile but harmful to the Teaching.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Probably no religion has suffered so much
    in this respect as Buddhism. In the first place, Buddhism is an oriental religion which
    was quite unknown to Europe a hundred years ago, and its discovery was so gradual that the
    whole of its scriptures have not been properly translated. Of the commentaries on the
    scriptures, scarcely any prominent part except the <i>Dhammapada</i> and <i>Dhammasangani </i>has
    been translated into any European languages. Under these circumstances it is not
    surprising that some Western writers misrepresented Buddhism in the most grotesque manner.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Among the Western writers on Buddhism
    there were some who had no intention of doing justice to Buddhism but were only concerned
    with showing that it was a heathen religion and inferior to the existing faith of the
    West. There were also others who were not only friendly but had a good intention and yet
    often took a distorted, one sided view, for the simple reason that their knowledge of Pali
    and Buddhism was inadequate. As a result there have been some extraordinary mixtures of
    misconceptions and queer ideas, or, in some cases, of Theosophy and Hinduism that have
    passed for Buddhism in the West.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The English language in the world of ideas
    is so impregnated with the Christian view of life that it has, in many cases, no
    equivalent ideas to the Buddhist ones. It is therefore difficult, if not impossible, to
    convey Buddhist ideas through the medium of the English language which has no perfect
    equivalents for the words required by them. The word <i>'bhikkhu' </i>for instance.
    although its Pali meaning is a very simple one, has no English equivalent that exactly
    conveys the meaning of it. It is often mistranslated as a beggar or priest or monk. As he
    does not beg in the true sense of the word he (bhikkhu) is not a beggar. Neither is he a
    priest, because he does not act as a mediator between God and man. Nor is he strictly a
    monk, since he is not bound by any vows. As a result, in the books on Buddhism in English
    the Western reader will come across a great number of Pali words retained for that reason.
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">This being the case, the serious student
    who genuinely wishes to gain an understanding of the profound teaching of the Buddha
    should be prepared to take a little trouble to acquaint himself with its essential
    keywords, or to acquire such working knowledge of Pali as will enable him to understand
    the sublime Dhamma in its true light.</font></p>
