    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Friends,</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The subject that I have chosen for this evening is The '<b>Buddha</b>'.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Who is a Buddha? A Buddha is one who has attained<i> bodhi</i>.
    By<i> bodhi</i> is meant an ideal state of intellectual and ethical perfection which can
    be attained by man by purely human means. In order to make clear how the Buddha attained
    bodhi, let me narrate a brief summary of the Buddhas life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">About 623 years before the Christian era, there was born
    in<b><i>Lumbini Park</i></b> in the neighbourhood of <b><i>Kapilavatthu,</i></b> now known
    as<i>Padaria</i> in the district of modern Nepal. an Indian<i> Sakyan</i> prince,
    Siddattha Gotama by name. To mark the spot as the birthplace of the greatest teacher of
    mankind, and as a token of his reverence for him, the<i><b> Emperor Asoka</b></i> in 239
    B.C.. erected a pillar bearing the inscription. 'Here was the Enlightened One born'.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Gotama's father was <b><i>Suddhodana</i></b>, king of <i>Kapilavatthu</i>.
    the chief town of the <i>Sakyan</i> clan; and his mother, who died seven days after his
    birth, was<b><i> Queen Maya</i></b> who also belonged to the same clan. Under the care of
    his maternal aunt,<b><i> Pajapati Gotami</i></b>. <b><i>Siddhattha </i></b>spent his early
    years in ease, luxury and culture. At the age of sixteen he was married to his cousin, <b><i>Yasodhara</i></b>,
    the daughter of <i>Suppabuddha,</i> the king of<i> Devadaha</i>, and they had a son named <b><i>Rahula</i></b>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For nearly thirteen years Siddhattha led the life of a
    luxurious Indian prince, seeing only the beautiful and the pleasant. In his twenty-ninth
    year, however, the truth gradually dawned upon him, and he realized that all without
    exception were subject to birth, decay and death and that all worldly pleasures were only
    a prelude to pain. Comprehending thus the universality of sorrow, he had a strong desire
    to find the origin of it, and a panacea for this universal sickness of humanity.
    Accordingly he renounced the world and donned the simple garb of an ascetic. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wandering as a seeker after peace he placed himself under
    the spiritual guidance of two renowned brahman teachers,<b><i> Alara </i></b>and <b><i>Uddaka</i></b>.
    The former was head of a large number of followers at <i>Vesali</i> and was an adherent of
    <i>Kapila</i>, the reputed founder of the <i>Sassata</i> system of philosophy, who laid
    great stress on the belief in <i>atma</i>. the ego. He regarded the disbelief in the
    existence of a soul as not tending towards religion. Without the belief in an eternal
    immaterial soul he could not see any way of salvation. Like the wild bird when liberated
    from its trap, the soul when freed from its material limitations would attain perfect
    release; when the ego discerned its immaterial nature it would attain true deliverance.
    This teaching did not satisfy the Bodhisatta, and he quitted <i>Alara</i> and placed
    himself under the tuition of<i> Uddaka</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The latter also expatiated on the question of 'I'', but
    laid greater stress on the effects of kamma and the transmigration of the soul. The
    Bodhisatta saw the truth in the doctrine of kamma, but he could not believe in the
    existence of a soul or its transmigration; he therefore quitted Uddaka also and went to
    the priests officiating in temples to see if he could learn from them the way of escape
    from suffering and sorrow. However, the unnecessarily cruel sacrifices performed on the
    altars of the gods were revolting to his gentle nature, and Gotama preached to the priests
    the futility of atoning for evil deeds by the destruction of life, and the impossibility
    of practising religion by the neglect of the moral life</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wandering from<i> Vesali </i>in search of a better system
    Siddattha went to many a distinguished teacher of his day, but nobody was competent to
    give him what he earnestly sought. All the so-called philosophers were groping in the
    dark, it was a matter of the blind leading the blind, for they were all enmeshed in
    ignorance. At last Siddattha came to a settlement of five pupils of Uddaka, headed by <b><i>Kondanna</i></b>,
    in the jungle of <b><i>Uruvela</i></b> near Gaya in Magadha. There he saw these five
    keeping their senses in check, subduing their passions and practising austere penance. He
    admired their zeal and earnestness, and to give a trial to the means used by them he
    applied himself to mortification, for it was the belief in those days that no salvation
    could be gained unless one led a life of strict asceticism, so he subjected himself to all
    forms of practicable austerities. Adding vigil to vigil, and penance to penance, he made a
    super-human effort for six long years until eventually his body became shrunken like a
    withered branch. His blood dried up, the skin shrivelled and the veins protruded, but the
    more he tortured his body the farther his goal receded from him. His strenuous and
    unsuccessful endeavours taught him one important lesson, though, and that was the utter
    futility of self-mortification.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having this valuable experience he finally decided to
    follow an independent course avoiding the two extremes of self-indulgence and
    self-mortification, for the former tends to retard one's spiritual progress and the latter
    to weaken one's intellect. The new path was the<b><i> Majjhima Patipada</i></b>, the
    Middle Path, which subsequently became one of the salient characteristics of his teaching.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Early in the morning on the full moon day of <b><i>Vesakha</i></b>.
    as he was seated in deep meditation under the Bodhi Tree, unaided and unguided by any
    supernatural agency but solely relying on his own efforts. the consciousness of true
    insight possessed him. He saw the mistaken ways that all the various faiths maintained, he
    discerned the sources whence earthly suffering came and the way that leads to its
    annihilation. He saw that the cause of suffering lay in a selfish cleaving to life, and
    that the way of escape from suffering lay in treading the Eightfold Path. With discernment
    of these grand truths and their realization in life, the Bodhisatta eradicated all
    passions and attained enlightenment - he thus became a Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having attained Buddhahood, the supreme state of
    perfection, he devoted the remainder of his precious life to serving humanity, both by
    example and precept, without any personal motive whatsoever. In order to deliver his first
    sermon the Buddha started for Benares, which has been famous for centuries as the centre
    of religious life and thought. On his way he met one of his former acquaintances. <b><i>Upaka</i></b>,
    a <i>Jain </i>monk, who, being struck by his majestic and joyful appearance, asked, 'Who
    is the teacher under whose guidance you have renounced the world?' The Buddha replied, 'I
    have no master, I am the Perfect One, the Buddha. I have attained peace. I have attained <b><i>Nibbana</i></b>.
    To found the Kingdom of Righteousness I am going to Benares: there I shall light the lamp
    of life for the benefit of those who are enshrouded in the darkness of sin and death.'
    Upaka then asked. 'Do you profess to be the <b><i>Jina</i></b>, the conqueror of the
    world?' The Buddha replied, ' Jinas are those who have conquered self and the passions of
    self, and those alone are victors who control their passions and abstain from sin. I have
    conquered self and overcome all sin, therefore I am the Jina.'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At Benares he met Kondanna and his four companions in the
    Deer Park, now known as <b>Saranath</b>. When these five saw the Buddha coming towards
    them they addressed him as Gotama, his family name. Then the Buddha said to them, 'Call me
    not after my personal name, for it is a rude and careless way of addressing one who has
    become a Buddha. My mind is undisturbed whether people treat me with respect or
    disrespect, but it is not courteous for others to call one who looks equally with a kind
    heart upon all living beings, by his familiar name; Buddhas bring salvation to the world
    and so they ought to be treated with respect.' Then he preached them his first great
    sermon, the <b><i>Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta</i></b>, in which he explained the <b>Four
    Noble Truths</b> and the <b>Noble Eightfold Path.</b> They received ordination and formed
    the first nucleus of the holy brotherhood of disciples known as the <b><i>Sangha</i></b>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During his active life the Buddha made many converts, high
    and low, rich and poor, educated and illiterate, <i>brahmans</i> and <i>chandalas</i>,
    ascetics and householders, robbers and cannibals, nobles and peasants, men and women from
    all classes and conditions became his countless disciples, both ordained and lay. After a
    supreme ministry of forty-five years the Buddha, in his last preaching tour, came to the
    town of <b>Kusinara</b> in the eastern part of Nepal, where he passed into Nibbana at the
    ripe age of eighty. His last words to his disciples were,<b>'All conditioned things are
    subject to decay; strive with heedfulness'.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was, therefore, a human being. As a man he was
    born, as a man he lived, and as a man his life came to an end. Though a human being he
    became an extra-ordinary man,<b><i> acchariya manussa</i></b>, as he himself says in the<b><i>
    Anguttara Nikaya</i></b>; he does not claim to be an incarnation of <i>Vishnu</i>, as the
    Hindus believe, nor does he call himself a saviour who saves others by his personal
    salvation. The Buddha exhorts his disciples to depend on themselves for their salvation,
    for both purity and defilement depend on oneself. In the <b><i>Dhammapada</i></b> he says,
    'You yourselves should make the exertion, the Buddhas are only teachers. The thoughtful
    who enter the Way are freed from the bondage of sin. He who does not rouse himself when it
    is time to rise, who, though young and strong is full of sloth, whose will and thoughts
    are weak, that lazy and idle man will never find the way to enlightenment. Strenuousness
    is the path of immortality, sloth the path of death. Those who are strenuous do not die;
    those who are slothful are as if dead already.'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhas point out the path, and it is left to us to follow
    that path to save ourselves. To depend on others for salvation is negative, but to depend
    on oneself is positive. In exhorting his disciples to be self-dependent the Buddha says in
    the<b><i> Parinibbana Sutta</i></b>,<b> 'Be ye lamps unto yourselves; be ye refuges to
    yourselves; hold fast to the Dhamma as a lamp; hold fast to the Dhamma as a refuge; seek
    not for refuge in anyone except yourselves. Whosoever shall be a lamp unto themselves and
    a refuge unto themselves, it is they among the seekers after bodhi who shall reach the
    very topmost height.'</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, the Buddha does not claim the monopoly of
    Buddhahood which, factually, is not the special prerogative of any specially chosen
    person. He reached the highest possible state of perfection to which any person could
    aspire, and he revealed the only straight path that leads thereto. According to the
    teachings of the Buddha anybody may aspire to that supreme state of perfection if he makes
    the necessary exertion; thus, instead of disheartening his followers and reserving that
    exalted state only for himself, the Buddha gave encouragement and inducement to follow his
    noble example.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The teaching founded by the Buddha is known in English as<b>
    Buddhism</b>.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>2. THE
    BUDDHA AND HIS MESSAGE</b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The technique of salvation which is characteristic of
    Buddhism is very different from that of all other religions. They say, 'Turn to God, pray
    to him, give yourself utterly to him, become one with him.' Christianity, Hinduism, Islam.
    Zoroastrianism and Judaism, base their teachings on the idea of God. These religions say
    that until a man can believe in God he cannot begin to live a truly righteous or useful
    life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We know that thousands in these religions do live lives of
    charity, purity and holiness, but the strange fact is that lives of charity, purity and
    holiness are also lived by thousands who follow the Buddha who never asked men to worship
    any god as the first step towards their salvation. The Buddha taught men to rely upon
    themselves in order to achieve their own salvation, and not to look to any external
    saviour. He never put himself forward as a mediator between us and our final salvation,
    but he could tell us what to do because he had done it himself and so knew the way.
    However, unless we ourselves act, the Buddha cannot take us to our goal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Though we may 'take refuge in the Buddha', the Buddhist
    phrase in the simple ceremony of pledging ourselves to live a righteous life, it is not
    through any blind faith that he can save us. He can point the way, he can tell us of its
    difficulties and the beauties which we shall find as we tread the way, but he cannot tread
    it for us, we must tread the way ourselves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yet we are not left alone and unaided in this difficult
    task, for in order to help us to tread the way to our goal, Nibbana. the Buddha has mapped
    out the moral life which must be lived. Like an engineer who constructs a pathway up a
    difficult mountain, so the Buddha has constructed a code of morality. First come the<i><b>
    panca sila</b></i>, the five precepts as they are called, namely, not to kill, not to
    steal, not to commit sexual misconduct, not to lie, and not to take any intoxicating
    liquor or drug. These are not the Buddha's commandments, the breaking of which entails
    sin, but they represent the preliminary ideals of a virtuous life which a man is to accept
    wholeheartedly if he is to call himself a Buddhist. He does not promise to the Buddha not
    to break the precepts, he gives the promise to himself, for the phrase is, '<i>Panatipata</i>,
    etc..', I undertake the precept to refrain from taking life, and so on in respect of the
    other precepts. Each man, as he repeats the precepts, puts himself upon his own honour to
    do his best not to break them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And if he breaks them? Then the only repentance which is
    constructive is to make the pledge to himself again, indeed, as many times as are
    necessary, day after day, month after month, year after year, until he wins the struggle
    against his lower nature. A man must win the goal of purity and nobility by himself; not
    the Buddha, nor the angels, nor any god can bring a man to salvation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So you see, the practice of the moral life is the very
    core and essence of Buddhism; character is the product of daily, hourly actions, daily
    acts of kindness, charity and unselfishness. By doing just actions we come to be just, and
    we judge strength by the power of action. In the same way as a musician is not one who
    merely loves music, but is one who is able to blend and combine sounds in a manner
    pleasing to the ear, so also it is the quality of our actions that determines our
    character.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism there is a spark of <i><b>bodhi</b></i>
    (wisdom) in the heart of every sentient being, but in ordinary beings it has not been
    developed into its power by the weakening of selfish desire, anger and ignorance. Each
    life is a stage in the pilgrimage from small to great, from less to more, and from
    ignorance to enlightenment. Everyone is the architect of his own fate. We shall reap in
    the future, in this life or the next, what we are sowing now. As we had the power in the
    past to make our present what it is, so we have equal power now to create a happy and
    useful future. To win the final victory of perfection it is necessary for each one of us
    to defeat the three great internal enemies, namely, selfish desire, anger and delusion. To
    defeat these three great enemies it is necessary for each one of us to live a life of
    charity, to extend his love towards all beings and to develop the spark of wisdom into its
    fullest power.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is only when these three great enemies are defeated,
    and the final victory of salvation is won, that there will be no war, and we shall have
    real and everlasting peace and happiness.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>3. WHAT
    IS BUDDHISM?</b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is Buddhism, is it a philosophy or a religion or an
    ethical system? Strictly speaking it is not a philosophy, for it does not contain an
    elaborate system of theories and facts exclusively for cogitation, although it must be
    admitted that the Buddha has anticipated much modern speculation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is known as Buddhism consists of three aspects, the
    doctrinal (<i>pariyatti</i>), the practical (<i>patipatti</i>) and the realizable (<i>pativedha</i>),
    which are interdependent and interrelated. The doctrine is preserved in the <i>Tipitaka</i>.
    This <i>Tipitaka</i>, which contains the word of the Buddha, is estimated to be about
    eleven times the size of the Christian bible. As the word itself implies, it consists of
    three baskets, namely: the Basket of Discipline (<i>Vinaya Pitaka</i>), the Basket of
    Discourses (<i>Sutta Pitaka</i>) and the Basket of Ultimate Things (<i>Abhidhamma Pitaka</i>).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The<b><i> Vinaya Pitaka</i></b>, which is sub-divided into
    five books, deals with the rules and regulations of the Order of monks and nuns, and gives
    a detailed account of the life and ministry of the Buddha. The <b><i>Sutta Pitaka</i></b>
    consists of discourses preached by the Buddha. and also, in some instances, by his
    distinguished disciples such as the <i>Ven. Sariputta, Moggallana, Ananda</i>, etc.
    Divided into twenty-six books it is rather like a collection of prescriptions, for the
    sermons were propounded to suit the occasion and the temperament of different individuals.
    The <b><i>Abhidhamma Pitaka</i></b>, however, is the most important and the most
    interesting because it elaborates the four ultimate things, i.e., consciousness (<i>citta</i>),
    mental properties (mental concomitants, <i>cetasika</i>), matter (material qualities,<i>
    rupa</i>) and <i>Nibbana</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus we see that Buddhism is concerned with truth and
    facts, and has nothing to do with theories and philosophies which may be accepted as
    gospel truth today and may be thrown overboard tomorrow. The Buddha has presented us with
    no new astounding philosophical theories, nor did he venture to create any new material
    science, rather did he explain to us what is within and without so far as it concerns our
    emancipation, and ultimately he laid out a path of deliverance which is unique.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It should be understood that the Buddha did not preach all
    that he knew. On one occasion while he was passing through a forest the Buddha took a
    handful of leaves and said to some bhikkhus, 'O bhikkhus, what I have taught is comparable
    to the leaves in my hand, and what I have not taught is comparable to the amount of leaves
    in the forest', for he taught us only that which is necessary for our emancipation.
    Incidentally, though, he has made some statements which are accepted as scientific truths
    today.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is not merely to be preserved in books, nor is it
    a subject to be studied only from an historical or literary point of view, on the
    contrary, it is to be learned and put into practice in the course of one's daily life, for
    without actual practice one cannot appreciate truth. Study and practice come first, but
    above all it is realization, self-realization, which is its ultimate goal. As such,
    Buddhism is comparable to a raft which is meant for the sole purpose of escaping from the
    ocean of<i> samsara</i>; Buddhism, therefore, cannot strictly be called a philosophy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Is it then a religion? Neither is it a religion in the
    sense in which that word is commonly understood, for it is not a system of faith and
    worship. Buddhism does not demand blind faith from its adherents; here, mere belief is
    dethroned and replaced by confidence, <i>saddha</i>, as it is known in <i>Pali</i>, based
    on knowledge of truth. The confidence placed by a follower in the Buddha is like that of a
    sick man towards the physician, or that of a student towards his teacher. A Buddhist seeks
    refuge in the Buddha because it is he who discovered the path of deliverance. A sick man
    should use the remedy which the physician prescribes in order to be cured, and the pupil
    should study what his teacher says in order to become learned. In just the same way, a
    Buddhist who possesses<i> saddha</i> should follow the Buddha's instructions in order to
    gain deliverance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The starting point of Buddhism is reasoning, or
    understanding, or in other words<i> sammaditthi</i>. To seekers after truth the Buddha
    says, 'Do not believe in anything on mere hearsay; do not believe in anything that is
    traditional just because it is old and handed down through generations; do not believe in
    rumours or anything because people talk about it; do not believe simply because the
    written testimony of some ancient sage is shown to thee; never believe in anything because
    the custom of many years leads thee to regard it as true; do not believe in anything on
    the mere authority of thy teacher or priests. According to thine own experience, and after
    thorough investigation, whatever agrees with thy reason and is conducive to thine own
    well-being and to that of all other living beings, accept that as truth and live
    accordingly.' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Is Buddhism, then, an ethical system? It no doubt contains
    an excellent code of morals which is adaptable to all climes and ages, but it is much more
    than ordinary morality. The <i>Singala Sutta</i> (<i>Sigalovada Sutta</i>), <i>Mangala
    Sutta</i>, <i>Metta Sutta, Vasala Sutta, Dhammika Sutta,</i> etc., should be read
    carefully to understand the high standard of morality; but morality, or <i>sila</i>, is
    only the A.B.C. of Buddhism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism, therefore, is neither a philosophy nor a
    religion, nor an ordinary ethical code, it is the doctrine of actuality, a means of
    deliverance: or, as it is called in <i>Pali</i>, the<i> Dhamma.</i></font></p>
    <hr>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>4.
    BUDDHISM</b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If a man is to build up a successful, healthy and happy
    life, a life that will stoutly resist the fiercest storms of adversity, it must be based
    on sound moral principles such as the five precepts laid down by the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our life is what we make it by our own thoughts and deeds,
    thus it is through his own thoughts that a man rises or falls. To think habitually of a
    certain virtue is to become that virtue, and to allow the mind to dwell on thoughts of
    vice for any length of time is to become guilty of that vice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a common delusion that man's failings and lapses
    in conduct are due to other people about him, and not to himself, but this delusion arises
    from the error of believing that others can be responsible for a man's misdeeds and
    errors. All a man's weaknesses and sins arise within his own mind and heart, he alone is
    responsible for them, and those who succumb to being induced, persuaded or excited by
    tempters, become co-operators in sin and vice. Tempters are quite powerless against those
    who refuse to respond. Any weakness lies in a man's own mind, and if he has given in to
    others' promptings, the real source of his troubles, his failures and miseries, is his own
    weakness; he is responsible for his every action.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A common excuse for wrong-doing is that right action would
    lead to failure, loss and unhappiness: thus immature-minded people concern themselves less
    with the deed than with the consequences of the deed. The longing to obtain pleasant
    results is the cause of much mental confusion. making men incapable of distinguishing
    between good and evil, worthy and unworthy, right and wrong. Right action is very simple,
    whereas wrong action is inextricably mixed, one falsehood often requiring the concoction
    of several others to hide it. Just one act of dishonesty, corruption or fraud needs a
    dozen other wrongs to fortify it, which means the creation of complications that bring
    trouble and unhappiness to oneself and to others.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The right-minded man concerns himself with the act, and
    not with the consequences; he considers not what is pleasant or unpleasant, but what is
    good and right according to the rules of morality. When he does right, and does not seek
    any result, he is relieved of all the burdens of doubt, fear and perplexity, he never
    becomes involved in an inextricable tangle or difficulty. His mind is at peace, his
    conscience serene; these are the requisites for health, happiness and long life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>LIKES AND DISLIKES</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One often hears the expression, 'I do not feel like doing
    it'. Such a man is in bondage to self when he is under the sway of his feelings, habits
    and inclinations, he is not free from servility in respect of his feelings. Those who wish
    for freedom in this way must be guided by reason and willpower, bringing calm, deliberate
    judgment to bear on all things, being mindful at all times that, 'This is a matter of
    right or wrong, good or bad, it is needful or needless, my feelings have nothing to do
    with it. It is not how one feels. but what is the proper thing to do'. If our life and
    conduct are ordered by our likes and dislikes, we are weaklings, puppets and bondslaves,
    apt to be overwhelmed by indolence and incompetence, ill-health and frustration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two kinds of emotion, (1) negative or
    destructive, and (2) positive or constructive.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Negative emotion such as ill-will, jealousy, bitterness,
    malice, anger, spitefulness, hatred, despair, fear, impatience, worries, anxieties, should
    be guarded against, for they poison the warm current of life and often cause troubles in
    the heart, brain and blood vessels. They invariably cause weakness, failure, folly, misery
    or untimely death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Positive or constructive emotion such as pity, sympathy
    for others, appreciation of the good, kindness, goodwill and altruistic motives are to be
    encouraged and cultivated. They react through the mind on the vital glands of the body to
    build up robust health, happiness, prosperity and long life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right mindfulness, right attention, is the seventh step in
    the <b>Noble Eightfold Path </b>that leads to the overcoming of sorrow and to the
    attainment of moral purity, and it includes: 1. Concentration on the body, 2.
    concentration on one's feelings, 3. concentration on one's thoughts, and 4. concentration
    on mental objects. In the <i>Majjhima Nikaya</i> we read of ten great blessings which are
    assured to the person who practises them. None who desire good health. happiness and
    wisdom can dispense with meditation in Buddhism; moral culture through meditation is a
    fundamental step in deliverance from suffering and unhappiness. By means of meditation one
    learns to reason through every situation, instead of reacting emotionally according to
    likes and dislikes, according to prejudice, custom or tradition; one learns to rationalize
    the experience of life. When this lesson is learnt one becomes supreme over every
    circumstance, happening or event.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Take as an illustration two persons who meet financial
    disaster. One reacts emotionally and falls into a stormy sea of bitterness, loses all hope
    and sinks in health, vigour and resolution, or he kills himself to end it all. The other
    man, who has learnt to think over the problems of life, to meditate, to rationalize,
    applies every available method to overcome the problem and finds a satisfactory solution,
    for he has exercised his mind just as the athlete exercises his muscles. He is the master,
    while the other is a slave. Many disappointments and breakdowns would not exist if people
    were to live according to the Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So you see, Buddhism is a philosophy of hope and of
    certainty of achievement. It is the gospel of attainment, of deliverance from unhappiness
    and suffering. The Buddha explained that in every mortal, however humble or lowly he may
    be, there is a grain of worth, a little of goodness, a spark of wisdom which he can kindle
    into a flame, which he can develop by conscious human effort. The Buddha encouraged
    everyone to strive for spiritual development, declaring that every right effort is sure of
    a reward here and .now, in this life, or in a future one.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also proclaimed that every low desire, every
    longing for ignoble things, every unworthy feeling that we conquer and trample down, and
    every difficulty we meet heroically and victoriously, with righteousness according to the
    rules of morality, becomes another rung on the ladder by which we can climb towards a
    nobler, higher life. This is the law of progressive development, the Buddhist doctrine of
    evolution, of attainment, of accomplishment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha drew for us the picture of progressive
    existence, a growth from small to great, from less to more, from ignorance to knowledge,
    of development depending upon inward strength, diligence and effort put forth from life to
    life. This is the doctrine of human perfection won through altruism, discipline and
    wisdom.</font></p>

    THERAVADA BUDDHISM</b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The name of the founder of what is known in the West as
    Buddhism, was <i>Gotama</i>, this being the name of the clan or family to which he
    belonged. The word 'Buddha' means 'awakened', or 'enlightened one', and is not a name but
    a title of honour bestowed upon the sage <i>Gotama</i> who attained enlightenment under
    the <i>Bodhi</i> Tree at <i>Buddhagaya </i>in India.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Gotama </i>was born as the son of an Indian king on the
    border of modern Nepal six hundred and twenty-three years before Christ, and to mark the
    spot as the birthplace of the great teacher of mankind, and as a token of reverence for
    him, the<b> Emperor Asoka</b> in 239 B.C. erected a pillar bearing the inscription, 'Here
    was the Enlightened One born'. At the time of his birth the wise men of the kingdom said
    that the signs showed that he would become either a very great ruler or a very great
    religious teacher. His father, wanting him to be a very great ruler, kept his son's mind
    turned towards worldly things instead of the religious life, and tried to arrange that his
    son should never see anything of an unpleasant nature that might set him thinking
    seriously about the world and life. In his twenty-ninth year, however, while on his way to
    the royal park, <i>Gotama </i>for the first time saw an old man, a sick man and a dead
    man, and he learned that all men without exception were subject to birth, old age and
    death, and that all worldly pleasures were only a prelude to pain. It was when he saw a
    monk that he realized that in order to learn the way to overcome man's universal sorrow he
    must give up worldly pleasures, and accordingly he renounced his kingdom and became an
    ascetic.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Gotama </i>wandered about the countryside as a seeker
    after truth and real peace, approaching many a distinguished teacher of his day, but
    nobody was competent to give him what he earnestly sought. He strenuously practised all
    forms of severe austerities, and made a superhuman effort for six long years until
    eventually his delicate body was reduced to almost a skeleton, but the more he tormented
    his body, the further away he was from his goal. Finally, having realized the utter
    futility of self-mortification, he decided to follow a different course, avoiding the two
    extremes of self-mortification and self-indulgence. The new path which he discovered was
    the Middle Way, the <b>Eightfold Path,</b> which subsequently became one of the salient
    characteristics of his teachings. By following this path his wisdom grew to its fullest
    power, and he discovered the<b> Four Noble Truths</b>, understood things as they truly are
    and finally attained full enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a man Prince<i> Gotama</i>, by his own will, effort,
    wisdom and love, attained Buddhahood, that highest possible state of perfection, and he
    revealed to mankind the only straight path that leads thereto. A special characteristic of
    Buddhism is that anybody may aspire even to the state of the Buddha himself if he makes
    the necessary exertion, it is a sort of evolutionary process and is achieved by' one's own
    effort.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha laid stress on human dignity, and taught the
    worth of the human being. A Buddha in the making is a <i>Bodhisatta,</i> and as a <i>Bodhisatta</i>
    through countless births he suffered all, sacrificed all, and fulfilled every perfection,
    so that on some distant day he might achieve this unique goal, the goal of winning - not
    only for himself, but for all beings - deliverance from the heavy burdens of birth, old
    age, disease and death. The Buddha himself tells us of his origin, and how it started with
    an inflexible, aspiring resolve; he tells us of the gradual perfection of the flux that
    made that aspiration, and how finally he won full enlightenment. In this way, instead of
    disheartening his followers and reserving that exalted state only for himself, the Buddha
    encouraged and induced them to follow his noble example.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The word of the Buddha is called<i> Dhamma</i>, which in
    the <i>Sanskrit</i> form becomes<i> Dharma</i>. It means truth, that which really is; it
    also means law, the law which exists in a man's own heart and mind. It is the principle of
    righteousness, therefore the Buddha appeals to man to be noble, pure and charitable, not
    in order to please any god, but in order to be true to the highest in himself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Dhamma</i>, this law of righteousness, exists not only
    in a man's heart and mind, but it exists in the universe also; all the universe is an
    embodiment or revelation of<i> Dhamma</i>. The laws of nature which modern science has
    discovered are revelations of <i>Dhamma</i>; if the moon rises and sets, it is because of <i>Dhamma</i>,
    for <i>Dhamma</i> is that law within the universe which makes matter act in the ways
    studied in physics, chemistry, zoology, botany and astronomy; <i>Dhamma</i> exists in the
    universe just as <i>Dhamma </i>exists in the heart and mind of man. If a man will live by<i>
    Dhamma</i> he will escape misery and come to<i> Nibbana</i>, the final release from
    suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus Buddhism is not a religion in the sense in which that
    word is commonly understood, it is not a system of faith or worship, Buddhism begins as a
    search for truth. It does not begin with unfounded assumptions concerning any god or first
    cause, and it does not claim to present the whole truth of the absolute beginning and end
    of mankind's spiritual pilgrimage in the form of a divine revelation. The Buddha himself
    searched and discovered with direct insight the nature of the cosmos, the cause of its
    arising and of its passing away, and the real cause of suffering together with the way in
    which it could be brought to an end, for the sake of all living beings. Having done so, he
    proclaimed the principles on which he had conducted his research, so that all who wished
    to do so could follow his system and know the final truth them selves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught men to rely upon themselves in order to
    achieve their own deliverance, and not to look to any external saviour. He never puts
    himself forward as a mediator between us and our final deliverance, but he can tell us
    what to do because he has done it himself and so knows the way; however, unless we
    ourselves act, the Buddha cannot take us to our goal. He can point out the way, he can
    tell us of its difficulties and of the beauties which we shall find as we tread the way,
    but he cannot tread it for us, we must tread the way ourselves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The life process of the universe is governed by the
    natural law of cause and effect. The cause ever becomes the effect, and the effect becomes
    the cause, and so birth is followed by death, and death on the other hand is followed by
    birth; birth and death being two phases of the same life process. In this circle of cause
    and effect, or of birth and death, known in Buddhism as<i> samsara</i>, a first beginning
    is not discoverable; it is said, 'The origin of phenomena is not discoverable, and the
    beginning of beings obstructed by ignorance and ensnared by craving is not to be found.' (<i>Samyutta
    Nikaya II</i>). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism the universe evolved, but it did not
    evolve out of nothingness, it evolved out of the dispersed matter of a previous universe;
    and when this universe is dissolved, its dispersed matter, or its residual energy which is
    continuously renewing itself, will in time give rise to another universe in the same way.
    The process is therefore cyclic and continuous, and the universe itself is composed of
    millions of world systems such as that which we know as our own solar system, each with
    its various planes of existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What of the soul? That which we call 'man' is composed of
    mind and matter. According to Buddhism, apart from mind and matter (<i>nama</i> and<i>
    rupa</i>) which constitute the so-called man, there is no such thing as an immortal soul,<i>atta</i>,
    which lies behind them. Matter (<i>rupa</i>) is the visible form of invisible qualities
    and forces, and there are altogether twenty-eight types of material qualities which
    constitute the physical body of an animate being. Mind (<i>nama</i>) is the most important
    part of a being, and consists of the four mental aggregates, namely: </font><ol>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Feeling, </i>of whatever kind <i>(vedana)</i></font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Perception, </i>of sense objects, or reaction to the
        senses <i>(sanna)</i></font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Mental Properties, </i>the fifty types of mental
        formations including good and evil tendencies and faculties <i>(sankhara)</i></font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Consciousness, </i>which is the fundamental factor of
        all the other three <i>(vinnana)</i></font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the combination of the five aggregates, or of the
    material and mental forces, is called a being which may assume as many names as its types,
    shapes, forms and so on may vary, according to the mode of physical and mental changes.
    Man is, therefore, a moral being of good and evil tendencies, of qualities and forces. who
    has unlimited powers physically. mentally and morally; and in the heart of every human
    being there is a spark of wisdom, but in ordinary mortals it is dormant or crippled by its
    unenlightened intercourse with selfish desire, hatred and ignorance. As a Buddhist the
    purpose of a man's life should be to grow from small to great, from less to more, from
    ignorance to enlightenment and from imperfection to perfection. Man is the architect of
    his own fate, and he will reap what he sow.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the material and mental forces combine and re-combine
    with no underlying substance or soul to make them permanent, and this process of becoming,
    the wheel of life, continues indefinitely until its main cause, craving or selfish desire
    for existence, is totally annihilated. It is this desire which sets the wheel of life in
    motion, and it is manifested in action which is in reality volition or will-power. It is
    called '<i>kamma</i>' in Pali, but <i>karma</i>' in Sanskrit, and it is this<i> kamma</i>,
    this volitional action which is responsible for the creation of being..</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Kamma</i> means all kinds of intentional actions,
    whether mental, verbal or physical; that is, all thoughts, words and deeds. Every action
    produces an effect; it is cause first and effect afterwards. We therefore may say that
    kamma is 'the law of cause and effect', and that man is the master of his own destiny,
    child of his past and parent of his future.<i>Kamma,</i> however, is not determinism, nor
    is it an excuse for fatalism; the past influences the present but does not dominate it.
    The past is the background against which life goes on from moment to moment, and the past
    together with the present influences the future; but one should remember that only the
    present moment exists, and the responsibility for using the present moment for good or ill
    lies with each individual. Man has a certain amount of free will and can therefore modify
    his actions and affect his future, so if a man does a good deed or utters a good word or
    thinks a good thought, the effect upon him will be to increase the tendencies towards
    goodness in him. The practice of good <i>kamma</i>. when fully developed, will enable man
    to overcome evil and thus bring him to his goal <i>Nibbana</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the root of man's trouble is his primal state of
    ignorance, and from ignorance comes desire which sets the <i>kammic </i>force in motion.
    The Buddhist ascends to <i>Nibbana</i> through the <b>Middle Way</b>, the path of wisdom,
    morality and mind-control, or meditation; he ascends through the cycle of rebirths, and
    perfects himself by conquering his cravings through wisdom and love. The attainment of the
    perfect type involves the utmost development of all the faculties of man by the persistent
    effort of one's own reasoning, understanding and right living.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism teaches that with the practice of meditation and
    mind culture one can acquire the five supernormal powers, i.e.. celestial eye, celestial
    ear, memory of past births, reading the thoughts of others and various psychic powers. Not
    only this, but Buddhism also teaches that with the attainment of <i>Nibbana</i> in this
    life itself, through enlightenment and wisdom, one can reach the end of this chain of
    rebirths</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Nibbana</i> is not annihilation, neither is it a kind
    of nothingness, it is the state free from any possibility of the re-arising of conditioned
    existence, the ultimate peace and happiness. In the Buddhist scriptures it is always
    described in positive terms such as the highest refuge, safety, emancipation, peace and so
    on.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism consists of three aspects: doctrinal, practical
    and realizable. The doctrinal aspect is preserved in the scriptures called <i>Tipitaka</i>,
    or 'Three Baskets', the canon which contains the words of the Buddha, and which has been
    estimated by English translators to be eleven times the size of the Christian Bible.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the teachings of the Buddha can be summed up in one
    verse: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong><em><font face="Times New Roman">'To refrain from all evil, <br>
      To do what is good, <br>
      To purify the mind.<br>
      This is the teaching of the Buddhas.'</font></em></strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This verse embodies the three stages on the grand highway
    that leads to enlightenment, the three stages of morality, concentration and wisdom.
    Morality regulates word and deed, concentration controls the mind, but it is wisdom, the
    final stage, that enables the spiritual man to annihilate completely the passions which
    are ever creating a turmoil within him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Soon after the attainment of enlightenment the Buddha
    founded the Order of monks (<i>Sangha</i>) containing both the community of those noble
    disciples who have reached the <i>ariyan</i> noble stages, of which the last is perfect
    sainthood (<i>arahat</i>). and also the community of Buddhist monks who are striving to
    reach the <i>ariyan</i> noble stages. The Order of monks increased, and within the forty-
    five years of the Buddha's ministry it had spread throughout India and beyond, and the
    gospel of liberation became known to all whose eyes were but lightly covered with dust. A
    similar order was established by the Buddha for nuns, with all the same rules and such
    additional ones as were required for women. The Buddhist <i>Sangha</i>, which historically
    is the earliest monastic institution to be governed by perfectly democratic principles,
    continues to the present day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the seventh day after the Buddha had passed away<b>
    Maha Kassapa</b>, who was head of the <i>Sangha</i>, decided to hold a convocation to
    establish the authoritative teachings of the Buddha. They then held a great council at <i>Rajagaha</i>
    under the patronage of <b>King Ajatasattu</b>, and the Buddhist canon was collected and
    recited in chants.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the first century after the demise of the Buddha,
    there was only one schism among Buddhists, but at the end of the first century during the
    reign of <b>King Kalasoka</b> a community of monks attempted to introduce ten new
    indulgences into the discipline of the <i>Sangha</i>, pronouncing them to be allowable to
    the<i> Sangha</i>. To suppress this heresy, and for the purpose of securing the permanency
    of the doctrines of the Buddha, seven hundred leading <i>arahats </i>having <i>Revata</i>
    for their chief, protected by King <i>Kalasoka</i>, held the <b>Second great council </b>at
    <i>Vesali</i> in precisely the same manner as the previous one.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <b>Third great council </b>was held in the third
    century after the Buddha, under the patronage of the <b>Emperor Asoka</b>. On the advice
    of Moggaliputta Tissa, who headed the third great council, Emperor Asoka sent messengers
    of the<i> Dhamma</i> to the various foreign countries known at that time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <b>Fourth great council</b> was held in Ceylon early
    in the sixth century after the Buddha, headed by <b>Maha Agga</b> and supported by <b>King
    Vattagamini</b>. At that council the<i> Tipitaka</i>, which had been transmitted in Pali
    by memory from the time of the Buddha, was committed to writing for the first time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The<b> Fifth great council</b> was held in Mandalay,
    Burma. early in the twenty-fifth century after the Buddha, headed by <b>Jagara Thera</b>
    with the support of <b>King Mindon</b>. At that time the whole <i>Tipitaka</i> was
    inscribed on seven hundred and twenty-nine marble slabs placed at the foot of <i>Mandalay
    Hill</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <b>Sixth great council</b> was held in Rangoon, Burma,
    commencing at the full moon of May, 2498 years after the demise of the Buddha, and ending
    on the 2500th anniversary (May 1956). At that council the <i>Tipitaka</i> was recited in
    Pali, and steps were taken toward translating it into some more modern languages.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In modern times there are mainly two schools of Buddhism,
    i.e., <i>Theravada</i>. which is practised chiefly in Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia
    and Laos; and<i>Mahayana</i>, which is practised in China, Tibet and Japan.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Theravada</i>, the Way of the Elders, was the original
    and only tradition from the earliest times to the time of the second great council when
    the <b>Mahasangika school</b>, a precursor of <i>Mahayana</i>, was formed. <b>Sarvastivada</b>
    then arose as the second major school which differed from <i>Theravada</i>, although in
    only minor details at first, after which it divided into several sub-sects, many of which
    eventually developed into<i>Mahayana</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The main differences between <i>Theravada</i> and <i>Mahayana
    </i>Buddhism are the concepts in regard to the Buddha himself, as well as in regard to the
    <i>Bodhisatta </i>ideal, the canon of scriptures, the development of doctrine, the
    celibacy of the monks and the form of ceremony.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The similarities between the two schools of Buddhism are:
    the Four Noble Truths, which relate human suffering to the attachment of what is only
    transient and impermanent; the <i>anatta</i> (non-ego) doctrine and the doctrine of the
    chain of causation, although variously interpreted; the Noble Eightfold Path, as the way
    of deliverance which involves a moral discipline as well as the practice of meditation;
    the virtue of metta, loving-kindness, as being fundamental; the acceptance of the Buddhist
    Teaching as being universal in its application; and the Middle Way of life to the goal of <i>Nibbana</i>,
    the highest of all happiness.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>6. THE
    MEANING OF BUDDHISM</b></strong></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><strong><i>(Extract from
    talk of above title)</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist ascends to Nibbana through many stages of the
    Middle Way, the path of wisdom, morality, and control. There is not space enough here even
    to mention these phases or the various aspects of the regimen recommended by the Buddha in
    his vast scriptures; but it may be taken for granted that the life of the conscientious
    Buddhist is full and rich. Through the cycle of rebirths he ascends, he perfects himself,
    he conquers his cravings through wisdom and love. Slowly the kammic force ebbs away, the
    flame dies down.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">At the root of man's trouble is his primal
    state of ignorance. From ignorance comes desire, which sets the kammic force in motion.
    Hence the way to Nibbana lies through knowledge, and we come again full circle to Dhamma,
    the Buddha's teachings. For in Dhamma, as truth, lies release from ignorance and desire
    and perpetual change. and the Buddha has shown us the way to truth</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What, then, is the meaning of Buddhism? Ultimately
    Buddhism, although not strictly speaking a religion, is a systematic exercise in
    spirituality, certainly one of the greatest ever conceived. It offers the individual a
    means by which he may fulfil himself through understanding, reaching eventually the plane
    of the supraperson on which both the self and self-knowledge are no longer useful. <i>Meister
    Eckhart</i>, the Great Christian mystic, said: The kingdom of God is for none but the
    thoroughly dead'. The Buddhist would agree, though he would probably prefer a less grim
    way of saying it. Nibbana in life, the peace which passeth all understanding', is the
    conquest of life, the discovery of the permanent in its flux of psychophysical accidents
    and circumstances. The Buddhist believes that through meditation and good hard thought he
    can follow the Buddha through the successive stages of enlightenment and achieve at last
    the perfect wisdom which surmounts all need.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But by no means all Buddhists are monks or adepts. What
    does Buddhism mean for the ordinary person going about his work in the world? All through
    the Buddha's teaching, repeated stress is laid on self-reliance and resolution. Buddhism
    makes man stand on his own feet, it arouses his self-confidence and energy. The Buddha
    again and again reminded his followers that there is no one, either in a heaven or on
    earth, who can help them or free them from the results of their past evil deeds. The
    Buddhist knows that the powers of his own mind and spirit are enough to guide him in the
    present and shape his future and bring him eventually to the truth. He knows that he
    possesses a strength which is ultimately unsurpassable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, Buddhism points unequivocally to the moral
    aspect of everyday life. Though Nibbana is amoral, in the sense that final peace
    transcends the conflict of good and evil, the path to wisdom is definitely a moral path.
    This follows logically from the doctrine of kamma. Every action must produce an effect,
    and one's own actions produce an effect in one's own life. Thus the kammic force which
    carries us inevitably onward can only be a force for good, that is, for our ultimate
    wisdom, if each action is a good action.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This doctrine finds its highest expression in metta, the
    Buddhist goal of universal and all-embracing love. Metta means much more than brotherly
    feeling or kindheartedness, though these are part of it. It is active benevolence, a love
    which is expressed and fulfilled in active ministry for the uplifting of fellow beings.
    Metta goes hand in hand with helpfulness and a willingness to forego self- interest in
    order to promote the welfare and happiness of mankind. It is metta which in Buddhism is
    the basis for social progress. Metta is, finally, the broadest and intensest conceivable
    degree of sympathy, expressed in the throes of suffering and change. The true Buddhist
    does his best to exercise metta toward every living being and identifies himself with all,
    making no distinctions whatsoever with regard to caste, colour, class or sex. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition, of course, the teachings of the Buddha are a
    prime cultural force in Oriental life, just as the Bible is the ultimate source of much
    Western art and thought. The Buddhist scriptures are larger and more detailed than the
    Christian Bible, however, and in translation would fill a dozen volumes. In Pali the
    language of the scriptures, the Buddha's teachings are called<i><b> Tipitaka</b></i>,
    which means 'The Three Baskets'.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i><b>Vinaya Pitaka</b></i>, 'The Basket of Discipline',
    consists of five books which expound the rules of monastic life.<i><b> Sutta Pitaka</b></i>,
    'The Basket of Discourses', is a collection of discussions, stories, poems, and proverbs,
    written in simple language, imparting all the precepts of practical Buddhism. The third
    basket, <i><b>Abhidhamma Pitaka</b></i>, or 'Basket of Ultimate Things', deals with
    epistemological, metaphysical and psychological matters and is of interest mainly to
    trained philosophers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the Tipitaka offers cohesive guidance at every level
    of intellectual, ethical and spiritual activity. The Buddha's word is light, a lamp for
    Burma -- and for everyone.</font></p>

    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>7. WHAT
    BUDDHISM MEANS TO A BUDDHIST</b></strong></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><strong><em><i>(Lecture to
    the High Court Buddhist Association, Rangoon)</i></em></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The title of my talk this afternoon is 'What Buddhism
    means to a Buddhist'. To a Buddhist, Buddhism is not a religion in the sense in which that
    word is commonly understood: but to him or to her Buddhism is a practical method of life
    --- to show how to live rightly thereby, happily and peacefully in spite of the unrest
    that is prevailing in the world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism, we say, is not a religion because it is not a
    system of faith and worship. The word 'religion' usually means a system of faith and
    worship but Buddhism is a way of life, and it is also a way of understanding the
    conditions of life so that a Buddhist may be able to live in harmony with other people and
    also in harmony with the laws of righteousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is founded on reason. Therefore it is a
    scientific explanation of the natural laws of life and not a set of dogmas laid down
    authoritatively; there are no dogmas in Buddhism. You know what a dogma means, a dogma is
    a rigid system laid down by authorities as representing the Truth; it is, so to speak, an
    arrogant declaration of one's own opinion. In Buddhism there are no such dogmas, but there
    are laid down a set of facts and principles for us to live by --- for us to follow.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism declares the laws of righteousness, the Universal
    law, the laws of cause and effect <i>(<b>Dhamma Niyama) </b></i>proclaiming that man is
    the master of his own destiny. He can mould his own life according to his ideas as a
    Buddhist. Buddhism removes that fear of death which haunts every untrained mind. Buddhism
    is the right way of life which is neither optimistic nor pessimistic.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many people in the West think that Buddhism is
    pessimistic. On the contrary, the Buddhist way of life is neither optimistic nor
    pessimistic. Many people in the world, especially the unthinking, carefree sort --- would
    like to have an optimistic view of life. Whenever such a man becomes depressed he is
    advised to be optimistic, but according to the Buddhist view this is not correct.
    Optimism, being an overestimated view of the condition of life, does not take the right
    view; nor is the pessimist's view, which underestimates the actual condition of life, the
    right view.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The right view of life is the Middle Way <i>(<b>Majjhima-patipadda</b>)
    </i>between these two extremes. Both these two extremes are futile for anyone to follow.
    So to a Buddhist, Buddhism means the right way of life --- a method by which a man can
    live happily, peacefully and with security for the present and security in the hereafter.
    In Great Britain people talk of future security but the security they speak of is very
    temporary. The Buddhist way of security is permanent, eternal and lasting.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The lives of men, and in fact the whole universe of living
    beings, are governed by unchanging, eternal laws, such as the laws of cause and effect,
    the laws of the mind or the laws of psychology <i>(<b>Citta-niyama</b>). </i>So the whole
    universe is governed by these eternal laws and not by any imaginary God. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For instance, sin, according to Buddhism, is not like the
    original sin mentioned in Christianity. Sin, Buddhism says, is the direct consequence of
    man's ignorance of these laws of righteous ness, these laws of justice. As you know, sin
    begets sorrow. These are ancient or eternal laws of life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To anyone who believes that the world is not governed by
    the laws of righteousness but by a changing, continually changing, God, it seems one must
    try to persuade a supreme God to make it better. It means that one does not believe that
    God's will is always just, for God has wrath which has to be appeased, compassion to be
    aroused and partiality to be won. But to the Buddhist the laws of nature, the laws of
    righteousness which govern the universe, are always the same, the same for one and all.
    Therefore, a man's duty is not to break these rules of nature --- the laws of justice ---
    not to try to change these laws by means of any prayer and by guarding against them but to
    know, to understand these eternal, unchanging laws and live in harmony with these laws.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right through the Teachings of the Buddha stress is laid
    on such attributes as self-reliance, self-confidence, resolution, energy, work, effort.
    Buddhism makes a man or woman stand on his or her own feet and be master or mistress of
    fate. Mindfulness is also emphasized greatly by the Buddha. For instance, in the <i><b>Dhammapada
    </b></i>( re: <i>Magga Vagga 276 </i>)it is said: You yourself must make an effort; the
    Buddhas are only teachers. The thoughtful who enter the Way are freed from the bondage of
    sin.' Again, in the same book, 'Mindfulness is the path of immortality, sloth the path of
    death. Those who are strenuous do not die; those who are slothful are as if dead already.(
    re: Appamada Vagga 21 ) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By deathlessness, the Buddha means <b><i>Nibbana. </i></b>All
    other conditions, all other lives are full of death --- continual, unending death. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also the Buddha said, it is in many scriptures either
    directly or indirectly, that it was through his ceaseless efforts and unshaking
    perseverance that he attained Buddhahood, the highest state of perfection, that is,
    supreme enlightenment. Yet, the Buddha does not take a monopoly of his Buddhahood; instead
    the Buddha encouraged his followers to be as high as possible in the spiritual field, or
    if they try hard enough, even as high as himself. That is the chief characteristic of
    Buddhism. The Buddha is like a good father who looks after his son well and likes him to
    be his equal or even to be his better, if the son can; that is the beauty of Buddhism. And
    the Buddha shows the way to attain self- enlightenment. He again and again reminded his
    followers that they will have to rely on themselves, rely on their own efforts and that
    there is no one anywhere either in heaven or on earth to help them, to save them from the
    results of their own misdeeds. You will remember also the saying of the Buddha: 'Evil
    deeds are done only by yourself, not by your parents, friends, relatives or advisers. So
    you yourself will have to reap the painful results of these misdeeds.' So we are
    responsible for our own evil deeds. There is no one to save us from the results of these
    evil deeds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Understanding that there is no one, no God, no big
    ceremony that can save us, that can give us spiritual salvation, the true Buddhist feels
    compelled to rely on himself and on his own efforts, and therefore he has confidence in
    his power and sense of responsibility. The tendency to rely on any God or any imaginary
    power outside oneself weakens one's own confidence and affects one's own sense of
    responsibility. The tendency to trust his own power strengthens his own confidence and
    sense of responsibility. Moral and mental progress is only possible where there is freedom
    of thought, without dogmas, without authorities. Where the dogmas come and fetter the mind
    there can be no spiritual progress; and reliance, trust in any outside authority, leads to
    spiritual stagnation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have lived many years among Christians. Some of my
    Christian friends, in a joking way perhaps, say their prayers like this: 'O God, if there
    be a God, save my soul, if I have a soul.'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, in any faith freedom of thought is important. In one
    of the six qualities of the <i>Buddha Dhamma </i>these words, as you all know, are
    mentioned <i>'Ehi Passiko' </i>'Come and see for yourself. The Buddha asked us not to
    believe in a blind way what is said by him. Of all religions Buddhism makes most demands
    on mental activity - mindfulness, earnestness, strenuousness etc. When the Buddha gave his
    famous exhortation to the<i> Kalama Princes</i> in the <i>Kalama Sutta</i> he said: 'Don't
    accept (views) from hearsay, from what you have been told, because it is mentioned in the
    scriptures, by reason of logic, in consideration of the reasoning (being plausible), by
    tolerating the views based on speculation, because of its appearance of possibility and
    because 'Our monk is venerable'. When you Kalamas realise by yourselves that these
    qualities are good, faultless, praised by the wise and that they lead to good and
    happiness when practised and observed, then Kalamas, you should abide in them after
    acquiring them.'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the Buddha urged us not to believe what is said merely
    on authority. Also not to believe in anything because it is the traditional custom -- but
    at the same time it is better not to denounce such traditions very easily. You must try to
    experiment with it, examine it thoroughly and after such examination, if it is reasonable
    and conducive to your happiness and the happiness and welfare of others, then take it,
    live up to it. This could be said to be a very grand and one of the bravest and boldest
    declarations ever made by any religious teacher.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To understand the causes and the conditions of life, one
    of the doctrines taught by the Buddha is the doctrine of <b><i>Kamma. </i></b>It is always
    good to talk a little about the doctrine of <i>Kamma </i>because it helps us to understand
    Buddhism more and at the same time to understand our daily life better. <i>Kamma </i>is a <i>Pali
    </i>word meaning 'action'. Literally it means 'good and bad actions'. It covers all
    actions, be they mental, verbal or physical; in other words, thought, words and deeds. In
    its ultimate sense <i>Kamma </i>means volition --- mental volition. In the <i>Anguttara
    Nikaya </i>mental volition is defined. Having mental volition one acts by the mind, by
    words and by actions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The doctrine of <i>Kamma </i>is not fatalism nor is it a
    doctrine of predetermination. <i>Kamma </i>is one of the 24 causes mentioned by the Buddha
    in the <b><i>Patthana </i></b>which govern the whole universe. <i>Kamma </i>is one of the
    12 causes which constitute the wheel of life and death taught by the Buddha in the <i>Vibhanga.
    Kamma </i>is also one of the four causes mentioned in the <i>Abhidhamma </i>and also in
    the <i>Suttas. Kamma </i>is not of the past only; the past merely influences the present
    but does not fully dominate it because <i>Kamma </i>is not only the past but also the
    present. The past forms only a background against which the present life works for the
    moment. The past combined with the present influences the future which is to come. Only
    the present moment exists and can be said to be within management, and the responsibility
    of using this present moment lies with each individual either for good or for evil. Every
    action produces its effect. It is the action or the cause that comes first and then the
    effect. Therefore we speak of <i>Kamma </i>as the Universal Law of Cause and Effect.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let me give you a very common example which has been given
    many times. For instance, throwing a stone is action, which is a cause. This stone strikes
    a glass window and breaks the pane. The throwing of a stone is action, a cause, but the
    stone strikes the window pane and breaks it; that is the effect. The act of throwing a
    stone at the window is the cause of the breaking of the window and the broken window is
    the effect. This effect in its turn becomes a cause for further trouble, or effect; for
    instance, the wasting of money to replace the broken glass. Because you have to replace
    the window pane and waste your money, the effect on your mind will be disappointment. Then
    you become irritable. When you are irritable your anger can easily be aroused. Your anger
    is the result (or effect) but it also becomes a cause again; because of your anger you may
    say or do something unpleasant; and this something said or done in an unpleasant manner
    may hurt something or someone and so on.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Christian terminology because you throw a stone and
    break the window and you have to pay money to buy a new window pane. the whole series of
    causes and effects leading to the final result is regarded by them as a punishment of God.
    In Buddhism there is no room for God who would come and punish you. So, to continue with
    my example, when you get angry you may say something unpleasant to somebody who may reply
    by saying something equally unpleasant to you. After that, if you are not careful, this
    may lead the two of you to a furious quarrel. For two persons this may lead to a fight.
    Between two nations this sort of thing may lead to a war. All this shows us clearly the
    existence of the laws of Cause and Effect.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If properly understood, the doctrine of <i>Kamma </i>teaches
    us to be careful with our thoughts, words and actions in daily life so that, as time goes
    on, it makes us better human beings, willing to perform better and nobler actions towards
    all and live more harmoniously with our fellow human beings. This is just one example.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a common question asked by people in other
    countries: 'Sometimes we try to do good, thinking the effect will be good, but in some
    cases the result or the effect turned out to be just the opposite. The effect is bad. In
    our locality a cunning, grasping man is called a 'shrewd' person; the more shrewd, the
    more wicked, the more greedy he is, the more is he praised as a successful hero in
    society. Again, among the dogs, the strongest and the fiercest dog gets the best bone. So
    where is the working of your laws of Cause and Effect? Where is the justice of this
    doctrine of <i>Kamma?'</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, as for that not only in Australia, for the
    questioner was an Australian, but in other parts of the world as well, cunning, greedy
    people are generally praised as if they are the conquering heroes in society. So, you too
    may ask,' When shall we get good results for the good that we have done or are trying to
    do? The good we have done seems to be very slow in bearing fruit'. Then, there was another
    man who told me that while he was engaged in saying his prayers aloud to God - somebody -
    his neighbor - came and told him that he was making a lot of noise over it. So he said to
    me. I was trying to perform a good act in good faith but the immediate effect is bad, very
    bad. So your law of <i>Kamma </i>does not work out well for us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I said to him: Though you may be worshipping God for a
    good purpose at that moment, in order to know why the man came and insulted you. you will
    have to think over what you did or said to him either that morning or the day before or
    some time in the past. Then, you may be able to find some cause why he came to insult
    you.' People are apt to forget what they have done to other people. so when the result
    come, they think it comes suddenly or that they are taken by surprise. It is not always
    sudden or that they are caught by surprise. It may be that you do not remember what you
    have done and the cause may be entirely misunderstood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore whatever comes to us is always just and must be
    accepted in the right spirit. If something very pleasant happens to us we should not be
    proud of it. It just shows that our good <i>Kamma </i>has come back to us bearing good
    fruit. If anything unpleasant occurs to us we should not be angry, depressed or
    disappointed but we should keep calm realizing that our bad <i>Kamma </i>has come back to
    us to remind us of our past mistakes. Whenever something comes to upset us let us try to
    be good, and let us never be worried, excited or angry. Let us make a firm resolve within
    ourselves to live rightly by trying to understand the working of these Laws of Cause and
    Effect - called the Law of <i>Kamma </i>in Buddhism.</font></p>

    BUDDHISM: THE PATH TO WISDOM</b></strong></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><strong><i>B.B.C. Talk<br>
    </i><em>(Reprinted from The Listener, April 15th 1948)</em></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha is one who has attained<i><b> bodhi</b></i>; by
    bodhi is meant wisdom - an ideal state of intellectual and ethical perfection, which can
    be attained by man through purely human means. The term 'Buddha' literally means
    'enlightened one' - 'a knower' - and it is the name of honour bestowed upon the Indian
    sage Gotama after obtaining enlightenment under the Bodhi tree at <i>Buddhagaya </i>in
    India. Gotama was born as the son of an Indian king on the border of modern Nepal. about
    623 years before Christ. To mark the spot as the birthplace of the greatest teacher of
    mankind and as a token of his reverence for him, the<i>Emperor Asoka</i> erected in 239
    B.C., a pillar bearing the inscription., ' Here was the Enlightened One born'. Gotama
    spent his early years in ease, luxury and culture. His father, the King. tried his best
    not to let him see anything unpleasant and ugly. In his twenty-ninth year. however. when
    Gotama went to the royal park, he saw on his way an old man, a sick man and a dead man,
    and he realized that all, without exception. were subject to birth, old age and death, and
    that all worldly pleasures were only a prelude to pain. Comprehending thus the
    universality of sorrow, he had a strong desire to find a remedy for this universal
    sickness of humanity. </font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">BUDDHA'S SEARCH FOR PEACE</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the night after his return from the park the Prince
    thought that if he remained as a ruler he would have to spend precious time in kingly
    duties to maintain his royal position, and not in searching for the remedy whereby to
    attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana the complete cessation of all sorrow. He accordingly
    gave up his kingdom and severed all worldly ties. He then lived an ascetic life and
    wandered as a seeker after real peace. He approached many a distinguished teacher of his
    day, but nobody was competent to give him what he earnestly sought. He strenuously
    practised all forms of severe austerities and made a superhuman effort for six long years.
    Eventually his delicate body was reduced almost to a skeleton. The more he tormented his
    body the farther he was away from his goal. Having realized the futility of
    self-mortification, he finally decided to follow a different course, avoiding the extremes
    of self-mortification and self-indulgence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The new path which he discovered was the Middle Way. the
    Eightfold Path, which subsequently became one of the salient characteristics of his
    teachings. By following this Path his wisdom grew into its fullest power and he discovered
    the Four Great Truths, understood things as they truly are, and finally attained full
    enlightenment. As a man Prince Gotama, by his own will. effort, wisdom and love, attained
    Buddhahood that highest possible state of perfection - and he revealed to mankind the only
    straight path that leads thereto. A special characteristic of Buddhism is that anybody may
    aspire even to the state of the Buddha himself if he makes the necessary exertion. It is a
    sort of evolutionary process and it is achieved by one's own effort.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha laid stress on human dignity and taught the
    worth of the human being. He painted for us the perfect picture of a human being striving
    and struggling from life to life in the quest for moral perfection - <i><b>Bodhisatta</b></i>,
    man as Buddha in the making. As a Bodhisatta, through countless births he suffered all,
    sacrificed all and fulfilled every perfection, so that on some distant day he might
    achieve this unique goal, the goal of winning, not only for himself, but for all beings,
    deliverance from the heavy burdens of birth, old age, disease and death. The Buddha
    himself tells us of his origin, and how it started with an inflexible aspiring resolve. He
    tells us of the gradual perfection of the flux that made that aspiration and how, finally,
    he won full enlightenment. Instead of disheartening his followers and reserving that
    exalted state only to himself, the Buddha encourages and induces them to follow his noble
    example.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Is Buddhism a religion? It is not a religion in the sense
    in which the word is commonly understood, for it is not a system of faith and worship.
    Though we may 'take refuge in the Buddha', as runs the Buddhist phrase in the simple
    ceremony of pledging ourselves to live a religious life, it must not be with any blind
    faith that he can save us. Here mere belief is dethroned and replaced by confidence based
    on knowledge of the truth. A Buddhist who has confidence in the Buddha follows the
    Buddha's instructions to gain deliverance. Because we keep a statue of the Buddha to which
    we pay respect, we are not in any sense idol worshippers. The image is there to remind us
    of the perfect personality of the Master, who out of compassion for us left behind his
    teaching for our benefit. We do not seek our salvation from an image of the Buddha. How
    can a statue save us? 'Work out your salvation yourself; the Buddhas are only teachers',
    says the Buddha. Each one is his own refuge and none should expect to be saved by another.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha can point out the way, and tell us of its
    difficulties and of the beauties which we shall find as we tread the way, but he cannot
    tread it for us. We must tread it ourselves. In order to help us to tread the way to our
    goal. the Buddha has mapped out a practical method of life which has to be lived. It is
    only by living in accordance with the principles of the teaching that one can realize the
    true significance of it. The great ideal is <i><b>Nibbana</b></i>. the final release from
    suffering. This is a state to be attained by following the method of life which leads to
    self-enlightenment. The Buddha's way of life is the middle way which is neither optimistic
    nor pessimistic. Optimism tends to over-estimate the conditions of life, whereas pessimism
    tends to under-estimate them. The path is a middle way between the pairs of opposites. and
    the doctrine of the 'Way' may only be grasped by an understanding of the correlation and
    interdependence of the two. All extremes beget their opposites and both are alike
    unprofitable. For all people the middle way of a good life lived in the world is best and
    safest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism consists of three aspects; doctrinal, practical
    and mystical.( Realizable ). The doctrinal aspect is preserved in the Scriptures called <i>Three
    Pitakas</i> or baskets of the Canon which contain the words of the Buddha. It has been
    estimated by English translators of the Pitakas to be eleven times the size of the
    Christian Bible.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the teachings of the Buddha can be summed up in one
    verse:</font></p>
    <p align="center"><strong><em><font face="Times New Roman">To refrain from all evil,<br>
    To do what is good,<br>
    To purify the mind,<br>
    This is the teachings of the Buddhas.</font></em></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This verse embodies the three stages of the Grand Highway
    that leads to enlightenment: morality, concentration and wisdom. Morality regulates word
    and deed, concentration controls the mind, but it is wisdom, the final stage, that enables
    the spiritual man to annihilate completely, the passions which are ever creating a turmoil
    within him.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">THE POWER OF WISDOM</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wisdom is the power of seeing what things truly are and
    how to act rightly when the problems of life come before us. The seeds of wisdom have lain
    latent in us, and when our hearts are soft and warm with love they grow into their powers.
    When a man has stilled the raging torrents of greed, anger and delusion, he becomes
    conscientious, full of sympathy, and he is anxious for the welfare of all living beings.
    He abstains from stealing and is upright and honest in all his dealings. He abstains from
    sexual misconduct and is pure, chaste. He abstains from tale-bearing. What he has heard in
    one place he does not repeat in another so as to cause dissension. He unites those who are
    divided, and encourages those who are united. He abstains from harsh language. He speaks
    such words as are gentle. soothing to the ear and which go to the heart. He abstains from
    vain talk. He speaks what is useful at the right time according to the facts. It is when
    his mind is pure and his heart is soft by being equipped with this morality that the
    divine seed, wisdom, grows. Knowledge of the properties of the magnetic needle enables the
    mariner to see the right direction in the ocean in the darkest night when there are no
    stars visible. In the same way wisdom enables a man to see things as they truly are, and
    perceive the right way to peace. It is this wisdom which will enable us to unite with all
    beings in one immense ocean of tenderness and love.</font></p>

    SHORT HISTORY OF BUDDHISM</b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the spot where the Buddha passed away, innumerable
    princes, brahmans, traders and <i>suddas</i>, as well as <i>devas</i>, assembled to attend
    the funeral ceremony. There were also seven hundred thousand monks of whom <i><b>Maha
    Kassapa</b></i> was at that time the chief, and under whose direction the funeral
    obsequies over the body and sacred relics of the Buddha were performed. Having heard of
    the foolish remarks of the monk <i>Subhadda</i>, who declared that the Buddhas teachings
    as well as the rules and regulations for the Order of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis were to be
    observed only in the lifetime of the founder, the head<i> thera</i> had a great desire to
    perpetuate the doctrines of the supreme teacher. On the seventh day, therefore, after the
    Buddha had passed away, the head<i> thera </i>for the purpose of holding a convocation on
    religion arranged to convene five hundred principal <i>theras</i> who had overcome the
    dominion of the passions, were of great celebrity, perfect in every religious attribute,
    and who were versed in doctrinal knowledge. They then held a great council at <i>Rajagaha</i>
    under the patronage of <i>King Ajatasattu</i>, collecting the Buddhist canon and repeating
    it in chants. This convocation was terminated in seven months.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist canon consists of three aspects, the
    doctrinal (<i><b>pariyatti</b></i>), the practical (<i><b>patipatti</b></i>) and the
    realizable (<i><b>pativedha</b></i>), all of which are interdependent and interrelated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The doctrine is preserved in the <b><i>Tipitaka</i></b>.
    This Tipitaka, which contains the word of the Buddha is estimated to be about eleven times
    the size of the Christian bible. It comprises eighty-four thousand discourses, and
    Professor Rhys Davids estimated the total number of words of the whole text of the
    Tipitaka to be 1,752,800. As the word itself implies, the Tipitaka consists of three
    baskets, namely, the Basket of Discipline (<i>Vinaya Pitaka</i>), the Basket of Discourses
    (<i>Sutta Pitaka</i>) and the Basket of Ultimate Things (<i>Abhidhamma Pitaka</i>).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The<i><b> Vinaya Pitaka</b></i>, which is divided into
    five books, deals with the rules and regulations of the Order of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis,
    and gives a detailed account of the life and ministry of the Buddha. The <i><b>Sutta
    Pitaka,</b></i> divided into twenty-six books, consists of discourses preached by the
    Buddha and, in some cases, his chief disciples. It is rather like a book of prescriptions,
    for the sermons were propounded to suit the occasion and the temperament of individuals.
    The<i><b> Abhidhamma Pitaka</b></i> is the most important and the most interesting, as it
    elaborates the four ultimate things: consciousness (<i>citta</i>). mental properties
    (mental concomitants,<i>cetasika</i>). matter (material qualities,<i> rupa</i>) and <i>Nibbana</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The convocation which was held by the principal theras,
    having Maha Kassapa for their chief, is called <i>Theriya Safigiti.</i> During the first
    century after the death of the Buddha, there was only one schism among Buddhists, but at
    the end of that century during the reign of <i>King Kalasoka </i>a community of monks,
    resident in the city of <i>Vesali</i>. attempted to introduce ten new indulgences into the
    discipline of the Buddhist Order, pronouncing them to be allowable to the Order. To
    suppress this heresy twelve hundred thousand monks, whose leader was <i>Revata</i>,
    assembled in Vesali. Thereupon their senior, for the purpose of securing the permanency of
    the doctrines of the supreme teacher, selected seven hundred theras who were gifted with
    the quality of sanctity and were repositories of the doctrines contained in the three
    Pitakas. With Revata as their chief, and protected by King Kalasoka. all these theras held
    the<b> second convocation </b>of religion at Vesali. where the council was conducted in
    precisely the same manner as the previous one and brought to a close in eight months.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Towards the end of the second century after the death of
    the Buddha. however, the pupils of those sinful monks, who had been degraded by the theras
    who held the second convocation, originated the schism called the<i>Mahasangika</i> heresy
    which was gradually sub-divided into various sects. These persons set up a doctrine of
    their own, although professing it to be the doctrine of the Buddha, and if there was any
    religious performance they performed it according to their own wishes without reference to
    the Buddhistic rules. In consequence of numerical preponderance and the schisms of these
    monks, the good bhikkhus were incapable of regulating their conduct according to the rules
    of the original faith therefore the bhikkhus in all the Buddhist temples in India were
    incapable of observing the rites of sanctification (<i>uposatha</i>) for seven years, as
    none but good bhikkhus could be admitted to these rites.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha passed away in 543 B.C. 220 years after the
    Buddha's decease (323 B.C.), <i><b>Asoka</b></i>, the emperor of India, became the
    defender of the Buddhist faith and conferred the royal protection on the <i>Sangha</i>.
    causing all those heretical monks to be expelled from the Order. The whole of the monks
    thus degraded numbered sixty thousand, and the Order was then restored to unanimity of
    communion and upheld the rules of sanctification. For the purpose of holding a further
    convocation the chief monk at that time,<i><b>Tissa</b></i>, selected a thousand monks of
    sanctified character, perfect in religious knowledge and versed in the Tipitaka. Under the
    auspices of the Emperor Asoka they held the<b> third council </b>at <i>Patana </i>according
    to the methods used by Maha Kassapa and Revata, who led the first and second convocations
    respectively, and that council was brought to a close in nine months.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Emperor Asoka gave his beloved son, <i>Mahinda</i>,
    also his daughter.<i>Sanghamitta</i>, to the Order, and sent them to Ceylon to introduce
    the religion there. His monks taught it throughout the whole of India and carried it to
    fourteen Indian nations outside its boundaries, also to five Greek kings, his allies, with
    whom he made treaties to admit his religious preachers. The names of the five kings
    mentioned in the edicts of the Emperor Asoka, and inscribed by him on stone pillars, are <i>Antiochus
    of Syria</i>, <i>Ptolemy of Egypt</i>, <i>Antigonus of Macedon</i>, <i>Magas of Cyrene </i>and
    <i>Alexander of Epirus</i>. Five of Asoka's monks were sent to the five divisions of China
    in the third century B.C., from whence Buddhism reached Korea in 372 A.D. and Japan in 552
    A.D. In the fourth and fifth centuries A.D., it spread to Cochin China, Mongolia and other
    Asiatic countries, and from Kashmir it spread to Nepal and Tibet. <i>Sona</i> and <i>Uttara</i>,
    two of Asoka's monks, introduced Buddhism into Burma, and thence gradually it spread to
    Arakan and Cambodia. In the seventh century, A.D.638, it spread from Ceylon to Siam where
    it became the state religion, even as it still is today.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Towards the end of the first century of the Christian era,
    the Buddhists in India were divided into two schools, one of which taught that all the
    individual had to do was follow out the pure doctrine of the Buddha and seek Nibbana; this
    was named <i><b>Hinayana</b></i>, or <b>the Little Vehicle</b>. Ceylon. Burma. Siam,
    Cambodia and Laos are said to belong to this school. The other taught special doctrines
    about the Buddha and some new metaphysical theories; this was styled the <i><b>Mahayana</b></i>,
    or<b> the Great Vehicle</b>. However, the terms Hinayana and Mahayana are not mentioned in
    the texts, but they have become common among Western writers owing to their usage by
    Chinese pilgrims. One of the best known philosophers of the Mahayana school was<i>Nagarjuna</i>,
    who founded and expounded the<i>Madhyamika philosophy</i>. The end and aim of his
    philosophy was to bring about a compromise, as it were, between the Buddhists and the
    Brahmins, and to find a mid-point where the adherents of these two could meet and shake
    hands with one another. Since his time the Brahmins began to regard the Mahayana Buddhists
    as their brothers in religion, and the Mahayana school had the predominant voice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the closing years of the eleventh century, however,
    India was overrun by the Mohammedans who destroyed the Buddhist monasteries, appropriated
    the monastic lands for the use of soldiers, massacred monks by the thousand and burned
    libraries wherever found. Many monks fled across the borders into Tibet and other safe
    places of refuge, carrying their books with them, and so Hinayana was practically stamped
    out from India, while Mahayana lingered in nooks and corners for two more centuries before
    it was lost altogether.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>10. THE
    BASIC PHILOSOPHY OF BUDDHISM </b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is based upon the fact that ignorance is the
    cause of all worldly misery, and that only self-realization of the truth can combat this
    ignorance. The Buddha taught that out of ignorance is born evil and iniquity, and that if
    the human race could see clearly, everyone would do right. So right view is absolutely
    necessary for intelligent living and true spirituality.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Men in their blind ignorance produce the evil things
    (sins) and sorrows of the world, therefore the first of the four Noble Truths is the truth
    of suffering. We can see around us every day the result of people wanting things they
    cannot have, and the result of their trying to avoid the responsibilities which they
    should assume. We know that in the majority of cases man's wants and appetites are his
    undoing. and the Buddha taught that man's sense of possession is his greatest enemy,
    because the desire for accumulation steals from him his reason and his intelligence. We
    come, therefore, to the second of the four Noble Truths, namely, the cause of suffering.
    The great cause of misery is the desire to possess and the desire to preserve things
    possessed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To be attached to a thing is to be sad at the loss of it.
    To despise or hate a thing is to be unhappy at the approach of it. The Buddha taught that
    selfish desire for a worldly material object results in sacrificing spiritual treasure in
    order to secure the desired object which is probably of little value. Therefore selfish
    desire destroys the sense of value, for selfish desire places worldly possessions above
    wisdom, and personalities above principles.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third Noble Truth is freedom from suffering, which is
    attained by the annihilation of all selfish desire.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In line with this we see that attachment is the basis of
    the fear of death, and that when an individual is not attached to his possessions, their
    coming and going will leave him unmoved. While he is attached to them he will weep with
    their passing, and if he hates them he will weep at their approach. While his eyes are
    capable of tears he is incapable of wisdom. The middle way is the way of the Buddha, and
    in order to tread the middle way we must understand the Eightfold Path, i.e.. right view,
    right thought, right speech. right action, right livelihood, right effort. right mindful
    ness and right concentration: the fourth Noble Truth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a magnificent philosophy underlying all these
    things which is based upon the four ultimate things, namely, conscious ness, mental
    properties. matter and Nibbana. But Buddhism is not a subject to be studied only from an
    historical and literary point of view; on the contrary, it is to be learned and put into
    practice in the course of one's daily life, for without actual practice one cannot
    appreciate the truth. Buddhism should be studied, also practised, but above all the
    Buddha's Teaching should be realized. Self-realization is the ultimate goal, and never
    have we needed the Buddha's Teaching more than now. It is the way which shows that
    happiness comes only with wisdom, which alone is the result of right living, and that
    only.</font></p>
