    BUDDHISM IN BURMA</b></strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhist Burma the Burmese, who have
    inherited such a sublime ethical code of compassion and altruism, used to be remarkable
    for an acute sense of humanity, and therefore they were well known to Westerners as one of
    the happiest people in the world.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">We often hear, however, the complaint that
    some of them have changed their attitude towards their religion, Buddhism. which has been
    a great source of their happiness, peace and culture, In Buddhist Burma there are certain
    sore spots of which the following appear to be the most significant: (1) Lack of metta
    (loving kindness), (2) neglect of religious principles and (3) change from the spirit of
    compassion and tenderness, which Buddhism teaches. to that of harshness and selfishness.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In the world as a whole there is enough
    money and material, and no lack of intellect. But what is it that is lacking? The will to
    do good, metta, is not strong enough to prevail against the powers of darkness, the world
    is disturbed and men distrust each other. What can we do to help? To increase metta in the
    world is the worlds supreme need. The lack of metta is the major cause of war. Apart from
    military conflicts there are many other conflicts, racial, political, economic and even
    religious conflicts. The chief cause of nearly all these conflicts is the lack of metta.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Since the end of the first Great War there
    have been many organizations termed international; many authors have written on this
    subject of internationalism. Idealistic workers who dream and hope for a better future
    have started many international movements. We had the League of Nations founded in 1920.
    but they failed to maintain peace. Why? Because most of them have dealt with mere external
    and material adjustments. too much attention has been paid to the material and too little
    to the spiritual side of life. Materialism alone cannot give happiness and peace - which
    we all desire. It is not materialistic ideology but the Buddhist way of life that is
    suitable for Burma which is still looked up to by the entire Buddhist world as the home of
    pure Buddhism. What is needed most in Burma is the practice of the noble principles of
    Buddhism which teaches the upholding of the laws of morality, fair dealing, honour, truth,
    right and refinement.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Neglect of religious principles is one of
    the fundamental causes of war. One of the most important ethical teachings of the Buddha
    is 'non-killing' or non-violence'.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Aggressiveness, urge to destroy or kill is
    a natural instinct common to both animal and man, but there is a great difference in the
    way in which instincts function in men and animals. In the case of animals and primitive
    men the impulse of violence is no doubt a protective and preservative device both for the
    individual and for the species. Animal needs are only those which are essential for
    self-preservation. they are nor to blame for their acts, for they are regulated by nature.
    But in the case of man it is quite different, he has a larger number of instinctive urges
    than animals hate. Man by virtue of his possessing higher capacities of memory,
    imagination, thought, reasoning, self-respect, moral conscience and religious faith,
    should think of the consequences, immediate as well as remote, of his actions before he
    performs them, that he may know beforehand how far they are conducive to his personal.
    social and spiritual security and welfare. His higher and more lasting interests should
    not be sacrificed on the altar of the momentary gratification of selfish desires.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Man, and not the animal, has often to
    choose between cruelty and sympathy, which cannot be both exercised at the same time with
    regard to the same object. Which one shall he choose? It is not difficult to decide that
    even from the point of view of one's own personal health and happiness, one should follow
    the path of love and sympathy rather than that of cruelty and violence. For he is more of
    a human being while walking along the former path than while going along the latter.
    Moreover, no man, party, community or race can be sure of being equally strong and
    powerful at all times to live successfully by violence. In order, therefore, to be on the
    safe side and to safeguard against becoming a future object of wrath of a forthcoming
    stronger man, party. community or race. he or it should keep his or its violent tendency
    under control, and set a right and desirable example for the future behaviour of mankind.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">It is a truism that he who lives by the
    sword perishes by the sword. A cruel man, party, community or race is bound to be treated
    cruelly when he or it becomes weak in course of time and others come into power. It is
    also true that cruel persons live a miserable life and die a miserable death. A tyrant
    lives a life of perpetual danger. Aggressive individuals and communities live in perpetual
    fear of other individuals and communities. The gains and victories of violence, although
    quickly achieved, are short-lived and are maintained at a heavy cost, therefore, even from
    a purely selfish point of view, the path of violence is not secure and desirable.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Human society flourishes better when it is
    based on love, sympathy and co-operation than when based on acts of violence which the
    Buddha asked us to avoid. Acts of violence are diseases of humanity. Cruel and selfish
    individuals or communities who trample over and crush the natural rights of others, are
    like poisonous germs or diseases in the body. A healthy and happy social life demands that
    all its members should live with others amicably and should help and protect each other.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">in the ideal society, the key-note of the
    stronger members is loving care and renunciation for the weaker ones, and that of the
    weaker ones is love and co-operation. In this age. when scientific discoveries and
    inventions have greatly increased the powers of man to do both good and evil, there is a
    great need for organizing education that is based on rational, just and moral principles
    for developing a keen social and humanitarian consciousness in every child so that the
    inhuman, barbarous and violent activities of men threatening the very destruction of
    humanity itself may not recur. Nobody likes to be harmed, injured or killed by another. if
    somebody does so. he violates the basic social principle. He is antisocial, and therefore
    a criminal.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Social solidarity and material gains are
    not the only objects of human life, the material and spiritual sides of life are
    interdependent and interrelated, so the importance of both must be realized. Material life
    is lived not only by human beings but also by animals. Men by virtue of possessing higher
    capacities should live a higher and nobler life in which peace and goodwill rather than
    struggle and destruction prevail. As a moral being guided by moral</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">conscience, man should rise much above an
    animal. He should become a being of a higher world in which higher values are preferred to
    mere material life and material gain, in which every human being is regarded as an equal
    and never as inferior to another, and in which truth, justice. honesty. fellowship and
    freedom are the intuitively accepted principles of action.</font></p>

    B.B.C. EUROPEAN SERVICE GENERAL NEWS TALK, <br>
    ECUMENICAL DEVELOPMENTS: DIALOGUE</b></strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The word 'dialogue', used in connection
    with the ecumenical movement, means conversation or discussion between separated Christian
    churches in order to pave the way for greater harmony between them. According to his first
    great letter or encyclical. however, addressed to the bishops. clergy, people of the
    Catholic Church and 'to all men of goodwill'. the present Pope has considered it on a
    wider scale than the ecumenical dialogue between Christians. I therefore would like to
    take the opportunity to contribute to a series of talks on the general theme of the
    ecumenical movement from a Buddhist point of view.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The teaching founded by the Buddha is
    known as Buddhism. All the teachings of the Buddha can be summed up in one verse:</font></p>
    <p align="center"><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>'To refrain from all evil,<br>
    To do what is good,<br>
    To purify the mind,<br>
    This is the teaching of the Buddhas.'</b> </font></em></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The evil thoughts are to be eliminated and
    the virtuous thoughts to be increased. Mere ceasing from evil is not enough. a noble
    effort is needed to replace evil by good. All this constitutes self culture, and in the
    course of this culture the individual, through his kind thoughts, words and deeds, helps
    all his neighbours and makes them happy.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus Buddhism is not individualistic, it
    is not a negative treatment. it is indeed a positive philosophy in which an ethical and
    moral code is enunciated to a great degree. In fact Buddhism is largely devoted to
    ethico-moral discipline, and through that discipline one can attain deliverance. As such
    it can be supplementary to any religion, and in fact it did act as a supplement to other
    religions. In China and Japan, for example, Buddhism supplemented the local religions; it
    did not expel local faiths, it merely stimulated people to moral awakening, ethical
    excellence and philosophical understanding. In this way Buddhism may be said to be a
    moralizing agent and a civilizing force.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism being an ethico-moral discipline
    should have no quarrel with any other religion, no religion worth the name should oppose
    ethico-moral discipline which is a synonym of Buddhism. It is on this basis that Buddhists
    will be willing to enter into genuine dialogue with the members of all other religions, in
    fact the Buddhists of Thailand have already taken the first step towards it.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">An inter-religious conference was held in
    Bangkok under the auspices of the Ministry of Religious Affairs of Thailand on the 26th
    October 1964. The conference was officially opened by the Prime Minister of Thailand, who
    said that the circumstances of the world at present were such that no religion could
    isolate itself from another. It is therefore of great importance that all religious
    people, no matter to what faith they belong, should come and work together for the
    security and development of both their religions and their countries. He was convinced of
    the fact that there is nothing to fear from sincere people of any faith, who are no threat
    to anybody or anything. What is to be feared, he said, is the kind of people who have
    intrinsically no religious principle in mind. The Prime Minister requested the
    co-operation of all religious people, asking them to safeguard their religious members and
    the people against dangerous political ideologies that seek to destroy all religions.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The religions whose ministers were present
    at the conference were Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism. Sikhism and Brahmanism.
    The Director of Religious Affairs there, said that the purpose of the conference was to
    promote co-operation among the various religions, to promote unity among all people with
    faith in religion, to build moral strength and to exchange views and opinions on religious
    matters. The theme of the conference was 'Religion in the Light of Life', in which the
    representatives of all the religions took part and freely expressed their views and
    opinions. The conference was such a great success that the Director-General hoped to be
    able to arrange a second of its kind on a greater scale, if possible international,
    sometime in 1965.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">To have proper moral discipline, to
    promote co-operation and unity among men. Buddhism emphasizes the importance of metta,
    universal and all-embracing love. Metta means much more than brotherly feeling or
    kindheartedness. though these are part of it; it is active benevolence, a love which is
    expressed and fulfilled in active ministry for the uplifting of fellow beings. The Buddha
    said. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>'As a mother even at the risk of her own life loves
      and protects her child, her only child, so let man cultivate all-embracing love without
      measure towards all beings'. </b></font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">This is the model of what man should be to
    man.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Metta goes hand in hand with helpfulness
    and willingness to forego self-interest in order to promote the welfare and happiness of
    mankind. It is metta which in Buddhism is the basis for social progress. It is this metta
    that attempts to break all the barriers which separate one from another. There is no
    reason to keep aloof from others merely because they belong to another religion; any
    religion worth the name is not confined to any one country or any one particular nation.
    it is universal. Religion is an education of the heart, with a view to refining our nature
    and elevating us in the scale of human beings. Religion is not merely theory, but
    practice. and the heart, like the body, becomes healthy and strong by practical exercise.
    No doctrine merely held in the mind as an intellectual belief has any driving force. no
    doctrine is of any value unless and until it is applied.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said,</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>'A beautiful thought or word which is not followed
      by a corresponding action, is like a bright flower that has no scent, that will bear no
      fruit'.</b></font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Practice of the moral life is the very
    core and essence of religion. It is action and not speculation. it is practice and not
    theory that counts in life. The will to do, followed by the doing. is the actual virtue,
    the will does not count much unless it is fulfilled. To put one's high ideas and concepts
    into practice is religion in the best sense.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The world has found itself as one body;
    yet the fact of physical unity and economic interdependence, though of very great value.
    is not by itself sufficient to create a united family, for this we require a human
    consciousness of community, a sense of personal interrelationship among men. Science
    proves that the fundamental structure of the human mind is uniform in all races; what
    differences there are, are due to historical circumstances and stages of development.
    Without recognition of the oneness of the world of today in all its aspects. spiritual as
    well as social, there will never be harmony among religions.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In order to pave the way for harmony among
    religions, we must realize the oneness of the world and understand that we are one family.
    Life is a mighty wheel of perpetual motion. This great wheel contains within it numberless
    small wheels, corresponding to the lives of individual men, each of which has a pattern of
    its own. The great wheel and the smaller wheels, the whole world and individual men, are
    intimately and indissolubly linked; the whole human family is so closely knit together
    that every unit is dependent upon all others for its growth and development.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">To bring Out the goodness in us, each one
    of us has to try to reproduce in his own wheel of life that pattern which is in harmony
    with the pattern of the great universal wheel. For all the wheels to revolve in harmony
    the highest good in each must be developed; this is possible by the performance of daily
    duties with kindness, courtesy and truthfulness. The ideal that is placed before us is
    that of mutual service and practical brotherhood. In all our thoughts, our emotions, our
    words and our deeds, we act and react upon one another; in a very real sense each one of
    us is responsible for the whole community. Men, being in need of each other, should learn
    to love one another, bearing one another's burdens: mutual service is a perpetual call
    upon humanity, for we are bound alike by the bonds of humanity.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Wherever there is a good man, a truly
    upright and noble man, pure in his motives and compassionate in his heart, whatever his
    faith may be, that man is one whom the Buddhist will revere. At the time of death,
    whatever may have been his creed. the Buddhist knows that he will receive the just result
    of his actions in the new birth: not according to his faith or any religious ceremonies he
    may have performed, but on the merits of thought, word and deed, the good he did to those
    around him, the integrity with which he acted and reacted. He may have been a Christian,
    Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, theist or atheist, it makes no difference.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In the universal Law of Cause and Effect,
    that man's actions will produce good in the world to himself as well as to others, and in
    time he also will attain the goal of deliverance - may in fact be nearer to it than many
    who are mere professed Buddhists. It is on this basis also that the Teaching of the Buddha
    embraces the members of all other faiths, and the followers of the Buddha are able to
    extend the hand of brotherhood to all humanity.</font></p>

    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>13. A
    BUDDHIST VIEW OF WORLD PEACE</b></strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In the world as a whole there is enough
    money and material and there is no lack of intellect, yet something is missing. What is
    it? The answer is the spirit of fellowship, and it is this lack of active fellowship which
    is the major cause of war. Apart from military conflicts, there are of course many other
    kinds of conflict such as racial, political, economic, even religious conflicts, and the
    cause of nearly all of them is the lack of the spirit of fellowship.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In a conflict each side has its own
    conceit. but to hide it both parties have their own nicely written labels such as, 'New
    World Order', 'Civilizing the Backward Peoples', 'Co-prosperity in East Asia'. etc.. and
    in almost every conflict each side blames the other, both parties claiming that they are
    right. They even use the name of religion to justify their actions, and will try to
    persuade God to take their side, although without seeming to make any attempt to be on
    God's side. They claim that there is only one God. apparently forgetting that if there is
    only one God, there must be only one family of men, and they treat one another not just as
    strangers but as enemies. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Since the end of the first world war there
    have been many organizations called 'international'. Many authors have written on the
    subject of internationalism, and idealistic workers hoping for a better future have
    started many international movements, but all without exception have failed to maintain
    peace. Why? In the first place they have not, for one reason or another, been able to
    carry out their plans: secondly. they received insufficient support from the public; and
    thirdly, most of them have dealt only with the purely external, material adjustments,
    paying too much attention to the material side of life and too little to the spiritual
    side. The two sides are interdependent and interrelated, and the importance of both should
    be recognized.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Then came the second world war,
    unparalleled in history for destruction. The world is still in a state of chaos, devoid of
    peace and real happiness, and once again idealistic workers, lecturers and writers are
    producing books and introducing new international organizations. Will they be successful
    in maintaining peace? It is possible to predict whether they will be successful or not;
    they will be successful if the leaders and workers can carry through their plans in a
    spirit of world fellowship, otherwise they will never be successful, there will be further
    wars, even more dreadful than the last. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The peace which we all desire, peace in
    our hearts and in our minds, peace between neighbours and among nations, is not a miracle
    which it is God's task to perform. it can only come about as a result of a reconstruction
    of thought. feeling and action by means of the spirit of fellowship, and such is the duty
    of all mankind.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Taking all nations as one whole there is
    in the world sufficient wealth and ability to abolish poverty, unemployment, hardship and
    cruelty of any kind from all countries. It is possible for all men to be able to do what
    work is necessary, if only they would learn to understand each other better by drawing
    closer. The discovery of power and energy could be of great service to humanity, and men
    could be inspired to noble conduct if only all the scientists, poets and artists of all
    countries would come together. A powerful spiritual influence, helping all men to make the
    world a happier place. could be given by every religion if all of them were to act
    together as members of one family.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism teaches that misery and suffering
    are not the result of the wrath of a god, or gods, but are the direct consequences of
    man's ignorance of his own nature and of his surroundings. in attempting to discover a way
    of appeal on which to base morality. Buddhism teaches that there is no such appeal to any
    external authority in the form of a deity, but only to the natural desire of the human
    heart. Therefore. knowing that certain actions such as selfishness, violence and laziness
    tend to disorganize society, and to cause unhappiness to its members, a man will try to
    avoid injuring others if he sees clearly that his interests are bound up with those of
    others.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The real spirit of fellowship which is
    lacking in the world today can be promoted only through religion. Religion is an education
    of the heart with a view to refining our nature and elevating us in the scale of human
    beings; it is not merely theory but practice, and the heart, like the body, becomes
    healthy and strong by practical exercise. No doctrine merely held in the mind as an

    ideas and concepts into practice is religion in the best sense. Religion is obviously not
    confined to any one country or to any' particular nation or race. it is universal; and it
    is certainly not nationalism which, in other words, is merely another form of caste system
    but founded on a wider basis,</font></p>

    yet the fact of physical unity and economic interdependence, though of very great value,

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">We are living today in a world torn
    between despair and hope. Our despair is due to many causes, the most serious of which is
    the constant fear of war; for although humanity wills peace, and the desire for peace
    exists everywhere throughout the world, instead of trying to give effect to that almost
    universal desire for peace each country has been arming to the limits of its capacity.
    Already more than half the national incomes of the world are being used for the
    preparation of war, and the maximum of our energy. ingenuity, finance and organization is
    being turned in the direction of discovering how we can kill our fellow beings more
    ruthlessly. To strengthen our military' power is not to guard the blessings of peace, but
    to run in the armaments race which must inevitably end in war. Many of us still remember
    the first great European war, and only recently country after country has been the victim
    of cruel, barbarous and unjustifiable tyranny. What will be the future of humanity if the
    present tendency of each country is continued?</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Nevertheless we are not without hope, for
    there are at the same time idealistic writers, lecturers and those who work for the
    general good of mankind and who dream and hope for a better future, and many present day'
    publications bear the term 'inter national'. The World Congress of Faiths I regard as an
    important movement, because it deals not just with mere external adjustments in material
    needs, but with the fundamental spiritual realities of life. It is the aim of this
    congress to promote world fellowship through religion, and it is now my present task to
    show how Buddhism can help in achieving this aim.</font></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>What are bad roots?</b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Greed (lobha) is a bad root; hatred (dosa)
    is a bad root; ignorance (moha) is a bad root; therefore the above ten kinds of bad
    actions are due to greed, hatred or ignorance. These three roots are like three great
    currents of force, for they' are sweeping each one of us down along the road to misery,
    just as the swift current of a river will carry with it all the logs which have fallen
    into it.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>GREED</b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The first mentioned root, that of greed.
    is desire; desire for sensual pleasures, wealth, rank. etc. This greed is in all of us
    like a raging thirst. The greedy man always says, 'I want', I must have', I cannot do
    without'. He may well be heard to say that if he were as rich as some neighbour whom he
    envies, he would be perfectly satisfied; but give him the particular amount of wealth he
    has set his mind upon, and he will find some still richer man to envy', and be as
    discontented as ever. A certain Persian poet has written, 'A small coin of silver makes a
    beggar contented; Faridun, with his kingdom of Persia. is only half satisfied'.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Our tendency to remain discontented in
    spite of success and prosperity is due to the insatiable nature of our desires; and we are
    depressed by the fear of losing our possessions. at the same time being dissatisfied so
    long as there is someone in the world richer than ourselves. What is beyond our reach
    seems valuable until we obtain it, but when possessed it loses its value. This,
    unfortunately, is the character of most men, greed making us selfish so that we think only
    of our own need for gratification. The selfish man aims at obtaining as much happiness as
    he can for himself, and does not care whether other people are happy or miserable. In
    order to acquire his object he tries to appropriate as large a share as possible of the
    good things of the world, and whenever he has an opportunity of doing so he enjoys
    himself. even when his enjoyment is obtained at the expense of his fellow men. All over
    the world we find the selfish taking an unfair share of everything and trying their best
    to use others as a means of attaining their pleasure.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Greed is like a thick fog such as there is
    in London sometimes, when we cannot see our way clearly before us; or sometimes at sea on
    a foggy day when people cannot see what lies ahead and two ships may collide, perhaps both
    sinking. Men, when blinded by desire, are carried away by a powerful current, not
    realizing whether they' are going, and where there are many who are blinded by desire for
    the same things, there is jealousy and rivalry. As they act to satisfy their desires, so
    they hurt and harm one another with resultant suffering.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>HATRED</b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The second current which equally leads us
    to misery is hatred. ill will or anger. It is that tendency within us which resents an
    action of another which challenges our right to what we desire. Our general tendency' is
    to try' and dominate others, and we want others to obey' our will while suppressing their
    own; so when someone opposes his will against our's our action is like that of a dog with
    a bone when another dog approaches. We are irritated in many ways, and although our
    irritation may at first be slight, if it is allowed to go on day by day it grows into a
    deep hatred. When a man is angry he is beside himself, as the saying goes, being swept
    along by a torrent of hatred, and it is due to this anger that disputes arise between one
    individual and another, between one nation and another. Such people as are blinded by
    anger cannot see that hatred ceaseth not by hatred, but by love; they regard war as the
    only ultimate way of settling national disputes, and the armies of great nations are
    larger than they were ever before in the history of the world, yet there seems little
    prospect of the establishment of the reign of universal peace. Although the principle that
    might is right no longer prevails in the relations between individuals, it is still
    considered natural to appeal to it when one nation quarrels with another; and although war
    remains as the greatest relic of barbarism in the midst of modern civilization, the
    'progress' of science is every year leading to the discovery of more and more powerful
    instruments for the destruction of human life and property'</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In many countries of the present day
    conscription prevails, and the younger members of every family are compelled by law to
    serve a term in the army. Under such circumstances war spreads far wider desolation than
    when it is waged between a limited number of men who have voluntarily adopted the
    profession of army life, as a consequence of which a countless number of families in every
    war are reduced to destitution by the destruction of their property', or by the loss of
    those on whom they depended for support. All this is the result of hatred.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>IGNORANCE</b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The third current which carries us to
    misery is ignorance, delusion. The state of greed as well as that of hatred is always
    accompanied by ignorance. because ignorance is the primary root of all evil. It is far
    more subtle than greed and hatred, and when a man is hypnotized by it he cannot
    distinguish between right and wrong. he can see no good in any noble action; nothing is
    safe from his scoffing and sneers. neither a sense of duty'. nor filial love, nor
    sacrifice in any' form can win a word of praise from his lips. On the contrary, he wants
    to be praised. and he is hurt if he is not properly appreciated. for he thinks much of
    himself and continually plans to feed his ambitions for personal happiness. The spirit of
    loving-kindness and charity is absent from him, he is deaf to all prayers and appeals for
    mercy, he has no sense of duty towards his fellow men. If he helps others he does so in
    order that he may get them into his power and thereby increase his gains, for under the
    influence of delusion he is determined to have what he wants, no matter who suffers, and
    he dislikes all those who hinder him or get ahead of him. He may occasionally gain
    advantages from those who cannot avoid coming into contact with him and who fear to
    provoke his resentment, but such advantages are conferred without goodwill, and those who
    can do so will be inclined to avoid his society. When perhaps the majority' of men turn
    against him. and the world does not want him any longer, he then blames them, saying.
    'What I have done is perfectly right, but people are too ignorant to realize it or too
    wicked to agree to it'. he does not know that it is the poison in himself which has upset
    the world.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">An old story may serve as an illustration
    in connection with ignorance which arouses hatred. Once a big bear with her three little
    cubs was looking for something to eat in the jungle when they saw a beehive in a trough
    under a tree, from one branch of which a big log was hanging just over the trough. The
    bears wanted to get at the honey, but as the log was in the way the mother bear pushed it
    away so that they could all get at it, and they began to eat. Suddenly the log swung out
    and came back, hitting the mother bear on the head. Growing very angry' she knocked it
    away violently so that it went out much further than before, and causing it to come back
    with such force that it struck one of the little cubs, killing it. The mother, now
    furious, struck at the log with all her might, and swinging out it came back with a great
    rush striking her again on the head and killing her.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Who killed the bear? Strictly speaking it
    was her ignorance. her delusion which made her think that the log was her enemy. Through
    her ignorance hatred arose to make her fight against the log which had hit her, although
    the log could not hurt her unless she set it in motion, but the poor old bear did not know
    that. When a man is carried away by the current of ignorance he becomes brutal and
    barbarous, any sense of a common humanity fades from his mind.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">It is due to these raging torrents of
    greed, hatred and ignorance that nations fight with nations, kings fight with kings.
    priests with priests; the mother quarrels with the son, the son with the mother, the
    father with the son, the son with the father; brother quarrels with brother, brother with
    sister, friend with friends. We talk about peace, yet we create confusion; we long for
    happiness, yet we obtain unhappiness, why? Because we are like logs carried helplessly
    along by the currents of greed. hatred and ignorance. If we are to revive the sense of a
    common humanity and find happiness, we must step outside these torrents. How may this be
    achieved? The Buddhist technique is to still the raging torrents of greed, hatred and
    ignorance by a careful self-culture; 'Save thyself by thyself are the words of the Buddha.
    and he laid down a specific course of practice in mental and physical actions for the
    successful outcome of this self-culture.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">To plan our good actions we should first
    understand what is meant by good and good roots.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">What, now, is that which is good?</font></p>

      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>What are good roots?</b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Absence of greed, unselfishness, is a good
    root; absence of hatred, love, is a good root absence of ignorance, wisdom, is a good
    root. These three roots are also called the seeds of nobility, seeds within each one of us
    that with careful, determined cultivation will grow into sublime powers. These powers lie
    latent in us, but they cannot grow until we discover them and make our hearts soft and
    warm with love so that they may grow to fulfillment. </font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">ABSENCE OF GREED <i>(Unselfishness)</i></font></strong></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">For this we must forget ourselves and
    substitute the world for ourselves. There is no evil in wanting universal happiness and
    peace, the evil arises when our desires are only for ourselves and not for others, or not
    in the sacred interests of truth. When we desire such things as we can share with others,
    our desires become wiser and more unselfish. The cultivation of unselfishness includes not
    only a feeling in the heart, although that internal feeling is essential, but also the
    performance of those outward actions by which that feeling is manifested: and it also
    includes the desire to put others perfectly at their ease, to save them from every kind of
    discomfort and to do all that we can to promote their happiness. The unselfish man puts
    himself in the position of others and tries to identify himself with all, regretting what
    he has done wrongly or has omitted to do, having an earnest desire to do better in the
    future and make amends for the wrong that has been done. He desires not to make himself a
    burden on his fellow men, but to be a blessing to them by making them happy, so that his
    unselfish disposition promotes social intercourse and adds to the pleasure of others. He
    appreciates benefits conferred on him and feels joy at the kindness of his benefactor to
    whom he has a great desire to return those benefits, or to give something more when
    possible. By being unselfish we develop in ourselves the sense of sympathy, and we cannot
    enjoy happiness worthy of the name without being in sympathy with our fellow men. Our
    happiness soon pails upon us if we have no congenial companions for whom we can feel an
    affection, for in every case our happiness is rendered more intense and more permanent by
    being shared with friends. The best way to be happy, therefore, is to make others happy;
    every kind act is twice blessed. blessing him who gives and him who takes. If we are to
    promote the spirit of fellowship we should forget our '1' in the service of all, we should
    do everything we can for the sake of others. In short, whatever deed we do, whatever word
    we utter and whatever thought we think, should be for the good, peace and happiness not
    only of ourselves, but others. The result of this is peace, happiness and friendship.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">ABSENCE OF HATRED <i>(Love)</i></font></strong></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">To promote the spirit of world fellowship
    we must make the sublime seeds, the seeds of loving-kindness, grow in our hearts and minds
    till we are all love. To love one another we should realize that we are all brothers, and
    brotherhood must be applied with justice, for justice is a natural law. No judge has the
    right to use his power over a criminal to a greater extent than that permitted by the law
    of the court, which should be the representative of the natural law of justice.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">If we do any harm to someone we shall be
    paid back in the same coin; rather as when we throw a stone into a pond, causing ripples
    to spread out over the surface until coming up against the edge of the banks. The water
    then moves back again until reaching the stone that has disturbed it. In just the same way
    the effects of our actions come back to us, and if our actions are good we shall have good
    effects, while bad actions will likewise produce bad effects. To produce good actions love
    is essential, so we must love everyone, no matter what may be the colour of his skin,
    whether he is rich or poor, wise or foolish, good or bad; and we should love not only
    human beings but all beings in the world.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Metta Sutta, the discourse on
    loving-kindness, the Buddha says, 'As a mother, even at the risk of her own life, protects
    her child, her only child, so let a man cultivate goodwill without measure among all
    beings. Let him cultivate goodwill without measure towards the whole world, above, below,
    all around, unstinted, unmixed with any feeling of differing or opposing interests. Let
    him remain steadfastly in this state of mind all the while he is awake, whether he be
    standing. walking, sitting or lying down. This state of heart is the best in the world.'</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Most of us have not yet learned this
    lesson, and therefore the sense of a common humanity is absent from our minds, the world
    is full of pain and cruelty and all wild animals flee from us. There are a few who have
    learned this lesson, they love everybody and everything, no wild animal flees from them
    and even a tiger will roll at their feet as a pet cat does at our's. Why do our pet
    animals love us? Because we love them. If we learn this lesson our enemies will become our
    friends and wild animals our pets.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>WISDOM</b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Wisdom is the power of seeing things as
    they truly are, and how to act rightly when the problems of life come before us. The seeds
    of wisdom lie latent in us, and when our hearts are soft and warm with love they grow into
    their powers.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">When a man has stilled the raging torrents
    of greed, hatred and ignorance, he becomes conscientious, full of sympathy, and he is
    anxious for the welfare of all living beings. Thus he abstains from stealing, and is
    upright and honest in all his dealings; he abstains from sexual misconduct and is pure,
    chaste; he abstains from tale- bearing. What he has heard in one place he does not repeat
    in another so as to cause dissension; he unites those who are divided and encourages those
    who are united. He abstains from harsh language, speaking such words as are gentle,
    soothing to the ear and which go to the heart. He abstains from vain talk, speaking what
    is useful at the right time and according to the facts. It is when his mind is pure and
    his heart is soft by being equipped with this morality and mental development that the
    sublime seed, wisdom, grows. Knowledge of the properties of the magnetic needle enable the
    mariner to see the right direction in mid-ocean on the darkest night when no stars are
    visible. In just the same way wisdom enables a man to see things as they truly are, and to
    perceive the right way to real peace and happiness, Nibbana.</font></p>

    PARAMI: PERFECTIONS</b></strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">A Bodhisatta is a Buddha in the making,
    and is thus a being practising over an incalculable period of world cycles to attain to
    the highest level in ethical, intellectual and spiritual achievement. As a Bodhisatta, in
    each succeeding birth he practises the ten perfections (ten <i>parami</i>), a prerequisite
    for Buddhahood.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">One need not think that the Bodhisatta
    ideal is reserved only for supermen; what has been accomplished by one could also be
    accomplished by another. given the necessary effort and enthusiasm. We should endeavour to
    work disinterestedly for the good of ourselves and others, having for our object in life
    the noble ideal of service and perfection.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <b>ten perfections</b> are:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Generosity, giving (<i>dana</i>)<br>
      2. Morality (<i>sila</i>)<br>
      3. Renunciation (<i>nekkhamma</i>)<br>
      4. Wisdom (<i>panna</i>)<br>

      7. Truthfulness (<i>sacca</i>)<br>
      8. Determination (<i>adhitthana</i>)<br>
      9. Loving-kindness (<i>metta</i>)<br>
      10. Equanimity (<i>upekkha</i>)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">1. <i>DANA</i></font></strong></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Generosity, giving, is the first parami.
    It confers upon the giver the double blessing of inhibiting the immoral thoughts of
    selfish ness on the one hand, and of developing the pure thoughts of selflessness on the
    other hand.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The object in giving is to eliminate the
    craving that lies dormant within oneself; apart from which there are the attendant
    blessings of generosity such as the joy of service, the ensuing happiness and consolation
    and the alleviation of suffering.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">He makes no distinction in extending his
    love with supreme generosity, at the same time not forgetting to use his judicious
    discrimination in doing so. If, for instance, a drunkard were to seek his help, but he was
    convinced that the drunkard would misuse his gift, the Bodhisatta would not hesitate to
    refuse him, for such generosity would not constitute parami.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">If, however, someone should seek his help
    for a worthy purpose. he would express his deep obligation for the opportunity offered,
    and willingly and humbly render him every possible aid. free of the smallest trace of any
    forced air of dignity or without making any false pretexts.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">A Bodhisatta is always ready to oblige
    others, but he will never stoop to beg a favour for himself. in abundance he gives.
    irrespective of caste, creed or colour, but selfishly he seeks nothing, for he is neither
    selfish nor self-possessive. He exercises this virtue of dana to such an extent that he is
    prepared to give away not only his wealth and other cherished possessions, but also his
    kingdom, his wife and children, even his limbs. He is ever ready to sacrifice his own life
    wherever such sacrifice will benefit humanity.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">2. <i>SILA</i></font></strong></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The second parami is morality, the purity
    of his conduct. If he be living the life of a recluse, he would try his best to observe
    the sila that pertains thereto; if, however, he leads the household life he would adhere
    to the five elementary principles of regulated behaviour, even in spite of his interests
    being at stake.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">He would not kill, steal, lie or slander,
    and he would avoid unchastity, harsh speech. frivolous talk and intoxicants. He would
    endeavour to observe these elementary principles as strictly as possible, for to
    transgress one of them means creating fresh troubles and obstacles on the road to
    enlightenment. However, it must not be understood that a Bodhisatta is wholly infallible
    and totally free from evil. (see Jataka No. 318). for one who had already attained
    complete perfection would have reached Buddha- hood.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">3. <i>NEKKHAMA</i></font></strong></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The third parami is renunciation. It
    implies both renunciation of worldly life and pleasures by adopting the ascetic life, and
    practising the cultivation of jhana whereby the temporary inhibition of the hindrances
    towards progress. (wish for sense pleasure, ill will, sloth/torpor, distraction/remorse,
    doubt) is achieved. Though he may sit in the lap of luxury. immersed in worldly pleasure,
    the idea comes to him that household life is like a den of strife, but by comparison the
    homeless life is like the ever free and open sky. Realizing thus the vanity of worldly
    life he voluntarily forsakes his earthly possessions, and wearing the simple ascetic dress
    he tries to lead the holy life in all its purity. Here he practises morality to such a
    high degree that he becomes practically selfless in all his actions; neither fame nor
    wealth, honour nor worldly gain being capable of inducing him to do anything contrary to
    his lofty principles. Sometimes the mere appearance of a grey hair (see Jataka No. 9) is
    sufficient to compel a Bodhisatta to leave his uncongenial atmosphere in order to lead the
    independent, solitary life of a hermit, but the practice of renunciation is not as a rule
    observed by a Bodhisatta. In the <i>Kusa</i> Jataka (No. 531) for instance, the Bodhisatta
    was subject to much humiliation owing to his unrestrained desire to win the love of the
    beautiful princess, <i>Pabhavati</i>.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>4. <i>PANNA</i></b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth parami is wisdom. It means
    right understanding of the real nature of the world, seeing things as they are in reality.
    The Bodhisatta strives to acquire knowledge from every possible source, although never at
    any time does he show any desire to display his knowledge, nor is he ever ashamed to plead
    his ignorance. What he knows is always at the disposal of others, and that he imparts to
    them unreservedly.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>5. <i>VIRIYA</i></b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The fifth parami is energy. It does not
    mean only physical strength as is ordinarily understood, but mental vigour or strength of
    character, which undoubtedly is far superior to the former and is defined as the
    relentless effort to work for others both in thought and deed. Firmly established in this
    virtue he develops self-reliance and makes it one of his prominent characteristics,
    viewing failures as steps to success; oppression merely' doubling his exertion and danger
    increasing his courage.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>6. <i>KHANTI</i></b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The sixth parami is patience. Patience
    here means endurance, the highest form of endurance in the face of suffering which may be
    inflicted upon oneself by others; and it means the forbearance of others' wrongs. A
    Bodhisatta practises patience to the extent that not even when his hands or feet are cut
    off will he become provoked.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>7. </strong><b><i>SACCA</i></b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The seventh parami is truthfulness. By
    sacca is here meant the keeping of one's promises, and is one of the salient
    characteristics of a Bodhisatta. According to the Haritaca Jataka (No. 431), no Bodhisatta
    in the course of his life to life wanderings ever spoke an untruth: although he may at
    times violate the other precepts, he makes truth his guide and holds to it firmly. He
    considers well before he makes a promise, but once a promise is made he fulfills it at any
    cost. In the <i>Mahasutasoma</i> Jataka it is stated that the Bodhisatta even went to the
    extent of sacrificing his life in order to fulfil a promise.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">He is trustworthy, sincere and honest. He
    speaks as he acts, and as he acts so he speaks. There is perfect harmony in his thoughts.
    words and deeds, and he never descends to flattery to win the hearts of others; neither
    does he exalt himself to win admiration.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>8. </strong><b><i>ADHITTHANA</i></b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The eighth parami is determination. It may
    be interpreted as resolute determination, for this will-power forces all obstructions out
    of his path, and no matter what may come to him in the form of grief or disaster he never
    turns his eyes from his goal. He could easily be persuaded to do good, but not so could he
    be tempted to do anything contrary to his lofty principles. He will be as soft as a flower
    or as firm as a rock, as occasion demands.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>9.<i> </strong><b>METTA</b></i></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The ninth parami is loving-kindness, in
    this case loving-kindness is much deeper than goodwill, friendliness or kindness, It is
    this metta that prompts a Bodhisatta to renounce personal salvation for the sake of
    others, such is the great regard in which he holds all his fellow beings, irrespective of
    caste, creed or colour. And since he is the embodiment of universal love he fears none,
    neither does he instill fear into any; even the wild beasts in lonely jungles are his
    loving friends, for he ever cherishes in his heart a boundless love for all that live.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>10. </strong><b><i>UPEKKHA</i></b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The tenth parami is equanimity. This
    literally means discerning rightly, viewing justly, or looking impartially, i.e.. without
    attachment or detachment, without favour or disfavour; and here the term is not used in
    the sense of indifference or neutral feeling. It is the most difficult and the most
    essential of all the ten parami. especially for the layman who has to move in an
    ill-balanced world with fluctuating fortunes, where slights and insults are the common lot
    of humanity. Likewise are praise and blame, loss and gain, but under all such vicissitudes
    of life a Bodhisatta tries to stand unmoved, like a firm rock, exercising perfect
    equanimity. In times of happiness and in times of adversity, amidst praise and amidst
    blame, he is evenly balanced.</font></p>
