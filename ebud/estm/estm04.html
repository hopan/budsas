    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>28. THE
    <em>ABHIDHAMMA</em> PHILOSOPHY</b> </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Pali term<i> Abhidhamma</i> is composed of <i>Abhi</i>
    which means subtle or ultimate, and <i>Dhamma</i> which means truth or doctrine.
    Abhidhamma therefore means subtle or ultimate truth or doctrine.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the Teachings of the Buddha can be summed up in one
    word: Dhamma. <i>Dharma</i> is the Sanskrit form. In the Pali language which the Buddha
    spoke, it is softened to Dhamma. It means truth, that which really is. As it enables one
    to realize truth the Doctrine is also called Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The word of the Buddha, his entire Teachings called
    Dhamma, consists of three aspects. the doctrinal (<i>pariyatti</i>), the practical (<i>patipatti</i>)
    and the realizable (<i>pativedha</i>). The doctrinal aspect is preserved in the Scriptures
    called <i>Three Pitakas</i> or baskets of the Canon. It has been estimated by English
    translators of the <i>pitakas</i> to be eleven times the size of the Christian Bible. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This <b>Pitaka</b> which contains the words of the Buddha
    consists of three baskets, namely the Basket of Discipline (<i>Vinaya Pitaka</i>), the
    Basket of Discourses (<i>Sutta Pitaka</i>) and the Basket of Ultimate Things (<i>Abhidhamma
    Pitaka</i>).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <b>Vinaya Pitaka</b> deals mainly with the rules and
    regulations of the Order of monks (Bhikkhus) and nuns (Bhikkhunis). It also gives a
    detailed account of the life, ministry of the Buddha and the development of the Buddhist
    Order. It is subdivided into five books. The<b> Sutta Pitaka</b> contains the discourses
    delivered by the Buddha to individuals or assemblies of different ranks at different
    places on different occasions. It is divided into twenty-six books. The<b> Abhidhamma
    Pitaka </b>consists of the four ultimate things: Mind (Citta). Psychic-factors (<i>Cetasikas</i>).
    Matter (Rupa) and Nibbana. It is the most important and most interesting to a deep
    thinker. It is subdivided into seven books.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The main difference between the Sutta and the Abhidhamma
    Pitakas is that in the Sutta the doctrines are explained in the words of conventional,
    simple language, but in the Abhidhamma everything is analyzed and explained in purely
    philosophical terms true in the absolute sense. Thus, in the Sutta. stones are called
    'stones', animals 'animals' and men 'men', but in the Abhidhamma realities of physical and
    psychical phenomena are described and elucidated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Abhidhamma is a philosophy in as much as it deals with the
    most general causes and principles of things. It is also an ethical system because it
    enables one to realize the ultimate goal, Nibbana. As it deals with the working of the
    mind, thoughts, thought processes and psychic factors, it is also a system of psychology.
    Abhidhamma is therefore generally translated as The Psycho-Ethical Philosophy of Buddhism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The discourses in the Sutta Pitaka were generally
    expounded to suit temperaments of different people and so they are rather like
    prescriptions. In the Abhidhamma Pitaka all these doctrines are systematically elucidated
    from the philosophical, psychological and physiological standpoint. As such Abhidhamma is
    underlying all the Teachings of the Buddha. A knowledge of it is therefore essential to
    understand dearly the Buddhist Doctrine.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Abhidhamma is highly prized by deep thinking students of
    Buddhist philosophy but to the average student it seems to be dull and meaningless. The
    main reason is that it is so extremely subtle in its analysis and technical in treatment
    that it is very difficult to understand without the guidance of an able teacher.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the four ultimate realities with which Abhidhamma
    deals, one is mind. Now, what is the mind? Mind has been explained by many philosophers
    and psychologists in various ways.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Abhidhamma, mind is power to think, to know.
    The power of the mind stands no comparison with anything known by us, but we may compare
    it with the colossal energy inherent in electricity, or perhaps with atomic power. Even as
    electrical power could be utilized for different purposes, good, bad or indifferent, so
    also our mind. The atomic power now utilized for human destruction could be utilized for
    the alleviation of human suffering as well.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mind may be said to be like pure, transparent water which
    can be mixed with anything. When it is mixed with mud, it becomes thick and defiled and
    you cannot see through. In the same way, this supreme, incomparable energy known as mind,
    which is by nature clear, bright and transparent, becomes dirty, defiled and poisonous by
    ill use. Take another power known to us; steam power. It can be utilized for the purpose
    of hauling or dragging huge weights of materials under proper control or an intelligent
    use. If this power is misused, or uncontrolled, the result is disastrous. A steam boat
    carrying a large number of passengers can bring destruction to life and property if the
    steam power is not controlled and dexterously used. The abuse of the mind can destroy
    hundreds of times more than any physical power can. But the same mind, when it is
    developed and trained for good purposes, can perform wonders. For instance, see the mind
    of the Buddha who, by the supernormal powers of his well trained mind, is able to
    influence millions of people throughout the world and bring them to light and
    understanding, to joy and happiness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A pure mind is defiled by thoughts of greed, anger and
    ignorance. There are some people who have attained positions of eminence, and because
    their minds are so defiled they have brought ruin not only to themselves but also to large
    sections of the people. They are utilizing their powerful minds in a wrong direction. It
    is just like a revolver in the hands of a monkey.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here in this article, for want of space. I may deal with
    only one aspect of the mind, to show how it can easily be made impure. I may deal with the
    aspect that works through the eye. When we see an object, we do not see its real or
    intrinsic nature, we see only its appearance. An image of the object is formed only if we
    keep our eyes in the right direction so that the waves of light which have been reflected
    by it enter our eyes. Though these waves are incessantly beating on the outside of our
    sense organ, eye; if the eye-lid is closed they make no sense impressions. It is not,
    then, any soul from within us that goes out to seize upon and grasp the object, but the
    phenomena are, as it were, making their way into our consciousness through the sense door.
    All our thoughts or concepts based on those sense impressions are therefore indirect,
    secondary to truth and not free from personal prejudice. We therefore, in actual fact,
    have no direct knowledge of what really exists in the world of physics; nevertheless the
    objects in the outside world of physics are real but not as an observer sees them. The
    objects in the outside world of physics exist independent of our awareness. These physical
    objects, according to the Buddhist philosophy, consist of four aggregates or elements.
    Therefore what we see is only the appearance, the image of the object which appears in the
    retina of our eye. We imagine that what we see is real, but it is our own imagination of
    appearance. Therefore our knowledge of what we see is composed of appearance; hence we
    mistake the appearance for an object, the shadow for the substance. Ignorance of this
    nature leads to delusion in which imagination plays a great part, giving rise to craving
    for what does not exist.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It reminds me of a little story. There was once a fox
    which was looking for something to eat. He stopped at a tree covered with red flowers. He
    looked up and waited till a bunch of flowers fell. He then ran towards it thinking of
    eating with relish, because he imagined that what he saw on the tree was some deep red
    flesh. He smelt it, but to his dismay, discovered that it was not what he expected. But he
    did not lose heart. He said, 'Not this, but those up there are'. So he waited; some more
    bunches of flowers fell, and every time they came down, he repeated the same experience.
    Thus he remained the whole day starving, imagining that the real thing was still on the
    top of the tree.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We worldly people think that things exist when they do not
    really exist. We are usually looking for something new and sometimes for things which do
    not really exist. We look to appearances without realizing their intrinsic values.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, we come to the question whether 1 exist, whether
    'you' exist. This is a common question. It was asked not only at the time of the Buddha.
    but also long before he appeared. The Buddha was asked this question and he has answered
    it again and again; but people have not been satisfied, and today we are asking the same
    question. According to the Buddhist philosophy, 'I' am real, and 'you' are real, they
    exist; but they exist not in the way we see them. What we see is an illusion, because what
    we see, or what we think we see is not real. It is only an appearance, a phantom which our
    mind has created out of appearance or image. We therefore can say that there are two 'I's
    and two 'you's. The 'I' that exists and has being in the world, and another 'I' that
    exists only in the world of the senses and so is not real. The former 'I' exists in its
    real sense, in its intrinsic value, and can be realized only by a well trained mind,
    unobscured by the illusory nature of phenomenal existence. According to Buddhist
    philosophy, this 'I' consists of five aggregates. The combination of these five aggregates
    in varying degrees constitutes the appearance to which we attribute different names. It is
    right knowledge that makes us discriminate the ultimate nature of things from superficial
    appearances, the real from the unreal, and truth from imagination.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The object coming to the view of an ordinary man would be
    seen only in the light of his own limited knowledge, in the light of his own imagination.
    He does not realize the aggregates that have made up the view represented by the object.
    He then attaches qualities that are either attractive or repulsive, desirable or
    undesirable. He often imputes qualities to people, but these qualities are in point of
    fact created out of his own imagination. because he sees only the image of the person
    concerned. He thereby makes mistakes because he does not go beyond the appearance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A Buddhist annotator gives this simile in this connection.
    He says that people who have no insight as to the ultimate reality of things are acting
    like a dog in a story. It appears there was a dog which came across a dry, lean bone.
    Being hungry, it began to lick it and try to eat it. In the process its saliva made the
    bone wet, and it soon began to chew the bone with great relish imagining that it was fat,
    juicy flesh.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">An ordinary world observer is like the dog in the story.
    He imagines he is happy when he really is not. He imagines something to be substantial and
    therefore permanent, when in point of fact, by its very nature, it is the reverse. He
    imagines something which really does not exist, thus giving rise to sorrow, worry,
    suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We talk of attractive and unattractive qualities. Now, do
    these qualities exist? According to Buddhist philosophy, there is nothing definite,
    because what is agreeable or desirable to one may be disagreeable or undesirable to
    another.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Qualities are usually thought to be good or bad
    accordingly as one imagines. Dead flesh that appears to us to be bad looking and having a
    foul smell, appears to a vulture to be good looking with a fine taste and smell. Hence
    what is attractive to one may be repulsive to another. What is lovely in one's eye may be
    ugly in another's. Good or bad, beautiful or ugly, therefore, depends on one's taste and
    habitual outlook.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a little story to illustrate the fact that what
    is attractive to one may not be attractive to another. The story is that once there was a
    golden royal swan, living in the Himalayas, surrounded by beautiful flowers and crystal
    clear streams, and living on sweet and juicy fruits of various kinds. One day, he flew out
    to see the conditions on the flat surface of the earth. He was surprised to see that the
    condition had changed. The water was muddy and the surroundings were ugly. He then spied a
    crane in a muddy pool, ardently spying for something. The golden swan, seeing the plight
    of his brother, took pity on him, and flew down. Approaching the crane, he asked
    sympathetically: My poor brother, I am very sorry to see you in this wretched condition.
    You look so thin and unhappy. Please tell me what you are doing now'. The crane replied,
    'I am looking for food'. 'What do you eat?', enquired the swan, getting interested. The
    crane replied that he lived on fish caught in the pool. This made the swan feel unhappy.
    Fish is not good food, it has such a nasty smell, said the golden swan, 'besides, you are
    living by killing others' lives. Come with me to the Himalayas where you can get sweet,
    juicy fruits, beautiful flowers and pure water', and he gave a very beautiful account of
    the life and conditions there. 'Yes. brother swan', said the creature of the lowlands,
    your account is so interesting and so beautiful indeed, but pray tell me, is there any
    muddy water where I can catch fish?' The swan ultimately had to give up his attempt,
    laudable though it appeared to him to be.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The quality of attraction and repulsion, desirability and
    undesirability depends on convenience, customary practice and predispositions. We may all
    agree that a certain living thing is beautiful, but the sense of appreciation varies with
    various individuals. There is nothing definite about what is beautiful in the real sense.
    I remember I was at one time in the National Gallery in London, and there I saw a group of
    people quarrelling amongst themselves as to which picture was more beautiful, One said
    this and another said that, and nobody agreed on any. So there is nothing definite about
    what is beautiful and what is not, what is attractive and what is not, what is desirable
    and what is not. So long as we base our knowledge on sense impressions, imaginations,
    appearances, we cannot hope to arrive at truth, at the ultimate nature of things.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is therefore a clash of visions, a clash of
    judgements amongst the people of the world. One man's view of idealism is different from
    that of another, one man's view of any subject is not in strict conformity with that of
    another. We talk of peace, but how can we attain peace, real peace, when people do not
    have clear visions? Our visions are covered with ignorance, selfishness and hatred. We are
    living in a world of imagination rather than of truth. There can be no possibility of
    attaining peace either here or hereafter if we do not rid ourselves of greed,
    misunderstanding and hatred. Our task as students of philosophy, therefore, is to keep our
    minds pure, clear and bright, so that our minds will become powerful instruments for the
    service of humanity at large. Then we can become peace makers and builders of a united
    world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To achieve this end, we must cultivate our minds to become
    great by culture and mental training, by service, selflessness and understanding.</font></p>

    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>29. <em>ABHIDHAMMATTHASANGAHA</em></b></strong></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><strong><i>Final talk in
    the series of 16 classes on the Citta Chapter <br>
    given at The London Buddhist Vihara during the summer of 1983</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Buddhist Teaching there are three kinds
    of world,' loka' in the Pali language,. <i>Kamaloka</i>, <i>Rupaloka</i> and <i>Arupaloka</i>,
    three kinds of planes of existence. <i>Kamaloka</i> is called the plane, or we may say
    sphere, of sense pleasures, this world - according to Buddhism, the world of sense
    desires. Kama, desire, plays the greatest part in this world, desire through the eye,
    desire through the ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; desire, meaning greed, is predominant in
    this world, therefore the name <i>Kamaloka</i>. We can realize in our actions that thing
    which we have most in everyday life: wish - 'I wish this', 'I wish that'; wish, the desire
    to have. As consciousness, 'citta' in Pali, it is consciousness of, belonging to, the
    Plane of Sense Desire; that is, this world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this world, <i>Kamaloka</i>, there are altogether for
    ordinary <i>puthujjanas</i> fifty-four types of consciousness (except one,<i>hasituppada</i>,
    the smile of the <i>arahatta</i>). We experience some of these fifty-four types, which you
    have already studied; first of all the <i>akusala</i> states, the eight bad types of
    immoral, greedy conscious ness; the two hateful, angry types of consciousness; the two
    ignorant types of consciousness rooted in dullness and delusion - lobha, dosa, moha,
    altogether twelve. We all of us experience these twelve, I can say every day, every hour
    if not every time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, resultant types of consciousness, which arise as a
    result of our immoral actions also the result of our moral actions; they are known as
    rootless, <i>ahetuka</i>, and are eighteen in number. Looking at the chart we see
    resultant, '<i>vipaka</i>' in Pali; bad resultant seven types, good resultant of lower
    kind eight types, and three inoperative. Thus in all, so far, thirty types: twelve immoral
    plus eighteen rootless resultant.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then in this world we also have good types of
    consciousness known as <i>sobhana</i>, beautiful types of consciousness. There are eight
    active moral (<i>kusala</i>) types known as beautiful, <i>sobhana</i>, which we experience
    also more or less every day. Good, moral consciousness means we can do good actions with
    one of these eight types; anything we do good, we do with one of these types of
    consciousness. As a result, therefore, we have eight types of good resultant (vipaka)
    consciousness because of our actions, physical, verbal or vocal, and mental. Because of
    our beautiful thoughts we utter beautiful words and we do beautiful actions, known as
    moral actions, as the result of which we have, mentally, eight types of beautiful
    resultant consciousness. Verbally, as a result of good thoughts (mental action), what we
    say will be very good, useful, helpful, pleasant; people will like us, love us, appreciate
    what we say. As a result we shall have everything good, verbally. These types of
    consciousness can also be experienced by the <i>arahattas</i>, perfect beings like the
    Buddha and <i>paccekabuddhas</i>, but their actions are not cumulative, their
    consciousness does not accumulate, does not produce any result, therefore they are only
    inoperative, '<i>kiriya</i>' in Pali. Thus, with eight inoperative types of <i>sobhana</i>
    consciousness, there are in all twenty-four <i>sobhana</i> states making a total of
    fifty-four types of consciousness that can be experienced in this world, or plane, <i>Kamaloka</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now we can go higher by developing our good consciousness
    into higher types of consciousness. For the attainment of the next, higher, plane of
    consciousness, <i>Rupaloka</i>, the Plane of Form, beings have very fine, refined bodies
    in that existence, they are all <i>jhanic</i> persons, very highly developed mentally, so
    high that they can live even thousands of lives, in some cases millions of lives, without
    eating. Wherever they want to go they can fly without having or bothering to buy tickets,
    making arrangements, without looking after cars or aeroplanes, in that <i>Rupaloka</i>.
    Because their physical body is so refined, beautiful; that is one way of explanation of
    the name Rupa for that existence. Another explanation is that to reach that state, to be
    born in that world, one's object of meditation is form, not the mind; that is why it is
    called <i>Rupaloka</i>, the Plane of Form, and the conscious states are known as
    consciousness of the Plane of Form. In that world their moral actions are five: first,
    second, third, fourth and fifth jhana, good (<i>kusala</i>) consciousness. They have as a
    result five resultant, vipaka, types of consciousness. And there are five inoperative, <i>kiriya</i>,
    types for the Buddhas, also <i>arahattas</i>; in all, therefore, fifteen. In this world
    fifty-four types of consciousness, and in the Plane of Form fifteen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now one can go still higher, <i>Arupaloka</i>, the
    Formless Plane, where they have no form - as already explained in an earlier class. In
    that existence there are four moral (<i>kusala</i>) actions, four resultants (vipaka) and
    four inoperative (<i>kiriya</i>) states, altogether twelve. So in these three planes of
    existence there are altogether eighty-one types of consciousness known as mundane types of
    consciousness: in <i>Kamaloka</i> fifty-four. <i>Rupaloka</i> fifteen and in the Formless
    Plane twelve. Though the Rupa and Arupa types of consciousness are much higher than this
    world, yet they are still mundane, not supramundane. By attaining these highest types of
    mundane consciousness we can enjoy life, the great lengths and periods of which are
    explained in this book (<i>Abhidhammatthasangaha</i>), but still they are only mundane.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we should like to attain even higher, that highest
    type of consciousness is called supramundane, <i>Lokuttara</i>. There are four <i>kusala</i>
    types of <i>Lokuttara</i> consciousness and four types of resultant, making a total of
    eight types of supramundane consciousness. Thus, including every type of consciousness,
    eighty-one plus eight, there are in all eighty-nine types of citta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To study supramundane consciousness please refer to the
    book, page no. 61, Moral Supramundane Consciousness'. ('A Manual of <i>Abhidhamma</i>' by
    Narada Mahathera, Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy, Sri Lanka, 1980) There are four
    types of consciousness, Path consciousness: <i>sotapatti</i> Path consciousness, <i>sakadagami</i>
    Path consciousness, <i>anagami</i> Path consciousness, arahatta Path consciousness. In
    Pali they are called <i>sotapattimagga</i>, <i>sakadagamimagga</i>, and so on; magga is
    translated in English as path. So, altogether four types of Path consciousness; these are
    the four <i>kusala</i> or moral types of supramundane consciousness. There are exactly the
    same number of resultant types of supramundane consciousness, 'phala' in Pali, in English,
    fruit; sotapatti fruit consciousness, <i>sakadagami</i> fruit consciousness, anagami fruit
    consciousness, arahatta fruit consciousness. Now, reading from the book, 'These are the
    four types of supramundane moral and resultant consciousness. Thus end, in all, the eight
    types of supramundane moral and resultant consciousness. Differing according to the four
    paths the moral consciousness is fourfold. So are the resultants, being their fruits. The
    supramundane should be understood as eightfold'. And, still following the book, 'Thus the
    &quot;immorals&quot; are twelve, the &quot;morals&quot; are twenty-one, the
    &quot;resultants are thirty-six, the &quot;functionals (inoperative)&quot; are twenty. In
    the Sensuous Sphere, they say, the wise say, 'are fifty-four types of consciousness; in
    the Form Sphere are fifteen; in the Formless Sphere are twelve; in the Supramundane are
    eight'.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Next, the explanation of how, why, eighty-nine types of
    consciousness become one hundred and twenty-one, see page 63 in the book: 'How does
    consciousness which is analyzed into eighty-nine become one hundred and twenty-one?' You
    already know eighty-one types of mundane consciousness, and now the eight supramundane are
    further divided into forty, eighty-one and forty totalling one hundred and twenty-one. The
    eight supramundane become forty in the following way, as shown in the book, 'The first
    jhana sotapatti Path consciousness together with initial application, sustained
    application, joy, happiness and one-pointedness'; you have already studied these jhanic
    states in <i>Rupaloka</i>, the Plane of Form. 'Second jhana sotapatti Path consciousness
    together with sustained application, joy, happiness and one-pointedness', and so on, third
    jhana, fourth, fifth, altogether five. Thus there are five types of sotapatti Path
    consciousness because of these five jhanas. as is also the case with <i>sakadagami</i>,
    anagami and arahatta Path consciousness; each is developed into five by way of the five
    jhanas, making exactly twenty types of Path consciousness. Similarly there are twenty
    classes of Fruit (phala) consciousness, making in all a total of forty types of
    supramundane consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Referring to the summary in the book on page 64: 'Dividing
    each (supramundane) consciousness into five kinds according to different jhana factors,
    the supramundane consciousness, it is said, becomes forty. As the Form Sphere
    consciousness is treated as first jhana consciousness, and so on, even so is the
    supramundane consciousness. The Formless Sphere consciousness is included in the fifth
    jhana'.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here again some explanation is needed. In the Sphere of
    Form there are three first jhanas - one <i>kusala</i>, one resultant and one inoperative.
    In <i>Lokuttara</i> there are eight first jhanas - one each in the four Paths and one each
    in the four Fruits. Thus there are in total eleven first jhanas. Similarly there are
    eleven second jhanas, third jhanas and fourth jhanas. When, however, it comes to the fifth
    jhana, not only are there eleven in the way just described, but because all the twelve
    types of consciousness in the Formless Sphere are of the category of fifth jhana this
    brings the total of fifth jhana states to twenty-three. Fifth jhana has only two dominant
    factors, equanimity and one-pointedness of mind. Because all the twelve <i>arupa</i> types
    of consciousness have only those two dominant factors, they are included in that category.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Referring to the book again, 'Thirty-seven are morals,
    fifty-two are resultants; thus the wise say that there are one hundred and twenty-one
    types of consciousness'. <i>Kiriya</i>, the inoperative states, are not mentioned here.
    'Thus ends the first chapter of the <i>Abhidhammatthasangaha</i> which deals with the
    analysis of consciousness'.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now to show how this supramundane consciousness can be
    experienced, how only with supramundane consciousness can one attain Nibbana, and not with
    any of the mundane states. Nibbana is the highest type of happiness and is attained only
    by the highest types of consciousness. <i>Lokuttara</i> states, not ordinary states of
    consciousness, therefore ordinary puthujjanas cannot know what Nibbana is, will not
    understand what it is. If one wants to talk about it one can, but one will not realize it.
    one cannot appreciate it; by mere thinking, no matter how high one's thoughts are, as long
    as they are mundane one will never realize Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He who practises meditation is called a yogi, and the yogi
    who wishes to realize Nibbana tries to understand things as they truly are; one must
    understand what things are. From the book. page 65: 'With his one-pointed mind he
    scrutinizes his self' - scrutinizes, examines thoroughly, deeply his self; that is, the
    so-called 'I'. What is self? What is 'I'? If one wants to attain Nibbana one should first
    examine what 'I' is, what we are; so- 'he scrutinizes his self, and on due examination
    discovers that his so-called ego, or ego-personality' - the so-called soul - 'is nothing
    but a mere composition of mind and matter'. If you analyse your body. including the
    so-called 'I', you or soul, or spirit or , you will discover that the so-called
    ego-personality, the so-called 'I'. is nothing but a mere composition of mind and matter.
    'The former', that is mind, 'consisting of fleeting mental states' - that have already
    been explained, that you have studied - 'that arise as a result of senses coming into
    contact with sense stimuli - i.e., an object - 'and the latter' - i.e., matter, body, the
    composition - 'of forces and qualities that manifest themselves in multifarious phenomena'
    - many and various kinds of phenomena. So by analysing mind and body one discovers these
    forces, four kinds of elements, and qualities. These forces are only qualities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Having thus gained a correct view of the real nature of
    his self ' - having analysed the so-called body and mind, and gaining a correct view of
    the real nature of his self, the so-called 'I' - 'freed from the false notion of an
    identical substance of mind and matter' - one sees what mind is, what matter is - 'he
    attempts to investigate the cause of this ego-personality' - this so-called self, or soul,
    or spirit. 'He realizes that everything worldly, himself not excluded, is conditioned by
    causes past or present, and that this existence is due to past ignorance (avijja)' - as we
    said in <i>Paticcasamuppuda</i>, this existence, our own existence, is due to past
    ignorance - 'craving (tanha), attachment (<i>upadana</i>), kamma' - that is, our action -
    'and physical food (<i>ahara</i>) of the present life' - because of food we exist. 'On
    account of these five causes this personality' - this soul, so-called 'I' - 'has arisen
    and as the past activities have conditioned the present, so the present will condition the
    future. Meditating thus', - that is what we call meditation, studying what the so-called
    'I', you, is composed of. So, meditation; what is meditation?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people use the word contemplation. What is the
    difference between meditation and thinking, between meditation and contemplation? For the
    attainment of Nibbana the Pali word is vipassana, and it is translated into English as
    meditation, which is not an actual equivalent; for the want of words we use the term
    meditation. Meditation is not the real complete meaning, it does not convey the full
    meaning of the Pali term vipassana. Vipassana means 'vi' and '<i>passana</i>'. 'Vi' has
    two meanings, <i>visesana</i> and <i>vividha</i>. <i>Visesana</i> means specially; <i>passana</i>
    means seeing; so, to see the object specially, not in an ordinary way is the meaning of <i>visesana</i>.
    That is to say, when one tries to meditate, when one uses or practises vipassana, one sees
    objects differently, specially, not in an ordinary way. Ordinarily, when one is not trying
    to meditate, if one sees a man one is conscious of, aware, there is a man, a woman, there
    is a dog, cat, and so on, that is the ordinary way of seeing. In a meditative way, in the
    vipassana way, one does not see a man or woman, one sees specially, one sees that the
    so-called man and woman are just a composition of mind and matter. One should go beyond
    the surface, beyond the appearance, that is what we call vipassana, seeing in a special
    and not ordinary conventional way. One will never realize truth if one sees things in an
    ordinary conventional way.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, <i>vividha</i>, the other meaning of 'vi', means
    differently, in the light of the Three Characteristics. As a meditator one sees not the
    body, not the appearance, one sees the so-called object in the light of the Three
    Characteristics; that is what we call vipassana. This so-called body and mind is subject
    to change; changing, changing, like the second hand of a clock or watch, changing,
    following, flowing. So when one sees an object one sees it in the light. of transiency,
    impermanence; and anything that is changeable is not really desirable. That is dukkha.
    Then another, the third Characteristic, is, there is no permanent, eternal substance in
    anything in the world we see, that is to say in animate beings like human beings, animals,
    there is no eternal principle in a body, no immortal soul. When we say a body, that body
    is moving, changing; mind and body are moving, and so on. So when as a meditator we see
    the object specially, not in an ordinary, conventional way, we see it in the light of the
    Three Characteristics. That is meditation, that is vipassana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one refers to the dictionary, meditation means
    thinking, thinking about, therefore it is entirely different from the meaning of the word
    vipassana. If one wants to practise Buddhist meditation it means vipassana meditation, to
    see objects specially, not in the ordinary way, to see objects in the light of the Three
    Characteristics (anicca, dukkha, anatta).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, the book, still on page 65 - 'Meditating thus he
    transcends all doubts with regard to the past, present and future (<i>kankhavitaranavisuddhi</i>).
    Thereupon he contemplates that all conditioned things are transient (anicca), subject to
    suffering (dukkha), and devoid of an immortal soul (anatta). Wherever he turns his eyes he
    sees nought but these Three Characteristics standing out in bold relief'. He sees them
    very clearly. 'He realizes that life is a mere flowing, continuous undivided movement.
    Neither in a celestial plane nor on earth' - earth does not mean the ground, but this
    world. So, neither in a celestial or divine world. i.e., heaven - 'does he find any
    genuine happiness, for every form of pleasure is only a prelude to pain'. If one sees
    this, one sees things as they are, suffering. To ordinary worldly people everything
    pleasant is supposed to be very pleasurable, enjoyable, but to that person such pleasure
    is only a prelude to pain. 'What is transient' - impermanent - 'is therefore subject to
    suffering, and where change and sorrow prevail there cannot be a permanent ego - cannot be
    a permanent soul.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'As he is thus absorbed in meditation', - vipassana - 'a
    day comes when, to his surprise, he witnesses an aura emanating' - coming forth - 'from
    his body (<i>obhasa</i>)'. If his meditation is enhanced he sees an aura, he experiences
    an unprecedented pleasure, happiness and quietude - 'He becomes even-minded. strenuous.
    His religious fervour increases' - that is, his strength - 'and mindfulness becomes
    perfect, and insight extraordinarily keen. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Mistaking this advanced state of moral progress for
    sainthood', - the meditator may think, 'Ah! I have attained sainthood, sotapatti' -
    'chiefly owing to the presence of the aura, he develops a liking for this mental state.
    Soon the realization comes that these new developments are only obstacles', - the
    hindrances - 'to moral progress', they are not real' - 'and he cultivates the purity of
    knowledge with regard to the Path and non-Path (<i>maggamagganana</i>-<i>dassanavisuddhi</i>)'.
    So he tries to see whether the path he is following is the real Path or not.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Perceiving the right path', - so he chooses - 'he resumes
    his meditation on the arising (<i>udaya</i> <i>nana</i>) and passing away (<i>vayanana</i>)
    of conditioned things. Of these two characteristics the latter becomes more impressed in
    his mind, because change is more conspicuous than becoming'. This also needs explanation.
    This is one of the stages of the <i>nanas</i> when one is meditating on the arising and
    falling away of one's consciousness, gradually one sees more clearly the falling part than
    the arising part; that is what it means - 'more impressed in his mind, because change is
    more conspicuous than becoming. Therefore he turns his attention to the dissolution of
    things (<i>bhanga nana</i>). He perceives that both mind and matter which constitute his
    personality, are in a state of constant flux', - change -'not remaining for two
    consecutive moments the same. To him comes the knowledge that all dissolving things are
    fearful (<i>bhaya nana</i>). The whole world appears to him like a pit of burning embers,
    a source of danger. Subsequently he reflects on the wretchedness and vanity (<i>adinava
    nana</i>) of the fearful world', - to him the world is to be feared - 'and feeling
    disgusted with it (<i>nibbida nana</i>), wishes to escape therefrom (<i>muncitukamyata
    nana</i>).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'With this object in view he meditates again on the Three
    Characteristics (<i>patsankha nana</i>), and thereafter becomes completely indifferent to
    all conditioned things', - he is not interested in worldly things - 'having neither
    attachment nor aversion for any worldly object (<i>sankharupekkha nana</i>). Reaching this
    point of mental culture he takes for his object of special endeavour one of the Three
    Characteristics that appeals to him most, and intently keeps on developing insight in that
    particular direction, until that glorious day when, for the first time, he realizes
    Nibbana, his ultimate goal'.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, continuing on page 67 in the book, there is a kind of
    diagram showing how the process of consciousness takes place. Then - 'When there is no <i>parikamma</i>
    thought-moment, in the case of an individual with keen insight, there arise three phala
    thought- moments'. Just the process of consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'These nine kinds of insight', - namely, <i>udaya</i>-<i>vaya</i>
    <i>nana</i>, and so on - 'are collectively called <i>patipadananadassanavisuddhi</i>,
    purity of knowledge and vision as regards the practice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Insight found in this supramundane Path consciousness is
    known as <i>nanadassanavisuddhi</i>, purity of knowledge and vision.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'When the spiritual pilgrim realizes Nibbana for the first
    time he is called a sotapanna, one who has entered the stream that leads to Nibbana for
    the first time. He is no more a worldling (<i>puthujjana</i>) but an ariya' -noble one.
    'He eliminates three fetters, namely, self-illusion (<i>sakkayaditthi</i>), doubts
    (vicikiccha), and adherence to wrongful rites and ceremonies'- rituals- '(<i>silabbataparamasa</i>).
    As he has not eradicated all the fetters that bind him to existence, he is reborn seven
    times at most' - in this world. 'In his subsequent birth he may or may not be aware of the
    fact that he is a sotapanna', - first noble one - 'nevertheless, he possesses the
    characteristics peculiar to such a saint.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'He gains implicit confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma,
    Sangha', - then he becomes a real Buddhist, really, otherwise one's confidence is very
    shaky. When one reaches the state of sotapanna, the fiat, initiative state of ariya, one's
    confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma, is fixed, established - 'and he would never violate any
    of the five precepts. He is, moreover, absolved from states of woe, for he is destined to
    enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Summoning up fresh courage as a result of this distant
    glimpse of Nibbana, the <i>ariyan</i> pilgrim makes rapid progress, and perfecting his
    insight becomes <i>sakadagami</i> (once returner), by attenuating two other fetters,
    namely, sense-desire (<i>kamaraga</i>) and illwill (<i>patigha</i>).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'In this case, too, and in the case of the other two
    advanced stages of sainthood, a <i>javana</i> thought-process runs as above ...'.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, just to conclude easily, please read to the end of
    this section and turn to the last paragraph on page 69.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'It will be noted that the fetters have to be eradicated
    in four stages'. This comes in the section just mentioned for you to read for yourselves.
    'The Path (magga) thought-moment occurs only once. The Fruit (phala) thought-moment
    immediately follows. In the supramundane classes of consciousness the effect of the <i>kusala</i>
    <i>cittas</i> is instantaneous. Hence it is called <i>akalika</i> (of immediate fruit);
    ...'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So in the case of supramundane consciousness, moral (<i>kusala</i>)
    consciousness, one experiences the result immediately, not like ordinary worldly moral
    actions, <i>lokiya</i>, mundane states, where 'effects may take place in this life, or in
    a subsequent life, or at any time until one attains Parinibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'In mundane consciousness kamma is predominant, while in
    supramundane consciousness panna, or wisdom, is predominant. Hence the four <i>lokuttara</i>
    cittas are not treated as kamma'. Kamma is only a worldly function. In the case of
    supramundane moral consciousness, this moral action is not known as kamma because it will
    not produce an ordinary worldly result; that is the attainment of Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;These eight <i>cittas</i>', - types of consciousness
    - 'are called <i>Lokuttara</i>. Here<i> loka</i> means the <i>pancupadanakkhandha</i>, the
    five aggregates of attachment. <i>Uttara</i> means that which transcends. <i>Lokuttara</i>
    therefore means that which transcends the world of aggregates of attachment. This
    definition strictly applies to the four Paths. The Fruits are called <i>Lokuttara</i>
    because they have transcended the world of aggregates of attachment'. <i>Lokuttara</i> is
    really the name for Path consciousness, because the Path is really the work which cuts, or
    transcends the world. The Fruit is only the result, that is what it means.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now the rest of this first chapter in the book explains
    how the eight types of supramundane consciousness become forty. That is the end of the
    section on citta, consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just to conclude our study, our talk, I would like to
    read, not much, just a little about Nibbana. The book explains how to reach the state of
    Nibbana; what I am going to read is, what is Nibbana?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nibbana is the result of the cessation of selfish desires.
    That is the literal meaning. '<i>ni</i>' and '<i>vana</i>'; '<i>ni</i>' means not, and '<i>vana</i>'
    means selfish desire. It may also be defined as extinction of lust, hatred and ignorance,
    freedom from lust, hatred and ignorance. So Nibbana means the cessation of selfish desire,
    the absence of craving, hatred and ignorance. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Pali word is Nibbana, formed, as just said, from the
    negative particle '<i>ni</i>' and '<i>vana</i>'. The Sanskrit word Nirvana comes from the
    root '<i>va</i>', which means to blow, and the prefix '<i>nir</i>' which means off or out;
    hence Nirvana in its Sanskrit form means the blowing out of the flame of personal desires.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Both explanations are negative explanations of Nibbana.
    The predominance of the negative explanation of Nibbana resulted in the mistaken notion
    that it is nothingness; some people even translate Nibbana as nothingness, or
    annihilation. Annihilation of what, though? They will not say what, but just that Nibbana
    means annihilation or nothing. If that is so, why should the Buddha have wasted his time
    for attaining nothing?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, in the Buddhist scriptures we find many positive
    definitions of Nibbana, such as: Nibbana means the highest refuge; safety; unique;
    absolute purity; supramundane; security; emancipation; peace; and so on, there are many
    positive definitions. Nibbana is, therefore, not a negative concept; because it is the
    cessation of craving, the blowing out of man's selfish desires, and that blowing out of
    desires leaves a man free. Nibbana is, therefore, freedom. Freedom, though, does not mean
    freedom from circumstances, nobody is free from circumstances. It is freedom from the
    bonds with which we have bound ourselves to circumstances, my circumstance, my activities,
    my, my; so we bind ourselves to our circumstances, make circumstances as our own. Thus
    Nibbana is freedom from those bonds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That man is free if he is free from selfish desire,
    hatred, illwill, ignorance. That man is free who is strong enough to say, 'Whatever comes
    I accept as best'. Who can say that? Though we may express it, some people may say it, but
    actually only the man who is free from these evil fetters can truly say so, only he is
    really free.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Freedom does not mean that one can do everything that can
    be imagined; people may think freedom means that one can do anything one likes. Freedom
    does not mean that one can defeat a lion with a slap of the hand. Some people might think
    that if one had that kind of power that that would be freedom. Freedom to do anything we
    wish is not freedom, because still there is a wish, which is a return to the bondage of
    our desires. Freedom means that one cannot be made a slave to anyone or anything. One is
    free because one is free from personal desire, free from resentment, free from anger, free
    from pride, free from fear, impatience; free, from all craving. Such a man's binding
    emotions have been blown out like so many candles; that man is free here on earth, he has
    reached Nibbana in this world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">May all be well, healthy, happy, wealthy - you may like to
    be wealthy - and successful in all your noble undertakings. May you attain this state of
    Nibbana without much difficulty, and as soon as possible.</font></p>

    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>30. <em>PATICCASAMUPPADA</em></b></strong></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><strong><i>A talk given at
    The London Buddhist Vihara on 9th October 1983</i> </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The subject of my talk this evening, as the chart in
    evidence on the blackboard shows, is Paticcasamuppada. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Paticcasamuppada is a Pali term meaning the Law of
    Dependent Origination, or Dependent Arising, the arising of a state dependent on the
    antecedent state. The discourse in Pali on Paticcasamuppada is one of the very well known
    and very important discourses, because without this aspect of the Teaching it is rather
    difficult to understand why and how one becomes a being. a human being. This Law of
    Dependent Origination mainly answers three great questions which had always puzzled the
    Bodhisatta, the Buddha to be, before he became the Buddha. As the Bodhisatta he had for
    countless lives practised all kinds of austerities, searching for truth, approaching many
    well known philosophers and meditation masters, from all of whom he had received all kinds
    of answers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of these three great questions the first is, 'Where did we
    come from?' Sitting here this evening you may say, '1 came from my home, from my flat' and
    so on, but this question is not asking an ordinary question; 'Where did we come from into
    this world, into this existence?' is the question being asked. Do you think you may be
    able to answer it? For immeasurable lives the Bodhisatta had looked for the answer, but
    none of the philosophers in any of those periods whom he approached was ever able to give
    him a satisfactory reply to this question, some saying that if you want to know where you
    have come from you should know the beginning of life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are sixty-two views, wrong views, about existence,
    where beings come from, how they start; however, if I deal with the sixty- two views you
    will be remaining here in this <i>vihara</i> all night, so I will take only three views
    which the Bodhisatta received from those well known philosophers, religious teachers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first view given was that the beginning of life is
    your fate, you must have faith in fate; you cannot do anything by yourself, you have to
    rely on your fate. Thus they taught that fatalism is the beginning; whatever comes to you
    it is because of your fate, and you cannot do anything about it. That in Pali is known as <i>sahetuka</i>,
    the cause of your existence; consequently you cannot make any plan for your own
    development to be free from all suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what is suffering? You already know, I think, the very
    well known <i>Dhammacakkapavattana</i> Sutta, the first sermon preached by the Buddha in
    which he expounds the Four Noble Truths - Suffering, the Cause of Suffering, the Cessation
    of Suffering and the Way Leading to the Cessation of Suffering. In Paticcasamuppada
    suffering is also explained, where it is shown that suffering is together with <i>jati</i>,
    the Pali word for birth. Birth is suffering. Consider your own birth, how difficult it
    was, what a dreadful state in a mother's womb as a foetus; to begin with a tiny spot, so
    tiny that no magnifying glass would help to identify it, then gradually developing, in
    some cases for seven months, in some for eight, nine months, in a mother's womb; that is
    suffering. If you were to live in a house say twenty feet wide by twenty feet long, you
    may say. 'Oh! what a very narrow house, very narrow'. It would not be very comfortable and
    you would not be regarded as a very rich person if you had to live within such confined
    conditions, yet consider the room you occupied when as a foetus in a mother's womb. And
    the suffering of birth is followed by <i>jara</i>, <i>byadhi</i>, old age and decay,
    death, sorrow, lamentation, physical pain, grief and despair; and a little more than that
    - to be separated from beloved ones is suffering, to be associated with those whom we
    dislike is suffering, not to get what one wishes is suffering, and so on; such is dukkha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unless one knows this Paticcasamuppada one cannot begin to
    understand the real nature and function of cause and effect, the cause of suffering, how
    suffering arises. And in meditation there is a stage where one becomes free from doubt
    about one's own existence; this again means a knowledge of Paticcasamuppada, a proper
    understanding of cause and effect, so that no doubts exist as to how one arises and passes
    away as a human being.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But getting back now to the Bodhisatta's quest for an
    answer to, 'Where did we come from?' As has already been said, the first view given by one
    of the well known philosophers was that the beginning of life is due to fate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second answer he received was that life started, or
    has started, without any cause, it just happens, there is no cause.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third view was that the beginning of life is neither
    really fatalism nor causeless, the beginning of life is due to a creator, a supreme being,
    he started it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, with the third view that the beginning of life is due
    to the creation of a supreme being, supreme god, he received those three different answers
    from the well known philosophers of those times, but the Bodhisatta was not satisfied with
    any of them. If a supreme being is the cause, he also must have a cause. Without a cause
    how could he live, who gave him his power of creation, the power to create? The unlimited
    power of which a supreme god is supposed to be possessed; where did that power come from.
    originate, how did he start, was there not a prior almighty being who created him, and so
    on? If you say. 'Oh well, it is normal, it is just natural', then you may say of yourself
    too, 'I come to this world naturally'; but it still does not answer the question of what
    cause, what preceding condition gives rise to such a natural, normal happening.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was not until the Bodhisatta realized this doctrine of
    Paticcasamuppada, the wheel of life, the continuous process of cause and effect, that he
    was able to find the answers to his three main questions. On the chart on the blackboard
    we can see there a big circle depicting the wheel of life. Of the twelve sections, links
    in the chain, the wheel, can we say which is the beginning, which is the end? The
    explanation will come.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Bodhisatta's second question was, 'Why are we here?'
    Why are we here in this world as human beings, why? We do not know, any more than we know
    where we came from; ordinary students, ordinary beings do not know the answer.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the third great question was, 'Where are we going?'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, the answer very briefly to the first question, 'Where
    did we come from?' We come from out of the past, even as today comes out of yesterday.
    This life is the result of the past life, before this life. We come from out of the things
    we have done before, out of the past labours unfinished. Although we have laboured, our
    work is not complete, if it were we should not be here, we should be somewhere higher. We
    come out of past vices and virtues, vices and virtues we have accumulated, out of the
    darkness of our own ignorance, out of our own desires. We should like, we desire, to live
    here; and we should like to come again, we have a great desire to come, but in a better
    way, physically, mentally, emotionally, morally - any way a little better, if not too
    much. In the way of wealth we should like, we desire, to be richer, physically more
    beautiful, to live longer, and so on. Thus we have come down into the present, bringing
    with us an unlimited accumulation of vices and virtues; therefore we can do evil things,
    but also we can do wonderful things, good things. In Paticcasamuppada it explains how the
    process works.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But proceeding now to the second question, 'Why are we
    here?' We are here because of the past, for the past gives birth to the present, and from
    the present is born the future. We are brought here by our own joys, our own sorrows, but
    most of all we are led here by our desires, and here we remain. For how long? Until the
    last selfish desire is annihilated. Desire for self: 'I want', 'I have a desire to do this
    and that', countless desires. All elfish desire must be totally annihilated, if there is
    one left we shall not attain Nibbana yet. To the wise man the life he lives here is an
    opportunity to rid himself of the burden which he has accumulated in the past; to rid
    himself of his own wrong doings, his wrong view points, to rid himself of his wrong
    concepts of life and death, and, leaving them all behind, to place his feet upon the
    Middle Way. Until then we shall be here, coming back again and again.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the answer to the third question, 'Where are we
    going?' We are going to the effects of our causation, the results of our actions, the
    effects of our causes. Those whose labours are unfinished will go around the wheel of
    life, known in Pali as <i>samsara</i>. Samsara means going round the wheel of life,
    returning again and again.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So those whose labours are unfinished merely go around the
    wheel of life, samsara, and return again to labour towards fuller completion. Those who
    have followed the Middle Way, the Eightfold Path, and finished their labours, reach the
    state of Nibbana, complete cessation of all suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Until the Bodhisatta, just before he became the Buddha,
    realized Paticcasamuppada fully, he was continuously searching for the answers to the
    above mentioned three great questions which had always puzzled him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, the wheel of life, how do we start? If we refer to
    the chart we can see there avijja, ignorance. This life begins with - not very pleasant -
    ignorance, that is how we start, because of ignorance; if we had attained wisdom we should
    not be here. But in taking avijja as the starting point in the circle, the wheel, the
    question arises as to what is the cause of avijja? The answer will come later. The wheel
    does not show the supreme ultimate beginning, the commencement of samsara, it shows the
    present life, the life we are living now and its relation to the past and future.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we are starting at avijja, ignorance, in the circle.
    Ignorance of what? Ignorance, mainly, of the Four Noble Truths; also ignorance of
    Paticcasamuppada, ignorance of one's own past and present. If we really realize the Four
    Noble Truths we shall attain wisdom, we shall attain Nibbana, but this circle.
    Paticcasamuppada, only deals with mundane states because we are as yet mundane beings, it
    does not deal with supramundane states in which Nibbana is the object of consciousness. So
    it shows the wheel of life of puthujjanas, ordinary beings. Puthujjana, very thick-
    skinned, thick with greed, hatred and ignorance; therefore we ordinary people are called
    puthujjana. that is one of the etymological explanations of puthujjana. So
    Paticcasamuppada refers only to puthujjana beings, and as such we are going round and
    round in the whirlpool of this circle without finding the outlet.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to discover the outlet our job is to know the
    Four Noble Truths. The Truth of Suffering, as briefly discussed earlier, everyone
    experiences from the beginning in a mother's womb. The Truth of the Cause of Suffering:
    the cause is craving, craving for existence, greed for this and that. The Truth of the
    Cessation of Suffering, release from suffering: that is Nibbana, The Truth of the Way
    Leading to the Cessation of Suffering: that is the Eightfold Path. If one knows the Four
    Truths really, not theoretically but with full realization, one can get out of this
    circle.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Next to avijja in the circle comes <i>sankhara</i>.
    Sankhara is translated in different ways - literally it means doing, acting; it means
    activities, mainly mental activities. Abhidhamma students who are present here will know
    the twenty-nine possible types of active conscious states that may take place in the case
    of puthujjanas, the twelve immoral states, eight moral and nine meditational states.
    Sankhara, here, means these twenty-nine types of consciousness. Owing to ignorance
    sometimes we do good actions, but mostly we do bad actions because mostly we do things
    rooted in greed and hatred. Under the influence of ignorance we do all kinds of actions.
    We are ignorant really of which is right and wrong, although we may know just generally
    that certain actions might be good, certain actions might not be good. Therefore, blinded
    by ignorance we do wrong actions, although sometimes we do good actions, but not commonly.
    Generally we do actions because we like, which means based on greed; in the main greed is
    our guide, desire is our guide, we are guided by greed. So we like this and that and the
    other all the time, all the time wanting, wishing. And why? Because of avijja, not
    understanding the result of greed, without knowing the influence or power of greed. If we
    do not get what we want we are disappointed, frustrated, we get angry and wild; but the
    result of this is not mentioned yet, here. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are altogether twelve factors in this circle,
    Paticcasamuppada, and there are three periods. i.e., past, present and future. As the
    starting point we have mentioned avijja, the first factor, ignorance of the Four Noble
    Truths, and so on. Hoping to get a good result we do actions; that is sankhara, the second
    factor. These two factors, avijja and sankhara, are the past period, and they have brought
    us to this world. Our past good actions such as giving, offering <i>dana</i>, observing
    certain precepts, having some good thoughts; because of good kamma in the past we come to
    this world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, because of sankhara the third factor arises, <i>vinnana</i>,
    rebirth consciousness in this world. Vinnana is the present period, resultant section,
    arising as the result, the outcome of the past avijja-sankhara, the cause. Vinnana, here,
    means not all types of consciousness but rebirth consciousness after death. Thus,
    beginning this present life, we have first <i>patisandhi</i> consciousness - relinking
    consciousness - that which links this present life with the past. Rebirth consciousness
    arises, we are reborn, that is why we use the word rebirth, not reincarnation which means
    a soul is reborn. In Buddhism, because there is no soul, we do not use the word
    reincarnation or incarnation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consciousness cannot work alone, it has some associated
    mental factors which work together with it, in Pali known as <i>cetasikas</i>; and being
    mind it cannot exist alone, it needs a body as a result of past actions. Therefore because
    of our relinking consciousness, dependent upon our relinking consciousness, we have mind
    and body, nama and rupa, the fourth factor in the circle. The translation given on this
    chart here is mentality for nama and materiality for rupa, but mind and body is rather
    easier to understand.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, because of mind and body, depending on mind and
    body, you have six bases, the fifth factor in the circle. We have five external sense
    bases: eye, ear, nose, tongue and body (touch). We also use the Pali word <i>dvara</i>,
    meaning door, because of two functions. Through the eye-door, for example, we take a
    visible object. and through the eye-door we let it go; therefore the eye has two
    functions, coming and going. The term base is used in the sense of a base upon which
    consciousness can function. And the sixth is an internal base, or inner door, the
    mind-door. It has two meanings, for it is not only a base or door but it is our life-line
    as well in Pali, <i>bhavanga</i> - which leads us on from birth to birth. following this
    wheel round and round. Physically the heart is mentioned as the base for thought. And so,
    depending on nama and rupa, mind and body, we have six bases. Depending on these six
    bases, because of them, there is contact, the sixth factor in the circle. Contact - in
    Pali, <i>phassa</i> - impression, impingement. Contact means there is contact between an
    external sense object and the appropriate sensory surface, or sense base. For example,
    when a visible object and the sensitive surface of the eye, the eye base, are at a correct
    distance and there is proper light, then contact between the two arises, the visible
    object impinges on the sensitive surface of the eye. Similarly with sounds and ear base.
    In the Abhidhamma it is fully explained how it works with forms and sight, and so on.
    Because of the five sense-doors, and mind-door, because of these bases, or doors, we have
    contact. When something touches the physical body, then contact arises via the body-door
    (touch); that is phassa, contact.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now because of contact one feels, feeling arises, the
    seventh factor in the circle. When there is contact with an object of touch via the
    body-door, one feels. If the touch is smooth one may have a pleasant feeling, if the touch
    is rough or coarse one may have an unpleasant feeling, a neutral feeling, and so on. So
    because of feeling contact arises- in Pali, <i>phassa paccaya</i> <i>vedana</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Looking at the circle on the board we can see that
    avijja-sankhara are the past period. From vinnana (rebirth consciousness) to vedana
    (feeling) inclusive, these five are the present period. Because of the past we are born in
    this life, to begin with. rebirth consciousness; because of which there is mind and body;
    and because of body there are the six bases; because of the six bases there is contact;
    and because of contact feeling arises. These five in the present life come as a result of
    avijja-sankhara, our past actions, and are shown on the chart as the present resultant
    section.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When pleasant feeling arises, liking arises, 'I like it',
    greed arises, craving - tanha - the eighth factor in the circle. It is due to feeling that
    craving arises; without feeling greed cannot arise. When we see something, hear something.
    if it is pleasant, 'Ah' I like it, I must have it, I cannot do without it', pleasant
    sights, sounds, and so on, mostly selfish desire or wish for self. Then what about
    unpleasant feeling? In Paticcasamuppada, when greed arises depending on feeling, how can
    we have greed for something which we dislike? The answer to this question is given in
    Visuddhimagga. In the case of unpleasant feeling, say one is ill, sick, one has a very
    painful ache, still greed arises because we have a desire to get out of that pain, to be
    free from that unpleasant feeling; so, craving arises either way, following pleasant or
    unpleasant feeling.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people who are poor would like to be rich, this is
    desire. Some rich people desire to be richer; so, greed by the poor, greed by the rich.
    The more one gets the more one wants, more greedy really. This greed, this desire in this
    present life does not belong to the resultant section which ends at vedana, we go on now
    to the new thing, the new activity, doing. committing. producing that which is the cause
    of our future. From these activities, as a result of them, so our future will manifest
    itself. Thus tanha, craving, is new, fresh activity, the commencing factor in this period
    shown on the chart as the present causal section.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To repeat - because of the past, avijja-sankhara, we have
    five present resultants: vinnana, nama-rupa, <i>salayatana</i>, phassa and vedana.
    Nama-rupa, as you know, is counted as one factor. So we are here, enjoying our past, the
    result of our past action, and now we are going to do new things. If we try to stop going
    round this wheel, to get out of this circle, we shall have to become without tanha,
    craving, greed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once tanha has arisen then attachment follows, in Pali
    upadana; that is the ninth factor in the circle. The difference between tanha (craving,
    greed) and upadana (attachment) - in English it is very clear - tanha is light desire,
    upadana is deeply rooted, we are attached. Greed is not attached, does not reach the state
    of attachment, it is just ordinary desire, wish.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Following attachment <i>bhava</i>, becoming, arises; the
    tenth factor in the circle. <i>Tanha paccaya upadana</i>, <i>upadana paccaya bhava</i>.
    What does it mean, becoming? Becoming means we are starting. acquiring new, fresh <i>kammic</i>
    energy for future life. <i>Bhava</i> has two aspects:<i> kamma-bhava</i>, action
    cumulative of resultant, and <i>upapatti-bhava</i>, resultant tending towards rebirth. In
    other words, because of our craving and attachment we act, now, do present actions (<i>kamma-bhava</i>),
    which means we are preparing for future birth, rebirth (<i>upapatti-bhava</i>).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore tanha, upadana and <i>bhava</i> also belong to
    the present period but not as resultants due to actions in the past, but as present
    actions causing, giving rise to the future. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we have said, by way of our present actions, doings. we
    are preparing for future birth, rebirth, and so we come to the eleventh factor in the
    circle, <i>jati</i>. <i>Jati</i> means born, arises. When we have finished this life then
    the next birth will come. What will be born, what will arise? When the next birth comes
    the five factors shown in the chart here as the present resultant section will, one after
    another, arise, that is: vinnana, nama-rupa, salayatana. phassa, vedana., but instead of
    saying these five we use only the one word, <i>jati</i>, born, meaning the beginning of
    the future life. So the future result means that mind, body, bases, contact and feeling,
    these five will be born.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus <i>jati</i> means the beginning of this life. The
    twelfth factor in the circle, however, <i>jaramarana</i>, means the end of one's life, <i>jara</i>
    meaning old age, gradually, and <i>marana</i>, death. As a natural sequence there are some
    other states such as <i>soka</i> - soka means sorrow, because we have been born we are
    subject to sorrow - lamentation, pain, grief and despair will arise as a result of birth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, altogether we see here twelve factors. Two, avijja
    and sankhara, belong to the past; five, from vinnana to feeling, belong to the present as
    a result of the past; tanha, upadana and <i>bhava</i> belong to the present, causing the
    future;<i> jati </i>and <i>jaramarana</i> belong to the future, resulting from present
    causes. From <i>jati</i> to <i>jaramarana</i>, just two things mentioned here, but it
    means these five here on the chart, the five factors in the present resultant section,
    from vinnana to vedana. The combination of these five factors are called man and woman,
    and it is these five which are born, die and are reborn in interminable continuity because
    of present actions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, the time is up. I usually give three talks on
    Paticcasamuppada, for to cover all the points in one talk is impossible; what I have said
    gives only a very brief, most brief outline. To conclude our talk, my talk, I should like
    to mention the real teaching of the Buddha, the advice of the Buddha to get out of this
    wheel of life. If we do not follow it we shall go round and round, without a limit</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To unmask the great illusion is the labour of man, so the
    Buddha advised us to get rid of our ignorance, to get rid of our masks of delusion,
    illusion. To stand in equilibrium in the midst of worldly things is the way of the Buddha.
    To contemplate life, but never to be enmeshed within worldly life is the law of the
    Buddha; not to be attached, tangled in the whirlpool of life, worldly life. To go forth
    out of worldly life into higher and spiritual life is the advice of the Buddha. To be
    absorbed into the reality, the supreme bliss of Nibbana is the end of the Buddhist way of
    life. </font></p>
    <hr>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><b>31. <em>NIBBANA</em></b>
    </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Nirvana</i>, which is the Sanskrit form of the Pali
    word Nibbana, is a combination of 'ni' and 'vana', 'ni' being a negative particle, and
    'vana' meaning lusting or craving. It is called Nibbana, for it is a departure from that
    craving; or it may also be defined as the extinction of greed, hatred and ignorance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The whole world is in flames', says the Buddha. By what
    fire is it kindled? It is kindled by the fire of greed, hatred and ignorance, by the fire
    of birth, old age, death, pain, lamentation, sorrow, grief and despair.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It should not be thought that Nibbana is a state of
    nothingness or annihilation just because we cannot conceive it with our worldly knowledge;
    a blind man cannot say that light does not exist just because he is unable to see it.
    There is the story, too, of the fish who argued with his friend the turtle, asserting
    triumphantly that there was no such thing as land. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nibbana of the Buddhists is neither a mere nothingness nor
    a state of annihilation, but exactly what it is no words can adequately express. It is a
    dhamma which is uncreated and unformed, hence it is boundless, to be sought after, happy,
    because it is free from all suffering, free from birth, death and so on. Nibbana is not
    situated in any place, nor is it a sort of heaven where a transcendental ego resides, it
    is a state which is dependent upon ourselves.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">THE PATH TO NIBBANA</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">How is Nibbana to be attained? It is by following the
    Noble Eightfold Path. which consists of morality (sila), concentration (samadhi) and
    wisdom (panna).</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>To refrain from all evil,<br>
      To do what is good.<br>
      To cleanse one's mind,<br>
      This is the teaching of all the Buddhas.</b></font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">DISCIPLINES</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Sila</i>, or morality, is the first stage on the path
    to Nibbana. One should not kill or cause injury to any living creature, one should be kind
    and compassionate towards all, even the tiniest creature that crawls at one's feet.
    Refraining from stealing anything, we should be honest in all our dealings. Abstaining
    from sexual misconduct which debases the exalted nature of man, we should be pure and
    chaste. Shunning false speech we should be truthful. Avoiding intoxicating drinks which
    promote heedlessness, we should be sober and diligent.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the spiritual man finds these five precepts too
    elementary he may advance a step further and observe the eight or even ten precepts.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It will be noticed that as the spiritual man proceeds on
    this highway he is expected to live a life of celibacy, simplicity and self-control, lest
    vigour and well-being might encourage indolence, and worldly bonds might impede his
    progress. While the spiritual man progresses slowly and steadily it is naturally easy for
    him to practise the four kinds of higher sila, namely, discipline as prescribed by the <i>Patimokkha</i>,
    sense restraint, purity of conduct connected with livelihood, and conduct in connection
    with the necessaries of life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having trodden the ground of sila, the progressing
    spiritual man reaches the practice of samadhi, the culture of the mind, the second stage
    of this path. Samadhi is concentration of the mind at will on one object.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third stage on the path to Nibbana is insight (panna)
    which enables the spiritual man to see things as they truly are. With one pointedness of
    mind he looks at the world to get a correct view of life, seeing nothing but the three
    characteristics. anicca (impermanence), dukkha (suffering) and anatta (soullessness),
    wherever he casts his glance. He does not find any genuine happiness in the world, for he
    sees that every form of pleasure is only a prelude to pain. Whatever is impermanent is
    painful, thus where change and sorrow prevail there cannot be permanent happiness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The advancing spiritual man then takes one of the above
    three characteristics which appeals to him most, and intently keeps on developing insight
    in that particular direction until he realizes Nibbana for the first time in his life.
    Having at this ariyan stage destroyed the first three of the ten fetters, namely,
    self-illusion (<i>sakkyaditthi</i>), doubts (vicikiccha) and indulgence in rites, rituals
    and ceremonies, he is called a sotapanna, one who has entered the stream that leads to
    Nibbana; he has forever escaped the states of woe, and is assured of final enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><em><font face="Times New Roman">More than any earthly power.<br>
    More than all the joys of heaven.<br>
    More than rule o'er all the world<br>
    Is the entrance to the Stream.</font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, since he has not destroyed the will to live, he
    will be reborn as a human being seven times at most if he does not make quick further
    attainment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Being encouraged by the result of this distant glimpse of
    Nibbana the spiritual man develops deeper insight, and weakening two more fetters, sense
    desire (<i>kamaraga</i>) and illwill (<i>patigha</i>), he becomes a <i>sakadagami</i>, a
    once returner. He is called this because he will be reborn on earth only once more if he
    does not attain <i>arahatship</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he reaches the third ariyan stage the spiritual man
    is called an anagami (never returner), at which stage he completely destroys the above two
    fetters. Hereafter he does not return to this world, for he has no more desire for worldly
    pleasures, and after death he is reborn in the Pure Abodes (<i>Suddhavasa</i>), a place
    which is exclusively for <i>anagamis</i> and from whence they will become arahatta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now the earnest spiritual man, encouraged by the great
    success of his endeavours, makes his final advance, and destroying the remaining fetters,
    namely, desire for life in the Realm of Form (<i>ruparaga</i>), desire for life in the
    Formless Realm (<i>aruparaga</i>), conceit (<i>mana</i>), distraction (<i>uddhacca</i>)
    and ignorance (avijja), he becomes a perfected saint by attaining arahatship. In this
    fourth supramundane stage he is called an <i>arahat</i>, one whose heart becomes free from
    sensual passion, free from the passion for existence and free from ignorance. He realizes
    that rebirth is exhausted, the holy life is fulfilled, and what was to be done has been
    done; this is the highest, holiest peace, the eradication of greed, hatred and ignorance.
    The arahat stands on heights more than celestial, realizing the unutterable bliss of
    Nibbana. He no more arises, no more passes away, no more trembles and no more desires;
    there is nothing in him to cause re-arising. Because he arises no more, he will not grow
    old; growing old no more he will not die again; dying no more he will not tremble, and
    trembling no more he will not desire. Hence the purpose of the holy life does not consist
