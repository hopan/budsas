    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="6">S</FONT>it up straight (with all the vertebrae of the spine
    fitting together snugly). Keep your head upright. Direct your
    eyes towards the tip of your nose so that nothing else is
    seen. Whether you see it or not doesn't really matter, just
    gaze in its direction. Once you get used to it, the results
    will be better than closing the eyes, and you won't be
    encouraged to fall asleep so easily. In particular, people
    who are sleepy should practice with their eyes open rather
    than closed. Practice like this steadily and they will close
    by themselves when the time comes for them to close. (If you
    want to practice with your eyes closed from the start, that's
    up to you.) Still, the method of keeping the eyes open gives
    better results. Some people, however, will feel that it's too
    difficult, especially those who are attached to closing their
    eyes. They won't be able to practice with their eyes open,
    and may close them if they wish.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Lay the hands in your lap, comfortably, one on top of the
    other. Overlap or cross your legs in a way that distributes
    and holds your weight well, so that you can sit comfortably
    and will not fall over easily. The legs can be overlapped in
    an ordinary way or crossed, whichever you prefer or are able
    to do. Fat people can only cross their legs in what is called
    the &quot;diamond posture&quot; (lotus posture) with
    difficulty, but fancy postures are not necessary. Merely sit
    with the legs folded so that your weight is evenly balanced
    and you cannot tip over easily -- that's good enough. The
    more difficult and serious postures can be left for when one
    gets serious, like a yogi.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In special circumstances -- when you are sick, not feeling
    well, or just tired -- you can rest against something, sit on
    a chair, or use a deck chair, in order to recline a bit.
    Those who are sick can even lie down to meditate.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sit in a place with good air circulation, where you can
    breathe comfortably. There should be nothing overly
    disturbing. Loud noises which are steady and have no meaning,
    such as the sound of waves or a factory, are no problem
    unless you attach to them as a problem. Sounds with meaning,
    such as people speaking, are more of a problem for those just
    learning to practice. If you can't find a quiet place,
    pretend there aren't any sounds. Just be determined to
    practice and it will work out eventually.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Although the eyes are gazing inattentively at the tip of
    the nose, you can gather your attention or awareness or <em><strong>sati</strong></em>
    [<A HREF="#n1">1</A>]<A NAME="1"></A>, as it's called in our technical language, in order to
    catch and note your own breathing in and out. (Those who like
    to close their eyes will do so from here on.) Those who
    prefer to leave the eyes open will do so continually until
    the eyes gradually close on their own as concentration and
    calmness (samadhi) increases.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the beginning (and only at the beginning, for a few
    minutes, not forever!), to make it easy to note the
    breathing, try to breathe as long as you can. Force it in and
    out strongly many times. Do so in order to know clearly for
    yourself what the breath rubs against or touches as it draws
    in and out along its path. In a simple way, notice where it
    appears to end in the belly (by taking the physical
    sensations as one's measure rather than anatomical reality).
    Note this in an easy-going way as well as you can, well
    enough to fix the inner and outer end points of the
    breathing. Don't be tense or too strict about it.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Most people will feel the breath striking at the tip of
    the nose and should take that point as the outer end. (In
    people with flat or upturned noses the breath will strike on
    the edge of the upper lip, and they should take that as the
    external end.) Now you will have both outer and inner end
    points by fixing one point at the tip of the nose and the
    other at the navel. The breath will drag itself back and
    forth between these two points. Here make your mind just like
    something which chases after or stalks the breathing, like a
    tiger or a spy, unwilling to part with it even for a moment,
    following every breath for as long as you meditate. This is
    the first step of our practice. We call it &quot;chasing
    after (or stalking) the whole time.&quot;</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Earlier we said to begin by trying to make the breathing
    as long as possible, and as strong, vigorous, and rough as
    possible, many times from the very start. Do so in order to
    find the end points and the track the breath follows between
    them. Once the mind (or sati) can catch and fix the breathing
    in and out -- by constantly being aware of how the breath
    touches and flows, then where it ends, then how it turns back
    either inside or outside -- you can gradually relax the
    breathing until it becomes normal no longer forcing or
    pushing it in any way. Be careful: don't force or control it
    at all! Still, sati fixes on the breathing the whole time,
    just as it did earlier with the rough and strong breathing.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sati is able to pay attention to the entire path of the
    breath from the inner end point (the navel or the base of the
    abdomen) to the outer end point (the tip of the nose or the
    upper lip). However fine or soft the breath becomes, sati can
    clearly note it all the time. If it happens that we cannot
    note (or feel) the breath because it is too soft or refined,
    then breathe more strongly or roughly again. (But not as
    strong or rough as before, just enough to note the breath
    clearly). Fix attention on the breathing again, until sati is
    aware of it without any gaps. Make sure it can be done well,
    that is, keep practicing until even the purely ordinary,
    unforced breathing can be securely observed. However long or
    short it is, know it. However heavy or light it is, know it.
    Know it clearly within that very awareness as sati merely
    holds closely to and follows the breathing back and forth the
    whole time you are meditating [<A HREF="#n2">2</A>]<A NAME="2"></A>. When you can do this it
    means success in the level of preparation called
    &quot;chasing after all the time.&quot;</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Lack of success is due to the inability of sati (or the
    attention) to stay with the breathing the whole time. You
    don't know when it lost track. You don't know when it ran off
    to home, work, or play. You don't know until it's already
    gone. And you don't know when it went, how, why, or whatever.
    Once you are aware of what happened, catch the breathing
    again, gently bring it back to the breathing, and train until
    successful on this level. Do it for at least ten minutes each
    session, before going on to the next step.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The next step, the second level of preparation, is called
    &quot;waiting (or guarding) in ambush at one point.&quot;
    It's best to practice this second step only after the first
    step can be done well, but anyone who can skip straight to
    the second won't be scolded. At this stage, sati (or
    recollection) lies in wait fixing at a particular point and
    stops chasing after the breathing. Note the sensation when
    the breathing enters the body all the way (to the navel or
    thereabouts) once, then let go or release it. Next, note when
    the breathing contacts the other end point (the tip of the
    nose) once more, then let go or leave it alone until it
    contacts the inner end point (navel) again. Continue like
    this without changing anything. In moments of letting go, the
    mind doesn't run away to home, the fields, the office, or
    anywhere. This means that sati pays attention at the two end
    points -- both inner and outer -- and doesn't pay attention
    to anything between them.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you can securely go back and forth between the two
    end points without paying attention to things in between,
    leave out the inner end point and focus only on the outer,
    namely, the tip of the nose. Now, sati consistently watches
    only at the tip of the nose. Whether the breathing strikes
    while inhaling or while exhaling, know it every time. This is
    called &quot;guarding the gate.&quot; There's a feeling as
    the breathing passes in or out; the rest of the way is left
    void or quiet. If you have firm awareness at the nose tip,
    the breathing becomes increasingly calm and quiet. Thus you
    can't feel movements other than at the nose tip. In the
    spaces when it's empty or quiet, when you can't feel
    anything, the mind doesn't run away to home or elsewhere. The
    ability to do this well is success in the &quot;waiting in
    ambush at one point&quot; level of preparation.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Lack of success is when the mind runs away without you
    knowing. It doesn't return to the gate as it should or, after
    entering the gate, it sneaks all the way inside. Both of
    these errors happen because the period of emptiness or quiet
    is incorrect and incomplete. You have not done it properly
    since the start of this step. Therefore, you ought to
    practice carefully, solidly, expertly from the very first
    step.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Even the beginning step, the one called &quot;chasing
    after the whole time,&quot; is not easy for everyone. Yet
    when one can do it, the results -- both physical and mental
    -- are beyond expectations. So you ought to make yourself
    able to do it, and do it consistently, until it is a game
    like the sports you like to play. If you have even two
    minutes, by all means practice. Breathe forcefully, if your
    bones crack or rattle that's even better. Breathe strongly
    until it whistles, a little noise won't hurt. Then relax and
    lighten it gradually until it finds its natural level.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The ordinary breathing of most people is not natural or
    normal, but is coarser or lower than normal, without us being aware [<A HREF="#n3">3</A>]<A NAME="3"></A>. Especially when we do certain activities or are in
    positions which are restricted, our breathing is more or less
    course than it ought to be, although we don't know it. So you
    ought to start with strong, vigorous breathing first, then
    let it relax until it becomes natural. In this way, you'll
    end up with breathing which is the &quot;middle way&quot; or
    just right. Such breathing makes the body natural, normal,
    and healthy. And it is fit for use as the object of
    meditation at the beginning of <em><strong>anapanasati</strong></em>
    [<A HREF="#n4">4</A>]<A NAME="4"></A>. Let us stress once more that this first step of
    preparation ought to be practiced until it's just a natural
    game for every one of us, and in all circumstances. This will
    bring numerous physical and mental benefits.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Actually, the difference between &quot;chasing after the
    whole time&quot; and &quot;waiting in ambush at one
    place&quot; is not so great. The latter is a little more
    relaxed and subtle, that is, the area noted by sati
    decreases. To make this easier to understand, we'll use the
    simile of the baby sitter rocking the baby's hammock [<A HREF="#n5">5</A>]<A NAME="5"></A>. At
    first, when the child has just been put intp the hammock, it
    isn't sleepy yet and will try to get out. At this stage, the
    baby sitter must watch the hammock carefully. As it swings
    from side to side, her head must turn from left to right so
    that the child won't be out of sight for a moment. Once the
    baby begins to get sleepy and doesn't try to get out anymore,
    the baby sitter need not turn her head from left to right,
    back and forth, as the hammock swings. The baby sitter only
    watches when the hammock passes in front of her face, which
    is good enough. Watching only at one point while the hammock
    is in front of her face, the baby won't have a chance to get
    out of the hammock just the same, because the child is ready
    to fall sleep (Although the baby will fall asleep, the
    meditator should not!).</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The first stage of preparation in noting the breathing --
    &quot;chasing after the whole time&quot; -- is like when the
    baby sitter must turn her head from side to side with the
    swinging hammock so that it isn't out of sight for a moment.
    The second stage where the breathing is noted at the nose tip
    -- &quot;waiting and watching at one point&quot; -- is like
    when the baby is ready to sleep and the baby sitter watches
    the hammock only when it passes her face.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you have practiced and trained fully in the second
    step, you can train further by making the area noted by sati
    even more subtle and gentle until there is secure, stable
    concentration. Then concentration can be deepened step by
    step until attaining one of the <em><strong>jhanas</strong></em>
    [<A HREF="#n6">6</A>]<A NAME="6"></A>, which, for most people, is beyond the rather easy
    concentration of the first steps. The jhanas are a refined
    and precise subject with strict requirements and subtle
    principles. One must be strongly interested and committed for
    that level of practice. At this stage, just be constantly
    interested in the basic steps until they become familiar and
    ordinary. Then you might be able gather in the higher levels
    later.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">May ordinary lay people give themselves the chance to
    meditate in a way which has many benefits both physically and
    mentally, and which satisfies the basic needs of our
    practice, before going on to more difficult things. May you
    train with these first steps in order to be fully equipped
    with sila (morality), samadhi (concentration), and panna
    (wisdom), that is, to be fully grounded in the noble
    eightfold path. Even if only a start, this is better than not
    going anywhere. Your body will become more healthy and
    peaceful than usual by training in successively higher levels
    of samadhi. You will discover something that everyone should
    find in order to not waste the opportunity of having been
    born.</FONT></p>

      <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><em><A NAME="n1"></A>[1] <strong>Sati</strong> is a
        key term in Buddhist meditation. It means &quot;recall,
        recollection, awareness, attention, mindfulness.&quot;
        All of these concern the present and do not involve
        memory or thought. In this article, the activity of sati
        is conveyed through a number of verbs: to fix, to note,
        to attend, to pay attention, to be aware, to experience.
        (Sati does not mean &quot;to concentrate or focus.&quot;)
        Please study these various words and their meaning in
        each context, then you will have a correct understanding
        of sati, namely, what it is and how to use it to get free
        of dukkha. [<A HREF="#1">^</A>]</em></FONT></p>
      <p><em><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><A NAME="n2"></A>[2] Don't try to push other things out of
        awareness, that will create tension. Just keep your
        attention centered on the breathing in a balanced way.
        Let go of anything that takes you away from the breathing. </FONT></em><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><em>[<A HREF="#2">^</A>]</em></FONT></p>
