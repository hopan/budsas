    <p>Vinaya is the name for the body of monastic rules and
    traditions that are binding on every Buddhist monk and nun.
    The Vinaya was established by the Buddha himself and is now
    preserved in written form, both in the ancient Indian
    languages and in English translation.</p>
    <p>With so many new people having come into the Society in
    the last few years, many of our members and friends know very
    little about the rules of discipline of the monastic
    community. It is important for the lay community to have an
    understanding of these rules to ensure that we do not behave
    in any way which is offensive to the Sangha nor which could
    create difficulty for them. We have therefore decided to
    reprint a series of articles in this and forthcoming
    newsletters, which were written by Ajahn Brahm a number of
    years ago.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b><i>Ownership and Administration
    of Monasteries:</i></b></font></p>
    <p>In the time of the Buddha, when a lay Buddhist offered
    lands of buildings, or money for such things, to establish a
    monastery, they would dedicate it to <b><i>The Sangha of the
    Four Quarters Present and Yet to Come</i></b><i>. </i>The
    Sangha of the four quarters present and yet to come means ALL
    properly ordained monks and nuns. This would include all
    legitimate Buddhist monks and nuns, of all nationalities and
    sects. Today it would probably include most Chinese Mahayana
    monks and nuns (bhiksus and bhiksunis) but it would exclude
    some Tibetan lamas and most Zen roshis, the married ones at
    least! Thus the owners of the monastery are the worldwide and
    &quot;timewide&quot; community of monks and nuns.</p>
    <p>The administrators of the monastery were those monks or
    nuns who lived there. They would meet regularly to make any
    decisions concerning their monastery and all such decisions
    had to be unanimous. But there are many rules of Vinaya which
    restrict what the resident monastics may do, in order to
    safeguard the monastery from corrupt monks. For example, they
    can't decide to give Sangha property away (unless it is
    trifling), nor to divide up the goods among themselves, (then
    disrobing, selling up, and moving to Majorca!). The community
    at a monastery is bound to preserve and maintain in good
    order all Sangha property, holding it in trust for the
    monastics now and in the future.</p>
    <p>In large monasteries, and some had thousands of monks and
    nuns, the community would delegate some of its
    responsibilities to competent monks and nuns. Thus there
    would be a monk in charge of allocating lodgings, and one in
    charge of building and maintenance. Ven. Maha Moggalana, one
    of the Buddha's two chief monk disciples, was perhaps the
    most effective of the building monks. Once the Buddha
    commissioned him, with the assistance of 500 monks, to build
    the grandiose dwelling called the &quot;Migaramatu
    Pasada&quot; at Savatthi, with funds donated by the foremost
    female lay disciple Visakha. This monastic dwelling had two
    stories, each with 500 rooms pinnacled with gold! Because of
    Ven. Maha Moggalana's psychic powers (they didn't have cranes
    and bulldozers then) it took only 9 months to complete. It
    makes our efforts at Bodhinyana look puny.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, in the time of the Buddha, the resident
    monastic community ran their monastery in every respect,
    maintaining it in good order for the benefit of all monks and
    nuns, now and in the future. And monastics did get involved
    in the building, although only now and again. The famous
    monasteries in ancient India, such as the Jeta Grove outside
    of Savatthi where the Buddha spent 19 rains retreats, were
    owned by the Sangha and run by the monks -- there was no
    Buddhist Society of Savatthi! Then there was no need.</p>
