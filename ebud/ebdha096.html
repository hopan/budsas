    <p align="left"><font FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Ordained at age twelve in Kandy, Sri
    Lanka, the Venerable Henepola Gunaratana trained as a novice for eight years and as a
    bhikkhu (monk) for seven years before leaving Sri Lanka in 1954 to work with untou</font>chables
    in India. In 1968 he came to the United States and became the Honorary General Secretary
    of the Buddhist Vihara Society, an urban monastery in Washington, D.C., while earning a
    Ph.D in Philosophy from The American University, where he later served as the Buddhist
    chaplain. He has been teaching Buddhism throughout the world for over forty years. His
    books include <i>Mindfulness in Plain English</i> from Wisdom Publications. In 1988,
    Bhante Gunaratana became President of the <a HREF="http://www.bhavanasociety.org/"
    target="_blank"><strong><em>Bhavana Society</em></strong> </a>in High View, West Virginia,
    a center to promote meditation and the monastic life. This interview was conducted for <i>Tricycle</i>
    by Helen Tworkov at the Bhavana Society last November (1994). <i>Bhante</i> is a Pali word
    equivalent to <i>Reverend</i> in English. <br>
    &nbsp; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>Nowadays, in the West, many people find that hierarchical
  distinction between the monastics and the laity outdated, old fashioned; something that
  developed in Asia but that has no place in the West.</i> </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>The monastic path is better, not in a political sense or as a
  power structure, but better for spiritual growth. Monasticism nourishes, supports a frame
  of mind for practice. If you want to live in a non-monastic community, it cannot be called
  monastic, and you cannot expect to do the practice in the best way. Life today has so many
  commitments, and people get into very difficult situations, emotionally and otherwise.
  Everyone has so many things to do. You have to have a space to grow, to improve your
  spiritual practice. That is why the Buddha said, &quot;Have few duties.&quot; When you
  have few duties, you have time to practice, you are not all the time tense, uptight, and
  nervous, worrying and destroying your health. </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>Are there ways of encouraging a monastic life in modern times?</i> </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>To update the monastic tradition, people don't have to be
  totally cut off from their societies. Even in monastic lives, there are certain things
  that people can do in order to make it more lively. In early days, monastic life seems to
  have been very grueling, very dark. The monks sat under trees or in caves and meditated
  all the time. One of the accusations that we get here from some very strict monastics is
  that we are too relaxed. Not that we have lost sight of monasticism, but that we try to
  update it by making certain adjustments. </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>Such as?</i> </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>We drive if necessary. Sometimes we go shopping if there is
  nobody else to go.<b> </b>And we have monks and nuns living in the same place. As long as
  we maintain our discipline and rules, these adjustments are possible. Sometimes people
  say, all religious principles, not only monastic principles, are out of date.. Morality is
  no longer an important issue in some places, some societies, because people do not want to
  discipline themselves. They do not want to be responsible, honest, sincere. But honesty,
  sincerity, responsibility never become out of date. We want to preserve the essence.
  Compromise doesn't mean to throw the baby out with the bath water. Every rule prescribed
  by the Buddha is for our own benefit. Every precept we observe is in order to cleanse the
  mind. Without mental purification, we can never gain concentration, insight, wisdom, and
  will never be able to remove psychic irritations. </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>In the West there is a pervasive psychological perspective which
  suggests that celibacy is unhealthy and therefore that monasticism attracts not people
  inspired by a spiritual quest, but those with sexual problems.</i> </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>At the same<b><i> </i></b>time, we can see that people who
  are obsessed with sex are always in trouble. Everywhere. Getting involved in all these
  natural urges and giving in to them is also not healthy. Somebody who very carefully,
  mindfully trains himself to restrain himself, too discipline himself, can live a very
  healthy life. People try to justify greed, hatred, and delusion. Many people become
  gullible. </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>Gullible?</i> </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>You know, &quot;gullible&quot; is a very beautiful Pali word.
  In Pali, it is called <i>galibaliso</i>. <i>Gali </i>means swallow, <i>baliso</i> means
  bait. When you have the attitude that you don't have too discipline yourself, that
  whenever you feel a sex urge, you can go and have sex with anybody<b> </b>you like; that
  when you get angry<b><i>, </i></b>you can<b> </b>express it any way you want, and even use
  violence if you like. These kinds of attitudes lead society downhill. I feel that is what
  is happening. Trying to introduce discipline, sincerity, honesty, religious practices, and
  so forth,&nbsp; that kind of work has become like trying to stop a stream with a piece of
  paper. Our mind is like liquid.&nbsp; Liquid always goes down, it never goes up by itself
  by its own force. Similarly, the mind always goes to the wrong thing. This is why the
  Buddha said the real practice of dhamma is like &quot;going upstream.&quot; Not an easy
  job. </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle:<i> </b>Is that just as true in or out of the monastery?</i> </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>Yes, but the sole purpose of monasticism is too give a chance
  to people to discipline themselves. It is like a laboratory. We don't want every nook and
  corner to have laboratories, but there have to be <i>some </i>laboratories, some sort
  controlled atmosphere for a person to grow in if that person really wants to be
  disciplined for the sake of<b> </b>his or her own inner peace. America is still like a
  teenager, a juvenile, just trying to grow, and that spiritually immature state has been
  taken as a standard for the whole world to follow. I don't think that is a healthy way of
  thinking. Only when we attain our state of responsibility and freedom are we all equal.</p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b>We <i>are not born equal?</i> </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>We are not born equal, are not created equal. We are divided
  by kamma. We are born different, and live different, and die different, because of our
  different kamma. Kamma divides us into high and low, rich and poor, intellectual and
  non-intellectual, attractive and non-attractive, skillful and non-skillful, and so forth.
  But when somebody comes to the order of monks and nuns, they give up their distinctions
  and become equal. When they attain stages of enlightenment, they all are equal. There is
  no difference in the attainment of enlightenment. When we attain nibbana, we all are
  equal. &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>The Theravada tradition has a long history of inequality between
  the sexes, even within the realm of spiritual understanding. In fact, it is my
  understanding that women cannot attain full ordination in your tradition.</i> </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>That is an adjustment that l would like to
  propose.&nbsp;&nbsp; We've had a problem introducing fully ordained nuns into the order.
  It has become a very big controversy because many women would like<i> </i>to<b><i> </i></b>enter
  the Theravada nuns' order and receive full ordination, but that has not been possible so
  far. </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>Where is the opposition coming from to day?</i> </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>From the Theravada Buddhist school. &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>Because of the traditional ways?</i> </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>Yes. Actually, the tradition for fully ordained women once
  existed, but disappeared. &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>How are Theravada nuns ordained now?</i> &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>It is not a full ordination, but a novice ordination. In a
  country like the United States, where Buddhism is still new, full ordination for women
  should be established. &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>What do your brothers in Sri Lanka think about your supporting
  this? Do they think, &quot;Oh, maybe he has just spent too much time in the West'?</i>
  &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>[laughing] Yes. Yet in in one famous discourse, the <i>Kalama
  Sutta, </i>the Buddha says, &quot;Don't believe in tradition, don't believe in mere
  hearsay. Don't accept anything because things are in the scriptures. Don't accept anything
  because the teacher appears to be a very honorable, sincere person. Don't accept anything
  because it<b> </b>appeals to intellect, to logic or philosophy. Don't accept anything
  because you like it. Check with your own experience, investigate, discuss, meditate upon,
  and question. And then, if what you learned is good for yourself, good for others, good
  for both, then accept it. If it is not good for you, not good for others, not good for
  both&nbsp; reject it.&quot; So the freedom of<b> </b>inquiry is very strongly advocated by
  the Buddha. And, therefore, using that information, I make these suggestions. &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>I'm sure that many women in the West and in Asia will be very
  appreciative of this view. And yet, even in those societies that sanction full ordination
  for women, the rules for women are still twice as many as for men, and the women are still
  considered inferior to the men. Even here, I have observed that the men leave the
  meditation hall before the women, and that they are served food first.</i> &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>We don't have fully ordained nuns. The women here are all
  novices. In monastic hierarchy, whoever has stayed in the order the longest is considered
  to be the senior-most person, and that person leads the group. He goes first. He sits
  first and so forth. The hierarchy is established only by seniority. &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>If&nbsp; full ordination of nuns were reestablished, would you also
  support full equality between men and women?</i> &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana:</b> I support it. I support it. Fully ordained nuns should be
  able to do the same things as fully ordained monks. That's the kind of equality I support.
  The Buddha introduced extra rules for women, because without giving some concessions,
  without introducing some rules, there would have been an enormous upheaval and opposition
  coming from other monks as well as lay people. To silence them, he introduced these
  regulations. But in modern society these things can be modified. &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>Can the changes you recommend be adapted in Asia?</i> &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>My hunch is that in Asia full ordination will never happen
  because the tradition, the habit, is so strong. The only possibility exists in societies
  like this one, where Buddhism is new. Once it is established here then perhaps slowly it
  can be introduced to Asian Buddhist communities. </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>What are the things that you think should not be adjusted, that you
  think must not change?</i> &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>Dhamma can be translated into simple, modern, language. But
  the meaning should not be changed to suit people's requirements. Some aspects of the
  rituals can change, but for instance, wearing robes must not change. Even in the time of
  the Buddha, civilian dress was quite different from monks' robes. And it is the same
  today. This robe protects us. As human beings we are not perfect. And when we have the
  robe, it reminds us of our place, and stops us from getting into wrong situations,
  wrongdoing. &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>Other Theravada communities have altered certain traditions, such
  as chanting only in Pali, or not eating after twelve noon; why have you chosen to preserve
  these rituals?</i> &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>If you do not preserve the form of Theravada Buddhism, the
  original form, eventually people won't even know what it is. </p>
  <p><i><b>Tricycle: </b>What most distinguishes the Theravada tradition from the other
  great vehicles of Buddhism?</i> &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>The Theravada tradition tries to maintain the Buddhism
  present in the<b> </b>Pali texts. It emphasizes morality, concentration, and wisdom
  practice as close to the Buddha's own teaching as possible without interpreting them,
  distorting them, or translating them into different ideas. As Theravada Buddhists, we are
  trying to preserve the Pali language and use it in our dhamma sermons, in our daily
  devotional services. </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>And the benefit is maintaining the language of the Buddha?</i>
  &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>Yes. The benefit is that when you<b> </b>have any doubt about
  the teaching, any gray area, you can always go to the Pali. And always you keep Pali as<b>
  </b>your reference language in order to clarify certain dhamma terms. If you do not have
  that kind of background, or that kind of reference, you have to rely on translations. If
  the translator has made a mistake, it is<i> c</i>arried on generation after generation.
  That is what has happened to some<b> </b>other branches of Buddhism. Because they don't
  study the original language, they have to read the third, fourth, fifth interpretations,
  or translations, and sometimes they lose track of the original teaching. Original teaching
  is preserved in the Pali tradition. No question about it. </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>Many people feel that the absence of the Bodhisattva Vow in
  Theravada,&nbsp; the vow to save all sentient beings and to place others before
  oneself&nbsp; diminishes the role of compassion that we find in some of the other
  traditions. Can you address that?</i> &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>You know, while<i> </i>we are trying to attain enlightenment,
  we must help others. We cannot wait. Suppose we are going on a journey, and somebody on
  the way needs some help. Food, water, or somebody is sick and so forth. We cannot simply
  say, ''Oh, I am going on a journey, you have to wait until I finish the journey.&quot; You
  cannot say that. You've got too help that person. That is your human, moral obligation.
  That is what the Buddha did. He became perfect by doing what he was supposed to do. He
  practiced in human society, with other people. Teaching, preaching, helping, serving, and
  doing everything that he had to do to help the world. And that helping, that practice,
  reached perfection. We don't have to wait until we have attained enlightenment. &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle:</b> <i>Do you think that some Westerners misunderstand Theravada Buddhism
  because of the absence of an actual Bodhisattva Vow?</i> &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>Exactly. Although Theravada Buddhists don't have any special
  Bodhisattva Vow, in practice it is almost impossible to ignore helping others. And you
  know, this idea of helping others is not only Buddhist. Is there anything Buddhist in
  generosity? You don't even have to be a human being to practice generosity. You might have
  seen animals sharing their food with other animals. To make this kind of distinction
  between Mahayana and Theravada is not a very practical, realistic way of seeing things.
  The challenge is making people understand the basic teachings, like selflessness,
  soullessness, and non-believing in a creator god. The first aspect, impermanence, is
  really easy. If you read any book on physics, chemistry, or science you will learn all
  about impermanence. But selflessness and not believing in a creator god,<i> </i>these two
  are extremely difficult to teach. </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>Can a society as a whole become a little less egotistical, or is it
  only at matter of individual practice?</i> &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>It is individual practice, actually. Even when the Buddha
  attained enlightenment, greed, hatred, and delusion were not less than they are today. His
  sole purpose in attaining enlightenment was to serve the world. But as soon as he attained
  enlightenment, he became so disappointed. He thought, &quot;How can l teach this dhamma to
  these people? They are so full of ignorance, greed, hatred, jealousy, fear, tension,
  worry, and lust, how can they understand this?&quot;&nbsp; But he started teaching. And he
  was never able to eliminate all the suffering in the human world. Never. He eliminated the
  suffering of certain people, but compared to the number of people in the world, the number
  of people he helped to attain enlightenment is insignificant. Now, with more population,
  more desirous things produced by technological advancement, more things to promote your
  desire, promote your greed, selfishness, fear, tension, worry, it is actually more
  difficult to practice pure dhamma. And this is not just the problem of the dhamma,&nbsp;
  the teaching of the Buddha.&nbsp; It is the problem of all religions. Religious people are
  trying as<i> </i>much they can in their own limited capacities. At the same time, in the
  material world other people are trying to promote their own productions, increase people's
  greed. There are more televisions, more computers, more this, more that. So you have to
  compete with this. &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>How can the dhamma best be protected in this environment?</i>
  &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>One who protects the dhamma will be protected by the dhamma,
  just like one who protects an umbrella will be protected by the umbrella. To protect the
  dhamma, what should one do? Each and every individual must practice it. To the degree and
  extent that a person practices dhamma, to that degree and extent that person gets
  protection from the dhamma. We can never get protection from anything else, no matter how
  much security, or insurance, or how many secure locks we have,.. never. &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Tricycle: </b><i>Do you have a particular goal for yourself?</i> &nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>Bhante Gunaratana: </b>I say that Buddhism is like a tree. A tree has its canopy,
  leaves, flowers, you know, little branches, and the trunk, and the bark, and softwood and
  hardwood, the roots, and so forth. And we should want the hardwood, the pit of the dhamma,
  just like wanting the pit of a tree. Everything else can conceal the truth. There are so
  many things around the true dhamma. And people can easily get deluded, confused, misled by
  those very many, many varieties of things. The Buddha said very clearly, &quot;Until
  artificial gold appears in the market, pure gold shines. As soon as the artificial gold
  appears in the market, nobody knows which is pure gold, and which is artificial.&quot; So
  I want to show people this pure gold, so that they cannot be deluded by everything that
  glitters. That is my purpose. </p>
