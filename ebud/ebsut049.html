        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What follows is an abbreviated English
        translation of a talk by the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw of Myanmar on the <i>Ariyaavaasa
        Sutta </i>(Discourse on the Abode of the Noble Ones). The <i>sutta </i>was
        preached by the Buddha himself and takes its name from the fact that the
        Ariyas, that is, the Noble Ones at their respective stages on the Eight
        fold Path, have dwelt in the past, are dwelling in the present, and will
        go on dwelling in the future, in a safe haven of their own, ever mindful
        of and practising the <i>Ariyaavaasa dhammas </i>(norms or ideals).
        These <i>dhammas</i>, are ten in number and may be enumerated as:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) doing away with the five <i>angas </i>(limbs
          or members),<br>
          (2) accomplishment or fulfilment of the six <i>angas,<br>
          </i>(3) presence of a sentinel at the gate,<br>
          (4) possession of the four dependences,<br>
          (5) renunciation of religious beliefs external to the Buddhist faith,<br>
          (6) giving up all forms of seeking,<br>
          (7) unclouded (clear) aspiration,<br>
          (8) attainment of the &quot;breathless&quot; state (the fourth <i>jhanic
          </i>state)<br>
          (9) a mind free from defilments, and<br>
          (10) the knowledge that liberates.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of these ten, Nos. (3), (9) and (10) are
        the most important from the point of view of Buddhist awakening and
        Deliverance. They are concerned with the principles and practice of <i>Satipa.t.thaana
        Vipassan </i>(Insight) Meditation, a subject to the active promotion of
        which the Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw has so selflessly dedicated his life and
        labour. The sentinel at the gate of No. (3) is none other than
        Mindfulness, the very foundation of <i>Satipa.t.thaanaa Vipassanaa </i>Meditation.
        The emancipated mind and the knowledge that liberates of Nos. (9) and
        (10) are the resultant benefits or rewards of deligent and substained
        meditative effort.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The message of this Sutta is loud and
        clear. </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">Let those who can,
        emulate the example of the Noble Ones and seek their release from the
        bondage of <i>Samsaric </i>suffering!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although in this talk and in talks on
        other suttas the Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw never fails to stress the practice
        aspect of the Buddha's teaching, he has made available for us relevant
        and significant excerpt from the mine of scriptural learning that is so
        richly his. It may fairly he said that in every one of his talks, he
        virtually traverses the entire field of the Buddha dhamma so far as the
        essential and pragmatic approach to the supreme Buddhist goal of <i>Nibbaana</i>
        through <i>Satipa.t.thaanaa Vipassanaa </i>Meditation is concerned.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The talk was translated into English by
        U Aye Maung, formerly of the editorial staff of Sarpaybeikman Institute
        and author of &quot;The Buddha and Creed&quot;. The translation is in
        conformity with the five guidelines laid down by the Scriptural
        Committee of the Buddha Sasana Nuggaha Organisation.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="01"></a>01. Introduction</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The subject-matter of this book is the
        Buddha's discourse on the Dhamma in the <i>Ariyaavaasa </i>sutta of the <i>Anguttara-nikaaya</i>.
        A sutta contains the Buddha's teaching and we make it a practice to be
        strictly guided by the suttas when we convey the message of the Dhamma
        to lay people.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In <i>Ariyaavaasa-sutta, </i>the Buddha
        says: &quot;O bhikkhus! The <i>Ariyaavaasa-dhammas </i>or the abode of
        the Noble Ones are of ten kinds. The Noble Ones have dwelt in these
        abodes before, they are still dwelling there and they will dwell there
        in the future.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ariyaa means the Noble One; avasa means
        the abode and so <i>Ariyaavaasa </i>means the abode of the noble Ones.
        There are eight kinds of Ariyas, viz., the first four Ariyas each of
        whom has attained one of the four stages on the holy path; and the other
        four Ariyas each of whom has attained the fruition (<i>phala)</i>
        corresponding to one of the four stages.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As to the first four of these Ariyas,
        i.e., <i>Magga-ariya </i>or Ariyas on the path, it is hard to point out
        clearly what kind of persons they are. For the duration of their
        spiritual climax is a single thought-moment. With the full attainment of
        insight-knowledge, the yogi has a flash of Nibbaana on Ariyan level and
        because of this split-second experience he is called the Magga-person at
        that moment. Then there follows the experience of <i>Ariyapphala </i>(fruit)
        consciousness and from that time he is called the phala-person are the
        only yogis whom we can clearly point out as Ariyas. <b>[<a href="#top">^</a>]</b></font></p>
        <b><font color="#7f0000">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="02"></a>02. Two kinds of
        bhikkhus</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>Ariyaavaasa-sutta </i>is
        addressed to bhikkhus. There are two kinds of bhikkhus, viz., the <i>sutta-bhikkhu
        </i>and the <i>vinaya-bhikkhu</i>. The <i>sutta-bhikkhu </i>is,
        according to the commentaries, any person who practises the Dhamma to
        get liberated from the cycle of life (<i>sa&quot;msaara)</i>. He is not
        necessarily a member of the <i>Sangha, </i>for he may be a <i>deva </i>or
        a layman.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The practice of the Dhamma enables the
        yogi to overcome defilements. Through the practice of morality, the yogi
        seeks to overcome active defilements (<i>vitikkama kilesaa)</i> such as
        greed, hatred, etc. that lead to killing, stealing and other misdeeds.
        The yogi who develops concentration (<i>samaadhibhaavanaa)</i> overcomes
        the arousal of greed, hatred, etc. that always lie in our consciousness
        (<i>pariyutthaana kiilesa)</i>. Finally the yogi overcomes potential or
        dormant defilments (<i>anusaya kilesaa)</i> through the development of
        insight-knowledge and wisdom. Every moment of mindfulness means the
        gradual destruction of latent defilements. It is somewhat like cutting
        away a piece of wood with a small axe, every stroke helping to get rid
        of the unwanted fragments of wood. Whenever the yogi focuses on the
        psycho-physical phenomena arising from sense-contact with the external
        world, the defilements become weak and impotent. Such a yogi is the
        bhikkhu of <i>sutta pitaka</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>vinaya-bhikkhu </i>is the monk
        who leads a good life based on <i>vinaya </i>rules. In the time of the
        Buddha the Lord himself ordained some of them by saying, &quot;Come
        hither, bhikkhus.&quot; Most of them, however, were ordained by the
        Sangha in accordance with <i>vinaya </i>rules.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhu referred to in <i>Ariyaavaasa
        sutta </i>is the <i>sutta-bhikkhu</i>, a term that applies to any human
        being, <i>deva </i>or Brahmaa who practises the Dhamma.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha preached the <i>Ariyaavaasa
        sutta </i>in order that we might live in the abode of Ariyas, safe,
        secure and protected from the perils of <i>sa&quot;msaara.</i> The
        perils of <i>sa&quot;msaara </i>(round of rebirth) are more terrifying
        than those that beset a man who does not live in a well-protected house.
        They follow us from one existence to another. One may land in the lower
        world as a <i>peta </i>or an animal and suffer for many years or one may
        be reborn as a poor, wretched man who has to face many hardships for a
        living as well as the universal evils of life viz, old age, sickness and
        death. These are the perils of <i>sa&quot;msaara</i> that repeatedly
        engulf those who do not live in the abode of Ariyas or in other words,
        who do not practice <i>Ariyaavaasa dhamma</i>. <b>[<a href="#top">^</a>]</b></font></p>
        <b><font color="#7f0000">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="03"></a>03. Ten </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">Ariyaavaasa
        Dhamma</font></p>
        </i></font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are ten <i>Ariyaavaasa dhamma. </i>The
        first <i>Ariyaavaasa dhamma </i>is the removal of the five hindrances.
        The second is the control of the six senses. The third is the presence
        of a guard or mindfulness. The fourth is the yogi living in the abode of
        Ariyas should have four supports. The fifth <i>dhamma </i>is that the
        yogi must have renounced all the false doctrines (<i>paccekasacca)</i>
        that do not accrod with the nature of life although they claim monopoly
        of truth. The sixth <i>Ariyaavaasa-dhamma </i>calls upon the yogi to
        give up all pursuits. The pursuit of something means lack of
        self-sufficiency whereas giving up all pursuits is a sign of
        non-attachment and self-fulfilment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The seventh <i>dhamma </i>insists that
        the mind of the yogi who dwells in the Ariya abode is not confused but
        is clear and pure. The eight dhamma is the possession of quiet bodily
        functions (<i>passaddha kaaya sankhaara)</i>. <i>Kaayasakhaara </i>here
        means in-and-out breathing. So this dhamma requires the yogi to seek the
        fourth <i>jhaana </i>that leads to the cessation of in-and-out
        breathing. But this shows only that the fourth <i>jhaana</i> is a
        spiritual experience that may appeal to some yogis. The main point is
        the need to become an <i>Arahata </i>with the extinction of all
        defilments. For there are persons who have become <i>Arahats </i>without
        attaining the fourth <i>jhaana</i>. The ninth and tenth <i>Ariyaavaasa
        dhammas </i>are a fully liberated mind and fully liberated knowledge or
        the knowledge that one is fully liberated from defilments. These two
        dhammas are linked together. Once the mind is totally liberated, there
        follows the awareness of such a total liberation. <b>[<a href="#top">^</a>]</b></font></p>
        <b><font color="#7f0000">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="04"></a>04. The Guard of
        Mindfulness</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We will begin with the third <i>dhamma, </i>that
        is mindfulness which is the key to the understanding of <i>Ariyaavaasa-sutta</i>.
        Mindfulness is essential to the practice of <i>Ariyaavaasa dhamma</i>.
        It forms the chief attribute of the Arahat. The commentary says that the
        Arahat is mindful even while he is asleep. Here it refers to mindfulness
        just before the Arahat falls asleep and just after he wakes up. It is
        impossible for him to be mindful while sound asleep. What we should note
        specially is that the Arahat is always on his guard whenever he acts,
        speaks or thinks.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness not does develope suddenly
        only after the attainment of Arahatship. It develops gradually as a
        result of previous effort and practice. It is fairly well established at
        the <i>anaagaami </i>stage before the yogi becomes an Arahat and this is
        due to self training at the <i>sakadaagaami </i>stage. At this latter
        stage, too, the yogi possesses mindufulness since the foundation for it
        is laid at the <i>sotaapanna </i>level.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">A <i>sotaapanna</i>, that is the yogi at
        the first stage on the noble path is not yet free from craving,
        ill-will, hatred, ignorance and conceit. But his unwholesome
        inclinations are not strong enough to lead him to killing, stealing,
        etc. He is mindful and this mindfulness keeps him on his guard. The
        Buddha says: &quot;<i>A sotapanna </i>avoids doing misdeeds that lead
        him to the lower worlds. Therefore he no longer takes life.&quot; So you
        should have faith in the Buddha and meditate seriously.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you have made some progress in
        meditation, you will find what mindfulness means. At the sight of a
        desirable object you crave for it and in the face of something offensive
        you become angry. For you are not yet free from these unwholesome
        emotions. But your mindfulness stands you in good stead and helps
        restrain them. They lose their momentum and wither away. They are not
        beyond control as in the case of common people. They are not strong
        enough to make a <i>sotaappanna </i>capable of doing evil. <b>[<a href="#top">^</a>]</b></font></p>
        <b><font color="#7f0000">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="05"></a>05. <i>Satipa.t.thaana</i>
        Method</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hence the importance of mindfulness in
        the spiritual training of the yogi on the <i>Ariyan </i>path. Practice
        in mindfulness should begin at the time when the yogi is still a
        worlding. The practice of contemplating all psycho-physical phenomena
        that arise from six senses is <i>Satipa.t.thaana </i>(the four
        applications of attentiveness) <i>Satipa.t.thaana </i>means full
        awareness of all physical and mental events that occur. It can be easily
        practised too. We teach this method simply as did the Lord Buddha.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>Gacchanto vaa gacchaamiti
          pajaanaati.<br>
          </i>&quot;Know that you are walking when walking.&quot;</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the simple instruction of the
        Buddha in the <i>Satipa.t.thaana </i>sutta. It does not present any
        difficulty and say that one should know the fact of walking after
        analysing the inner corporeality, consciousness and so forth. The
        instruction is so simple that everyone can follow it in his meditation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people insist that the yogi should
        avoid saying, &quot;I walk&quot; mentally as it implies some sort of ego
        belief.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are three different views of the
        ego or self. The first is the belief in self as the soul-entity. The
        second is the view of self based on conceit and pride, while the third
        is the self as a conventional term for the first person singular as
        distinct from other persons. The self or &quot;I&quot; implicit in the <i>Paa.li</i>
        word &quot;<i>gacchami</i>&quot; has nothing to do with illusion or
        conceit. It is a term of common usage that is to be found in the sayings
        of the Buddha and Arahats.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we instruct the yogis to make a note
        of all phenomena in conventional terms, that is, for example, to note
        &quot;walking&quot; whenever they start walking. But as concentration
        develops, all these conventional usages disappear and there remains only
        the reality of everything arising-and-passing away. <b>[<a href="#top">^</a>]</b>

        <b><font color="#7f0000">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="06"></a>06. Initial Doubt</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people who have never meditated may
        have some doubt and no wonder for only seeing is believing and their
        skepticism is due to their lack of experience. I myself was a skeptic a
        one time. I did not then like the <i>Satipa.t.thaana </i>method as it
        makes no mention of <i>naama-ruupa, anicca, anatta </i>and so forth. But
        the Sayadaw who taught the method was a learned monk and so I decided to
        give it a trial. At first I made little progress because I still had a
        lingering doubt about the method which, in my view, had nothing to do
        with ultimate reality.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was only later on when I had followed
        the method seriously that its significance dawned on me. I realized then
        that it is the best method of meditation since it calls for
        attentiveness to everything that is to be known, leaving no room for
        absent-mindedness. So the Buddha describes the <i>Sati-pa.t.thaana</i>
        method as the only way: </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">Ekaayanomaggo.

        Concentration</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the outset the yogi treats the
        sense-data as the raw material for his meditation and makes a note of
        &quot;walking&quot; &quot;bending&quot;, etc. Then as concentration
        develops, he becomes aware of all the psycho-physical phenomena arising
        from the six senses. Finally he is mindful only of the ceaseless passing
        away of the sense-object and the knowing consciousness. Thus he finds
        nothing that is permanent, pleasant and worthwhile, nothing that gives
        ground for the ego-belief.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">At our meditation-center the yogi begins
        the exercise in mindfulness by making a note of the rising and falling
        of the belly when he breathes in and out. Later on he notes all mental
        events such as thinking, feeling, imaging, etc. The yogi who
        stead-fastly keeps his mind occupied in this way can in due course
        become aware of all physical and mental events that occur whenever he
        sees, hears, etc. He is then in step with the ideal of <i>Ariyaavaasa </i>sutta
        which stresses the need for self-possession and mindfulness : </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">Sataarakkhena

        knowledge</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our method of meditation does not
        prepsuppose a thorough knowledge of <i>naamaruupa, anicca </i>and other
        Buddhist concepts. For our main object is to attain insight-knowledge
        which is accessible only to empirical approach. Through experience, the
        yogi observes the distinction between mind and matter and he realizes
        the impermanence of everything. Experience may be followed by
        explanation on the part of the teacher but not the other way round. For
        real knowledge has nothing to do with preconceived notions but is based
        on personal experience.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The empirical knowledge acquired by the
        yogi is distinct and clear. He sees nothing except the vanishing of
        everything. This is called <i>bhanga - </i>insight about which he learns
        not from scriptures or a teacher but by experience. As he keeps on
        meditating, he becomes more and more mindful until his mindfulness
        becomes perfect at the last stage on the noble path.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness is a matter of great
        importance. It tends to develop concentration and sharpen the intellect.
        It means being on one's guard and dwelling in the abode of Ariyas that
        protects us from the dangers of <i>sa&quot;msaaric - </i>existence. In
        order to dwell in the Ariyaan abode you have to pay the price in terms
        of fath, will and effort.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is impossible to do anything without
        faith or conviction. You will practise mindfulness only if you believe
        that it will help to develop insight-knowledge. But faith in itself will
        not do. You need, too, a strong will and unrelenting effort to attain
        the path and <i>Nibbaana. </i>Possession of these qualities is essential
        to success in the practice of mindfulness and security in the abode of <i>Ariyas</i>.

        </i></font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness even for a few moments
        ensures protection from <i>sa&quot;msaaric</i> dangers as is evident in
        the story of <i>Tambadathika</i>.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tambadathikka </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">was
        a public executioner in the life-time of the Buddha. On the day of his
        retirement he was about to drink milk-gruel when there appeared <i>thera
        Saariputta </i>who had come apparently in search of food. Because of his
        strong faith <i>Tambadathika </i>promptly offered the milk-gruel. After
        drinking it, the <i>Thera </i>gave a talk on alms-giving, morality,
        insight-meditation and the Noble Path. <i>Tambadathika </i>could not
        follow the talk very well because he became stricken with remorse when
        he thought of his evil deeds in the past. He told the <i>Thera </i>about
        his unhappiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Questioned by the <i>Thera</i>, <i>Tambadathika
        </i>said that he did not do the evil deeds of his own free-will, that he
        had to carry out the king's order. &quot;In that case,&quot; asked <i>Sariputta</i>
        &quot;would those evils be of your own making?&quot; This question was
        cleverly designed to ease his conscience. His anxiety being thus laid to
        rest, he was able to reflect on the <i>thera's </i>sermon and at last he
        attained a kind of insight-knowledge called <i>anuloma~naa&quot;na</i>. <i>Dhammapada
        </i>commentary identifies it with the higher stage of equanimity. It is
        said that the <i>bodhisattas</i> in the holy order practised meditation
        till they attained <i>anuloma~naa&quot;na</i>, but theirs is not the <i>anuloma~naa&quot;na</i>
        of the path process (<i>magga-vithi)</i>. The attainment of <i>anuloma~naa&quot;na
        </i>of the path process means outright attainment of the path and its
        result (<i>phala)</i>. The spiritual development does not end with the
        attainment of <i>anuloma~naa&quot;na</i>. Moreover, a <i>bodhisatta </i>can
        attain the goal of the path only in his last life when he is about to
        become a Buddha. He cannot attain it in early lives. So the <i>anuloma~naa&quot;na</i>
        attributed to the <i>bodhisattas </i>is the advanced stage of equanimity
        knowledge and the same may be said of the insight attained by <i>Tambadathika</i>.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tambadathika </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">became
        mindful as a result of his spiritual experience. Before long he was
        gored to death by a cow. His death formed the subject of conversation
        among the <i>bhikkhus</i>. The <i>bhikkhus </i>were much surprised when
        the Buddha told them that the man was reborn in <i>Tusita </i>heaven,
        that in spite of his evil deeds in the past, his mindfulness during the
        last moments of his life had protected him from the dangers of the lower
        worlds.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through practice, mindfulness may become
        spontaneous as in the case of <i>Dhanaa~njaanii</i>, a lay follower of
        the Buddha. She was told by her husband not to say anything to extol the
        Buddha while his brahmit teachers were being entertained. Yet when she
        tripped, she at once uttered thrice the sacred formula: &quot;<i>Namo
        tassa bhagavato - </i>Praise to the Blessed One, etc.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness in the face of suffering or
        death is very important since it helps to lessen pain and ensure good
        rebirth. The yogi who seeks to develop it requires four supports. In the
        first place he needs clothes, food, medicine and dwelling. He needs them
        not because of his craving for pleasure but because they form the basic
        necessities of life. To deny oneself these necessities of life means
        asceticism which was practised by some non-Buddhist sects in ancient
        India. In fact the <i>bodhisatta </i>himself resorted to it, but later
        on he gave it up as he realized that it served no purpose. The Buddha's
        way is the middle way between asceticism and attachment to sensual
        pleasure.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second support for the yogi is the
        fortitude of mind with which he contemplates physical and mental pain.
        He is prepared to face hardship or even death for the attainment of
        insight-knowledge. Meditation does not do any harm to health; on the
        contrary it is beneficial as is borne out by some yogis who regained
        their health after meditating for some time. There is the case of a
        woman who practised mindfulness and got rid of a growth in her womb,
        thereby making it unnecessary for her to undergo an operation as advised
        by her doctor.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The yogi should bear pain as far as
        possible. &quot;Patience leads to <i>Nibbaana</i>,&quot; says a Myanmar
        proverb. If a meditating yogi fidgets impatiently whenever an unpleasant
        sensation occurs, he will not be able to concentrate and without
        concentration, he cannot attain insight-knowledge. So patience or
        fortitude is one of the supports of the yogi. <b>[<a href="#top">^</a>]</b></font></p>
        <b><font color="#7f0000">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="10"></a>10. Things to avoid</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third support of the yogi is
        avoidance. He should avoid all kinds of danger. He must not take
        unnecessary risk by goint to improper places. He should not allow his
        meditation to make him overconfident and foolhardy. He must be
        especially on his guard against close relationship with the opposite
        sex. In short, he should avoid all sense-objects that are likely to do
        harm to him physically or morally.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth support of the yogi is the
        rejection of unwholesome thoughts that tend to make him sensuous,
        malicious and aggressive. It is hard to overcome these evil thought as
        most of us like to think about objects and people that we love or hate.
        The yogi should watch these thoughts and reject them. It is not easy for
        some people to do so because before taking up meditation they used to
        let their mind wander freely. To watch every thought is of course
        burdensome to them but in fact it takes only two or three day's effort
        to establish the habit of watchfulness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again, foreigners who come to our
        meditation-center are fond of reading and writing which lead to
        discursive thinking and do not help to develop mindfulness. So we have
        to tell them not to read and write. They do not like this restriction
        but they get used to it in due course and find it beneficial to their
        mind-training. One such foreigner was Mr. Duval, an American who spent
        several months at the center. He was much impressed by the <i>Satipa.t.thaana
        </i>method that had halpped him to attain insight-knowledge and he
        thought it would also benefit many Westerners who have no inner peace in
        spite of their material prosperity. <b>[<a href="#top">^</a>]</b></font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="11"></a>11. The five hindrances</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is through constant mindfulness that
        the yogi seeks to remove the five hindrances or <i>nivaaranas, </i>viz.
        sensuous desire, ill-will, laziness, restlessness and doubt. They block
        the way to <i>Nibbaana </i>and so their removal is the first </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">Ariyaavaasa
        dhamma.</font></p>
        </i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sensuous desire is the desire for
        pleasant sense-objects such as sights, sounds, smells and so forth. Here
        the sense-object means not only the object that directly causes pleasant
        sensation but also other objects that are associated with it. Thus the
        object of sound refers to a man who speaks persuasively as well as to
        musical instruments. Smell as a sensuous object is represented by
        perfumes and human beings who use them. In short, all objects of desire
        are sensuous objects.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Love of pleasant sense-object is the
        case of conflict among people and nations. Yet modern man is excessively
        fond of sensual pleasure and to him it is the <i>summum bonum </i>of
        life, something that is to be sought by every possible means regardless
        of all moral considerations. Accroding to the Buddha, sensuous desire is
        like debt that keeps a man in bondage.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as the debtor has to be servile to
        the creditor, so also a man has to respect the object of his sensual
        desire. If it is a lifeless object, he must handle it with care and keep
        it under lock and key. If it is his wife who fuels his sensual desire,
        he has to avoid doing or saying anything that may displease her.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you have no desire, it means freedom
        from worry or anxiety about any desired object or living being. The best
        way to overcome desire is to watch it constantly. You should focus on it
        and trace it back to its source. If you thus focus on desire with
        persistence and strong will, it usually disappears and you are assured
        of a place in the Ariyan abode.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who are outside the Ariyan abode
        remain attached to sense-objects and sometimes this attachment spells
        disaster for them after their death. In the time of the Buddha a bhikkhu
        was so much attached to his robe on his death bed that after his death
        he became a louse in it. Such a story may be scoffed at by skeptics who
        argue that a tamarined seed can produce no tree other than a tamarind
        tree, that gold cannot revert to its former state of earth and that
        likewise man cannot be reborn as a lower form of life. This argument
        does not accord with the Buddha's teaching.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In fact there is no being and life means
        only the process of consicousness and corporeality. Of these two
        consciousness is the determining factor. So according to the doctrine of
        Dependent Origination, because of ignorance there arise karma-formations
        (<i>sa&quot;nkhaara)</i> which in turn lead to consciousness and so
        forth. Hence when a new life arises, it is not the corporeality of the
        previous life or its potency but the force of the consciousness that
        passes on.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover there is no such thing as big
        or small consciousness. The mind of an ordinary person does not differ
        basically from that of an animal. It may revert to a lower state as in
        case of a man who becomes insane or a victim of rabies. In short, there
        is no basis for the view that it is impossible for a man to sink to a
        lower plane of existence after death.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the pure mind of a dying person
        imbued with faith, good-will, etc ensures good rebirth whereas the
        defiled mind full of greed, hatred, etc. leads to the lower worlds. We
        need not wonder how consciousness manages to reach a far distant place
        like heaven or hell. Consciousness has no substance and so distance
        makes no difference to it. Death means the vanishing of the last
        thought-moment and the emergence of rebirth-consciousness. For the dying
        person the last state of consciousness is crucial, for if it is
        unwholesome it may lead to the lower world in spite of his good moral
        life.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hence the Buddha's instruction to the
        bhikkhus to have the right attitude towards food, robes, and dwellings.
        They should use them only to meet their physical needs and avoid sensual
        desire. One may also reflect on the impermanence and emptiness of most
        sensual objects to overcome attachment to them. But the best thing to do
        is to watch the arising of desires and reject them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This instruction is important also for
        the lay mena and women who have various attachments that are fraught
        with danger for their afterlife. They can be free from such danger
        through the practice of <i>Ariyaavaasa dhamma</i>. First they must have
        faith that is born of sound reasoning and a good knowledge of the
        Buddha's teaching. But the Buddha-dhamma insists on the need for
        empirical investigation as befits its attribute of &quot;<i>ehipassiko -
        </i>Come and see!&quot; So for the follower of the Buddha practice is of
        paramount importance.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most of the bhikkhus around the Buddha
        attained various stages of enlightenment because they practised <i>Satipa.t.thaana</i>
        meditation zealously. They never did or said anything unmindfully. Their
        calm and gentle manners impressed even the wandering medicants who did
        not follow the Buddha's teaching. One medicant, <i>Kandaraka</i> by name
        paid a high tribute to them for their poise and self-possession.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So did his companion, a lay man named <i>Pessa</i>.
        He appreciated the Buddha's teaching that had helped reform people who
        were given to deceit and hypocrisy. But he was so much preoccupied with
        his worldly affairs that he did not hear the Buddha's sermon to the end
        or practise the Dhamma thoroughly. There are other reasons why men like
        Pessa failed to attain any stage on the holy path. They lack good
        teachers and a good knowledge of the Dhamma. Association witha bad
        friend or a bad teacher is disastrous as in the case of prince <i>Ajaatasattu</i>
        who killed his father at the instigation of his teacher <i>Devadatta</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">A good teacher, a good friend and a good
        knowledge of the Dhamma will make a man realize the need for mindfulness
        as an antidote to defilements (<i>kilesaa)</i>. We must observe and note
        any sensation that arises from our contact with the external world. We
        should take note of the bodily sensation that we have when the body,
        hands, etc. make any movement. We should also be mindful of our mental
        processes. By taking note to all mental events we can guard ourselves
        against evil thoughts and emotions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although there are ten <i>Ariyaavaasa
        dhammas</i> mindfulness suffices to ensure the attainment of <i>Nibbaana</i>.
        In fact, it is the keystone of the Buddha's teaching. This is clearly
        borne our by the last saying of the Buddha which may be translated as
        follows.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Bhikkhus, here is my last advice
          to you; All compunded things are subject to disintegration. Work out
          your own salvation with mindfulness.&quot;</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">All compounded things (<i>Sa&quot;nkhaara)</i>
        are impermanent. Many people do not take this fact of life seriously. On
        the contrary they believe in their personal identity and the permanence
        of their ego. The average man believes that he can live for a long time
        with his life-force and body.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>Vaya dhammaa sa&quot;nkhaara
        appamaadena sampadetha</i>.&quot; Here <i>sakharaa </i>means all the
        conditioned psycho-physical phenomena; <i>vaya dhamme </i>means that
        they are by nature subject to decay. Liberation from the phenomenal
        existence that is conditioned, impermanent, and unsatisfactory means
        Nibbaana and the way to it lies in the Buddha's last words: <i>Appamaadena
        sampaadetha - </i>Practise till you achieve constant mindfulness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The commentaries describe this advice as
        the essence of the Buddha's teaching. It is indeed the keynote of <i>Ariyaavaasa
        sutta</i> that stresses he far-reaching importance of mindfulness.
        Through the practice of mindfulness the yogi attains the first stage on
        the holy path (<i>sotaapanna)</i> where he is free from coarse desire
        that leads to the lower worlds. At the second stage (<i>anaagaami)</i>
        he becomes wholly free from the desire for sense-objects. At the last
        stage (Arahatship) he has done away with all the refined desire for the
        material and the immaterial worlds. <b>[<a href="#top">^</a>]</b></font></p>

        Second Hindrance and others</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ill-will (<i>vyaapaada</i>) is the
        second hindrance on the holy path. It is like a disease that creates a
        distaste for good food and makes the sick man listless and apathetic.
        Ill-will makes us irritable, bad-tempered and suspicious. We do not
        trust even our friend who is on good terms with the man we dislike. A
        man who has ill-will should regard himself as suffering from a disease.
        Unless it is treated promptly, it may gain ground and lead to death.
        Likewise the effect of unrestrained ill-will may be disastrous as is
        evident in the newspaper reports of violent crimes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people may appear to have good-will
        as long as they find everything agreeable, but anything that they
        dislike usually leads to outburst of bad temper. The Buddhist scriptures
        cite the story of Vedehika, a housewife who was noted for her affable
        manners. Her slave-girl had misgvings, however, and so one day in order
        to test her mistress she purposely got up late from bed. Then the woman
        flew into a rage and showed her true character.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ill-will is the root-cause of discord,
        friction, quarrel, and unhappiness among mankind. We tend to have
        ill-will against our relatives, co-workers, neighbours, etc. and yet
        these are the very people on whom we have to rely for help in times of
        trouble.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So in order to ensure unity, harmony and
        mutual understanding, we should keep off the disease of ill-will. If the
        disease infects us, it should be promptly treated. When you become
        angry, note your anger mentally and do away with it. You should not let
        it affect your speech and behaviour. You should not utter more than one
        or two words in a fit of temper.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third hindrance on the path is sloth
        or laziness a lazy man does not seek to understand the Dhamma or to
        practise it. So he fails to make any spiritual progress and misses the
        insight-knowledge attained by the yogis who practise meditation
        vigorously. He does not even have any of the ecstasy that occurs to the
        meditating yogis. Of course ecstasy is not to be confused with the goal
        of meditation that transcends all varieties of experience in life. But
        the unique experience of insight-knowledge is not for lazy people.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth hindrance is restlessness and
        worry (<i>uddhacca kukkucca)</i>. Here restlessness means mindwandering
        while by worry we are to understand remorse over the mistakes we have
        made. Both these mental states should be removed since they form an
        obstacle to progress on the holy path.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last hindrance is doubt (<i>vicikicchaa)</i>.
        It is doubt about the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. A man who has
        much doubt usually hesitates and wavers so much that he does not
        accomplish anything. He may come to grief as do some people who do not
        act decisively in important matters. Opposed to doubt is faith which
        makes a yogi follow the instruction of his teacher that accords with
        Buddha-dhamma.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The yogi can contemplate any one of the
        five <i>khandhas </i>or the five groups of psychophysical elements
        comprising a human being. But it is better to start with the
        contemplation of the rising and falling of the belly. Both the rising
        and the falling indicate the element of motion. Motion or wind (<i>vaayo)</i>
        is one of the four primary elements. According to the commentaries,
        those who have not achieved tranquility (<i>samatha)</i> should begin
        with the four primary elements whereas the yogi in a tranquil state of
        mind can begin with (<i>jhaanic)</i> entranced consciousness. The other
        three primary elements are the quality of hardness (<i>pathavii)</i>,
        the quality of heat, cold or warmth (<i>tejo)</i> and the quality of
        liquidity or wetness (<i>aapo)</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We should begin meditation with what is
        obvious and easy. The Buddha himself pointed out a very easy method of
        meditation, viz., the contemplation of the four bodily posture. He told
        his disciples to be mindful of what they are doing. This advice is so
        easy to follow that some people do not take it seriously. They argue
        that since it makes no mention of (<i>naamaruupa)</i> etc, it has
        nothing to do with ultimate reality.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In one of his books Ledi Sayadaw says:
        &quot;When you walk, you should focus on every step that you take.&quot;
        This accords with the teaching of the Buddha: 'When you walk, you should
        know that you are walking.&quot; Although you merely note
        &quot;walking&quot;, you will realize, as your power of concentration
        develops, that the movement of the body is due to mind's desire.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You should also observe physical changes
        such as the rising and falling of the belly which can be clearly and
        easily noted. Some people have doubt about this practice. This is due to
        their lack of experience that corresponds to what their teachers have
        told them about the distinction between mind and body, the meanings of <i>anicca,
        dukkha, </i>etc. Lack of experience leads to doubt which forms one of
        the five hindrances.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The hindrances prevent good thoughts
        form arising. Good thoughts and evil thoughts do not occur together. You
        have goo, wholesome thoughts when you are mindful, and bad, unwholesome
        thoughts when you are unmindful. Unmindfulness is largely due to
        hindrance and so those who practise meditation are likely to be
        distracted by doubt, worry, desire and so forth. Some people do not wish
        to meditate because they count on their acts of alms-giving, observance
        of moral precepts and recitation of scriptures, etc., for the purity of
        their mind. But they are quickly disillusioned when they take up
        meditation for then they find themselves harassed by impure thoughts.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">An unmindful person cannot make himself
        morally pure for he is never aware of the true moral character of his
        thoughts. Sensuous desires, hatred, ill-will, etc., escape his notice.
        It is only through meditation that we can know whether the mind is pure
        or not, whether or not it is free from anger, greed, etc. Repeated
        introspection helps to purge the mind of its impurities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You have impurity of mind, when you are
        mindful. It is a mistake to think that one can attain it only when one
        enters trance (<i>jhaana)</i>. Purity of mind based on <i>jhaana </i>is
        due to the continuous stream of <i>jhaanic </i>consciousness. Purity of
        mind through meditation is the purity that emerges at the moment of
        attaining insight. Both kind of consciousness are alike in respect of
        purity of mind and freedom from hindrances.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our method of meditation begins with the
        practice of keeping the mind on the rising and falling of the belly. It
        accords with the Buddha's teaching: &quot;Rising refers to the physical
        or material <i>khandhaa</i>. <i>Vaayodhaatu </i>(element) is involoved
        in the material <i>khandhaa </i>and the characteristic mark of this
        element is strengthening.&quot; In the contemplation of mind and body,
        quantity and shape do not matter. Some yogis seek to focus on what they
        believe to be the combination of atomic particles in some shape. Shape
        is possessed only by the objects which have colour or which can be
        touched. <b>[<a href="#top">^</a>]</b></font></p>
        <b><font color="#7f0000">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="13"></a>13. Characteristics,
        Function, etc.</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Physical phenomena such as sound, smell,
        etc., may lend themselves to atomic analysis but the same cannot be said
        of mind and its elements. It is impossible to imagine greed, anger,
        etc., as particles. In point of fact, the yogi should focus only on the
        nature of a phenomena in terms of its characteristics, of a phenomenon
        in terms of its characteristics, (<i>lakkha&quot;na)</i> function (<i>rasa)</i>
        and resulting phenomenon (<i>paccua.t.thana)</i>. This is in accord with
        the instruction in <i>Visuddhi-maagga </i>(&quot;Path of Purity) and <i>Abhidhamma.t.thasangaha
        </i>(&quot;Compendium of Philosophy&quot;).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So you should focus on the rising and
        falling of the belly with reference to its function, etc., The marks of <i>vaayo-</i>element
        are rigidity, stiffness and looseness. These marks will escape your
        notice in the beginning for your have to attend to the hindrances and
        overcome them by repression. Constant practice of mindfulness helps to
        overcome them and with the mind free from them the stiffness and
        rigidity become obvious in the rising of the belly. So too the abdominal
        falling helps to emphasise the quality of looseness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The function of <i>vaayo </i>element is
        motion. <i>Vaayo </i>is air which moves from one place to another when
        its force is strong and remains still and rigid when the force is weak.
        You cannot watch rising and falling without being aware of motion. When
        you note the rising, you are aware of the gradual movent outward and in
        the case of falling, you become aware of the gradual movement inward.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The resulting phenomenon of <i>vaayo </i>element
        is the propulsion of things to wherever they tend. In the case of
        voluntary motion such as bending, the <i>vaayo </i>element tends in the
        direction in which the mind is inclined. There is inward motion when you
        bend your hand and outward motion when you stretch it. These two kinds
        of motions are apparent, too, in the rising and falling of the belly.
        The resulting phenomenon or <i>paccupa.t.thama </i>is any impression
        that occurs to our mind when we think of something.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">While watching the rising and falling,
        the yogi may have disagreeable feelings that arise from cramps, pain in
        the body, or heat. In connection with such feelings, the Buddha says:
        &quot;The monk is aware of the disagreeable feeling even as he
        experiences them.&quot; Here &quot;experience&quot; as a verb is the
        translation of the Pali word <i>vedayaami </i>in the text. Myanmar
        Buddhists do not say, &quot; I experience heat.&quot; Instead they say,
        &quot;It is hot&quot; etc., So the Myanmar yogi is instructed to make a
        mental note of the specific sensaion that he has, &quot;It is hot&quot;
        or &quot;It is painful&quot; and so on as the case may be.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this way the yogi becomes aware of
        painful feelings. Its function is to depress the spirit, its resulting
        phenomenon is the irritating sensation. Thus the yogi contemplates
        strain, ache, etc., and realize the nature of painful feeling on the
        basis of its characteristics, function, etc., The same way be said of
        pleasant feeling and indifferent feeling.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the characteristic of mind or
        consciousness to know its sense-object. Hence we have different kinds of
        consciousness each being dependent on different contact (seeing,
        hearing, etc.,) with different sense-objects, (sound, smell, etc.,).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The function of the mind is to lead its
        concomitants (attendant dhammas). The mind takes the initiative and is
        followed by greed or faith or doubt. The resulting phenomenon of mind is
        its connection with the preceding mental state. By contemplating his
        mental states, the yogi becomes aware of their impermanence and their
        arising one after another without cessation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If at the moment of seeing, you make a
        mental note of the event, you know that the eye and the colour are
        physical while the consicousness by way of sight is mental. The same may
        be said of the ear and the sound, the nose and the smell, the tongue and
        the taste, the body and the object of contact, each pair of these
        physical phenomena having their corresponding mental phenomena of
        sound-consciousness, scent-consciousness and so forth. The mental field
        of contact or touch-consciousness is very wide. Bending, stretching,
        walking, etc., all belong to it. <b>[<a href="#top">^</a>]</b></font></p>
        <b><font color="#7f0000">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="14"></a>14. Stages of
        Insight-Knowledge</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In taking a step, the feeling of
        lightness as you lift your foot indicates <i>tejo </i>(heat) element,
        tenseness and motion as you put your foot forward indicate <i>vaayo </i>(wind)
        element, the heaviness as you put the foot downward is <i>aapo </i>element
        while the friction and resistance at the moment of the impact of the
        foot on the ground reflect <i>pathavi </i>(earth) element. Thus the
        distinctive features of each of the four primary elements is evident.
        Whenever you observe the behaviour of your body, you distinguish between
        the body which does not know its sense-object and the mind which knows
        it. This is insight into the distinction between mind and matter.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Later on as concentration develops, the
        yogi becomes more aware of the nature of the phenomenal world. He finds
        that when he bends his hand, the bending is preceded by the desire to
        bend; that seeing arises on account of the eye and the visible object;
        that hearing, etc., are due to the corresponding sense-organs and
        sense-objects. It takes only a few days practice of mindfulness to
        realize that every phenomenon is made up of cause and effect, that there
        is no ego, person or being who creates it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the yogi knows analytically the
        beginning and end of each unit of psycho-physical phenomenon. The
        beginning is the arising and the end is the vanishing of an event. As he
        observes this ceaseless process of arising and vanishing, the yogi
        realizes the law of impermanence. Impermanence is the mark of the five
        khandhaa's or mind-body complex. It has two aspects, viz., the arising
        from a state of non-existence and coming into a state of momentary
        existence; and vanishing and passing away into a state of momentary
        existence and then into a state of non-existence.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This arising and passing away is the
        sign of impermanence. If a thing does not arise at all, it cannot be
        called impermanent. Such a thing implies the concept of <i>Nibbaana</i>
        which has no origination. Nor can we call a thing impermanent if it
        arises and exists forever. But there is no such things. Everything that
        has a beginning has also an end.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The insight into the law of impermanence
        leads the yogi to realize <i>dukkha</i> (suffering) and <i>anatta</i>
        (insubstantiality of life). These three marks of existence are
        intertwined and whenever we see anatta, we are close to <i>Nibbaana</i>.
        But there &quot;seeing&quot; anatta means not mere intellectual
        acceptance but insight-knowledge born of meditation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">After having insights into impermanence,
        etc., the yogi ceases to reflect and keeps on noting the psycho-physical
        phenomena. Then his consciousness deepens. He discriminates sharply
        between the beginning and the end of every phenomenon. He sees
        illumination and experiences joy, rapture, serenity, an upsurge of faith
        and heightened awareness. But the yogi should not mistake these blissful
        states for the peace of <i>Nibbaana</i>. He should note and overcome
        them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then as he continues to practise
        mindfulness, there comes a time when his consciousness is confined to
        ceaseless vanishing. When he contemplates an object, he no longer thinks
        of its shape or size or quality. He sees everything, the object,his
        mind, etc., passing away ceaselessly. This is called <i>bhanga~naa&quot;na</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because the yogi sees everything passing
        away, he is seized with fear (<i>bhaya~naa&quot;na)</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Fear leads to recognition of the evils
        of conditioned existence (<i>aadinavaa~naana</i>). So the yogi becomes
        sick of life (<i>nibbida~naana)</i>. Because of his disillusionment, he
        wants to be free (<i>mu~ncatukamyata~naana)</i> and to achieve his
        object he has to resort to special contemplation (<i>patiankhaanaa&quot;na)</i>.
        This results in the full comprehension of the three signs of existence,
        viz., <i>anicca, dukkha </i>and <i>anatta (sankhaanupekkha~naa&quot;na)</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">With the emergence of this insight, the
        yogi attains equanimity in regard to the six sneses, which the Buddha
        describes follows:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">- &quot;O monks, the monk who has seen
          a visible object with his eyes is neither pleased nor displeased. His
          mind is in equilibrium, being affected neither by attachment nor by
          aversion. This is because he has right mindfulness.&quot;</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Note that the <i>Paa.li</i> text refers
        to the monk who has seen the object. It makes no sense to speak of a
        yogi's equanimity in the absence of sense-objects that attract or repel
        him. In point of fact he is unperturbed in the face of sense-objects and
        this is due to his right mindfulness and insight into the nature of
        conditioned existence with its chief characteristics of anicca, dukkha
        and anatta.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>Cakkhunaa ruupa&quot;m disvaa </i>....Having
        seen the object, the monk recognizes it with clear or right
        understanding.&quot; Right understanding caues neither pleasure nor
        displeasure: it makes the yogi completely indifferent in his contact
        with the external world. This is the special attribute of the Arahat and
        as the commentary says, it is possible for the yogi to possess it. He
        can have it when he attains all the successive stages of
        insight-knowledge through whole-hearted effort.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some teachers of meditation tend to
        mis-lead their disciples by exaggerating the importance of their
        lectures. The yogi should not accept their words blindly. He should not
        regard himself, say, as a <i>sotaapanna, </i>on the authority of his
        teacher. Instead, he should examine himself on the basis of his
        experience and the Buddha's teaching. If he is a true <i>sotaapanna</i>,
        his experience leaves no doubt about the three signs of conditioned
        existence, the nature of <i>Nibbaana </i>and the other teachings of the
        Buddha. So he has unshakeable faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
        Sangha. He also strictly avoids killing, stealing, indulging in illicit
        sex, lying and drinking.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">These then are the four essential
        attributes of a <i>sotaapanna </i>and this teaching of the Buddha can
        help the yogi to decide whether he has attained the first stage on the
        path. A real <i>sotaapanna </i>has no desire to do evil. His moral life
        does not need self-restraint since it is spontaneous. In this respect he
        differs from the false <i>sotaapanna </i>whose morality is superficial
        and prone to back-sliding. <b>[<a href="#top">^</a>]</b></font></p>

        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The two important <i>Ariyaavaasa dhamma </i>that
        we have to consider now are those which all for the renunciation of
        false views about life after death. These views center on the ego that
        is supposed to survive death and take up its abode in another physical
        body and the belief that rejects any idea of an afterlife and insists on
        the annihilation of a living being by death. These two false beliefs can
        be overcome through the constant practice of mindfulness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Equally to be rejected by the yogi on
        the holy path are the two false pursuits, viz., persuit of sensual
        pleasure and the pursuit of life. The first puruit dominates the yogi
        until he attains the third stage on the path. The second pursuit is
        motivated by will-to-live. It does not end even at the third stage for
        there is still a lingering desire for immaterial existence. The yogi can
        overcome this attachment to life only on the attainment of Arahatship.
        He should therefore renounce the unwholesome pursuits and the false
        beliefs. He should follow the Nole Eightold Path that will free him from
        illusions and unwholesome desires.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The yogi should also seek the fourth
        state of <i>jhaana </i>with its cessation of out-and-in breathing. He
        will have to make special effort to attain it since it is not within the
        reach of every Arahat. It is exclusively meant for specially gifted
        Arahats. Still, if the yogi cannot make great effort, it will do as well
        for him to bypass the <i>jhaanic </i>state and seek Nibbaana. For when
        he attains <i>Nibbaana</i>, it makes no difference whether he is an
        ordinary Arahat or an Outstanding Arahat or a Buddha. <b>[<a href="#top">^</a>]</b></font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="16"></a>16. Self-knowledge</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last two essential attributes of the
        yogi who dwells in the Ariyan abode is (1) his mind is liberated from
        defilements and (2) he knows that he is so liberated. Full liberation
        means Arahatship and the Arahat is wholly free from attachment and
        restrictions associated with craving, hatred and ignorance. He is also
        independently aware of his freedom.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This awareness is not confined to
        Arahats. The <i>sotaapanna </i>knows, too, that he is relatively free
        from defilments. There are equlitative degrees of freedom, corresponding
        to the different stages of spiritual attainment. Thus at the first stage
        the yogi is free from doubt and ego-belief, and at the third stage he is
        free from senous desire and ill-will. But some ignorant yogis are often
        deluded into a false sense of freedom. For they continue to do evil,
        thereby giving the lie to their claim. They say that it is not improper
        for a <i>sotaapanna </i>to drink under certain circumstances. Their
        arguments are purely rationalizations for unwholesome desires.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But for the yogi who has really attained
        certain important stages on the holy path, the realization of freedom is
        not bookish knwoledge but a matter of independent insight. It is based
        on personal experience that leaves no doubt about its reality.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now to conclude. If the yogi sees <i>Nibbaana
        </i>with the eye of wisdom, he becomes at least a <i>sotaapanna </i>and
        he will never land in the lower worlds after his death. Therefore he
        should constantly contemplate everything that arises and guard his
        senses until he attains the first stage of liberation. He should of
        course continue the practice of mindfulness until he achieves
        Arahatship./. <b>[<a href="#top">^</a>]</b></font></p>
