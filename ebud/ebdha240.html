      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT>t<B> </B>is well-known that with 
      the rise of Buddhism in India there dawned the golden age of India’s 
      culture and civilisation. There was progress in all aspects of Indian 
      civilisation under the impact of Buddhism. This is very much in contrast 
      to what happened in the Roman empire in Europe with the rise of 
      Christianity. With the coming of Christianity into power the Dark Ages 
      dawned upon Europe. During this era whatever progress that was achieved by 
      the Greeks and the Romans received a set-back and came to a stand-still. 
      Schools and centres of philosophy were closed down. The famed library at 
      Alexandria was burnt down by a Christian mob led by a prelate. Hypatia the 
      learned philosopher and teacher was dragged into a Church and her flesh 
      was torn off her body. As a result of these barbarities Europe was plunged 
      into the darkness of ignorance and poverty for a thousand years. The Dark 
      Ages of European history was really the golden age of the Christian 
      Church, because it did the conversion of the barbarians to Christianity 
      during this time. The great philosophers and intellectuals of Europe who 
      left their mark on human civilisation were all pre-Christian pagans who 
      lived prior to the rise of Christianity, e.g. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, 
      Seneca, Pliny, etc. The Christian era was masked by an absence of such 
      men. Illiteracy and religious intolerance prevailed during the Dark Ages.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">At the end of this period the Muslims had conquered parts 
      of the Roman empire and established their rule in Spain, Portugal and 
      parts of France. They introduced the learning of the Greeks and Romans as 
      well as knowledge gathered from their contacts with India. This set the 
      pace for Martin Luther’s reformation which broke the power of the Catholic 
      Church. The ensuing liberal policies persuaded by the Protestants brought 
      about the Renaissance, after this the Europeans pushed back the power of 
      the Churches and began to make progress in civilisation.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">In contrast to this with the rise of Buddhism in India, 
      there arose many centres of learning which did not exist before. Buddhist 
      monks could opt for a life of meditation in the forests, or a life of 
      teaching, preaching, propagating the Dharma as a result of the activities 
      of the teaching monks, seats of learning arose. These seats of monastic 
      learning (Pirivenas) gradually developed and some of them became 
      full-fledged universities. As a result Buddhist India came to have five 
      major universities which achieved wide fame. These five were 1. Nalanda, 
      2. Vickramasila, 3. Odantapuri, 4. Jagadalala and 5. Somapura.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><STRONG>Nalanda University</STRONG></P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Nalanda is the best known of ancient India’s universities. 
      It’s site has been discovered and it’s ruins have been preserved by 
      India’s Department of Archeology. It is situated in Bihar State, the 
      ancient Magadha country. Magadha is well known as the cradle of Buddhism. 
      Bihar is so called because it had a large number of Viharas or Buddhist 
      monasteries. Nalanda was a prosperous city during the days of the Buddha. 
      He visited it during his preaching itineraries. When in Nalanda, the 
      Buddha sojourned at Ambavana the mango-park with his disciples. Nalanda 
      was also the home town of Ven. Sariputra, King Asoka had erected a Stupa 
      at the spot where he was cremated.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">We get a comprehensive account of Nalanda university from 
      Hieun Tsang the brilliant Chinese scholar who came there for his studies 
      during the reign of King Harsha-Siladitya. Back in China he wrote this 
      famed &quot;Ta - Tang - Si - Yu - Ki&quot; Buddhist Travels in the western world. 
      This has been translated into English by Samuel Beal a British scholar who 
      was once the ambassador to Peking, China.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">It has been called the treasure house of accurate 
      information by European Archeologists. They found the information given 
      there invaluable for them to locate the sacred shrines of the Buddhist in 
      India. Indians and their scholars were hopelessly ignorant of these places 
      and could do nothing to help the archeologists. I - Tsing (675-685) was 
      another Chinese monk who came to India and studied at Nalanda. He too like 
      Hiuen Tsang has left an account of his travels. In this he gives an 
      account of Nalanda and his stay there. At the time of Fa-Hion’s visit it 
      was an ordinary Buddhist monastery. Lama Taranata the Tibetan historian 
      also gives an account of Nalanda in his works.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">It appears that King Kumara Gupta (AC 415-455) built the 
      first monastery at Nalanda. It was a seminary for training Buddhist monks. 
      It’s site was not too for nor too close to the city. Hence it was selected 
      as an ideal centre for the pursuit of Buddhist studies by monks. Nalanda 
      University was an expansion and extension of this seminary. King Buddha 
      Gupta (AC 455-467) Jatagatha Gupta (AC 467-500) Baladitya (500-525) and 
      Vijra (525) made additions and expansions to the buildings. King Baladitya 
      made a shrine-room a house of worship which was 300 feet high. His son 
      Vijra built the fifth monastery. King Harsha Siladitya built the sixth 
      monastery and surrounded the university buildings with 9’ high wall. In 
      the 10th century when Hieun Tsang entered the university, there were 
      10,000 resident students. They came from all parts of India and foreign 
      lands. It was India’s leading University. It’s chancellorship was reserved 
      for India’s foremost Buddhist scholar when Hieun-Tsang visited Nalanda 
      Silabhadra Maha Thera held the post. At that time there were 10,000 
      students, 1510 teachers, and about 1,500 workers at Nalanda. Students from 
      foreign lands such as Tibet, China, Japan, Korea, Sumatra, Java and Sri 
      Lanka were found there. Admission to Nalanda was by oral examination. This 
      was done by a professor at the entrance hall. He was called Dvara Pandita. 
      Proficiency in Sanskrit was necessary, as it was the medium of 
      instruction. All Chinese monks going to India for higher studies in 
      Buddhism had to go to Java and brush up their Sanskrit. Hieum Tsang 
      reports that of the foreign students only 20% managed to pass the stiff 
      examinations. Of the Indian students only 30% managed to pass and gain 
      admission. Therefore the standard required were high. Casts, creed and 
      nationality were no barriers in keeping with the Buddhist spirit. There 
      were no external students at the university. Nalanda was maintained by the 
      revenue from seven villages which were granted by the king. The study of 
      Mahayana was compulsory for Buddhists. One could also study the doctrines 
      of 18 other Buddhist sects. One could also study secular subjects like 
      science, medicine, astrology, fine-arts, literature etc. The six systems 
      of Hindu philosophy were also taught. One could study Hinayana forms of 
      Buddhism. This included the Theravada commerce, administration and 
      astronomy were also taught. The observatory of the university was situated 
      in a very tall building. Lectures, debates and discussions were part of 
      the educational curriculum. Hieun Tsang states that 100 lectures were 
      delivered there every day. The discipline was exemplary.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Nalanda university occupied an area of 30 acres. There 
      were three large libraries bearing the names Ratna-Sagara, Ratna-Nidi and 
      Ratna-Ranjana. One of these was nine storeys high. Nalanda was graced by 
      the presence of India’s most brilliant Buddhist luminaries. Some of them 
      were Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Dharmapala, Silabhadra, Santarakshita, 
      Kamalaseela, Bhaviveka, Dignaga, Dharmakeerty etc. The works they left 
      behind are mostly available 14 Tibetan and Chinese translations. The 
      originals perished when Muslim invaders under Bhaktiar Khilji set fire to 
      Nalanda and beheaded the monks. (AD 1037), Prior to that Nalanda 
      flourished for a thousand years, a lighthouse of wisdom and learning, the 
      first of it’s kind in the world. Bhaktiar Khilji the invader of Magadha 
      set fire to Nalanda. When the monks were about to have their meals. This 
      is revealed in the archeological remains which show food abandoned in a 
      great hurry. Charred rice from the granaries also tell this sorry tale. 
      Nalanda’s ruins and excavations are preserved in a Museum by the Indian 
      government. On 19.11.58 the President of India, Rajendra Prasad 
      inaugurated the Nava Nalanda Viharaya at a site close to the ancient 
      university. Master of the Tripitaka Ven. Jagadish Kashyap was appointed 
      head of the institution on 12. 01. 1957 the Dalai Lama handed over the 
      ashes of Nalanda’s famed alumni - Hieun Tsang to the Indian government, 
      headed by Pandit Nehru. The Chinese government donated five lakhs of 
      rupees for a mausoleum which enshrines these relics. The Muslims carried 
      the university idea to the West, and after that universities came up in 
      the western - world.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><STRONG>Vickramasila</STRONG></P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Vickramasila is said to have been situated on the banks of 
      the Ganges near the northern part of Magadha. Although it’s site was 
      undiscovered, the Indian newspaper ‘Searchlight’ of 25.4.80 carried an 
      account of the discovery of the ruins of Vickramsila by Dr. B. S. Varma, 
      Superintending Archeologist in charge of the discovery of the ruins of the 
      Vickramsila Excavation Project.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">According to this Vickramasila was situated at Antichak 
      Village, Kahalagon, Bagalpur District Vickramasila was said to be a sister 
      institution of Nalanda and was said to have been founded by a monk called 
      Kamapala, under the patronage of King Dharmapala. (AC 770-810). The King 
      granted land-endowments for it’s upkeep later King Yasapala also 
      patronised the institutions by liberal land endowments. Under the Pala 
      Kings Vickramasila rose to 9 positions when it rivalled Nalanda and bade 
      well to outshine it. In the centre of the university was the main 
      lecture-hall. It was called ‘Vidyagriha’. There were six entrances to this 
      building and near each entrance was a monastery for resident monks about 
      150 teachers were accommodated in each monastery. Like Nalanda 
      Vickramasila was also surrounded by a high-wall. There were six ‘Dvara 
      Panditas’ i.e Professors who examined candidates seeking admission. Here 
      too high standards were maintained. 108 Professors were engaged in 
      teaching and administrative duties. The curriculum of studies was similar 
      to that of Nalanda. Here preference was given to the Tantric form of 
      Buddhism.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Dipankara Sri Gnana who is also known as Atisha (AC 
      960-1055) was the more-famous of the scholars of Vickramasila. His fame 
      spread far and wide as the propagator of Buddhism in Tibet Tibetans hold 
      his name in the highest veneration. When he was at Vickramasila he was 
      invited to teach and propagate Buddhism in Tibet. He postponed it for some 
      time till he completed his work at Vickramasila and then undertook the 
      task. Vickramasila achieved it’s high water mark of prosperty and fame 
      under him. Sri Gnana’s period was the golden era of Vickramasila. In 1038 
      Sri Gnana left Vickramsila for Tibet to organise Buddhist studies in that 
      country. Vickramasila was managed by a staff of Professors. They 
      constituted the Board of Education, Board of Administration, Board of 
      Discipline and the Board in charge of entrance examinations. Inaugurated 
      in about 800 A.C. it graced the land until it was demolished by the Muslim 
      invaders.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><STRONG>Odantapuri</STRONG></P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Odantapuri was considered the second oldest of India’s 
      universities. This was situated in Maghada, about 6 miles away from 
      Nalanda. Acharya Sri Ganga of Vickramasila had been a student here. Later 
      he joined Odantapuri King Gopala (660-705) was the patron who helped to 
      found this university. According to the Tibetan records there were about 
      12,000 students at Odantapuri. Our knowledge of this seat of learning is 
      obscure, and we are not in a position to give more details. This too 
      perished at the hands of the Muslim invaders. It is said they mistook the 
      universities with their high walls for fortresses. They thought the 
      Buddhist monks were &quot;Shaven headed Brahmins&quot; who were idolaters.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><STRONG>Somapura</STRONG></P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Somapura was situated in East Pakistan. King Devapala (AC 
      810-850) is said to have erected the Dharmapala-Vihara at Somapura. The 
      ruins of these buildings cover an area of about 1 square mile. There was a 
      large gate and the buildings were surrounded by a high-wall. There were 
      about 177 cells for monks in additions to the shrines and image houses. A 
      common refectory and a kitchen are among the ruins, Remains of three 
      -strayed buildings are to be seen. This university flourished for about 
      750 years before it was abandoned after the Muslim invasion.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><STRONG>Jagaddala</STRONG></P>
      <P ALIGN="left">King Ramapala (1077-1129) is said to be the founder of 
      this University. Jagaddala University was the largest construction works 
      undertaken by the Pala Kings. This was a centre for the study and 
      dissemination of Tantric Buddhism. It followed the methods, practices, and 
      traditions of Nalanda. According to Tibetan works many books were 
      translated to the Tibetan language at Jagaddala. The Buddhist teacher 
      Sakya Sri Bhadra, seeing that Nalanda, Vickramsila, and Odantapuri were in 
      ruins after the Muslim invasion, entered Jagaddala for his studies. It is 
      said that his pupil Danaseela translated ten books to Tibetan Sakya Sri 
      Bhadra was responsible for the propagation of Tatntric Buddhism in Tibet. 
      He lived for seven years at Jagaddala. In 1027 the Muslim invaders sack 
      and destroyed Jagaddala.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><STRONG>Vallabhi</STRONG></P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Vallabhi University achieved as much fame as Nalanda. The 
      Maitraka kings who ruled Western India constructed a monastery at 
      Vallabhitheir capital. While Nalanda was the centre for Mahayana Buddhism, 
      Vallabhi achieved fame as the centre for Hinayana Buddhism. The Maitraka 
      kings spent lavishly to maintain their university. They gave every 
      encouragement and assistance to Buddhist studies at this institution. In 
      the 7th century Vallabhi was as prosperous and famous as Nalanda. Hieum 
      Tsang visited Vallabhi, and reported in his &quot;Ta-Tang-Si-Yu-Ki&quot; as follows:</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">-&quot;The population of Vallabhi is very large. The country is 
      rich and prosperous. There are over a hundred millionaire families there. 
      Imported luxury goods are seen in this city. There are about 100 
      monasteries with about 6,000 Buddhist monks. Most of them belong to the 
      Sammitiya Sect. There are also many Hindu temples and a large Hindu 
      population in this past of the country. The Buddha had visited this land 
      during his ministry. There are stupas erected by King Asoka to mark the 
      spots hallowed by the Buddha’s visit.&quot;</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">There are about 100 shrines and about 6,000 resident monks 
      studying at Vallabhi. They do not believe that Abhidharma was the teaching 
      of the Buddha. They believed in the Antarabhava doctrine and were 
      exponents of Puggalavada a traditions that disregards Abhidharma teachings 
      that are inconsistent with the Sutra-Teachings.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><STRONG>I -Tsing’s record</STRONG></P>
      <P ALIGN="left">I-Tsing records that foreign students were found at 
      Vallabhi. They come from many lands far and near from these facts we know 
      that like Nalanda-Vallabhi was internationally recognised. There was a 
      large library. This was maintained by a fund established by the King. An 
      inscription put up by King Guhasena confirms this. Precedence was given to 
      Sammitiya doctrines at this University. The course of studies included 
      Comparative Religion. The Six systems of Hindu Philosophy and various 
      other schools of Buddhism, Politics, Law, Agriculture, Economics also 
      formed a part of the curriculum.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">I-Tsing records that the graduates of Vallabhi, displayed 
      their skill in the presence of the royalty, nobbles, and other eminent 
      people. The Elders Gunamoti and Sthiramatic were Nalanda’s alumni and were 
      teaching there for a time. They are said to be the founders of Vallabhi. 
      As the founders came from Nalanda, Vallabhi followed the Nalanda pattern 
      in most of it’s activities. It flourished from 475 to 1200 A.C. It met the 
      same fate as other Universities at the hands of the Muslim invaders.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Thus it would be seen that as long as Buddhism was a power 
      to reckon with in India, it rendered yoemen service in the field of 
      learning and culture. This is how it should be in a religion that teaches 
      that ignorance is the worst enemy of Mao and the cause of ace his 
      sufferings while knowledge (Pragnya) is his highest asset. Pragnya wins 
      all that is good in this world, and finally brings him the highest 
      happiness, mundane as well as supra-mundane.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">When the Portuguese conquered the Kotte Kingdom there were 
      flourishing Buddhist Seminaries (Pirivenas) at Totagamauwa, Keragala, and 
      Wattala. The Sandesa poems of the period give glowing descriptions of them 
      and their rectors. They were all raised to the ground &quot;leaving not one 
      stone upon another&quot; according to Portuguese writers of the period. Quyroz 
      mentions the demolition of the Wattala Vijayabahu Pirivena and the 
      erection of the R. C. Church on it’s land. Then followed an age of 
      ignorance, decay and corruption for some 200 years. Finally during the 
      reign of King Kirti Sri Rajasinha, Ven. Weliwita Saranankara started his 
      Buddhist revival opening his Seminary at Niyamakanda, Udunnwara. His 
      papillary successors opened the Vidyoda and Vidyalankara Pirivenas in 
      Colombo. These Seminaries were upgraded and converted to secular 
      Universities by the S.L.F.P. Government.</P>
