    <p align="center"><font color="#800000"><b>WHY GOD CANNOT
    EXIST</b></font></p>
    <hr width="25%">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We have seen that the arguments used to prove God's
    existence are inadequate. We will now demonstrate that
    logically an all-loving, all-knowing and all-powerful God
    such as the one in which Christians have faith cannot exist.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>The Problem of Free Will</b></font></p>
    <p>For the religious life to be meaningful we must have free
    will, we must be able to choose between good and evil. If we
    do not have free will we cannot be held responsible for what
    we do.</p>
    <p>According to Christians, God is all-knowing - he knows all
    the past, all the present and all the future. If this is so,
    then God must know everything we do long before we do it.
    This means that our whole life must be predetermined and that
    we act not according to the free exercise of our wills but
    according to our predetermined natures. If we are
    predetermined to be good we will be good and if we are
    predetermined to be evil we will be evil. We will act not
    according to our will or choice but according to the way God
    has already foreseen we will act. Although Christians will
    insist that we do have free will, God's omniscience simply
    makes this logically impossible. And that people will act
    only as God determines is verified in the Bible (e.g. 2 Thess
    2:11-12; Rom 9:19-21; Rom 9:18).</p>
    <p>If people are evil it is because God has chosen to make
    them evil (Rom 1:24-28) and caused them to disobey him (Rom
    11:32). If they do not understand God's message it is because
    he has made their minds dull (Rom 11:8) and caused them to be
    stubborn (Rom 9:18). God prevents the Gospel from being
    preached in certain areas (Act 16:6-7) and he fixes long
    before it will happen when a person will be born and when he
    or she will die (Act 17:26). Those who were going to be saved
    were chosen by God before the beginning of time (II Tim 1:9).
    If a person has faith and is thereby saved, their faith comes
    from God, not from any effort on their part (Eph 2:9-10). One
    may ask &quot;If a person can only do what God predetermines
    them to do, how can God hold them responsible for their
    actions?&quot; The Bible has an answer for this question.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>But one of you will say to me: &quot;If this is so,
        how can God find fault with anyone? For who can resist
        God's will?&quot; But who are you, my friend, to answer
        God back? A clay pot does not ask the man who made it:
        &quot;Why did you make me like this?&quot; After all, the
        man who makes the pot has the right to use the clay as he
        wishes, and to make two pots from one lump of clay, one
        for special occasions and one for ordinary use. And the
        same is true of what God has done (Rom 9:19-22).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So apparently in Christianity a person's life and destiny
    are due purely to the whim of God and as mere humans we have
    no right to complain about what God has decided for us. The
    idea that we are all predetermined is quite consistent with
    the idea of an all-knowing God but it makes nonsense of the
    concept of making an effort to do good or avoid evil.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>The Problem of Evil</b></font></p>
    <p>Perhaps the most potent argument against the existence of
    an all-powerful, all-loving God is the undeniable fact that
    there is so much pain and suffering in the world. If there is
    really a God of love who has unlimited power, why doesn't he
    put an end to all evil? Christians try to answer this
    question in several ways.</p>
    <p>Firstly, they will say that evil is caused by man not God
    and that if only man would follow God's commandments there
    would be no pain, evil or suffering. However, while it is
    true that evils such as war, rape, murder and exploitation
    can be blamed on humans, they can hardly be blamed for the
    millions who die each year in earthquakes, floods, epidemics
    and accidents, all of which are natural events. In fact,
    according to the Bible, the germs that cause hideous diseases
    like TB, polio, cholera, leprosy etc. and all the misery,
    deformity and suffering to which they give rise, were created
    by God <i>before</i> he created man (Gen. 1:11-12).</p>
    <p>Another way Christians will try to explain away evil is to
    say that it is God's punishment for those who do not follow
    his commandments. However this implies that terrible things
    happen only to bad people, which is certainly not true. We
    often hear of painful sickness or disasters befalling good
    people including good Christians, and likewise we often hear
    of really bad people who seem to have nothing but good
    fortune and success. So it cannot be said that suffering and
    evil are God's way of punishing sinners.</p>
    <p>Next, Christians will say that God allows evil to exist in
    the world because he wants to give us the freedom to choose
    good over evil and thereby earn salvation. Evil, they will
    say, exists to test us. At first this seems to be a good
    explanation. If a man sees someone being beaten up by a bully
    he has a choice between turning away (doing wrong) or
    deciding to help the victim (doing right). If he decides to
    help then he has been tested and found good. However, as we
    have seen before, an all-knowing God must <i>already know </i>what
    choices a person will make so what is the point of testing
    us? Also, even if suffering and evil exist in the world to
    test us, couldn't an all-loving God think of a less cruel and
    less painful way to do this? It seems unloving and unfair to
    allow pain to be inflicted on one person so that another
    person can have the opportunity to choose between good and
    evil.</p>
    <p>Some Christians will try to free God from responsibility
    for evil by saying that it is not created by God but by the
    Devil. This may be true but again if God is so loving why
    doesn't he simply prevent the Devil from doing this? In any
    case, who created the Devil in the first place? Surely it was
    God.</p>
    <p>By this stage the Christian will start to get a bit
    desperate, shifting the argument from logic to pragmatism. He
    will say that even though there is suffering in the world we
    can use it as an opportunity to develop courage and patience.
    This is undoubtedly true but it still does not explain <i>why
    </i>an all-loving God allows babies to die of cancer,
    innocent bystanders to be killed in accidents, and leprosy
    victims to suffer deformity and pain. In fact the existence
    of so much unnecessary pain, misery and evil in the world is
    very strong evidence that there is no all-loving all-powerful
    God.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Why Create?</b></font></p>
    <p>Christians claim that God is perfect, that he is complete
    in every way, but if God really did create the universe this
    would prove that he was not perfect. Let us examine why.</p>
    <p>Before God created the universe there was nothing - no
    sun, no earth, no people, no good or evil, no pain - nothing
    but God who was, according to Christians, perfect. So if God
    was perfect and nothing but perfection existed, what
    motivated God to create the universe and thus bring
    imperfection into being? Was it because he was bored and
    wanted something to do? Was it because he was lonely and
    wanted someone to pray to him?</p>
    <p>Christians will say that God created everything because of
    his love of man, but this is impossible. God could not love
    humans <i>before </i>he created them any more than a woman
    could love her children before she had conceived them. God's
    need to create indicates that he was dissatisfied in some way
    and therefore not perfect. Christians might then say that God
    created spontaneously and without need or desire. However
    this would mean that the whole universe came into being
    without purpose or forethought and therefore it would mean
    that God was not a loving creator.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>The Problem of the Hidden God</b></font></p>
    <p>Christians claim that God wants us to believe in him so
    that we can be saved - but if this is so why doesn't God
    simply appear and perform a miracle so that everyone will see
    and believe? Christians will say that God wants us to believe
    in him out of faith, not because we see him with our eyes.
    However, according to the Bible, God in the past performed
    the most awesome miracles and often intervened dramatically
    in human affairs so that people would know his presence. So
    if he did so in the past, why doesn't he do so now?</p>
    <p>Christians will say that God does perform miracles today
    (healing, solving personal problems etc) but being stubborn
    and evil most people refuse to believe. However these
    so-called miracles are individual and minor and leave much
    room for doubt. If God performed a really impressive miracle
    which could have no other possible explanation, then most
    people certainly <i>would </i>believe.</p>
    <p>According to the Bible when the Israelites wandered in the
    desert for forty years, God fed them by making food fall
    regularly from the sky (Ex 16:4). During the 1980's, several
    million Ethiopian Christians died slowly and painfully from
    starvation due to a prolonged drought. God had then the
    opportunity to make food fall from the sky, as the Bible
    claims he did in the past, in order to prove his existence,
    his power and his love. Buddhists would say that God did not
    manifest his presence because he does not exist.</p>
