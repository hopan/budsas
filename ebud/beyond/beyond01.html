    <h3 align="center"><a name="preface"></a><font
    color="#800080"><b>PREFACE</b></font></h3>
    <p>The purpose of this book is threefold. Firstly it aims to
    critically examine Christianity and thereby highlight the
    logical, philosophical and ethical problems in Christian
    dogma. In doing this I hope to be able to provide Buddhists
    with facts which they can use when Christians attempt to
    evangelize them. This book should make such encounters more
    fair, and hopefully also make it more likely that Buddhists
    will remain Buddhists. As it is, many Buddhists know little
    of their own religion and nothing about Christianity - which
    makes it difficult for them to answer the questions
    Christians ask or to rebut the claims they make.</p>
    <p>The second aim of this book is to help any Christians who
    might read it to understand <i>why</i> some people are not,
    and never will be, Christians. Hopefully, this understanding
    will help them to develop an acceptance of and thereby
    genuine friendship with Buddhists, rather than relating to
    them only as potential converts. In order to do this, I have
    raised as many difficult questions as possible and not a few
    home truths. If it appears sometimes that I have been hard on
    Christianity, I hope this will not be interpreted as being
    motivated by malice. I was a Christian for many years and I
    still retain a fond regard, and even admiration, for some
    aspects of Christianity. For me, Jesus' teachings were an
    important step in my becoming a Buddhist and I think I am a
    better Buddhist as a result. However when Christians claim,
    as many do with such insistence, that their religion alone is
    true, then they must be prepared to answer doubts which
    others might express about their religion.</p>
    <p>The third aim of this book is to awaken in Buddhists a
    deeper appreciation for their own religion. In some Asian
    countries Buddhism is thought of an out-of-date superstition
    while Christianity is seen as a religion which has all the
    answers. As these countries become more Westernized,
    Christianity with its &quot;modern&quot; image begins to look
    increasingly attractive. I think this book will amply
    demonstrate that Buddhism is able to ask questions of
    Christianity which it has great difficulties in answering,
    and at the same time to offer explanations to life's puzzles
    which make Christian explanations look rather puerile.</p>
    <p>Some Buddhists may object to a book like this, believing
    that such a gentle and tolerant religion as Buddhism should
    refrain from criticizing other religions. This is certainly
    not what the Buddha himself taught. In the Mahaparinibbana
    Sutta he said that his disciples should be able to
    &quot;Teach the Dhamma, declare it, establish it, expound it,
    analyse it, make it clear, and be able by means of the Dhamma
    to refute false teachings that have arisen.&quot; Subjecting
    a point of view to careful scrutiny and criticism has an
    important part to play in helping to winnow truth from
    falsehood, so that we can be in a better position to choose
    between &quot;the two and sixty contending sects.&quot;
    Criticism of another religion only becomes inappropriate when
    it is based on a deliberate misrepresentation of that
    religion, or when it descends into an exercise in ridicule
    and name-calling. I hope I have avoided doing this.</p>
    <p>I would like to thank Moses Chan and Paul Teo, two devout
    Christians and good friends, for the hours of stimulating
    discussions we had on some of the matters covered in this
    book. We agree to disagree but remain friends.</p>
