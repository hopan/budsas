    <p>The single thing which makes Christianity what it is, the
    foundation on which it rests, is Jesus Christ, or rather,
    claims about Jesus Christ. Christians are always making the
    most exaggerated claims about this man: &quot;Jesus was the
    only man in history to claim to be God&quot;; &quot;Only
    faith in Jesus can give a person peace and happiness&quot;;
    &quot;Either Jesus was God or he was the greatest liar in
    history&quot;; &quot;Thousands of witnesses saw him rise from
    the dead so it must be true&quot;; &quot;Jesus was the most
    perfect human being who ever lived&quot;; etc, etc, etc.
    These claims all sound very impressive until we look at the
    evidence.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Prophecies about and by Jesus</b></font></p>
    <p>Every time there is a change in the turbulent politics of
    the Middle East, Christians will sift through their Bibles
    and loudly proclaim that the newest crisis has been
    prophesied. A prophecy is a prediction in the Bible which is
    supposed to foretell events which will take place in the
    future. These so-called prophecies are bandied about for a
    while and then quietly dropped when they do not come to
    completion in the way they are supposed to. </p>
    <p>Christians claim that many of the events which are
    happening in today's world were long ago prophesied in the
    Bible. When one actually asks to have a look at these
    'amazing prophecies' one can see that they are usually so
    broad and general that they could be interpreted to
    correspond to any event. For example, they will say that the
    world is going to end soon because the Bible prophesises that
    in the last days &quot;There will be wars and rumours of
    wars&quot; (Matt 24:6). The problem with this prophecy is
    that it could refer to any period in world history because
    there are always a few wars occurring somewhere. Christians
    also claim that all the events in Jesus' life were prophesied
    in the Bible long before he was born and that the fact that
    these prophecies came true proves that he really was the
    Messiah . So let us have a look at some of these supposed
    prophecies and see if there is any truth in this claim. In
    the book of Isaiah in the Old Testament it says:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and
        the government will be upon his shoulder, and his name
        shall be called 'Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God,
        Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace'. Of the increase of
        his government and of peace there will be no end. (Is
        9:6-7).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is supposed to be a prophecy foretelling the birth of
    Jesus. But does it? Other than being born no event mentioned
    here happened to Jesus. The government was not on his
    shoulders, he was never called nor did he call himself by the
    titles mentioned here and there has been no more peace since
    he was born than there was before. This is a fairly good
    example of the 'amazing prophecies' upon which Christianity
    is based. Before Jesus' birth an angel is supposed to have
    prophesied that</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The Lord God will make him a king, as his ancestor
        David was, and he will be the king of the descendants of
        Jacob forever (Lk 1:32-33).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>But if what the Bible says is true David could not
    possibly have been Jesus' ancestor because God, not Joseph,
    was Jesus' real father. Also David was a king in a political
    sense, while Jesus never became a king in this way or in any
    other way similar to David. Finally, the descendants of Jacob
    (i.e. the Jews) never accepted Jesus as their king -
    politically, spiritually or in any other way - and have
    refused to accept him as such even to this day. So as before
    this prophecy is wrong on every point. Again in Isaiah it
    says:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened
        not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
        and like a sheep that before its shearers is dumb, so he
        opened not his mouth. (Isa 53:3-5).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is supposed to prophesise that when Jesus was
    attacked by his opponents he would not retaliate. But in the
    Gospels Jesus is portrayed as robustly defending himself
    against criticism and loudly condemning his enemies. He
    cursed and criticized the Pharisees when they opposed him and
    according to John 18:33-37 he was anything but silent at his
    trial.</p>
    <p>When the Romans crucified people they would nail them to a
    cross, let them hang there for some time and then finally
    break their legs, thereby increasing the poor victims' pain
    and killing them. According to the Bible, when the Romans
    came to break Jesus' legs he was already dead and so they did
    not bother (Jn 19:31-34). This, so Christians claim, is
    another remarkable example of biblical prophecy, for in
    Psalms (34:20)it says that God will not let even one bone of
    the Messiah's body be broken. Unfortunately the Christians
    have overlooked a very important fact. Although the bones in
    Jesus legs may not have been broken, the bones in his feet
    definitely were. When the nails were driven into Jesus feet
    they must have broken or at least cracked one or several of
    the metacarpals.</p>
    <p>Christians claim that Jesus died and on the third day rose
    from the dead. And of course they claim that this was
    prophesied before it happened. The supposed prophecy says:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the
        whale's belly, so shall the Son of Man be three days and
        three nights in the heart of the earth (Matt 12:40).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>However, like most Christian prophecies, this is wrong .
    Jesus is supposed to have died on Friday (Good Friday) and
    risen from the dead early on Sunday morning (Easter Sunday).
    Even a schoolchild can see this is not three days and three
    nights - but one day and two nights. Another problem is that
    just before Jesus died he turned to the two criminals
    crucified with him and said &quot;I assure you, <i>today </i>you
    will be in Paradise with me.&quot; (Lk 23:43). Yet Jesus was
    supposed to be in the tomb for three days before ascending
    into heaven, so how could he assure the two criminals that
    they would be in heaven on the day he died? But it is not
    just prophecies about Jesus that are wrong, the prophecies he
    himself made were also wrong. Christians are always claiming
    that the end of the world is coming soon. Where do they get
    this bizarre idea from? They get it from Jesus. He believed
    and explicitly taught that the world would end within his own
    lifetime or very soon afterwards.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly
        not pass away until all these things have happened (Lk
        21:25-33).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>By &quot;this generation&quot; he was obviously referring
    to the people he was addressing. On another occasion he again
    told the people who stood listening to him that some of them
    would still be alive when the end of the world came.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will
        not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in
        his Kingdom (Matt 16:28).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>On every one of these points Jesus' prophecies proved to
    be wrong. The people who lived at his time have been dead for
    2000 years and the world has not ended nor has Jesus
    returned. Jesus' disciples finished going through all the
    cities in Israel within a few years of Jesus' death and he
    has still not returned.</p>
    <p>These and other examples prove that most of the supposed
    prophecies about Jesus and by him are false. But even where a
    prophecy seems to be true this does not necessarily mean
    anything. It can be demonstrated that whoever wrote the
    Gospels deliberately invented events in the life of Jesus to
    make them fit into supposed prophecies. We will examine one
    well-known example of this. Several hundred years before
    Jesus the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew into
    Greek, the language of the day. When a passage in Isaiah
    which says that the Messiah will be born of a young woman (Is
    7:14) was translated, the word for young woman (<i>almah</i>)
    was mistranslated as virgin (<i>parthenas</i>) changing the
    meaning of the prophecy considerably. When the authors of the
    Gospels read this they thought that to qualify to be the
    Messiah Jesus' mother had to be a virgin and so they
    fabricated the story of the virgin birth. In fact it only
    became necessary to invent this story because of a
    misunderstanding. So it is not that prophecies foretold
    events in Jesus' life but rather that events were fabricated
    to fit into prophecies. </p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>The Birth of Jesus</b></font></p>
    <p>We will often hear Christians boast that no one has ever
    found a mistake in the Bible, just as we will often hear them
    claim that the Bible is the inspired word of God and
    therefore infallible. Considering how carefully Christians
    pick through the Bible text it is difficult to know how such
    claims can be made, much less believed.</p>
    <p>Let us have a look at what the Bible says about the birth
    of Jesus. First we are told that news of Jesus' impending
    birth was conveyed to Joseph, Jesus' father, in a dream (Matt
    1:20). Then we are told that the news was given to Mary,
    Jesus' mother, by an angel (Lk 1:28). Which of these two
    stories are true? Was it Joseph who got the news or Mary?
    Christians will say that they both got it. Then why does the
    Gospel of Matthew fail to mention the angel appearing to Mary
    and the Gospel of Luke fail to mention Joseph's dream? On one
    hand we are told that Jesus' parents went on a journey before
    the baby was born (Lk 2:4-7) and on the other that they went
    on a journey after the birth (Matt 2:13-14). Which of these
    true stories is true? When we come to where Jesus was
    actually born we meet with more contradictions. Was Jesus
    born at home (Matt 1:24-25) or was he born in a manger at the
    back of an inn (Lk 2:7)? Next we come to Jesus' ancestry. We
    have two lists of all Jesus' ancestors on his father's side,
    but when we look at the names in these we find almost no
    correspondence between them. They do not even agree about the
    name of Jesus' grandfather. One says his name was Jacob (Matt
    1:16) and the other says his name was Heli (Lk 3:23).
    Moreover, it is ridiculous to talk about Jesus' ancestors on
    his father's side and Jesus being related to King David (Matt
    1:1), when not Joseph but God is supposed to be Jesus' real
    father.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Was He A Good Teacher?</b></font></p>
    <p>At the time of the Buddha there was a religious sect
    called the Niganthas which fell apart soon after the death of
    its founder Nataputta.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>And at his death the Niganthas split into two parties,
        quarrelling and disputing, fighting and attacking each
        other and using a war of words......You would have
        thought that they were disgusted, displeased and repelled
        when they saw that the doctrine was so badly presented,
        so poorly laid out and so ineffective in calming the
        passions because it had been taught by one who was not
        fully enlightened and was now without guide or arbiter
        (Digha Nikaya, Sutta No.29).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Interestingly enough, this was exactly what happened as
    soon as Jesus died and for exactly the same reasons. Jesus is
    justly famous for the parables he used to illustrate his
    ideas but at the same time he often failed to make his
    meaning clear. Sometimes this was because he himself was not
    clear about his ideas and at other times it seems that he was
    just a poor communicator. What is even more strange is that
    Jesus even admitted that he deliberately obscured his
    message.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>And when his disciples asked him what the parable
        meant, he said; to you it has been given to know the
        secrets of the Kingdom of God: but for others they are in
        parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hearing
        they may not understand (Lk 8:9-10; Mk 8:17-18).</p>
        <p>But they did not understand this saying, and it was
        concealed from them, that they could not perceive it: and
        they were afraid to ask him about this saying (Lk 9:45).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Add to this deliberate obscurity the numerous
    contradictory ideas in Jesus' teachings and it is not hard to
    imagine why his disciples fell into disagreement as soon as
    he died. In the Epistles there are constant references to the
    bickering and squabbling between the various factions amongst
    the early Christians. Paul complained that all the churches
    in Asia turned against him (2 Tim 1:15) and that they refused
    to take his side in some theological argument (2 Tim
    4:14-16). He tells us of his squabble with Peter and the
    elders of the church in Jerusalem (Gal 2:11-13), of how he
    was snubbed by the church at Philippi (1 Thess 2:1-20), and
    of course he accused his rivals of not having real faith (2
    Thess 3:1-3), of teaching 'another Christ' and of not really
    knowing God (Tit 1:10-16). John bitterly complained that his
    opponents threw those who supported him out of the church
    (John 1:9-10). Paul made a desperate but futile appeal for
    harmony between the early Christians.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord
        Jesus Christ, that you all agree with one another that
        there may be no divisions between you and that you might
        be perfectly united in mind and thought (1 Cor 1:10-12).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What were the early Christians squabbling about? One of
    the numerous points of disagreement seems to have been on the
    issue of whether it was necessary to be circumcised or not
    (Rom 2:25-29, Gal 5:2-12, Gal 6:12-15, Phil. 3:2-4, Col.
    2:11-13). Paul was against it and called those who disagreed
    with him &quot;dogs&quot; (Phil 3:2), said that he hoped that
    they would go all the way and castrate themselves (Gal 5:12)
    and he warned other Christians to keep away from them (Tit
    1:10). Sadly, all this is reminiscent of modern Christians.
    While claiming that they alone have the truth there is so
    much disagreement between them about what that truth is that
    they have split into hundreds of denominations, sects, cults
    and churches and refuse to worship the same God together.
    Like the early Christians there is much ill-will and jealousy
    between them with one group accusing the other of not being
    'true Christians', of not understanding the Bible properly
    and of being misled by Satan. For Buddhists and other
    non-Christians this is all very bewildering. If it is true
    that Jesus' message of salvation was so clear and if it is
    true that God communicates with and guides Christians through
    prayer why is it that there is so much disagreement and
    mutual hostility among them?</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>The Last Supper</b></font></p>
    <p>The Bible gives us almost no information about the life of
    Jesus until he started teaching at about the age of 30. And
    even after his public ministry started there is great
    confusion about what happened and when. For instance, the
    Gospel of John claims that the cleansing of the temple took
    place at the beginning of Jesus' ministry (Jn 2:13-14), but
    the Gospel of Luke claims the cleansing took place at the end
    (Lk 19:45-46). On one hand we are told that Jesus stayed in
    Peter's house and then healed a leper (Mk 1:29-45), on the
    other we are told that he healed the leper and then went in
    Peter's house (Matt 8:1-2, 8:14). On one hand we are told
    that the centurion spoke personally to Jesus (Matt 8:5); in a
    complete contradiction to this we are told that the centurion
    sent people on his behalf to speak to Jesus (Lk 7:1). In the
    Gospel of Mark we are told that Jesus left Tyre and passed
    through Sidon on his way to the Sea of Galilee (Mk 7:31). A
    look at any map of Israel will show that this is quite
    impossible as Sidon is in another direction altogether.</p>
    <p>Christians will reluctantly admit these mistakes but say
    that they are minor and of no significance. Perhaps so, but
    they do prove that the Bible is not infallible, and if the
    Bible makes mistakes about what Jesus did, it could just as
    easily make mistakes about what Jesus said. But even when we
    look at very important events in Jesus' life we find
    confusion. Let us have a look at the Last Supper. According
    to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus' Last Supper
    took place on the Jewish holy day of Passover (Matt 26:17-20,
    Mk 14:12-17, Lk 22:7-14). The Gospel of John on the other
    hand claims that the Last Supper took place on the day <i>before
    </i>Passover (Jn 19:14). Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were
    supposed to be among the disciples who attended the Last
    Supper with Jesus. They are also supposed to be the disciples
    who remembered and wrote down all Jesus' teachings. If they
    couldn't even remember the day of the Last Supper how do we
    know that they remembered Jesus' teachings correctly?</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>The Trial</b></font></p>
    <p>Now we will have a look at that most important event in
    the life of Jesus, his trial. As described in the Bible the
    trial is predictably full of contradictions, but it also
    raises many questions which are difficult to answer. The
    trial and the events leading up to it are usually described
    by Christians like this - Jesus entered Jerusalem riding on a
    donkey to the acclaim of the population of the city. He was
    arrested by the henchmen of the Jewish priests who beat him
    and handed him over to the Romans. The Roman governor,
    Pontius Pilate, could find no guilt in Jesus but the Jewish
    priests kept insisting he was guilty. Unable to make up his
    mind, the Roman governor decided to ask the crowd what they
    wanted, either the release of Jesus or a Jewish rebel. The
    crowd cried out for the release of the rebel and the
    crucifixion of Jesus. So Pilate reluctantly had Jesus
    executed.</p>
    <p>Could the trial really have proceeded like this? Let us
    have a look. We are told that when Jesus rode into Jerusalem
    crowds of delighted people greeted him, laying their cloaks
    on the road and praising him as their king (Mk 11:8). But
    only a day later a huge crowd were screaming out for Jesus to
    be crucified (Mk 15:12-14). This sudden change from adulation
    to hatred is hard to explain. Next we have Jesus brought
    before Pontius Pilate. The Bible portrays Pilate as a man who
    can find no guilt in Jesus but is pushed into crucifying him
    by the Jewish priests. This is clearly impossible. The Romans
    were famous for their strong and effective government; their
    judicial system was known for its justice and they did not
    send weak, indecisive men to govern troublesome parts of the
    empire. Who could believe that a Roman governor would allow
    the people he ruled to make up his mind for him and tell him
    how to run his own court? The Bible says that Pilate asked
    the crowd whether they wanted either Jesus or Barabbas
    released (Lk 23:13-18), and when they said Barabbas, he was
    set free and Jesus was executed. Now credibility has been
    stretched to the limit. We are asked to believe that a Roman
    governor would execute a man he believed to be innocent and
    set free a rebel involved in murder and trying to overthrow
    Roman rule (Lk 23:19). The Romans did not conquer and govern
    Europe, Africa and the Middle East by releasing dangerous
    rebels. They were strong, fair and completely ruthless with
    all who opposed them. So the Christian account of Jesus'
    trial is unconvincing.</p>
    <p>If we read what Jesus is supposed to have said at his
    trial we can see that all the accounts of the trial are
    fabrications. According to the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus
    &quot;gave no answer&quot;, (Matt 27:12) and &quot;made no
    reply, not even to a single charge, to the great amazement of
    the governor&quot; (Matt 27:14) during his trial. In a
    complete contradiction to this the Gospel of John claims that
    Jesus answered charges, asked questions and spoke much during
    his trial (Jn 18:33-37). Which of these two accounts is true?
    Was Jesus silent or did he speak? Like the Gospel of John,
    the Gospel of Luke also claims that Jesus spoke much during
    his trial. But if we compare John's account of what was said
    with Luke's account we find that almost every sentence is
    different (Compare Jn 18:33-37 with Lk 22:66-70). Obviously,
    Christian claims that the Bible is an accurate, reliable
    historical document are completely untrue.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>What Happened to Judas?</b></font></p>
    <p>Judas was the disciple who betrayed Jesus. After he had
    done this he is said to have died. But how did he die? Here,
    as with many other incidents, the Bible gives us several
    confused accounts. According to Matthew this is what
    happened:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was
        condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the
        thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders.
        &quot;I have sinned&quot;, he said, &quot;for I have
        betrayed innocent blood&quot;. &quot;What is that to
        us&quot;, they replied. &quot;That's your
        responsibility!&quot;. So Judas threw the money into the
        temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
        The chief priests picked up the coins and said, &quot;It
        is against the law to put this into treasury, since it is
        blood money&quot;. So they decided to use the money to
        buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners.
        That is why it has been called the field of blood to this
        day (Matt 27:3-8).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Elsewhere we are told a different story.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>With the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas
        bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst
        open and all his intestines spilled out. Everyone in
        Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in
        their language Akeldama, that is, field of blood (Acts
        1:18-19).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Was it Judas who bought the field or was it the chief
    priests? Did Judas hang himself or did he fall down and have
    his body burst open?</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Jesus' Last Words</b></font></p>
    <p>Many Christian doctrines are often based on a single word
    or sentence which Jesus is supposed to have spoken. To prove
    the truth of their beliefs Christians will rush to their
    Bibles and point to a sentence saying, &quot;There, that
    proves it&quot;. They assume that every phrase, every
    sentence, every word in the Bible is exactly what Jesus said.
    We have already seen that the Bible is quite confused about
    what Jesus did and said. In fact even Jesus' last words have
    not been accurately recorded. According to Matthew, Jesus'
    last words were: &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken
    me?&quot; (Matt 27:46). According to Mark he just gave a loud
    cry and died (Mk 15:37). According to Luke he said,
    &quot;Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit&quot; (Lk
    23:46). According to John, Jesus' last words were: &quot;It
    is finished.&quot; (Jn 19:30). Once again we have
    discrepancies and contradictions which make it impossible to
    know what to believe.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>The Resurrection</b></font></p>
    <p>Did Jesus really die and then rise from the dead after
    three days? The Four Gospels' accounts of this most crucial
    event are such a confused and contradictory mess that
    convincing any unbiased person to doubt it would be easy. At
    this point the reader is advised to have a Bible ready and to
    check the references. We will see that the four accounts of
    the supposed Resurrection differ in nearly every detail.</p>
    <p>(1) When did the Resurrection happen?</p>
    <p>All four Gospels agree that the events described took
    place early on Sunday morning (Matt 28:1, Mk 16:1, Lk 24:1,
    Jn 20:1).</p>
    <p>(2) Who went to the tomb?</p>
    <p>Now the problems begin. Matthew says that the two Marys
    went to the tomb (Matt 28:1); Mark says that the two Marys
    and Salome went (Mk 16:1); Luke says that the two Marys,
    Joanna and some other women went (Lk 24:10); and John says
    that Mary went alone (Jn 20:1).Christians claim that the
    Bible contains no mistakes but surely there are a few
    mistakes here. They claim that those who wrote the Gospels
    were inspired by God as they wrote, but apparently not
    inspired enough to be able to count properly.</p>
    <p>(3) Was there an earthquake?</p>
    <p>Matthew tells us that at that time there was a &quot;great
    earthquake&quot; (Matt 28:2), but why do the other three
    Gospels fail to mention it? Surely a great earthquake,
    especially occurring at such a significant moment, would be
    hard to forget. It is far more likely that Matthew just made
    up the story to add drama to his account, in other words he
    lied.</p>
    <p>(4) How many angels?</p>
    <p>Next, Matthew claims that an angel appeared before the two
    women, rolled back the stone door and sat upon it (Matt
    28:2). He also says that the guards were so frightened that
    they fainted (Matt 28:4). Mark's story is quite different. He
    claims that the door had <i>already</i> been removed before
    the women arrived, so they went into the tomb and saw the
    angel inside (Mk 16:4-5). And he doesn't mention any guards.
    Luke's story is even more inventive. He claims that the women
    went into the tomb and saw not one but <i>two </i>angels (Lk
    24:4). Obviously someone is not telling the truth. John
    claims that Mary went to the tomb alone, saw the tomb open,
    ran to get the other disciples and when they went into the
    tomb she waited outside. After everyone went home Mary
    waited, and as she did two angels appeared to her, and then
    Jesus appeared although she could not recognize him (Jn
    20:12-14). And it is on this garbled 'evidence' that
    Christianity rests.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Was Jesus God?</b></font></p>
    <p>Christians claim that Jesus was God. Let us see if there
    is any justification for these claims. If Jesus really was
    God it is very strange that he never said so. There is not
    one place in the whole of the Bible where Jesus simply and
    unambiguously says, &quot;I am God&quot;. Christians will
    object to this and say that Jesus often called himself or was
    called the Son of God. However, the Bible clearly shows that
    any person who was good and had faith qualified to be called
    a Son of God. For example, Jesus called Adam a son of God (Lk
    3:38).</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It will happen that in the very place where it was
        said of them &quot;you are not my people&quot; they will
        be called &quot;sons of the living God&quot; (Rom 9:26).</p>
        <p>Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute
        you, that you may be sons of your father in heaven (Matt
        5:44-45).</p>
        <p>You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus
        (Gal 3:26).</p>
        <p>You are God's; you are all sons of the most high (Ps
        82:6).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Jesus is called God's 'only begotten son' but even this is
    not unique. In the Psalms God says to King David, &quot;You
    are my son, today I have begotten you&quot; (Ps 2:7) In fact,
    Jesus said distinctly that when he called himself a son of
    God, he did not mean he was God or related to God in a
    literal sense. When the Jewish priests criticized him for
    claiming to be equal with God, Jesus said:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Is it not written in your law, &quot;I have said you
        are gods&quot;? If he called them &quot;gods&quot; to
        whom the word of God came - and the Scripture cannot be
        broken - what about one whom the Father set apart as his
        very own and sent into the world? (Jn 10:34-36).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Christians will protest that in these quotes 'son of god'
    is not written in capitals but when Jesus makes his claims
    capitals are used thus, 'Son of God'. But capital letters to
    make a phrase outstanding or to give it emphasis is an
    innovation of modern English. In ancient Greek and Aramaic,
    the languages in which the New Testament was written, capital
    letters were never used and so the distinction between 'son
    of god' and 'Son of God' did not exist. Christians make an
    enormous fuss about Jesus' claims to be a son of God but as
    we can see, there is absolutely nothing unique in this claim.
    Christians could claim that the term 'son of God' is used in
    the Bible in two different ways - as a title for a
    particularly holy person and for the actual son of God,
    Jesus, who was with God in heaven before coming to earth. But
    even in this second sense Jesus was not unique. The Bible
    tells us that God had numerous sons with him in heaven who
    later came to earth and lived with humans just as Jesus did.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>When mankind began to increase and spread all over the
        earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God
        saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; so they
        took for themselves such women as they chose(Gen 6:1-3)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the Bible Jesus is called the Son of Man more than 80
    times. Yet the Bible also tells us that in the eyes of God
    the Son of Man is nothing more than a worm (Job 25:6). How
    can Christians claim that the Son of Man is God when the
    Bible itself says that the Son of Man is nothing more than a
    worm?</p>
    <p>Christians will then insist that Jesus was called the
    Messiah, but again it was not unusual to be called a Messiah.
    The Hebrew word <i>mashiah </i>of which the Greek translation
    is <i>christos </i>simply means 'anointed one', and refers to
    anyone sent by God to help the people of Israel. Even a
    non-Jew could be and sometimes was called a Messiah. The
    Bible even calls the pagan Persian King Cyrus a Messiah
    because he let God's people return to their homeland (Is
    45:1). So just because Jesus was called the Messiah does not
    prove he was God. In fact, throughout the Bible Jesus goes
    out of his way to make it clear that he was not God. When
    someone called Jesus 'good teacher' he said:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Why do you call me good? No one is good except God
        alone (Lk 18:19).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now if Jesus was God why would he deny that he was good?
    We are told that Jesus prayed, but if he was God why would he
    need to pray to himself? And when Jesus prayed, he said to
    God, &quot;not my will but yours&quot; (Lk 22:42). Quite
    clearly Jesus is making a distinction between God's will and
    his own. Jesus says that no one has even seen God (Jn 1:18),
    meaning that when people saw him they were not seeing God.
    Again Jesus says he can do nothing without God.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by
        himself; he can only do what he sees the Father do (Jn
        5:19).</p>
        <p>By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear and
        my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but
        him who sent me (Jn 5:30).</p>
        <p>I can do nothing on my own but speak just what the
        Father has taught me (Jn :28).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If Jesus was God he could do anything he wanted to do, and
    in these passages and dozens of others he is making it as
    clear as crystal that he is one thing and God another. Jesus
    said, &quot;The Father is greater than I&quot; (Jn 14:28)
    making it clear that he is not as great as God and therefore
    different from God. He says:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will
        be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy
        Spirit will not be forgiven (Lk 12:10).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now if Jesus and the Holy Spirit were the same, to
    blaspheme one would be the same as blaspheming the other. In
    the Bible we are told that no one born of a woman can be pure
    (Job 25:4). Jesus was born of a woman, his mother Mary, so he
    likewise must have been impure. Now if Jesus was impure how
    could he be God? We are told that Jesus was dead for three
    days before ascending into heaven. How can God possibly die?
    Who was looking after the universe while he was dead? Jesus
    said that at the end of the world he would be sitting at the
    right hand of God to judge the world (Lk 22:69). If Jesus and
    God are the same being, how is this possible? Quite clearly
    the two are separate and different. And again David is
    described as sitting on the right hand of God, so to do this
    one does not have to be a god (Ps 110:1). We are told that
    Jesus stands <i>between </i>God and man.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>For there is one God and one mediator between God and
        men, the man Jesus Christ (1 Tim 2:5).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This passage clearly states that Jesus is not God, for if
    he was, how could he stand <i>between </i>God and men? It
    also specifically calls Jesus a man (see also Acts 17:30-31).
    In the Gospels of Matthew and Luke (Matt 1:16, Lk 3:23) we
    are given the name of Jesus' father, his father's father, and
    so on, back through many generations. If God was really
    Jesus' father, why does the Bible list all Jesus' ancestors
    on his father's side? Christians are forever claiming that
    Jesus is God and at the same time that he is the son of God.
    But how is this possible? How can a father be his own son and
    himself all at the same time? And to make matters more
    confused, the Holy Spirit is brought in and we are asked to
    believe that Jesus, God and the Holy Spirit are different and
    yet the same.</p>
    <p>The claim of Christians that Jesus is God contradicts what
    the Bible says, it goes against common sense and it raises
    numerous logical problems. Whereas if we see Jesus as he was,
    a reformer and prophet, none of these problems arise.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Was Jesus Perfect?</b></font></p>
    <p>If a religious teacher were perfect we would expect the
    behaviour of such a person to be unfailingly blameless, their
    teachings to be humane and practical and for there to be
    consistency between what they preached and how they behaved.
    Jesus of course, denied that he was perfect (Lk 18:19) but
    despite this denial and all the evidence in the Bible,
    Christians continue to claim that Jesus was perfect. They
    have to do this because they mistakenly believe that Jesus
    was God - and how can a God be imperfect? Buddhists believe
    that Jesus was a good man as were the founders of the other
    great world religions but because he was not enlightened like
    the Buddha he was certainly not perfect. Like other
    unenlightened people he sometimes did wrong, some of the
    things he taught were impractical, and sometimes he failed to
    practise what he preached. Let us examine the evidence.</p>
    <p>Jesus' ethical teachings are often described as 'sublime',
    'lofty', 'utterly perfect' etc. But were they? Let us look at
    his teachings on divorce. In the Old Testament divorce was
    allowed under certain circumstances, which of course when a
    couple no longer love each other or when they are
    incompatible, is the most humane thing to do. But Jesus took
    an extreme position on divorce, saying that it was allowable
    only on the grounds of adultery:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It has been said, &quot;Anyone who divorces his wife
        must give her a certificate of divorce&quot;. But I tell
        you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital
        unfaithfulness, causes her to commit adultery, and anyone
        who marries a woman so divorced also commits adultery
        (Matt 5:31-32).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This terrible teaching has meant that until recently in
    Christian countries millions of couples were trapped in
    unhappy and loveless marriages, unable to get a divorce. It
    also meant that countless women who did manage to get a
    divorce from their husbands even without committing adultery
    were branded as adulterers if they married again. This
    teaching of Jesus alone has caused untold misery and
    heartbreak. Another example of the far from perfect teachings
    of Jesus is his attitude to money. Jesus seems to have a deep
    resentment for the rich:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>But woe to you that are rich, for you have received
        your consolation. Woe to you that are full now, for you
        shall hunger (Lk 6:24-25).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>While it is true that the rich are sometimes greedy and
    thoughtless (as are the poor) no mention is made of this. The
    rich are condemned simply because they are rich. Once when a
    young man pressed Jesus for an answer to the question of how
    he could have eternal life he finally said:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and
        give it to the poor and follow me and you will have
        treasure in heaven (Matt 19:21).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Jesus even went so far as to say that it is virtually
    impossible for a rich person to get to heaven.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Truly, I say to you, it will be hard for a rich man to
        enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Again, I tell you, it is
        easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than
        for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God (Matt
        19:23-24).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Christians of course, have never taken any notice of these
    sayings of Jesus, but if they did the economies of most
    Christian countries would collapse and all the good qualities
    that honest entrepreneurship can engender would disappear.
    This rather impractical and unfair teaching of Jesus
    contrasts very sharply with the Buddha's attitude to wealth.
    He recognized that wealth honestly earned can be a source of
    happiness.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>What is the happiness of ownership? Herein, a
        householder has wealth acquired by energetic striving,
        won by strength of arm and sweat of brow, justly and
        lawfully won When he thinks of this, he feels happiness
        and satisfaction.</p>
        <p>And what is the happiness of wealth? Herein, a
        householder has wealth justly and lawfully won, and with
        it he does many good deeds. When he thinks of this, he
        feels happiness and satisfaction.</p>
        <p>And what is the happiness of freedom from debt?
        Herein, a householder owes no debt large or small to
        anyone, and when he thinks of this, he feels happiness
        and satisfaction (Anguttara Nikaya, Book of Fives, Sutta
        No.41).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>He also understood that with the right attitude the
    wealthy can do great good with their money.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>With wealth acquired by energetic striving, won by
        strength of arm and sweat of brow lawfully and justly, a
        noble disciple makes himself, his mother and father, his
        wife and children, his servants and workmen and his
        friends and acquaintances cheerful and happy - he creates
        perfect happiness. This is the first opportunity seized
        by him, used for good and appropriately made use of
        (Anguttara Nikaya, Book of Fives, Sutta No.41).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So rather than dismissing the rich wholesale from the
    religious life as Jesus did. the Buddha taught them to earn
    the money honestly and to use it for the benefit of
    themselves and the general community.</p>
    <p>But the teaching of Jesus which has caused more problems
    than any other is the claim that he and he alone can give
    salvation (Jn 14:6). It follows axiomatically from this that
    all other religions lead to the only alternative to salvation
    - hell - and are therefore evil. Sadly, this claim by Jesus
    is the root of that most characteristic of all Christian
    traits - intolerance. Christianity has always equated
    disbelief in Jesus with evil and has castigated non-believers
    as godless, wicked, stubborn, pagan, scoffers, followers of
    false prophets, idol worshippers (see e.g.</p>
    <p>I Pet 2:1-22).</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do
        righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what
        fellowship can light have with darkness? What harmony is
        there between Christ and Belial? What does a believer
        have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement is
        there between the temple of God and idols? (2 Cor
        6:14-16).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What, Paul asks in this passage, can a Christian have in
    common with, for example, a Buddhist? For Paul as for
    fundamentalist and evangelical Christians the fact that the
    Buddhist may value and practise love, compassion, charity,
    patience, humility, and truthfulness just as he does, counts
    for nothing. For the Christian the single fact that the
    Buddhist does not believe that Jesus is God automatically
    puts him on the side of wickedness and darkness; he is an
    idol worshipper who should be shunned and who deserves to go
    to hell. </p>
    <p>This is the great tragedy of Christianity - the stronger
    the Christian's faith in Jesus the more partisan, bigoted and
    intolerant he usually becomes. What a relief it is to be able
    to Take Refuge in the Buddha and still be able to respect and
    admire Lao Tzu, the Prophet Mohammed, Krishna, Guru Nanak,
    etc. How pleasant it is to be able to communicate with others
    without the need to be always trying to convert them. How
    nice it is to be able to be happy when one sees others happy
    with their religion. Christianity is intolerant because it is
    obsessed with Jesus and excludes everyone who does not accept
    him. Buddhism is tolerant because it treasures wisdom and
    compassion and can embrace anyone, whatever their religion,
    who is developing these qualities.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Miracles</b></font></p>
    <p>Some of the most bizarre things about Jesus were the
    miracles he is said to have performed. One of the most famous
    of these was bringing Lazarus back from the dead. Lazarus had
    been dead for at least four days and was presumably in
    heaven, while his family were heartbroken and grieving. In
    raising him from the dead, Jesus certainly demonstrated his
    power but what did Lazarus and his family get out of it?
    Lazarus was removed from heaven and brought back to
    &quot;this vale of tears&quot; only to have to die all over
    again some time in the future while his family would also
    have to go through grieving and distress all over again (Jn
    11:1-44).</p>
    <p>To the Buddhist this miracle, if it even really happened,
    seems to be unnecessary, and even cruel. How much more
    practical and humane was the Buddha's approach to death. On
    one occasion a young mother named Kisagotami came to the
    Buddha with her dead son, deranged with grief and pleading
    with the Buddha to give her son medicine. Full of compassion
    the Buddha told her to go and get a mustard seed from a house
    where no one had ever died. In the process of looking for
    such a seed, Kisagotami gradually came to realize that death
    is an integral part of life and she overcame her grief
    (Dhammapada Atthakatta, Book 8,13). Jesus performed showy
    miracles which seemed to leave people much as they were, the
    Buddha gently and skilfully led people to understanding. This
    is what the Buddha meant when he said that education is the
    highest miracle (Digha Nikaya, Sutta No.11).</p>
    <p>Another miracle where Jesus seems to have given little
    thought to the consequences of what he was doing was the one
    he supposedly performed at Godara. A man was possessed by
    devils, and just before Jesus exorcized them the devils asked
    Jesus if he would send them into a nearby herd of pigs. Jesus
    obliged, sending the devils into the pigs, which then rushed
    screaming down the side of a cliff into a lake where they
    drowned (Mk 5:1-13). The man who had been possessed by the
    devils must have been very grateful for this but one wonders
    what the owners of the pigs would have thought. The loss of
    their animals would have caused them great financial
    hardship. Not surprisingly, we are told that after this
    incident the people from the nearby village came to Jesus and
    begged him to leave their territory (Mk 5:17). Note that
    Matthew tells this same story but he exaggerates it, claiming
    that not one but two men were exorcized (Matt 8:28-32).</p>
    <p>This supposed miracle also highlights Jesus utter
    disregard for nature. He could simply have expelled the
    devils but instead he chose to do it in a most cruel way by
    driving to their deaths a large number of completely harmless
    and innocent animals. On another occasion he used his
    miraculous powers to kill a fig tree simply because it could
    not bear fruit (Matt 21:18-20). Apparently he never
    considered that animals could have eaten its leaves, birds
    could have nested in its branches, travellers could have
    rested in its shade and its roots would have helped prevent
    erosion of the soil by the rain and the wind - which probably
    explains why the tree had been left growing. No advantage at
    all came from killing the tree - it was little more than an
    act of wanton vandalism.</p>
    <p>While some of Jesus' miracles were pointless others seem
    to have verged on the ridiculous. Once Jesus was invited to a
    wedding. After some time there was no wine left to drink so
    Jesus turned several large jars of water into wine (Jn
    2:1-11). No doubt the host must have appreciated not having
    to go out to buy more alcohol, but it does seem a bit
    incongruous. that God should incarnate as a man, come to
    earth and use his powers just so that people wouldn't run out
    of drinks at their parties.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Inconsistency</b></font></p>
    <p>What we have said above indicates that while some of
    Jesus' teachings were good, others were cruel, impractical ,
    and in some cases just silly. And perhaps it is not
    surprising that not only have Christians often failed to
    practise Jesus' teachings, but he often also failed to
    practise them himself. He taught that we should love our
    neighbour but he seems to have problems doing this himself.
    He believed that his teaching could lead people to heaven and
    yet he specifically instructed his disciples not to preach
    the Gospel to anyone but his own people, the Jews.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the
        Samaritans Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel (Matt
        10:5-6).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>When a poor distressed woman came to Jesus begging for
    help he refused to help her simply because she was not
    Jewish. Teaching the Gospel to Canaanites was, he said, like
    taking food from children and throwing it to dogs.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A Canaanite woman from the vicinity came to him,
        crying out, &quot;Lord, son of David, have mercy on me!
        My daughter is suffering terribly from
        demon-possession&quot;. Jesus did not answer a word. So
        his disciples came to him and urged him, &quot;Send her
        away, for she keeps crying out after us&quot;. He
        answered: &quot;I was sent only to the lost sheep of
        Israel&quot;. The woman came and knelt before him,
        &quot;Lord, help me!&quot; she said. He replied, &quot;It
        is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to
        the dogs&quot; (Matt 15:22-26)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It was only after strong urging from his disciples that
    Jesus finally decided to help the woman. So much for loving
    one's neighbour. Jesus taught that we should love our
    enemies, but again he seemed to have difficulties doing this.
    When the Pharisees criticized him he responded with a tirade
    of curses and insults (e.g. Jn 8:42-47, Matt 23:13-36).</p>
    <p>Jesus said that we should not judge others (Matt 7:12) and
    claimed that he himself judged no one (Jn 8:15). But despite
    this he was constantly judging and condemning others, often
    in a harsh and sweeping manner (Jn 8:42-47, Matt 23:13-16) </p>
    <p>In conformity with the Old Testament Jesus taught that we
    must honour our mother and father (Matt 19:19) but on other
    occasions he taught and practised the exact opposite.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If any one comes to me and does not hate his own
        father and mother and wife and children and brothers and
        sisters, yes, even his own life, he cannot be my disciple
        (Lk 14:26).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This demand that to love Jesus we must be prepared to hate
    others, even our own parents, seems to be very much at odds
    with the idea of honouring parents - let alone with the idea
    of loving our neighbour. Once Jesus' mother and brothers came
    to see him while he was preaching only to be rudely rebuffed.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>And his mother and brothers came, and standing outside
        they sent to him and called him. And a crowd was sitting
        about him, and they said to him, &quot;Your mother and
        brothers are outside, asking for you&quot;. And he
        replied, &quot;Who are my mother and my brothers?&quot;
        And looking around on those who sat about him, he said,
        &quot;Here are my mother and brothers!&quot; (Mk
        3:31-35).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Once when his mother spoke to him, he snapped at her:
    &quot;O woman, what have you to do with me?&quot; (Jn 2:4).
    And yet while he acted like this to his parents he condemned
    the Pharisees for their supposed hypocrisy over the law to
    honour mother and father (Matt 15:3-6, Mk 7:10-13).</p>
    <p>In some instances, it is difficult to accuse Jesus of
    failing to practise what he preached for the simple reason
    that he taught contradictory things. Christians are used to
    thinking of him as &quot;gentle Jesus meek and mild&quot;,
    because of his commands &quot;to turn the other cheek&quot;
    and to &quot;not resist an evil person&quot; (Matt 5:39). And
    indeed Jesus seems to have acted like this sometimes. But at
    other times he clearly saw his role as a violent one.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace on the
        earth. I did not come to bring peace but the sword. I
        have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter
        against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her
        mother-in-law, a man's enemies will be the members of his
        own household (Matt 10:34-36).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Certainly he saw nothing wrong with using violence when he
    thought it was necessary. When he saw the money changers in
    the temple he lost his temper and lashed out with violence.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>So he made a whip out of cords and drove all from the
        temple areas: he scattered the coins of the money
        changers and overturned their tables (Jn 2:15).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Before his arrest Jesus was expecting trouble so he told
    his disciples to prepare themselves by getting weapons.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If you do not have a sword sell your cloak and buy one
        (Lk 22:36).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>When he was arrested there was a fight during which
    &quot;one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it
    out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off
    his ear&quot; (Matt 26:51). It is very difficult for the
    Buddhist to reconcile such behaviour with the idea of being
    perfect. To retaliate against one's accusers, to lose one's
    temper and to encourage others to carry weapons and use them
    seem to negate the whole idea of moral perfection.</p>
    <p>At this stage it might be good to point out that while
    most of Jesus' teachings are inadequate and ill-conceived,
    some are excellent. His teachings on love, forgiveness,
    humility and service to the sick and poor are worthy of the
    highest praise. However, none of this is unique. Such ideas
    are to be found, sometimes more fully, in the teachings of
    the Buddha, Confucius, Lao Tzu, Mahavira, Guru Nanak etc,
    most of whom lived centuries before Jesus. What is good in
    Jesus' teachings is not unique and what is unique is not
    particularly good. </p>
    <p>Christians have great difficulty understanding why
    Buddhists and other non-Christians cannot accept Jesus as the
    Lord and saviour as they themselves do. But when we read the
    life and teachings of the Buddha - a man who smiled at abuse,
    remained calm when provoked and who always discouraged
    violence - the reason for their rejection becomes clear.</p>
