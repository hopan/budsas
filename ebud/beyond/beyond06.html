    BIBLE</b></font></p>
    <hr width="25%">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Christianity is a book-based religion. There is no
    evidence for the claims and dogmas of Christianity other than
    what is said in the Bible and this fact alone makes this book
    the bedrock of Christianity. In the past as today Christians
    have picked through the Bible arguing with each other over
    the meaning of its phrases and words and tried to convince
    non-Christians of the truth of a book that they cannot even
    agree about themselves. But one thing which all Christians
    agree about is that the Bible <i>is </i>God's word - not that
    it contains God's word, but that it is God's word, an
    infallible and complete revelation given to man by God. We
    will examine this claim and show that like most of the claims
    made by Christians it has very little substance to it at all.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Is it God's Word?</b></font></p>
    <p>If the Bible really is God's word it indicates that he is
    a very strange being indeed. One would expect that the
    creator of the universe would only speak to man when he had
    something of great importance to say and that what he said
    would be of universal significance. Not so. The book of
    Chronicles for example consists of little more than lists of
    names of people we know little or nothing about and who died
    thousands of years ago. No commandments, no ethical
    principles, no hints on how to live properly or to worship
    God - just page after page of useless names. Why would God
    waste his and our time revealing such things? And what about
    the Songs of Solomon? This book consists of a collection of
    erotic love poetry. Once again, with the world in such a mess
    one would have supposed that God could have thought of
    something more important to say to man than this.</p>
    <p>Then we come to the Gospels which recount the life of
    Jesus. Why has God decided to reveal the whole of Jesus'
    biography, not once, but four times? And why has he revealed
    what are, quite clearly, four different and contradictory
    versions of the same story? Unlike Christians, historians
    have given perfectly plausible answers to these questions.
    The Bible is not a revelation from God, rather it is a
    compilation, a fairly untidy compilation, written by many
    different people, over many centuries, changed and edited
    from time to time, and containing legends, stories,
    genealogies, fables, sacred and secular writings. It is no
    more a revelation from God than are the Iliad or the Odyssey,
    the Ramayana or the Mahabharata, books which the Bible
    resembles quite closely.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Is the Bible Inspired?</b></font></p>
    <p>Christians claim that although the books of the Bible were
    actually written by different people, these people were
    inspired and guided by God as they wrote. While contemporary
    Christians make this claim, the ancient authors of the Bible
    never did. For example Luke says at the beginning of his
    Gospel:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Insomuch as many have undertaken to compile a
        narrative of the things which have been accomplished
        among us.....it seemed good to me also having followed
        all things closely for some time past, to write an
        orderly account for you..... (Lk 1:1-3).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Nothing about being filled with the spirit of God either
    before or while he wrote, he simply says that others had
    written accounts of the life of Jesus so he thought it might
    be a good idea if he wrote something also. If he <i>really </i>was
    inspired by God to write the Gospel why didn't he say so? But
    the claim of inspiration is not just unsubstantiated, it also
    raises a very serious problem. Christians are always claiming
    that in prayer God speaks to them, gives them advice and
    tells them what to do. They claim that his voice is very
    direct, very clear and very real. But if they <i>really </i>have
    no doubt that God is communicating with them surely his words
    should be recorded and included in the Bible. The Bible
    contains words God spoke to Moses, Joshua, Matthew, Mark
    Peter and Paul so why shouldn't the words he speaks to modern
    day Christians be included also? Christians will balk at such
    a suggestion which indicates that they are not so convinced
    that the words they hear in their hearts really do come from
    God after all.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>One Bible or Several?</b></font></p>
    <p>In ancient times there was no standardized version of the
    Old Testament. Different Jewish groups and different regions
    had their own versions. There were the Septuagint, the
    Aquila, Theodotion's version and Symmachu's version, all
    containing different text and different numbers of books. The
    Old Testament used by modern Christians is based on the
    Massonetic version which only appeared after the Jamnia Synod
    at the end of the 1st century AD. The New Testament did not
    appear in its present form until the year 404 AD, nearly four
    hundred years after the death of Jesus. Before that time, the
    Gospels of Thomas, the Gospel of Nicodemus, the Acts of
    Peter, the Acts of Paul and a dozen other books were included
    in the Bible. In 404 AD these books were simply cut out of
    the Bible because they contained teachings that were contrary
    to Christian theology of that time. One of the oldest
    existing Bibles, The Codex Sinaiticus, includes the Epistle
    of Barnabas, a book that is not included in the modern Bible.
    If these books were considered to be revelation by early
    Christians why don't modern Christians consider them to be
    revelation?</p>
    <p>When we look at the Bibles used by modern Christians we
    find that there are several different versions. The Bible
    used by the Ethiopian Church, one of the most ancient of all
    churches, contains the Books of Enoch and the Shepherd of
    Hermas which are not found in the versions used by Catholics
    and Protestants. The Bible used in the Catholic Church
    contains the books of Judith, Tobias, Banuch, etc which have
    been cut out of the Bible used in Protestant churches. Prof.
    H.L. Drummingwright of the Southwestern Baptist Theological
    Seminary in his introduction to the Bible explains how these
    books came to be cut out of the Bible used by the
    Protestants. These books were, he says, &quot;in most
    Protestant Bibles until the 19th century, when publishers,
    led by the British and Foreign Bible Society voluntarily
    began to omit them&quot;. Once again, these books contained
    ideas which the churches did not like so they just cut them
    out. How can a book like Judith be the infallible word of God
    one moment and not the next? Why are there so many different
    versions of the Bible? And which version is the infallible
    word of God?</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Are There Mistakes in the Bible?</b></font></p>
    <p>We have seen previously that there are many mistakes in
    the Bible but we will have a look at three more examples of
    its inaccuracies. Today, even schoolchildren know that the
    earth moves; it moves on its axis and at the same time it
    moves around the sun. We also know that the tectonic plates
    on the earth's surface move also. The Bible however, clearly
    states that the earth does not move. In 1 Chronicles 16:30
    the Bible says, &quot;The world is firmly established, it
    cannot be moved.&quot; (See also Ps 93:1, 96:10 and 104:5).</p>
    <p>Here, and in many places, the Bible contradicts scientific
    fact. Moreover the Bible does not just contradict scientific
    fact it also <i>contradicts itself</i>. Let us have a look at
    the creation story. In the first book of the Bible it says
    that God created all the plants and trees on the third day
    (Gen 1:11-13), all birds, animals and fish on the fifth day
    (Gen 1:20-23) and finally, man and woman on the sixth day
    (Gen 1:26-27). Yet a little further on the Bible gives a
    different version of the creation story saying that God
    created man first (Gen 2:7), then all plants and trees (Gen
    2:9), after that all birds and animals (Gen 2:19) and only
    then did God create woman (Gen 2:21-22). These two versions
    of the creation story clearly contradict each other.</p>
    <p>Now let us have a look at the story of Noah's Ark. In one
    place in the Bible we are told that Noah took two of every
    animal and put them in the ark (Gen 6;19). Later the Bible
    says Noah took seven pairs of all clean animals and birds and
    two of all other creatures and put them in the ark (Gen 7:2).
    Again the Bible is contradicting itself Christians will
    object to this saying that these and the numerous other
    mistakes in the Bible are only small and of no significance.
    However, only one mistake is required to show that the Bible
    is not infallible. Also, if mistakes can be made in small
    matters they can be made in important matters. And, finally,
    one mistake is proof either that the Bible is not the word of
    God or that God is capable of mistakes.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Is the Bible Reliable Testimony?</b></font></p>
    <p>We have seen that the Bible is not infallible and
    therefore cannot be revelation. So if it is not God's word
    whose word is it? Many of the books in the Bible are named
    after different people who are supposed to have written them.
    So the Gospel of Matthew is supposed to have been written by
    Matthew, one of the disciples of Jesus. The Gospel of Mark is
    supposed to have been written by Mark, another of Jesus'
    disciples, and so on.</p>
    <p>The Christian could claim that even if the Bible is not
    necessarily infallible revelation it is the testimony of
    reliable people, They could claim that Matthew, Mark, Luke
    and John knew Jesus well, they lived with him for several
    years, they heard his teachings and they wrote down what they
    saw and heard and that there is no reason for them to lie or
    exaggerate. Therefore, Christians could claim that the Bible
    is reliable testimony. Except that for testimony to be
    reliable it must come from reliable people, people we could
    trust, people from good backgrounds. Were the disciples of
    Jesus such people? Let us look.</p>
    <p>Some of Jesus' disciples were tax collectors (Matt 9:9), a
    dishonest and despised class of men (Matt 18;17); others were
    mere illiterate fishermen (Mk 1:16-17). Simon was a Zealot
    (Lk 6:15), a group of men known for their fanatical and often
    violent opposition to Roman rule, and like many people
    involved in illegal politics he used an alias and was also
    known as Peter (Matt 10:2). Peter and James were given the
    nicknames 'Boanerges' meaning 'sons of thunder' (Mk 3:17)
    once again suggesting their involvement in violent politics.
    When Jesus was arrested his disciples were carrying swords
    and were willing to use them (Matt 26:51). Hardly the sort of
    people with whom we would feel comfortable.</p>
    <p>Another thing that should make us wary of trusting the
    testimony of Jesus' disciples is that they seemed to be
    constantly misunderstanding what Jesus was saying (Mk 4:13,
    6:52, 8:15-17, 9:32; Lk 8:9, 9:45). They are supposed to have
    seen Jesus perform the most amazing miracles and yet despite
    this they still doubted. Jesus scolded them and called them
    &quot;men of little faith&quot; (Matt 8:26, 17:20). Should we
    trust the writings of men who constantly failed to understand
    what was being said to them and whom even Jesus called men of
    little faith? If even the people who knew and saw Jesus had
    '&quot;little faith&quot; how could we, who have never seen
    him, be expected to have faith in him?</p>
    <p>How unreliable and faithless the people who wrote the
    Bible were is best illustrated by what they did just prior to
    and during Jesus' arrest. He asked them to keep watch but
    they fell asleep (Matt 26:36-43). After Jesus was arrested
    they lied and denied that they even knew him (Mk 14:66-72),
    and after his execution they simply went back to their
    fishing (Jn 21:2-3). And who betrayed Jesus in the first
    place? His disciple Judas (Matt 26:14-16). Association with
    sinners, liars and fools in order to help them, as Jesus did,
    is a good thing. But should we believe everything such people
    say?</p>
    <p>An even more disturbing thing about the disciples of Jesus
    is just how many of them were possessed by demons or devils
    from time to time. Mary Magdalene who later claimed to have
    seen Jesus rise from the dead, had been possessed by seven
    devils (Mk 16:9). Satan entered into Judas (Lk 22:3), tried
    to get into Simon (Lk 22:31) and Jesus once actually called
    Peter, his chief disciple, &quot;Satan&quot; (Matt 16:23)
    indicating that he too was possessed by a devil at that time.
    Whether possession by devils actually happens or whether it
    indicates serious psychological disorders as modern
    psychiatrists believe, either way it indicates that we should
    treat the words of Jesus' disciples with great caution.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Who Did Write the Bible?</b></font></p>
    <p>We have seen that the Bible is not infallible, is not
    revelation and is not the testimony of reliable, trustworthy
    people. We will now show that the Bible was not even written
    by the people who are claimed to have been its writers. Let
    us have a look at the first five books in the Bible: Genesis,
    Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. These five books
    describe the creation of the world, God's first revelation to
    man, and the early history of the tribe of Israel and are
    supposed to have been written by Moses. They are, in fact,
    often called 'The Books of Moses'. However, his authorship is
    clearly impossible, because in these books we have an account
    of Moses' death.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the
        land of Moab according to the word of the Lord, and they
        buried him in the valley in the land Moab opposite Beth
        Peor, but no man knows the place of his burial to this
        day (Deut 34:5-6).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>How could a man write an account of his own death and
    burial? The book of Deuteronomy, at least, must have been
    written by someone other than Moses.</p>
    <p>Now let us have a look at the New Testament. The Gospel of
    Matthew is supposed to have been written by Matthew (tax
    collector, doubter, man of little faith), one of the
    disciples of Jesus. Yet we can easily demonstrate that
    Matthew could not have possibly have written the Gospel of
    Matthew. We read:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>As Jesus passed on from there he saw a man called
        Matthew sitting at the tax office and he said to him,
        &quot;Follow me&quot;. And he rose and followed him (Matt
        9:9).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Neither now nor in the past do people write in the third
    person. If Matthew had really written this we would expect it
    to read:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>As Jesus passed on from there he saw me sitting at the
        tax office and he said to <i>me</i>, &quot;Follow
        me&quot;. And <i>I </i>rose and followed him.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Obviously this was not written by Matthew but by some
    third person. Who this third person is we do not know but
    Bible scholars have made a guess. In the preface to his
    translation of the Gospel of Matthew the distinguished Bible
    scholar J.B. Phillips says:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Early tradition ascribes this Gospel to the apostle
        Matthew but scholars nowadays almost all reject this
        view. The author, who we still can conveniently call
        Matthew has plainly drawn on a collection of oral
        traditions. He has used Mark's Gospel freely, though he
        has rearranged the order of events, and has in several
        instances used different words for what is plainly the
        same story.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is a deeply disturbing admission, especially coming
    from an eminent Christian Bible scholar. We are told that
    &quot;almost all&quot; modern Bible scholars reject the idea
    that the Gospel of Matthew was actually written by Matthew.
    We are told that although the real author is unknown it is
    &quot;convenient&quot; to keep calling him Matthew. Next we
    are told that whoever wrote the Gospel of Matthew has
    &quot;freely&quot; copied much of his material from the
    Gospel of Mark. In other words, the Gospel of Matthew is just
    a plagiarism where material has been &quot;rearranged&quot;
    and restated in &quot;different words&quot;. So apparently in
    the Gospel of Matthew not only do we not have the words of
    God, we don't even have the words of Matthew.</p>
    <p>To the credit of Bible scholars like Prof. J.B. Phillips,
    they freely admit these and other major doubts about
    authorship of the Bible, but such admissions make the claim
    that the Gospels were written by the disciples of Jesus
    clearly untrue.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Mistakes and Variations in the
    Bible</b></font></p>
    <p>If we look at the bottom of the pages in most Bibles we
    will find many notes. These notes indicate mistakes,
    variations or doubtful readings in the text of the Bible. And
    there are literally hundreds of them. Some of the mistakes or
    variations consist of only a few words but some of them are
    long passages (see for example the notes to Luke 9:55-56;
    John 5:3; Acts 24:6; 1 Corinthians 8:36-38; 11:4-7; 2
    Corinthians 10:13-15). Also notice that the notes to Mark
    16:9-20 mention that this long passage is not found in the
    ancient Bible. In other words, this long passage in the Bible
    was added at a later time. How can Christians honestly claim
    that the Bible is infallible and without mistakes when all
    the mistakes are pointed out at the bottom of each page?</p>
    <p>In the New Testament Jesus and his disciples often quote
    the Old Testament in order to make a point or, more usually,
    to attempt to prove that the Old Testament prophesizes events
    in the life of Jesus. But when we compare these quotes with
    the original text of the Old Testament we find that they are
    almost always different. We will use here the New
    International Version of the Bible.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="center"><u>Old Testament</u></p>
        <p>But you, Bethlehem Ephasthah, though you are small
        among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one
        who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from old
        (Mic 5:2).</p>
        <p align="center"><u>New Testament</u></p>
        <p>But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah are by no
        means the least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you
        will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people
        Israel (Matt 2:6).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The quote in the New Testament contains not just different
    words, it also changes the meaning of the original. Has
    Matthew misquoted the Old Testament because he was not
    familiar with it and made a mistake? Has he deliberately
    misquoted in order to alter the meaning? Or is the Old
    Testament Matthew used different from the one we have today?
    The New Testament quotes the Old Testament dozens of times
    and hardly a single quote is accurate. Christians will
    protest and say that these changes are only minor and of no
    importance. Perhaps so, but these are proofs that the Bible
    does contain mistakes, contrary to what Christians say. Also,
    it is strange that Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and Paul, who
    according to Christians were inspired by God to write the New
    Testament, could not even quote the Old Testament correctly.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Changing the Lord's Prayer</b></font></p>
    <p>Jesus taught his disciples the Lord's Prayer before he
    died and since that time generations of Christians have
    learned the prayer by heart. But anyone who learnt it by
    heart 20 years ago will have to learn it again because the
    Lord's Prayer has been changed. We will compare the original
    Lord's Prayer found in all Bibles until 20 years ago with the
    Lord's Prayer now in the New International Version of the
    Bible, and we will see that Christians have even tampered
    with this most important teaching of Jesus.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="center"><u>King James Version</u></p>
        <p>Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,
        Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in
        heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us
        our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against
        us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
        evil, for thine is the kingdom and the power, and the
        glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
        <p align="center"><u>The New International Version</u></p>
        <p>Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come. Give
        us each day our bread. Forgive us our sins, for we also
        forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not
        into temptation (Lk 11:2-5).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Notice that these phrases - &quot;who art in heaven&quot;,
    &quot;thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven&quot;,
    &quot;but deliver us from evil, for thine is the kingdom and
    the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen&quot; - have
    been cut out of the Lord's Prayer. We should ask our
    Christian friends <i>why </i>these verses have been cut out
    of the most famous and important of all Jesus' teachings. Ask
    them <i>which </i>of these two different versions of the
    Lord's Prayer is the infallible, unchanging word of God. Ask
    them <i>who </i>had knowledge and wisdom enough to tamper
    with the Bible. You will find that they have great
    difficulties answering your questions. Here as elsewhere, the
    reader is encouraged to go to the library and the bookshop,
    find different versions of the Bible and carefully compare
    them. We will see with our own eyes how much the Bibles
    differ as the result of tampering.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Cutting Verses Out of the Bible</b></font></p>
    <p>Proof that the Bible has been tampered with is found on
    every page if one looks carefully. The text of the Bible is
    arranged into chapters which in turn are arranged into
    verses. As we read we will sometimes notice that one or two
    verses are missing. On page are reproduced some pages from
    The New International Version of Bible printed by the New
    York International Bible Society. Notice that verses 44 and
    46 have been deleted from chapter 9 of the Gospel of Mark.
    Verse 37 has been cut out of chapter 8 of Acts and verse 28
    has been removed from chapter 15 of Mark. How can Christians
    possibly claim that the Bible is the infallible and
    unchanging word of God when they cut out inconvenient verses
    and words? And why have these verses been removed?</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Selective Interpreting</b></font></p>
    <p>Whenever Christians want to convince us of the truth of
    their religion they will quote from the Bible, believing as
    they do, that every word in the Bible is literally true. But
    when we quote from the Bible to prove that their religion is
    primitive, silly or illogical (e.g. that smoke comes out
    God's nose and fire comes out of his mouth, Ps 18:7-8; or
    that donkeys can talk, Num 22:28) the Christian will say:
    &quot;That's symbolic, it is not meant to be taken
    literally.&quot; Christians are very selective in how they
    interpret the Bible. Some passages are 'God's word' and
    literally true and other parts, usually the embarrassing
    parts, are not meant to be taken literally. Either the Bible
    is God's infallible word or it is not, one cannot pick and
    choose. And if indeed some passages are meant to be taken
    literally and others are not, how do Christians decide? If
    the stories about Balaam's donkey talking, Adam and Eve
    eating the apple, or Moses turning his stick into a snake are
    not meant to be taken literally, perhaps too, the stories
    about Jesus' resurrection are only symbolic and not meant to
    be taken literally.</p>
