    CHRISTIAN ARGUMENTS FOR GOD'S EXISTENCE</b></font></p>
    <hr width="25%">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Christians claim that there is an all-knowing, all-loving
    God who created and who controls the universe. Several
    arguments are used to prove this idea. We will examine each
    of these arguments and give the Buddhist objections to them. </p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>The Authority of the Bible</b></font></p>
    <p>When asked to prove God's existence, the Christian will
    often open the Bible and say &quot;The Bible says God exists,
    so he must.&quot; The problem is that if we ask a Hindu, a
    Muslim, a Sikh or a Jew the same question they too will point
    to their respective holy books as proof of the existence of
    their Gods. Why should we believe the Bible but not the holy
    books of all the other religions? Using the Bible to prove
    God's existence is only valid if we already accept that it
    alone contains God's words. However, we have no evidence that
    this is so. In fact, as we will demonstrate later, there is
    strong evidence that the Bible is a highly unreliable
    document.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>The Existence of the Universe</b></font></p>
    <p>In their attempts to prove God's existence, Christians
    will sometimes say &quot;The universe didn't just happen,
    someone must have made it and therefore there must be a
    creator God.&quot; There is a major flaw in this argument.
    When it starts to rain we do not ask &quot;Who is making it
    rain?&quot; because we know that rain is caused not by <i>someone</i>
    but by <i>something </i>- natural phenomena like heat,
    evaporation, precipitation, etc. When we see smooth stones in
    a river, we do not ask &quot;Who polished those stones?&quot;
    because we know that the smooth surface of the stones was
    caused not by <i>someone </i>but by <i>something </i>-
    natural causes like the abrasive action of water and sand.</p>
    <p>All of these things have a cause (or causes) but this need
    not be a being. It is the same with the universe - it was not
    brought into being by a God but by natural phenomena like
    nuclear fission, gravity, inertia, etc. However, even if we
    believe that a divine being is needed to explain how the
    universe came into existence, what proof is there that it was
    the Christian God? Perhaps it was created by the Hindu God,
    the God of Islam or one of the gods worshipped by tribal
    religions. After all most religions, not only Christianity
    claim that their God or gods created the universe.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>The Argument from Design</b></font></p>
    <p>In response to the above refutation, the Christian will
    maintain that the universe does not merely exist but its
    existence shows perfect design. There is, a Christian might
    say, an order and balance which point to its having been
    designed by a higher intelligence, and that this higher
    intelligence is God. But as before, there are some problems
    with this argument.</p>
    <p>Firstly, how does the Christian know that it was <i>his </i>God
    who is behind creation? Perhaps it was the gods of
    non-Christian religions who designed and created the
    universe.</p>
    <p>Secondly, how does the Christian know that only <i>one </i>God
    designed everything? In fact, as the universe is so intricate
    and complex we could expect it to need the intelligence of
    several, perhaps dozens, of gods to design it. So if anything
    the argument from design proves that there are many gods, not
    one as Christians claim.</p>
    <p>Next, we would have to ask, is the universe perfectly
    designed? We must ask this because if a perfect God designed
    and created the universe, then that universe should be
    perfect. Let us first look at inanimate phenomena to see
    whether they show perfect design. Rain gives us pure water to
    drink but sometimes it rains too much and people lose their
    lives, their homes and their means of livelihood in floods.
    At other times it doesn't rain at all and millions die in
    drought and famine. Is this perfect design? The mountains
    give us joy as we see them reaching up into the sky. But
    landslides and volcanic eruptions have for centuries caused
    havoc and death. Is this perfect design? The gentle breezes
    cool us but storms and tornadoes repeatedly cause death and
    destruction. Is this perfect design? These and other natural
    calamities prove that inanimate phenomena do not exhibit
    perfect design and therefore that they were not created by a
    perfect God.</p>
    <p>Now let us look at animate phenomena to see whether they
    reveal perfect design. At a superficial glance, nature seems
    to be beautiful and harmonious; all creatures are provided
    for and each has its task to perform. However, as any
    biologist will confirm, nature is utterly ruthless. To live,
    each creature has to feed on other creatures and struggle to
    avoid being eaten by other creatures. In nature, there is no
    time for pity, love or mercy. If a loving God designed
    everything, why did such a cruel design result? The animal
    kingdom is not only imperfect in the ethical sense, it is
    also imperfect in that it often goes wrong. Every year
    millions of babies are born with physical or mental
    disabilities, or are stillborn or die soon after birth. Why
    would a perfect creator God design such terrible things?</p>
    <p>So if there is design in the universe, much of it is
    faulty and cruel. This would seem to indicate that the
    universe was not created by a perfect all-loving God.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><strong><b>The First Cause Argument</b></strong></font></p>
    <p>Christians will sometimes say that everything has a cause,
    that there must be a first cause, and that God is the first
    cause. This old argument contains its own refutation, for if
    everything has a first cause then the first cause must also
    have a cause.</p>
    <p>There is another problem with the first cause argument.
    Logically there is no good reason to assume that everything
    had a <i>single </i>first cause. Perhaps six, ten or three
    hundred causes occurring simultaneously caused everything.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Miracles</b></font></p>
    <p>Christians claim that miracles are sometimes performed in
    God's name and that the fact that this happens proves that
    God exists. This is an appealing argument until it is looked
    at a little more closely.</p>
    <p>While Christians are quick to claim that because of their
    prayers the blind could see, the deaf could hear and crooked
    limbs were straightened, they are very slow in producing
    evidence to back up their claims. In fact, some Christians
    are so anxious to prove that miracles have occurred at their
    prayer meetings that the truth often gets lost in a flood of
    wild claims, extravagant boasts, and sometimes even conscious
    lies.</p>
    <p>It is true that things which are unusual and difficult to
    explain do sometimes happen during religious events - but not
    just for Christians. Hindus, Muslims, Taoists, etc. all claim
    that their God or gods sometimes perform miracles.
    Christianity certainly does not have a monopoly on miracles.
    So, if miracles performed in God's name prove the existence
    of the Christian God, then miracles performed in the name of
    numerous other gods must likewise prove that they too exist.</p>
    <p>Christians may try to overcome this fact by claiming that,
    when miracles occur in other religions, they are done through
    the power of the Devil. Perhaps the best way to counter this
    claim is to quote the Bible. When Jesus healed the sick, his
    enemies accused him of doing this through the power of the
    Devil. He answered that healing the sick results in good and
    if the Devil went around doing good he would destroy himself
    (Mk 3:22-26). Therefore the same could be said for the
    miracles performed by Hindus, Jews or Sikhs. If these
    miracles result in good, how can they be the work of the
    Devil?</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>The Argument for God's Necessity</b></font></p>
    <p>Christians will often claim that only by believing in God
    will people have the strength to deal with life's problems,
    and therefore that belief in God is necessary. This claim is
    apparently supported by numerous books written by Christians
    who have endured and overcome various crises through the
    power of God. Some of these books make highly inspiring
    reading, so the claim that one can cope with problems only
    with God's help sounds rather convincing - until we look a
    little more deeply.</p>
    <p>If this claim is true, we would expect most of the
    non-Christian people of the world to lead lives of emotional
    distress, confusion and hopelessness while most Christians
    through their faith in God would be able to unfailingly deal
    with their problems and to never need to seek help from
    counsellors or psychiatrists. It is clear, however, that
    people from non-Christian religions and even those with no
    religion are just as capable of dealing with life's crises as
    Christians are - sometimes even better. It is also sometimes
    the case that people who are devout Christians lose their
    faith in God after being confronted with serious personal
    problems. Consequently, the claim that belief in God is
    necessary to cope with and overcome problems is baseless.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>The &quot;Try and Disprove&quot;
    Argument</b></font></p>
    <p>When Christians find they cannot prove God's existence
    with doubtful facts or logic, they may switch tactics and say
    &quot;Perhaps it can't be proved that God exists, but neither
    can you disprove it&quot;. This of course is quite true. You
    cannot prove that God doesn't exist - but neither can you
    prove that the gods of Taoism, Hinduism and a dozen other
    religions do not exist. In other words, despite all the
    hyperbole, the extravagant claims and the confident
    proclamations, there is no more evidence for the existence of
    the Christian God than there is for the gods worshipped in
    other religions.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>The Testimony</b></font></p>
    <p>After everything else has failed, the Christian may
    finally try to convince us that God exists by appealing to
    the emotions. Such a person will say, perhaps quite
    truthfully, &quot;I used to be unhappy and discontented but
    after giving myself to God I am happy and at peace with
    myself.&quot; Such testimonies can be deeply moving, but what
    do they prove? There are millions of people whose lives
    became equally happy and meaningful after they embraced
    Buddhism, Hinduism or Islam. Likewise, there are no doubt
    many people whose lives have <i>not </i>changed for the
    better after they became Christians - the same weaknesses and
    problems sometimes remain. So this argument, like all the
    others, does not prove the existence of the Christian God.</p>
