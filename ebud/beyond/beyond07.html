    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Christianity is based upon certain supposed historical
    events (the virgin birth, the resurrection, etc), the only
    record of which is an allegedly reliable document called the
    Bible. If these events can be shown to have never occurred,
    and if the documents recording these events can be shown to
    be unreliable, then Christianity will collapse. In this book
    we have seen that the claims are at best highly doubtful and
    at worst demonstrably wrong.</p>
    <p>When we examine the teachings of the Buddha we find an
    entirely different situation. Even if we were able to prove
    that the Buddha never existed or that there were mistakes in
    the Buddhist scriptures this would in no way undermine
    Buddhism. And why? Because Buddhism is not primarily about
    the historical Buddha or about events which happened in the
    past; rather, it is about human suffering, what causes that
    suffering, and how it can be overcome so that humans can be
    free, happy and radiant. If we wish to verify or understand
    Buddhism we don't pick through scriptures squabbling about
    the meaning of words or phrases; rather, we become sensitive
    to our own experience. Let us examine the four principles
    which are the doctrinal basis of Buddhism.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>(i) When we die we are reborn</b></font></p>
    <p>Christians believe that when people die they have only one
    or the other of two possible destinies - heaven or hell. They
    believe that these destinies are eternal and that one goes to
    one's destiny according to God's judgement.</p>
    <p>Buddhism teaches that when people die they can have a
    variety of destinies (heaven, hell, as a human being, as an
    animal, etc). It teaches that none of these destinies is
    eternal and that, having finished one's time in one of these
    realms, one will die and pass to another. It also teaches
    that one's destiny is conditioned by one's kamma (i.e., the
    sum total of the good or bad that one has done during one's
    life). This means that <i>all </i>good people, no matter what
    their religion, will have a good destiny. It also means that
    even those who have done evil will have a chance to become
    good in the next life.</p>
    <p>Christians scoff at the idea of being reborn and say that
    there is no evidence that such a thing happens. But the idea
    of rebirth is not so different from the Christian afterlife
    belief - if people after death can become angels in heaven,
    why can't they become humans on earth? And as for evidence,
    there is certainly no evidence for the Christian afterlife
    theory while there is some evidence that people can be reborn
    (see <i>Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation</i>,
    University Press of Virginia, Charlotteville U.S.A., 1975).</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>(ii) Life is suffering</b></font></p>
    <p>The next principle upon which Buddhism is based is the
    idea that life is suffering. Although Christians accuse
    Buddhists of being pessimistic for saying this, life's
    inherent unsatisfactoriness is in fact confirmed by the
    Bible: &quot;In the world you will have tribulation&quot; (Jn
    16:33); &quot;Man is born to trouble as sparks fly
    upwards&quot; (Job 5:7); &quot;All things are full of
    weariness&quot; (Ecc 1:8); &quot;the earth mourns and
    withers, the world languishes and withers; the heavens
    languish together with the earth&quot; (Is 24:4). But while
    both religions agree on this point they disagree on why
    suffering exists.</p>
    <p>Christianity relies on what is plainly a myth to explain
    the origin of evil and suffering, claiming that they are due
    to Adam and Eve having eaten an apple. Buddhism sees
    suffering as a psychological phenomenon with a psychological
    cause - wanting, craving and desire. And our <i>experience </i>tells
    us that this is so. When we want something and cannot get it
    we feel frustration, and the stronger the wanting the
    stronger the frustration. Even if we get what we want we soon
    grow tired of it and begin to want something else. Even
    physical suffering is caused by craving because the strong
    craving to live causes us to be reborn and when we are reborn
    we become subject to sickness, accidents, old age, etc.
    Buddhism says that even the bliss of heaven is impermanent
    and imperfect, a fact confirmed by the Bible. The Bible tells
    us that Satan was originally a heavenly angel but that he
    rebelled against God (i.e. he was dissatisfied) and was cast
    out of heaven (i.e. existence in heaven need not be eternal).
    If having been in heaven one can fall from that state this
    proves that heaven is not, as Christians claim, perfect and
    everlasting (see Is 14:12-15, II Pet 2:4, Jude 6, Rev 12:9).</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>(iii) Suffering can be overcome</b></font></p>
    <p>The third principle upon which Buddhism is based is the
    idea that it is possible to be free from suffering. When
    craving and wanting stop, one's life becomes more content and
    happy, and at death one is no longer reborn. This state of
    complete freedom from suffering is called Nirvana and is
    described by the Buddha as being &quot;the highest
    happiness&quot; (Dhammapada 203). Christians often mistakenly
    think that Nirvana is a blank nothingness and accuse Buddhism
    of being nihilistic. This misunderstanding arises because of
    their inability to conceive of an afterlife more subtle than
    their own naive heaven - a place &quot;up there&quot; (Ps
    14:2, 53:2) with doors and windows (Gen 28:17, Rev 4:1, 2 Kg
    7:2, Mal 3:10), where God sits on a throne (Rev 4:2)
    surrounded by Christians in beautiful gowns with crowns on
    their heads playing trumpets (Rev 4:4). The Buddha
    categorically said that Nirvana is not nihilistic.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>When one has freed the mind, the gods cannot trace
        him, even though they think: &quot;This is the
        consciousness attached to the enlightened one
        (Buddha).&quot; And why? It is because the enlightened
        one is untraceable. Although I say this, there are some
        recluses and religious teachers who misrepresent me
        falsely, contrary to fact, saying: &quot;The monk Gotama
        (Buddha) is a nihilist because he teaches the cutting
        off, the destruction, the disappearance of the existing
        entity.&quot; But this is exactly what I do not say. Both
        now and in the past, I simply teach suffering and the
        overcoming of suffering (Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta No.22).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>But he also said that Nirvana is not the crude 'eternal
    life' as portrayed in Christianity. It is an utterly pure and
    blissful state which no conventional language can adequately
    describe.</p>
    <p>Christians sometimes claim that Buddhism contradicts
    itself because in wanting to attain Nirvana one is
    strengthening the very thing which prevents one from
    attaining it. This point was raised at the time of the Buddha
    and answered by one of his chief disciples, Ananda.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A priest asked Venerable Ananda: &quot;What is the aim
        of living the holy life under the monk Gotama?&quot; -
        &quot;It is for the sake of abandoning desire.&quot; -
        &quot;Is there a way, a practice by which to abandon this
        desire?&quot; - &quot;There is a way - it is by means of
        the psychic powers of desire, energy, thought and
        consideration together with concentration and
        effort.&quot; - &quot;If that is so, Venerable Ananda,
        then it is a task without end. Because to get rid of one
        desire by means of another is impossible.&quot; -
        &quot;Then I will ask you a question; answer as you like.
        Before, did you have the desire, the energy, the thought
        and consideration to come to this park? And having
        arrived, did not that desire, that energy, that thought
        and that consideration cease?&quot; - &quot;Yes, it
        did.&quot; - &quot;Well, for one who has destroyed the
        defilements, once he has won enlightenment, that desire,
        that energy, that thought and that consideration he had
        for enlightenment has now ceased&quot; (Samyutta Nikaya,
        Book Seven, Sutta No. 15).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>(iv) There is a way to overcome
    suffering</b></font></p>
    <p>The last of the four principles which form the basis of
    Buddhism tells us how to eliminate craving and thereby be
    free from suffering both in this life and in the future. The
    first three principles are how the Buddhist sees the world
    and the human predicament while the last principle is what
    the Buddhist decides to do about it. And the Buddhist
    response to suffering is to walk the Noble Eightfold Path.
    This practical and universally valid system of training
    comprises the development of Right Understanding, Right
    Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right
    Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration. We will
    look briefly at each of these steps.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Right Understanding</b></font></p>
    <p>If we persist in believing that evil and suffering are due
    to something Adam and Eve did, or that they are caused by
    devils, we will never be able to overcome them. When we come
    to understand that we inflict suffering upon ourselves
    through our ignorance and craving, we have taken the first
    step in overcoming that suffering. Knowing the true cause of
    a problem is the beginning of overcoming it. And it is not
    sufficient to just believe - we must strive to <i>understand</i>.
    Understanding requires intelligence, careful observation,
    weighing up the facts, openness; and in trying to develop
    insight, these qualities are strengthened.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Right Thought, Speech and Action</b></font></p>
    <p>The next three steps on the Noble Eightfold Path embody
    Buddhism's ethical teachings. Christians often try to give
    the impression that theirs are the only ethics which revolve
    around gentleness, love and forgiveness. However, the truth
    is that 500 years before Jesus the Buddha taught a
    love-centred ethic as good as and in some ways more complete
    than that of Christianity. To practise Right Thought we must
    fill our minds with thoughts of love and compassion.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Develop a mind full of love, be compassionate and
        restrained by virtue, arouse your energy, be resolute and
        always firm in making progress (Theragata 979).</p>
        <p>When with a mind full of love one feels compassion for
        the whole world - above, below and across, unlimited
        everywhere, filled with infinite kindness, complete and
        well-developed; any limited actions one may have done do
        not remain lingering in one's mind (Jataka 37,38).</p>
        <p>Just as water cools both good and bad and washes away
        all dirt and dust, in the same way you should develop
        thoughts of love to friend and foe alike, and having
        reached perfection in love you will attain enlightenment
        (Jataka Nidanakatha 168-169).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In practising Right Speech we should use our words only in
    ways which promote honesty, kindness and peace. The Buddha
    described Right Speech like this.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If words have five characteristics they are
        well-spoken, not ill-spoken, neither blamed nor condemned
        by the wise, they are spoken at the right time, they are
        truthful, they are gentle, they are to the point, and
        they are motivated by love (Anguttara Nikaya, Book of
        Fives, Sutta 198).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>With a beauty and comprehensiveness typical of the Buddha
    he describes the person who strives to develop Right Speech
    like this.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Giving up lying, one becomes a speaker of the truth,
        reliable, trustworthy, dependable, not a deceiver of the
        world. Giving up slander, one does not repeat there what
        is heard here, or repeat here what is heard there, for
        the purpose of causing divisions between people. Thus,
        one is a reconciler of those who are divided and a
        combiner of those already united, rejoicing in peace,
        delighting in peace, promoting peace; peace is the motive
        of his speech. Giving up harsh speech, one speaks what is
        blameless, pleasant to the ear, agreeable, going to the
        heart, urbane, pleasing and liked by all. Giving up
        useless chatter, one speaks at the right time, about the
        facts, to the point, about Dhamma and discipline, words
        worthy of being treasured up, seasonable, reasoned,
        clearly defined and connected to the goal (Digha Nikaya,
        Sutta No.1).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Right Action requires that we avoid killing, stealing and
    sexual misconduct and that we practise gentleness,
    generosity, self-control and helpfulness towards others.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Right Livelihood</b></font></p>
    <p>To practise Right Livelihood one will do work which is
    ethically wholesome and which produces something which does
    not harm society or the environment. An employer will pay his
    workers fairly, treat them with respect and make sure their
    working conditions are safe. An employee on the other hand
    will work honestly and diligently (see Digha Nikaya, Sutta
    No. 31). One should also use one's income responsibly -
    providing for one's needs, saving some and giving some to
    charity (see page ).</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Right Effort</b></font></p>
    <p>Christian beliefs about God and man make human effort
    inconsequential. Humans are by nature depraved and evil
    sinners.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>How can man be righteous before God. How can he who is
        born of a woman be clean? (Job 24:4).</p>
        <p>The heart is deceitful above all things, and
        desperately corrupt (Jer 17:9).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Being nothing more than a maggot (Job 25:6) humans are
    incapable of being good, and can be saved not through their
    own efforts but only through the grace of God. Buddhism, by
    contrast, sees human nature as primarily good and in the
    right conditions more likely to do good than evil (see
    Milindapanha 84). In Christianity humans are held responsible
    for the evil they have done throughout their lives but they
    are also held responsible for and likely to be punished for
    the sins of Adam and Eve. In Buddhism people take
    responsibility only for their own actions and, as human
    nature is basically good, this means that effort, exertion
    and diligence are of great importance. The Buddha says:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Abandon wrong. It can be done. If it were impossible
        to do, I would not urge you to do so. But since it can be
        done, I say to you: &quot;Abandon wrong&quot;. If
        abandoning wrong brought loss and sorrow, I would not
        urge you to do so. But since it conduces to benefit and
        happiness, I urge you: &quot;Abandon wrong.&quot;
        Cultivate the good. It can be done. If it were impossible
        to do, I would not urge you to do so. But since it can be
        done, I say to you: &quot;Cultivate the good.&quot; If
        cultivating the good brought loss and sorrow, I would not
        urge you to do so. But since it conduces to benefit and
        happiness, I urge you: &quot;Cultivate good.&quot;
        (Anguttara Nikaya, Book of Twos, Sutta No. 9).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Right Mindfulness and
    Concentration</b></font></p>
    <p>The last two steps on the Noble Eightfold Path jointly
    refer to meditation, the conscious and gentle practice of
    firstly coming to know the mind, then controlling it, and
    finally transforming it. Although the word meditation occurs
    about twenty times in the Bible, it seems to refer only to
    the simplistic practice of ruminating over passages from the
    scriptures (e.g. Josh 1:8). The Bible seems to be almost
    completely devoid of the sophisticated meditation techniques
    found in the Buddhist scriptures. Consequently when
    Christians are plagued by evil desires or troubled by
    stubborn negative thoughts, about all they can do is pray
    harder. This absence of meditation is also the reason why
    Christians so often appear agitated and lacking in the quiet
    dignity which is characteristic of Buddhists. God says
    &quot;Be still and know that I am God&quot; (Ps 46:10) but
    Christians can't seem to sit still, let alone still their
    minds, for a moment. God also says &quot;Commune with your
    own heart on your beds and be still&quot; (Ps 4:4) which is
    exactly what Buddhists do when they meditate. But Christian
    services and prayer meetings often seem like a cross between
    a rock concert and a riot, with the pastor shouting and
    wildly gesticulating while the people in the congregation
    sway back and forth, 'speak in tongues', weep and clap their
    hands.</p>
    <p>The great advantage of Buddhism is that it not only
    advises us to be calm, peaceful, free from unruly desires and
    self-aware but it also shows us how to develop these states.
    There are meditations to induce calm, to modify specific
    mental defilements, encourage positive mental states, and to
    change attitudes. And of course when the mind is calm and
    free from prejudices, preconceived ideas and distorting
    passions it is more likely to see things as they really are.
    It is not surprising that many of the meditation techniques
    taught by the Buddha are now being used by psychologists,
    psychiatrists and counsellors.</p>
