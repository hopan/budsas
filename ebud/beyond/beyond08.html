    ANSWER THE EVANGELISTS</b></strong></font></p>
    <hr width="25%">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As part of their efforts to promote their faith,
    evangelical Christians often ask Buddhists questions intended
    to confuse or discourage them. We will look at some of these
    questions and comments and give effective Buddhist responses.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>You do not believe in God so
    you cannot explain how the world began ...</strong></font></p>
    <p>-- It is true that Christianity has an explanation about
    how everything began. But is this explanation correct? Let us
    examine it. The Bible says that God created everything in six
    days and on the seventh day he rested. This quaint story is
    nothing more than a myth and is no more true than the Hindu
    myth that the gods created everything by churning a sea of
    milk, or the classical belief that the universe hatched out
    of a cosmic egg.</p>
    <p>Some parts of the creation myth are plainly absurd. For
    example it is said that on the first day God created light
    and darkness but on the fourth day he created the sun (Gen
    1:15-16). How can there be day and night without the sun? The
    creation myth also contradicts modern science which has
    proven how the universe began and how life evolved. There are
    no departments of astronomy or biology in any of the world's
    universities which teach the creation myth for the simple
    reason that it is not based on fact. So while it is true that
    Christianity has an explanation for how everything began (as
    do most religions) that explanation is just a myth.</p>
    <p>Then what does Buddhism sat about how everything began?
    Buddhism says little on this subject and for a very good
    reason. The aim of Buddhism is to develop wisdom and
    compassion and thereby attain Nirvana. Knowing how the
    universe began can contribute nothing to this task.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Once a man demanded that the Buddha tell him how the
        universe began. The Buddha said to him &quot;You are like
        a man who has been shot with a poison arrow and who, when
        the doctor comes to remove it, says 'Wait! Before the
        arrow is removed I want to know the name of the man who
        shot it, what clan he comes from, which village he was
        born in. I want to know what type of wood his bow is made
        from, what feathers are on the end of the arrow, how long
        the arrows are, etc etc etc.' That man would die before
        all these questions could be answered. My job is to help
        you to remove the arrow of suffering from yourself&quot;
        (Majjhima Nikaya Sutta No. 63).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Buddhism concentrates on helping us solve the practical
    problems of living - it does not encourage useless
    speculation. And if a Buddhist did wish to know how and when
    the universe began he would ask a scientist.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Buddhism is impractical because
    it says you cannot even kill an ant ...</b></font></p>
    <p>-- Before we defend Buddhism against the charge of being
    impractical, let us see if Christianity is practical.
    According to Jesus if someone slaps us on the cheek we should
    turn the other cheek and let them slap us there also (Matt
    5;25). If we discover that someone has stolen our pants we
    should go out and give the thief our shirt too (Matt 5:40).
    If we ourselves cannot resist stealing we should cut off our
    hands (Matt 5:30). We could call all these teachings
    impractical although Christians would probably prefer to call
    them challenging. And of course they would be right. To turn
    the other cheek when someone assaults us is not easy. It
    requires that we control our anger and doing this helps to
    develop patience, humility, non-retaliation and love. If we
    are never challenged we will never grow.</p>
    <p>The Buddha asked us to have respect for all life, even for
    humble creatures. As with turning the other cheek, this is
    not always easy. Like some people, creatures such as ants can
    be an irritating inconvenience. When we take the precept not
    to kill and try to practice it we are challenged to develop
    patience, humility, love, etc. So in asking us to respect all
    life, Buddhism is no more impractical than Christianity.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>The Buddha is dead so he cannot
    help you ...</b></font></p>
    <p>-- Buddhists sometimes have difficulty responding
    effectively when Christians say this to them. However if we
    know Dhamma well it will be quite easy to refute this claim
    because, like most Christian claims about Buddhism, it is
    based upon misunderstandings.</p>
    <p>Firstly, the Buddha is <strong><i>not</i></strong><i> </i>dead.
    He has attained Nirvana, a state of utter peace and freedom.
    The other name the Buddha gives Nirvana is the Deathless
    State (<i>Amita</i>) because after one attains it one is no
    longer subject to birth or death. Of course Nirvana is not
    the naive 'eternal life' described in the Bible, where the
    body is resurrected and where angels sing. In fact it is so
    subtle it is not easy to describe. However it is not
    non-existence, as the Buddha makes very clear (Majjhima
    Nikaya Sutta No.72; Sutta Nipata, verse 1076).</p>
    <p>It is equally untrue to say that the Buddha cannot help
    us. During his forty year career, the Buddha explained in
    great detail and with masterly clarity everything we need to
    attain Nirvana. All we need to do is to follow his
    instructions. His words are as helpful and as valid today as
    when he first spoke them. Of course the Buddha doesn't help
    us in the same way as Christians claim Jesus helps them, and
    for a very good reason. If a student knew that during the
    exams he could ask the teacher for the answers to the exam
    questions, he would never study and consequently would never
    learn. If an athlete knew that by merely asking for it the
    judge would give him the prize, he would never bother to
    train and develop his body. Simply giving people everything
    they ask for does not necessarily help them. In fact, it
    guarantees that they will remain weak, dependent and lazy. </p>
    <p>The Buddha pointed us to Nirvana and told us what
    provisions we would need for the journey. As we proceed, we
    will learn from our experiences and our mistakes, developing
    strength, maturity and wisdom as we do. Consequently when we
    finish our journey we will be completely different persons
    from when we started. Because of the Buddha's skilful help we
    will be fully enlightened.</p>
    <p>This statement that Christians make is not only wrong, but
    it also implies two things: that, in contrast to the Buddha,
    Jesus is alive and that he can and will help us. Let us look
    at these two assumptions. Christians claim that Jesus is
    alive but what evidence is there of this? They will say that
    the Bible proves that Jesus rose from the dead. Unfortunately
    statements written by a few people thousands of years ago
    don't prove anything. A statement in the Mahabharata (one of
    the Hindu holy books) says that a saint had a chariot which
    could fly. But does this prove that the ancient Indians
    invented the aeroplane? Of course it does not. The ancient
    Egyptian scriptures say that the god Khnum created everything
    out of clay which he shaped on a potters wheel. Does this
    prove that everything which exists is just mud? Of course it
    does not. A passage in the Old Testament says that a man
    named Balaam had a donkey which could talk. Is that
    conclusive proof that animals can speak? Of course it is not.</p>
    <p>We cannot uncritically accept claims made in the Bible any
    more than we can uncritically accept claims made in other
    sacred books. When we examine Bible claims about Jesus'
    supposed resurrection, we find very good reasons why we
    should not believe them (see page ). In fact, the Bible
    actually proves that Jesus is <i>not</i> alive. Just before
    he was crucified Jesus told his disciples that he would
    return before the last of them had died (Matt 10:23, Matt
    16:28, Lk 21:32). That was 2000 years ago. Jesus has still
    not returned. Why? Obviously because he is dead. </p>
    <p>The second assumption is that Jesus always responds when
    you pray to him. It is very easy to prove that this is not
    true. Christians die from sickness, suffer from misfortunes,
    have emotional problems, give in to temptations etc just as
    non-Christians do and despite the fact that they pray to
    Jesus for help. I have a friend who had been a devout
    Christian for many years. Gradually he began to doubt and he
    asked his pastor for help. The pastor instructed him to pray
    and even got members of the church to also pray for him. Yet
    despite all these prayers to Jesus for strength and guidance
    my friend's doubts increased and he eventually left the
    church. Later he became a Buddhist. If Jesus is really alive
    and ready to help why do Christians have just as many
    problems as non-Christians do? Why didn't Jesus answer my
    friend's prayers and help him to remain a Christian?
    Obviously because he is dead and cannot help.</p>
    <p>In answer to this objection Christians will say that there
    are people who can testify that their prayers have been
    answered. If this is true, it is also true that there are
    Muslims, Taoists, Sikhs, Hindus, Shintos and devotees of Kuan
    Yin who can say the same thing.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Unlike Christianity, Buddhism is
    so pessimistic ...</b></font></p>
    <p>-- According to Webster's Dictionary, pessimism is
    &quot;the belief that evil in life outweighs the good&quot;.
    It is interesting that Christians accuse Buddhism of being
    pessimistic because the idea that evil is more pervasive than
    good is one of the central doctrines of Christianity. Two of
    their favorite Bible quotes are &quot;All have sinned, all
    have fallen short of God's glory&quot; (Rom 3:10) and
    &quot;Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does
    good and never sins (Ecc 7:20). The doctrine of Original Sin
    teaches that all human beings are sinners, incapable of
    freeing themselves of sin, and that the evil in us is
    stronger than the good (Rom 7:14-24). Christians will say
    that while this is true, we can be free from sin if we accept
    Jesus. This may be so but it is still the case that
    Christians feel they need Jesus because their view of human
    nature is so utterly pessimistic.</p>
    <p>Buddhism on the other hand has a very different, not to
    say more realistic, view of human nature. While fully
    recognizing mankind's potential for evil, Buddhism teaches
    that we can conquer evil and develop good through our own
    efforts.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Abandon evil! One can abandon evil! If it were
        impossible to abandon evil, I would not ask you to do so.
        But as it can be done, therefore I say, &quot;Abandon
        evil!&quot;</p>
        <p>Cultivate the good! One can cultivate what is good! If
        it were impossible to cultivate the good I would not ask
        you to do so. But as it can be done, therefore I say,
        &quot;Cultivate the good!&quot; (Anguttara Nikaya, Book
        of Ones).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Whether one agrees with this belief or not, one could
    certainly not say that it is pessimistic.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Jesus teaches us to love but
    Buddhism encourages us to be cold and detached ...</b></font></p>
    <p>-- This is not true. The Buddha says that we should
    develop a warm caring love towards all human beings.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Just as a mother would protect her only child even at
        the risk of her own life, even so one should cultivate
        unconditional love to all beings (Sutta Nipata, verse
        150)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In every sense love is as important in Buddhism as it is
    in Christianity and is emphasized just as much. There is
    however something which somewhat spoils Christians' practice
    of love. Their loud insistence that only <i>they </i>love,
    that the quality of their <i>love </i>is superior to that of
    others, and their constant disparagement of and scoffing at
    others' efforts to practise love makes them appear thoroughly
    invidious. So petty and jealous are some Christians that they
    cannot even praise or appreciate a quality as beautiful as
    love, unless it has 'Made by Jesus' written on it.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>You claim that when we die we are
    reborn, but there is no proof of this ...</b></font></p>
    <p>-- Before responding to this let us examine both the
    Christian and Buddhist after-life theories. According to
    Christianity, God creates a new soul that becomes a human
    being which lives its life and then dies. After death the
    soul will go to eternal heaven if it believed in Jesus, or to
    eternal hell if it did not.</p>
    <p>According to Buddhism, it is impossible to fathom the
    ultimate beginning of existence. Each being lives its life,
    dies and then is reborn into a new existence. This process of
    dying and being reborn is a natural one and can go on forever
    unless the being attains Nirvana. When a being does attain
    Nirvana their understanding, and consequently their
    behaviour, alters and this changes the process which causes
    rebirth. So instead of being reborn into a new existence the
    being attains Nirvana. Nirvana is not existence (to exist
    means to respond to stimuli, to grow and decay, to move in
    time and space, to experience oneself as a separate etc.) and
    it is not non-existence in that it is not annihilation. In
    other words each being's existence is beginningless and
    endless unless Nirvana is attained and until that time
    existence has no other purpose than to exist.</p>
    <p>There is little evidence for either of these two theories.
    However, there are several logical and moral problems with
    the Christian theory which are absent from the Buddhist
    theory and which make the latter more acceptable.
    Christianity sees existence as having a beginning but no end
    whereas Buddhism sees it as cyclic. Nature offers no examples
    of processes which have a beginning but no end. Rather, all
    the natural processes we can observe are cyclic. The seasons
    go and return again next year. Rain falls, flows to the sea,
    evaporates, and forms clouds which again fall as rain. The
    body is made up of the elements we ingest as food; when we
    die the body breaks down and releases its elements into the
    soil, where they are absorbed by plants and animals which we
    again eat to build the body. The planets circle the sun and
    even the galaxy containing our solar system slowly revolves.
    The Buddhist theory of rebirth is in harmony with the cyclic
    processes we see throughout nature whereas the Christian
    theory is not.</p>
    <p>Christians claim that God created us for a purpose - so we
    can believe in him, obey him and be saved. If this is so it
    is very difficult to explain why, each year, millions of
    foetuses naturally abort, and millions of babies are born
    dead or die within the first two years of their lives.
    Further, millions of people are born and live their whole
    lives with severe mental retardation, unable to think even
    the most simple thoughts. How do all these people fit into
    God's supposed plan? What purpose can God have in creating a
    new life and then letting it die even before it is born or
    soon after its birth? And what happens to all these beings?
    Do they go to heaven or hell? If God really created us with a
    plan in mind, that plan is certainly not very obvious. Also,
    as the majority of the world's people are non-Christian and
    as not even all Christians will be saved, this means that a
    good percentage of all the souls that God creates will go to
    hell. God's plan to save everyone seems to have gone terribly
    wrong. So although we can't prove either the Christian or the
    Buddhist afterlife theory, the Buddhist doctrine is more
    appealing and acceptable.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>If we are really reborn, how do
    you explain the increase in the world's population?</b></font></p>
    <p>-- When beings die they are reborn but they are not
    necessarily reborn as the same type of being. For example, a
    human could be reborn as a human, as an animal, or perhaps as
    a heaven being, according to its kamma. The fact that there
    is a dramatic increase in the world's human population
    indicates that more animals are being reborn as humans (there
    has been a corresponding drop in the number of animals due to
    extinctions etc.) and more humans are being reborn as humans.
    Why is this so? Just why more animals are being reborn as
    humans is difficult to say. But why more humans are being
    reborn as humans is undoubtedly due to an increasingly
    widespread knowledge of the Buddha's teachings. Even where
    the Dhamma is not widely known its capacity to be a subtle
    influence for good is powerful. All this can account for the
    increase in the human population.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>Nirvana is an impractical
    goal because it takes so long to attain and so few can do it
    ...</strong></font></p>
    <p>-- It is true that attaining Nirvana may take a long time
    but on the other hand rebirth gives us plenty of time. If one
    does not do it in this life one can continue striving in the
    next life. In fact, it will take as long as one wants. The
    Buddha says that if one really wants, one can attain Nirvana
    within seven days (Majjhima Nikaya Sutta No.10). If this is
    so, the Christian will ask, why haven't all Buddhists already
    attained Nirvana? For the simple reason that mundane
    phenomena still hold an attraction for them. As insight and
    understanding gradually make that attraction fade one moves
    step by step, at one's own pace, towards Nirvana. As for the
    claim that only a few people can attain Nirvana, this is not
    correct. While in Christianity one has one and only one
    chance of being saved, Buddhism's teachings on rebirth mean
    that a person has an infinite number of opportunities to
    attain Nirvana. This also implies that everyone will
    eventually be liberated. As the Buddhist text says</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>This immortal state has been attained by many and can
        be still attained even today by anyone who makes an
        effort. But not by those who do not strive (Therigatha,
        verse 513).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong><b>In Christianity, history
    has a meaning and is moving towards a particular goal.
    Buddhism's cyclic view of existence means that history has no
    meaning and this makes Buddhists fatalistic and indifferent
    ...</b></strong></font></p>
    <p>-- It is true that according to Buddhism history is not
    moving towards any climax. But the person who is walking the
    Noble Eightfold Path certainly is. He or she is resolutely
    moving towards the peace and freedom of Nirvana.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Just as the river Ganges flows, slides, tends towards
        the east, so too one who cultivates and makes much of the
        Noble Eightfold Path flows, slides, tends towards Nirvana
        (Samyutta Nikaya, Great Chapter, Sutta No.67)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So it is not true to say that Buddhism's more realistic
    view of existence and of history necessarily leads to
    indifference. And what climax is history moving towards
    according to Christianity? The Apocalypse, where the vast
    majority of humanity and all the works of man will be
    consumed by brimstone and fire. Even the lucky few who are
    saved will have the gloomy prospect of an eternity in heaven
    knowing that at least some of their family and friends are,
    at the same time, being punished in hell. It would be
    difficult to imagine a more depressing future to look forward
    to than this.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>The Buddha copied the idea of
    kamma and rebirth from Hinduism ...</b></font></p>
    <p>-- Hinduism does teach a doctrine of kamma and also
    reincarnation. However, their versions of both these
    teachings are very different from the Buddhist versions. For
    example, Hinduism says we are determined by our kamma while
    Buddhism says it only conditions us. According to Hinduism,
    an eternal soul (<i>atman</i>) passes from one life to the
    next while Buddhism denies that there is such a soul (<i>anatman</i>)
    saying rather that it is a constantly changing stream of
    mental energy that is reborn. These are just two of many
    differences between Hinduism and Buddhism on kamma and
    rebirth.</p>
    <p>However, even if the Buddhist and Hindu teachings were
    identical this would not necessarily mean that the Buddha
    unthinkingly copied the ideas of others. It sometimes happens
    that two people, quite independently of each other, make
    exactly the same discovery. A good example of this is the
    discovery of evolution. In 1858, just before he published his
    famous book <i>The Origin of the Species</i>, Charles Darwin
    found that another man, Alfred Russell Wallace, had conceived
    the idea of evolution exactly as he had done. Darwin and
    Wallace had not copied each other's ideas; rather, by
    studying the same phenomena they had come to the same
    conclusion about them quite independently of each other. So
    even if Hindu ideas about kamma and rebirth were identical to
    those of Buddhism (which they are not) this would still not
    be proof of copying. The truth is that Hindu sages, through
    insights they developed in meditation, got vague ideas about
    kamma and rebirth, which the Buddha later expounded more
    fully and accurately.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Jesus forgives our sins, but
    Buddhism says you can never escape the consequences of your
    kamma ...</b></font></p>
    <p>-- It is only partially true that Jesus forgives sins.
    According to Christianity, after people are created they will
    live forever - first for a few decades on earth and then for
    eternity in either heaven or hell. Jesus will forgive
    people's sins while they live in the world but for the rest
    of eternity he will refuse to do so, no matter how frequently
    or how pitifully the souls in hell may call upon his name. So
    Jesus' forgiveness is limited to a minute period of time in a
    person's existence after which he will withhold it. So most
    people will never escape from the consequences of their
    supposed sin.</p>
    <p>Can Buddhists escape from their kamma? The doctrine of
    kamma teaches that every action (<i>kamma</i>) has an effect
    (<i>vipaka</i>). However this effect is not always equal to
    its cause. For example, if a person steals something this act
    will have a negative effect. If however after the theft the
    person feels remorse, returns the stolen article, and
    sincerely resolves to try to be more careful in the future,
    the negative effect of the theft may be mitigated. There
    would still be an effect although not as strong. But even if
    the thief does not mitigate the wrong which has been done
    with some good, he or she will be free from the deed after
    its effect comes to fruition. So according to Buddhism we <i>can
    </i>be free from our kamma while according to Christianity
    our sins will only be forgiven during an extremely limited
    period of time.</p>
    <p>There are other ways in which the doctrine of kamma is
    better than the Christian ideas of forgiveness and
    punishment. In Buddhism while one may have to endure the
    negative effects of the evil one has done (which is only
    fair) this means that one will experience the positive
    effects of the good one has done as well. This is not so in
    Christianity. For example, a non-Christian may be honest,
    merciful, generous and kind yet despite this at death this
    person will go to hell and not receive any reward for the
    good he or she has done. Furthermore, according to the
    doctrine of kamma the effects we experience, all things being
    equal, are in direct proportion to their cause. Again this is
    not so in Christianity - even if a person is exceptionally
    evil during this life, eternal hell is an utterly
    disproportionate punishment. How much more is this so if the
    person is virtuous but non-Christian? Indeed the eternity of
    hell, and the idea that all non-Christians are condemned to
    it, are teachings that cast very serious doubts on the
    concept of a just and loving God.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Christianity has spread to almost
    every country in the world and has more followers than any
    other religion, so it must be true ...</b></font></p>
    <p>-- It is true that Christianity has spread widely but how
    has this happened? Until the 15th century Christianity was
    largely confined to Europe. After this, European armies
    spread throughout the world forcing their religion on the
    people they conquered. In most conquered countries (e.g. Sri
    Lanka, the Philippines, Taiwan and parts of India) laws were
    passed banning all non-Christian religions. By the late 19th
    century brute force was no longer used to enforce belief but,
    under the influence of the missionaries, colonial
    administrators tried to hinder non-Christian religions as
    much as possible. Today the spread of Christianity is
    supported by lavish financial assistance which missionaries
    get largely from the U.S.A. So Christianity has spread not
    because of its inherent superiority but because of violence
    in the past and wealth today.</p>
    <p>Whether Christianity is the world's largest religion is a
    matter of definition. Can we consider the Mormons, the
    Moonies and the Jehovah's Witnesses to be Christians? Can we
    consider the numerous strange cults and sects that flourish
    in South America and Africa, and which account for many
    millions of people, to be Christian? Most Protestants don't
    even consider Catholics to be Christians! If we deny that all
    the heretical, heterodoxist, cultic and bizarre Christian
    groups are 'real' Christians, this would probably make
    Christianity one of the smallest religions in the world. This
    would also explain why the Bible says that only 144,000
    people will be saved on Judgement Day (Rev 14:3-4).</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>God blesses those who believe in
    him. That is why Christian countries are so rich and Buddhist
    countries are so poor ...</b></font></p>
    <p>-- Of all the arguments that Christians use to try to
    convert people this is by far the most foolish. Firstly if
    what the Bible says about wealth is true (Matt 19:23-24) it
    would seem that the blessings which God has supposedly poured
    out on Europe and America are really a curse in disguise.
    Secondly if prosperity is really proof of God's favour it
    would seem that he really likes the Muslims because he has
    given them all the oil. Thirdly, some Christian countries
    such as Honduras and the Philippines are extremely poor while
    Japan, predominantly a Buddhist country, is very rich. And
    finally, by making statements like this, Christians are
    letting slip their real motive for worshipping God - desire
    for money. Buddhism for its part teaches that qualities like
    contentment, love, gentleness and inner peace are more
    precious than money.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Throughout the world including
    Asia, Christianity has been a force for progress while
    Buddhism has done little to improve society ...</b></font></p>
    <p>-- In Christianity's long history there is much to be
    proud of and perhaps equally as much to be ashamed of. Take
    for example slavery, a terrible institution that almost all
    churches supported until the 19th century. After Paul
    converted the runaway slave Oresimus he convinced him that as
    a Christian he should go back to his master (Philemon
    1:3-20). He asked the master to be kind to Oresimus but he
    did not ask him to free the slave. The Bible says that slaves
    should obey their masters even if they are treated with
    cruelty.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and
        trembling, singlemindedly, as if serving Christ (Eph 6:5)</p>
        <p>Slaves, give entire obedience to your earthly masters,
        not merely with an outward show of service, to curry
        favour with men, but with singlemindedness, out of
        reverence for the Lord (Col. 3:22)</p>
        <p>Bid slaves to be submissive to their masters and give
        satisfaction in every respect; they are not to be
        refractory, nor to pilfer, but to show entire and true
        fidelity so that in everything they may adorn the
        doctrine of God our saviour (Tit 2:9-10)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The reason why slave owners in Africa, U.S.A. and Brazil
    encouraged their slaves to become Christians was because it
    made them passive and obedient. In England the campaign to
    abolish slavery in the 18th century was strongly opposed by
    the churches as they opposed similar campaigns in Mexico,
    Brazil and the southern U.S.A. (for details read the section
    on 'Slavery' in <i>The Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics</i>,
    1989).</p>
    <p>Take science. The development of science in the West was
    retarded by church opposition (see <i>A History of the
    Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom</i>, 2 Vol.,
    A.D.White, 1960). Christian opposition to dissection of
    corpses held back the development of medicine and anatomy for
    300 years. The churches were against dissection because they
    believed that it would make bodily resurrection impossible.
    The church was opposed to the heliocentric view of the
    universe and even threatened to execute Galileo for saying
    that the earth moved around the sun. When Benjamin Franklin
    invented the lightning rod that prevented buildings from
    being damaged by lightning, Protestant churches were in an
    uproar. They believed that God would no longer be able to
    punish sinners by hurling thunder bolts. When chloroform was
    invented, the churches refused to allow it to be used to
    alleviate the pain of childbirth. The Bible teaches and they
    believed that such pain was God's punishment on women for the
    sin of Eve (Gen 3:16).</p>
    <p>Take intolerance of the Jews. Of all the bleak pages in
    the history of Christianity this is the bleakest and most
    disgraceful. For 2000 years Christians have harassed,
    hounded, humiliated and murdered the Jews because they
    refused to believe in Jesus. In this respect Protestants have
    been no better than the Catholics. In 1986 a leading
    Protestant clergyman in the U.S.A. said &quot;God does not
    listen when the Jews pray&quot;. </p>
    <p>We could go on but this is enough. However since the 19th
    century it is true that many Christian churches have begun to
    eagerly adopt the outlook of the liberal secular tradition
    and make it their own. So now Christians are often in the
    forefront of movements for justice, democracy and equality
    but there is little in the Bible that they can use to justify
    their actions. On the contrary, the Bible specifically says
    that all rulers, even the unjust, get their power from God
    and to oppose them is to oppose God.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Let every person be subject to the governing
        authorities. For there is no authority except from God,
        and those that exist have been instituted by God.
        Therefore he who resists the authorities resists what God
        has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment
        (Rom 13:1-2, see also Jn 19:11, Tit 3:1, Pet 2:13, Prov
        8:15-16)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Despotic kings, cardinals and bishops quoted passages like
    these for centuries to justify their rule. Liberation
    theologies are very silent about such Bible passages today.
    Christian social philosophy doesn't come from the Bible. It
    comes from the Western secular tradition that the churches
    spent 400 years opposing. Now they try to pretend that these
    values originate from Jesus (see <i>What the Bible Really
    Says</i>, ed. M. Smith and R.S.Hoffman, 1989).</p>
    <p>Buddhism has always been less aggressive and less
    organized than Christianity. This has meant that its
    influence on society has been subtle, less noticeable and
    even perhaps less dynamic than it should have been. On the
    other hand it has also meant that the witch-hunts against
    heretics, the persecution of non-believers, and the bloody
    religious wars that have marred Christian history, have been
    rare or absent in Buddhism.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>(1) Deep down Buddhists are
    really searching for God.<br>
    (2) Buddhism is just a different expression of man's
    understanding of God<br>
    (3) Buddhists are Christians outside the church ...</b></font></p>
    <p>-- Today one often hears liberal Christians make
    statements like these. Sadly, such statements are
    meaningless. One could simply reverse them and say &quot;Deep
    down Christians are really searching for Nirvana&quot;,
    &quot;The Christian God is just a personification of
    Nirvana&quot;, or &quot;Christians are Buddhists outside the
    Sangha&quot;. Although such statements are often welcomed by
    Buddhists as indicating that liberal Christians are more
    tolerant than their fundamentalist brothers and sisters, this
    is actually not so. Such statements really show that
    Christians still wish to claim superiority for their own
    religion. They also show that the liberal Christian's
    supposed tolerance is dependent upon believing that Buddhism
    is just another form of Christianity. In short, it is based
    on a delusion. Liberal Christians will only be genuinely
    tolerant when they can admit that Buddhism is different from
    Christianity, very different, and be tolerant despite these
    differences.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Buddhism may be a noble
    philosophy but if you look at Buddhist countries you notice
    that so few people seem to practise it ...</b></font></p>
    <p>-- Perhaps! But is it not exactly the same in Christian
    countries? What honest Christian could say that all
    Christians fully, sincerely and with deep understanding
    follow Jesus' teachings? Let us not judge a religion by those
    who fail to practise it.</p>
