    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While Christians look to God as their lord and creator,
    Buddhists look to the Buddha as their model and ideal.
    Although Christians have never seen God, they claim to know
    him by communicating with him through prayer and through
    feeling his presence. They also claim that they can know
    God's will by reading his words which they maintain are
    contained in the Bible.</p>
    <p>As Buddhists neither pray to nor acknowledge God, the only
    way they can get an idea of what he is like is by reading the
    Bible. However when Buddhists look at what the Bible says
    about God they are often shocked. They find that God as he is
    portrayed in the Bible to be profoundly different from how
    they hear Christians describe him.</p>
    <p>While Buddhists reject the Christian concept of God
    because it seems to be illogical and unsubstantiated, they
    also reject it because it seems so much lower than their own
    ideal, the Buddha. We will now examine what the Bible says
    about God, compare it to what the Tipitaka (the Buddhist
    sacred scriptures) say about the Buddha, and thereby
    demonstrate the moral superiority of the latter.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Physical Appearance</b></font></p>
    <p>What does God look like? The Bible says that God created
    man in his own image (Gen 1:26) so from this we can assume
    God looks something like a human being. The Bible tells us
    that God has hands (Ex 15:12), arms (Deut 11:2), fingers (Ps
    8:3) and a face (Deut 13:17). He does not like people seeing
    his face but he doesn't mind if they see his back.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>And I will take away my hands and you will see my back
        parts but my face you shall not see (Ex 33:23).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>However, although God seems to have a human body he does
    at the same time look not unlike the demons and fierce
    guardians one often sees in Indian and Chinese temples. For
    example, he has flames coming out of his body.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A fire issues from his presence and burns his enemies
        on every side (Ps 97:3).</p>
        <p>Our God comes and shall not keep silent, before him a
        fire burns and around him fierce storms rage (Ps 50:3).</p>
        <p>Now the people complained about their hardships in the
        hearing of the Lord, and when he heard them his anger was
        aroused. Then fire from the Lord burned among them and
        consumed some of the outskirts of the camp (Num 11:1).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>When God is angry, which seems to be quite often, smoke
    and fire come out of his body.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of
        the mountains shook, they trembled because he was angry.
        Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from
        his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it (Ps 18:7-8).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>When the prophet Ezekiel saw God and his attendant angels,
    he described them as looking like this.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>On the fifth of the month - it was the fifth year of
        the exile of King Jehoiachin - the word of the Lord came
        to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, by the Kebar
        River in the land of the Babylonians. There the hand of
        the Lord was upon him.</p>
        <p>I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the
        north - an immense cloud with flashing lightning and
        surrounded by brilliant light. The centre of the fire
        looked like glowing metal, and in the fire was what
        looked like four living creatures. In appearance their
        form was that of a man, but each of them had four faces
        and four wings. Their legs were straight; their feet were
        like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze.
        Under their wings on their four sides they had the hands
        of a man. All four of them had faces and wings, and their
        wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead;
        they did not turn as they moved.</p>
        <p>Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the
        face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of
        a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had
        the face of an eagle. Such were their faces. Their wings
        were spread out upward; each had two wings, one touching
        the wing of another creature on either side, and two
        wings covering its body.</p>
        <p>Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit
        would go, they would go, without turning as they went.
        The appearance of the living creatures was like burning
        coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth
        among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed
        out of it. The creatures sped back and forth like flashes
        of lightning.</p>
        <p>As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on
        the ground beside each creature with its four faces. This
        was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They
        sparkled like chrysolite, and all four looked alike. Each
        appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel
        (Ezek 1:4-21).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Christians often look at the many-armed and fierce-faced
    gods in Hindu and Taoist temples and claim that they are
    devils rather than gods - but as the Bible makes clear the
    Christian God is very similar in appearance to these.
    Furthermore, just as Hindu and Taoist gods carry various
    weapons so too does the Christian God.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>In that day the Lord will punish with his sword, his
        fierce, great and powerful sword (Is 27:1).</p>
        <p>The sun and moon stood still in the heavens at the
        glint of your flying arrows, at the lightning of your
        flashing spear. In wrath you strode through the earth and
        in your anger you threshed the nations (Haba 3:11-12).</p>
        <p>The Lord thundered from heaven, the voice of the Most
        High resounded. He shot his arrows and scattered the
        enemies (Ps 18:13-14).</p>
        <p>But God will shoot them with arrows, suddenly they
        will be struck down (Ps 64:7).</p>
        <p>Then the Lord will appear over them, his arrows will
        flash like lightning. The sovereign Lord will sound the
        trumpet (Zech 9:14).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Another interesting way in which God's appearance
    resembles that of non-Christian idols is in how he travels.
    The Bible tells us that God gets from one place to another
    either by sitting on a cloud (Is 19:1) or riding on the back
    of an angel (Ps 18:10). It is obvious from these quotes that
    God has a savage and frightening appearance; a conclusion
    verified again by the Bible where people are described as
    being utterly terrified by God's appearance.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Serve the Lord with fear and trembling, kiss his feet
        or else he will get angry and you will perish in the way,
        for his wrath is quickly kindled (Ps 2:11).</p>
        <p>Therefore I am terrified at his presence. When I think
        of him I am in dread of him, God has made my heart faint.
        The Almighty has terrified me (Job 23:15).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Jesus frequently says that we should fear God (e.g. Lk
    12:4-5). The Bible also very correctly says that where there
    is fear there cannot be love (I Jn 4:18) and so if God
    creates fear in people it is difficult to know how he can
    genuinely be loved at the same time.</p>
    <p>What did the Buddha look like? Being human, the Buddha had
    a human body like any ordinary person. However the Tipitaka
    (the Buddhist sacred books) frequently speak of his great
    personal beauty.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>He is handsome, good-looking, pleasant to see, of most
        beautiful complexion, his form and countenance is like
        Brahma's, his appearance is beautiful (Digha Nikaya,
        Sutta No.4).</p>
        <p>He is handsome, inspiring faith, with calm senses and
        mind tranquil, composed and controlled, like a perfectly
        tamed elephant (Anguttara Nikaya, Sutta No.36).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Whenever people saw the Buddha, his calm appearance filled
    them with peace and his gentle smile reassured them. As we
    have seen, God's voice is loud and frightening like thunder
    (Ps 68:33). while the Buddha's voice was gentle and soothing.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>When in a monastery he is teaching the Dhamma, he does
        not exalt or disparage the assembly. On the contrary, he
        delights, uplifts, inspires and gladdens them with talk
        on Dhamma. The sound of the good Gotama's voice has eight
        characteristics; it is distinct and intelligible, sweet
        and audible, fluent and clear, deep and resonant
        (Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta No.19).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>God carries weapons because he has to kill his enemies and
    because he controls people with violence and threats. The
    Buddha, on the other hand, showed enmity to no one and was
    able to control people by reasoning with them. Addressing the
    Buddha, King Pasenadi once said:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I am a king, able to execute those deserving
        execution, fine those deserving to be fined, or exile
        those deserving exile. But when I am sitting on a court
        case people sometimes interrupt even me. I can't even get
        a chance to say: &quot;Don't interrupt me! Wait until I
        have finished speaking.&quot; But when the Lord is
        teaching Dhamma there is not even the sound of coughing
        coming from the assembly. Once, as I sat listening to the
        Lord teach Dhamma a certain disciple coughed and one of
        his fellows tapped him on the knee and said,
        &quot;Silence, sir, make no noise. Our Lord is teaching
        Dhamma&quot;, and I thought to myself, indeed it is
        wonderful, marvellous how well trained these disciples
        are without stick or sword (Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta
        No.89).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We can just imagine how God would react if one were
    foolish enough to interrupt him while he was speaking. We can
    see from what has been said above that the Buddha's physical
    appearance reflected his deep inner calm and compassion.
    People were always inspired by the aura of peace that
    surrounded him.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Mental Make-up</b></font></p>
    <p>We have seen that Buddhists do not believe in God because
    to them the idea is illogical and contrary to the facts.
    Buddhists also reject the Christian God because, if the Bible
    is correct, God appears to be so imperfect. All of the
    negative emotions which most cultured people find
    unacceptable are to be found in God. Let us examine how the
    Bible describes God's mind.</p>
    <p>The emotion which is associated with God more than any
    other is jealousy. He even admits that he is jealous.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>For the Lord is a devouring fire, a jealous God (Deut
        4:24).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Nothing makes God more jealous than people worshipping
    other gods, and he tells us we must even kill our own
    children if they do this.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son,
        daughter, the wife of your bosom or the friend of your
        own soul, entices you secretly, saying, &quot;Let us go
        and serve other gods&quot; which neither you nor your
        fathers have known, some of the gods of the people that
        are around you whether near or far, from one end of the
        earth to the other, you shall not yield to him or listen
        to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare
        him, nor shall you conceal him, but you shall kill him.
        Your hand shall be the first against him to kill him and
        after that the others can strike him (Deut 13:6).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Bible tells us that God frequently loses his temper.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>See, the day of the Lord is coming - a cruel day, with
        wrath and fierce anger, to make the land desolate and
        destroy the sinners within it (Is 13:9).</p>
        <p>God is angry every day (Ps 7:11).</p>
        <p>The Lord will cause men to hear his majestic voice and
        will make them see his arm coming down with raging anger
        and consuming fire (Is 30:30).</p>
        <p>His anger will burn against you and he will destroy
        you from the face of the land (Deut 6:15).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>God tells us to love but he is described as hating and
    being filled with abhorrence.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>You hate all those who do wrong. You destroy those who
        tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the Lord abhors
        (Ps 5:5-6).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>He is further described as hating many other things as
    well as people (see Deut 16:22, Mala 2:16, Lev 26:30). God
    has a particularly deep hatred for other religions which
    probably explains why Christianity has always been such an
    intolerant religion. He is often described as feeling special
    hatred for those who will not worship him.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my
        soul hates (Is 1:14).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Buddha had compassion for those who were cruel, he
    forgave those who did wrong, and he had respect for those of
    other religions. We would expect God, being capable of
    jealousy and hate, to be vengeful, and not surprisingly the
    Bible often mentions God's vengefulness.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Behold, your God will come with vengeance (Is 35:4).</p>
        <p>The Lord is avenging and wrathful, the Lord takes
        vengeance on his adversaries and holds wrath for his
        enemies (Nahum 1:2).</p>
        <p>For we know him who said, &quot;It is mine to avenge;
        I will repay&quot;, and again, &quot;The Lord will judge
        his people&quot;. It is a dreadful thing to fall into the
        hands of the living god (Heb 10:30-31). (See also Rom
        1:8, 2:5-6, 12:19).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What would be the use of worshipping a God who is full of
    the very mental defilements which we ourselves are striving
    to overcome?</p>
    <p>During the forty years after his enlightenment, the Buddha
    urged people to give up anger, jealousy and intolerance and
    never once in all that time did he fail to act in perfect
    accordance with what he taught to others.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The Lord acts as he speaks and speaks as he acts. We
        find no teacher other than the Lord who is so consistent
        as this whether we survey the past or the present (Digha
        Nikaya, Sutta No.19).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the whole of the Tipitaka, there is not a single
    example of the Buddha expressing anger, hatred, jealousy,
    etc. because, being perfect, he was freed from such negative
    emotions.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Attitude to War</b></font></p>
    <p>The Bible tells us that there is a time for hate and a
    time for war (Ex 3:8) and it is widely recognized today that
    those great evils depend upon each other. As we have seen,
    God is quite capable of hatred and, not surprisingly is
    therefore often involved in war.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The Lord is a man of war (Ex 15:3).</p>
        <p>The Lord your God is in your midst, a warrior who
        gives victory (Zeph 3:17).</p>
        <p>The Lord goes forth like a mighty man, like a man of
        war he stirs up his fury, he cries out, he shouts aloud,
        he shows himself mighty against the enemy (Is 42:13).</p>
        <p>When I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand grasps it
        in judgment, I will take vengeance on my adversaries and
        repay those who hate me. I will make my arrows drunk with
        blood while my sword devours flesh: the blood of the
        slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders
        (Deut 32:41-42).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For centuries Christians have been inspired by these Bible
    passages, which encourage and even glorify war, to use
    violence to spread their religion. Even today there is a
    distinctly militaristic flavour about Christianity. The
    Salvation Army with its motto &quot;Blood and Fire&quot;; the
    hymns that speak about &quot;Onward Christian soldiers
    marching as to war&quot;; the saying &quot;Praise the Lord
    and pass the ammunition&quot;, etc. The Bible contains dozens
    of examples of God helping his devotees to capture cities,
    slaughter civilian populations and defeat armies (for example
    Num 21:1-3, Num 31:1-12, Deut 2:32-34, Deut 3:3-7, Josh
    11:6-11, etc.). Concerning captives in war God says:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>And you shall destroy all the peoples that the Lord
        your God gives over to you, your eye shall not pity them
        (Deut 7:16).</p>
        <p>When the Lord your God gives them over to you and you
        defeat them you must utterly destroy them and show no
        mercy to them (Deut 7:2).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Even Christians are often shocked when they read passages
    like these. Buddhists simply feel that such passages justify
    their rejection of God and their faith in the Buddha.</p>
    <p>What was the Buddha's attitude to war? There is no example
    of the Buddha ever praising war, encouraging war, or going to
    war himself. On the contrary, he urged all to live in peace
    and harmony and is described in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>He is a reconciler of those who are in conflict and an
        encourager of those who are already united, rejoicing in
        peace, loving peace, delighting in peace, he is one who
        speaks in praise of peace (Digha Nikaya, Sutta No.1).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>He set an example by being a man of peace.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Abandoning killing, the monk Gotama lives refraining
        from killing, he is without stick or sword, he lives with
        care, compassion and sympathy for others (Digha Nikaya,
        Sutta No.1).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Buddha was not content with merely speaking in favour
    of peace or with being peaceful himself. He actively promoted
    peace by trying to stop war. When his relatives were about to
    go to war over the waters of the Rohini River, the Buddha did
    not take sides, urge them on, give them advice on tactics, or
    tell them to show no mercy to their adversaries, as God would
    have done. Instead he stood between the two factions and
    said, &quot;What is more valuable, blood or water?&quot; The
    soldiers replied, &quot;Blood is more valuable, sir.&quot;
    Then the Buddha said, &quot;Then is it not unbecoming to
    spill blood for water?&quot; Both sides dropped their weapons
    and peace was restored (Dhammapada Atthakata Book 15,1). The
    Buddha had put aside hatred and filled his mind with love and
    compassion, so approving of war was impossible for him.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Idea of Justice</b></font></p>
    <p>Justice is the quality of being fair, and a person who is
    just acts fairly and in accordance with what is right.
    However ideas about what is fair and right differ from time
    to time and from person to person. Christians claim that God
    is just, so by examining his actions we will be able to know
    God's concept of justice.</p>
    <p>God tells us that anybody who disobeys him will be
    punished &quot;seven times over&quot; (Lev 26:18), that is,
    one sin will be punished seven times. God obviously considers
    this to be fair and just. He also tells us that he will
    punish the innocent children, grandchildren, and even
    great-grandchildren of those who sin.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I the Lord am a jealous God, punishing the children
        for the sins of the fathers to the third or fourth
        generation of those who hate me (Deut 5:9).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is known as collective punishment; punishing a whole
    family or group for the crime committed by one of its
    members. Collective punishment is condemned today as unfair
    and unjust but God apparently considers it quite just.</p>
    <p>God tells us that even minor offences should be punished
    by death. For example, those who work on Sunday should be
    stoned to death. Once a man was found collecting firewood on
    Sunday and God said to Moses and the people who caught the
    man:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;The man must die. The whole assembly must stone
        him outside the camp.&quot; So the assembly took him
        outside the camp and stoned him to death as the Lord
        commanded Moses (Num 15:32-36).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>God's idea of justice does not seem to embrace the idea
    that the punishment should fit the crime. We are told that
    all who do not love God will suffer eternal punishment in
    hell. There are many kind, honest and generous people who do
    not believe in God and they will all go to hell. Is this fair
    and just? God apparently thinks so.</p>
    <p>Was the Buddha just? The Buddha had attained the freedom
    of enlightenment and he taught others how they too could
    attain this freedom. Unlike God, he was not primarily a
    lawgiver, a judge, or one who metes out punishment. He was a
    teacher. In all his dealings with people he was fair, mild
    and merciful and he urged his followers to act in like
    manner. If someone did wrong, he said that one should not
    rush to punish him.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>When you are living together in harmony, a fellow monk
        might commit an offence, a transgression. But you should
        not rush to condemn him, the issue must be carefully
        examined first (Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta No. 103).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In addition, when a person is being examined one should
    remain uninfluenced by bias or partiality and should look at
    both sides of the case.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Not by passing hasty judgments does one become just, a
        wise man is one who investigates both sides. He who does
        not judge others arbitrarily, but passes judgment
        impartially and in accordance with the facts, that person
        is a guardian of the law and is rightly called just
        (Dhammapada 256-257).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As for punishment, the Buddha would have considered
    stoning someone to death or any other form of capital
    punishment to be cruel. He himself was always ready to
    forgive. Once a man called Nigrodha abused the Buddha and
    later realised his mistake and confessed to the Buddha. Full
    of compassion and forgiveness the Buddha said:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Indeed, Nigrodha, transgression overcame you when
        through ignorance, blindness and evil you spoke to me
        like that. But since you acknowledge your transgression
        and make amends as is right, I accept your confession
        (Digha Nikaya, Sutta No.25).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Buddha forgave all whether they accepted his teachings
    or not, and even if Nigrodha had refused to apologise the
    Buddha would not have threatened to punish him. To the Buddha
    the proper response to faults was not the threat to punish
    but education and forgiveness. As he says:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>By three things the wise man can be known. What three?
        He sees his faults as they are. When he sees them he
        corrects them and when another confesses a fault the wise
        man forgives it as he should (Anguttara Nikaya, Book of
        Threes, Sutta No.10).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Attitude to Disease</b></font></p>
    <p>Disease, sickness and plagues have been the scourge of
    mankind for centuries, causing untold suffering and misery.
    The Bible shows us that God has always considered disease a
    useful way of expressing his anger and exercising his
    vengeance. When Pharaoh refused to release the Jews, God
    caused festering boils to break out on &quot;all
    Egyptians&quot; (Ex 9:8-12). God used this affliction to
    punish men, women, children and babies for the sin of one
    man. Later God made the first-born of every male child die.
    He says:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Every first-born son in Egypt will die, from the
        first-born son of Pharaoh who sits on the throne, to the
        first-born son of the slave girl who sits at her
        hand-mill. There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt -
        worse than there has ever been or ever will be (Ex
        11:5-6).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is another good example of God's idea of justice and
    compassion. Countless thousands of men, boys and innocent
    babies were killed by God because Pharaoh would not obey. In
    many places in the Bible God promises that he will inflict
    terrible diseases on those who do not follow his
    commandments.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The Lord will plague with diseases until he has
        destroyed you...the Lord will strike you with wasting
        disease, with fever and inflammation...(Deut 28:21-22).</p>
        <p>The Lord will inflict you with the boils of Egypt and
        with tumors, festering sores, and with itch, from which
        you cannot be cured (Deut 28:27).</p>
        <p>The Lord will send fearful plagues on you and your
        descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters and severe and
        lingering illness. He will bring upon you all the
        disasters of Egypt that you dreaded and they will cling
        to you. The Lord will also bring on you every kind of
        sickness and disaster (Deut 28:59-61).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Sometimes God even inflicts hideous diseases on people
    just to test their faith. To test Job God allowed all his
    children to be killed (Job 1:18-19) and Job himself to be
    struck with a terrible disease (Job 2:6-8). So unbearable was
    Job's grief and suffering that he began to wish he had never
    been born (Job 3:3-26).</p>
    <p>God even created some people blind and allowed them to
    spend their lives begging and groping in darkness just so
    that Jesus could miraculously heal them and thereby
    demonstrate God's power (Jn 9:1-4). Obviously, God sees
    illness, sickness and disease as useful means of punishing
    people and of demonstrating the extent of his power.</p>
    <p>Now let us have a look at the Buddha's attitude to
    sickness. The Buddha saw sickness and disease as a part of
    the general suffering from which he came to free mankind. He
    was called &quot;the compassionate physician&quot;. There are
    no examples of the Buddha ever having caused people to become
    diseased in order to punish them or because he was angry at
    them. The Buddha rightly understood that for as long as we
    have a body we will be susceptible to disease. He urged all
    to attain Nirvana and be forever free from suffering. While
    he tried to cut the problem at the root, he also did
    practical things to comfort the sick and restore them to
    health. Rather than inflict diseases on people, as God did,
    he gave practical advice on how to help and comfort the sick.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>With five qualities one is worthy to nurse the sick.
        What five? One can prepare the correct medicine; one
        knows what is good for the patient and offers it, and
        what is not good one does not offer; one nurses the sick
        out of love not out of desire for gain; one is unmoved by
        excrement, urine, vomit and spittle; and from time to
        time one can instruct, inspire, gladden and satisfy the
        sick with talk on Dhamma (Anguttara Nikaya, Book of
        Fives, Sutta No.124).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>He not only taught this but acted in conformity to his own
    teaching. When once he found a sick monk, neglected and lying
    in his own excrement, he bathed him, comforted him and then
    calling the other monks together said to them, &quot;If you
    would nurse me, nurse those who are sick&quot; (Vinaya,
    Mahavagga, 8). When God was angry he would inflict diseases
    on people and then watch them suffer. When the Buddha saw
    people with diseases, out of compassion he did all he could
    to restore them to health.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Creating Evil</b></font></p>
    <p>God created all that is good, but because he created
    everything, he also created all that is evil. God himself
    says:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I am the Lord and there is no other. I form the light
        and I create the darkness, I make the good and I make
        evil (Is 45:7-8). (See also Rom 11:32).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>When we think of nature and we remember that God is
    supposed to have created everything we understand the meaning
    of these words. Leprosy germs cause untold misery and they
    were created by God. Tuberculosis germs kill and deform
    millions of humans each year and they were created by God.
    God created the plague bacteria, the fleas and the rats that
    together cause bubonic plague and which have throughout the
    centuries killed perhaps as many as a hundred million people.
    In 1665, 68,000 people died of the plague in London alone. No
    doubt all this is what God means when he says he created
    darkness and evil. But God also created other forms of evil.
    He says:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>When disaster comes to a city, has not the Lord caused
        it? (Amos 3:4).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This undoubtedly refers to the earthquakes, fires, social
    strife, wars and other forms of evil which periodically
    afflict mankind's towns and cities. We also read in the Bible
    that even evil spirits come from God. In 1 Samuel 16:14-16 we
    are told that an evil spirit from God tormented Saul.</p>
    <p>Did the Buddha create evil? As he was not a creator God,
    he could not be held responsible for 'darkness and evil'. The
    only thing he 'created' was the Dhamma which he discovered
    and then proclaimed to the world. And his Dhamma has brought
    only light, good and gentleness everywhere it has spread.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Sacrifices</b></font></p>
    <p>In Old Testament times when people broke God's
    commandments he would get angry and the only way the sinner
    could make atonement and soothe God's anger was to sacrifice
    an animal. God himself gave exact instructions on how the
    animal was to be slaughtered.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If the offering to the Lord is a burnt offering of
        birds, he is to offer a dove or a young pigeon. The
        priest shall bring it to the altar, wring off its head
        and burn it on the altar; its blood shall be drained out
        on the side of the altar. He is to remove the crop with
        its contents and throw it to the east side of the altar,
        where the ashes are. He shall tear it open by the wings,
        not severing it completely, and then the priest shall
        burn it on the wood that is on the fire on the side of
        the altar (Lev 1:14-17).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>God tells us that when the meat, fat, skin and bone of the
    sacrificial victims are thrown in the fire and burned, he
    likes the smell of it (Lev 1:9, 1:17). But not all the
    sacrifices God demanded were animals; sometimes he demanded
    even human sacrifices. God once said to Abraham:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and
        go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a
        burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you
        about (Gen 22:2).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Abraham took his son to the place God indicated, built an
    altar, laid his son on it and then took up the knife. Just as
    he was about to slit his own son's throat, Abraham was
    stopped by an angel (Gen 22:12). Presumably, Abraham was a
    good devotee because he blindly, unquestioningly and
    willingly did anything God told him to do, even to the extent
    of preparing to butcher his own son as a sacrifice to God.</p>
    <p>In later centuries, mankind's sins became so bad that the
    sacrifice of mere animals could no longer appease God's
    anger. God required a greater, a more valuable sacrificial
    victim - his own son Jesus. Once again it was the blood of a
    victim which most atoned for sin and which is able to
    reconcile the sinners with God. Thus modern Christians often
    say that their &quot;sins have been washed away by the blood
    of Jesus&quot;.</p>
    <p>What did the Buddha think of animal or human sacrifices?
    At the time of the Buddha, the Hindu deities were offered
    animal sacrifices just as the Christian God was, and so the
    Buddha was quite aware of this practice. However, he
    considered sacrifices to be vulgar, cruel and useless.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The sacrifice of horse or man, the Peg-Thrown Rite,
        the Sacrificial Drink, the Victory Rite, the Withdrawn
        Bolt, all these rites are not worth a sixteenth part of
        having a heart filled with love, any more than the
        radiance of the moon outshines the stars (Anguttara
        Nikaya, Book of Eights, Sutta No.1).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Christians believe that Jesus' sacrificial blood will wash
    away their sins just as Hindus at the time of the Buddha
    believed that their sins could be washed away by bathing in
    holy rivers. The Buddha criticised the Hindu idea just as he
    would have criticised the Christian idea if he had known
    about it. To believe that blood, water or any other external
    things can purify the heart, which is an internal thing, is
    foolish indeed.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>In the Bahuka River, at Adhikakka, at Gaya, in the
        Sundrika, the Sarassati, the Payaga or the Bahumati the
        fool can wash constantly but cannot cleanse his evil
        deeds. What can the Sundrika, the Payaga or the Bahumati
        River do? They cannot cleanse the angry, guilty man
        intent on evil deeds. For the pure in heart every day is
        lucky, for the pure in heart every day is holy (Majjhima
        Nikaya, Sutta No.7).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This being the case, bathing in sacrificial blood or holy
    rivers is a poor substitute for purifying oneself by acting
    in a pure way. The only sacrifice that the Buddha asked us to
    make was to give up our selfishness and replace it with love,
    wisdom and compassion.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Love</b></font></p>
    <p>We are told that God is love and the Bible sometimes
    mentions love as one of God's attributes. However, there are
    different types of love. A person can love his or her own
    children but hate the neighbour's children. Someone might
    have a strong love for his own country but a burning hatred
    for another country. Though we may love someone deeply, we
    may, due to changed circumstances, grow indifferent or even
    hateful towards them. This is the lower, less developed, type
    of love which ordinary people feel - but there is a higher,
    more universal, type of love than this. This higher type of
    love is well described in the Buddhist texts and also in the
    Bible. In Corinthians we read:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, it
        does not boast, it is not proud, it is not rude, it is
        not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no
        record of wrongs (1 Cor 13:4-5).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Does God exhibit this higher type of love? Let us have a
    look. We are told that love is patient. Patience is defined
    as the ability to wait calmly for a long time, to control
    oneself when angered, especially at foolishness or slowness.
    We have already seen that God gets angry every day (Ps 7:11)
    and that he gets angry very quickly (Ps 2:11). Obviously God
    has very little patience.</p>
    <p>We are told that love is kind. Is God kind? Read
    Deuteronomy (28:15-68) where God describes in his own words
    just how cruel he can be. This shocking passage proves beyond
    all doubt that God is capable of truly terrible cruelty.
    Obviously God is not always very kind.</p>
    <p>We are told that love does not envy. Envy is, of course,
    very similar to jealousy and God often describes himself as
    fiercely jealous. He says:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>For the Lord your God is a devouring fire, a jealous
        God (Deut 4:24).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We are told that love does not boast and is not proud. Is
    God like this? Certainly the Bible does not give us the
    impression that God is modest and retiring. God spends a lot
    of time telling Job how great he is (Job 40:41) and ends by
    boasting of himself that:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>He looks down on all that are haughty, he is king over
        all that are proud (Job 41:34).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Next we are told that love is not easily angered. We have
    already seen that God is very easily angered.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Serve the Lord with fear and trembling, kiss his feet
        or else he will get angry and you will perish in the way,
        for his wrath is quickly kindled (Ps 2:11).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Finally we are told that love does not keep a record of
    wrongs that are done, that is, love soon forgives and
    forgets. Does God keep a record of wrongs that are done? God
    tells us that he will punish the children, grandchildren and
    even great-grandchildren of those who sin (Deut 5:9). In
    order to do this he must keep a record of the wrongs that
    have been committed and long remember them. Jesus tells us
    that God will never forgive those who insult the Holy Ghost
    (Lk 12:10). We are told that God casts sinners and
    non-believers into eternal hell. In other words, he refuses
    to ever forgive them. In short, he keeps a record for
    eternity of the wrongs which have been done. Quite clearly,
    God does not exhibit the highest type of love.</p>
    <p>What about the Buddha? Did he exhibit the highest type of
    love? The first characteristic of this highest kind of love
    is patience, and there is not one incident recorded in the
    Tipitaka of the Buddha being impatient. Even when he was
    abused he remained calm. His every action displays a calm,
    strong patience. When Asurinda cursed and abused the Buddha,
    he calmly replied:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>He who abuses his abuser is the worse of the two. To
        refrain from retaliation is to win a battle hard to win.
        If one knows that the other person is angry but refrains
        from anger oneself, one does what is best for oneself and
        the other person also. One is a healer of both (Samyutta
        Nikaya, Chapter Seven, Sutta No.3).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As he was always patient, he was also free from anger.
    Even when his cousin Devadatta tried to murder him, the
    Buddha displayed only pity and tolerance.</p>
    <p>We are also told that love is kind. Was the Buddha kind?
    Again there is not a single hint of the Buddha being anything
    other than kind and compassionate - not only to those who
    accepted his teachings but also to the followers of all
    faiths, not only to the good but also to the evil, not only
    to humans but also to animals. He says:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One should do no unkind thing that wise men might
        condemn and one should think, &quot;May all beings be
        secure and happy. Whatever beings there are, moving or
        still, tall, middle-sized or short, great or small, seen
        or unseen, whether living far or near, existing or not
        yet come into existence, may they all be happy.&quot; One
        should not harm another or despise anyone for any reason.
        Do not wish pain on another out of either anger or
        jealousy. Just as a mother would protect her only child
        even at the risk of her own life, even so, one should
        develop unbounded love towards all beings in the world
        (Sutta Nipata, Verses 145-149).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Buddha did not only teach this but he also practised
    everything he taught. God tells us that he is jealous and by
    this he means that he is jealous of other gods and other
    religions. He wants everyone to worship and revere him alone.
    So jealous is he that he says his devotees should kill even
    their own children if they worship other gods (Deut 13:6) and
    that God hates followers of other religions.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I hate those who cling to worthless idols (Ps 31:6).</p>
        <p>I gain understanding from your precepts, therefore I
        hate every wrong path (Ps 119:104).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Was the Buddha jealous of other faiths? Indeed, he was
    not. A man called Upali was a follower of the Jain religion.
    The Buddha explained the Dhamma to him after which he decided
    to become a Buddhist. The Buddha did not exult nor was he
    anxious to 'win' Upali. Rather, he advised him to think
    carefully before making such an important decision:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Make a careful investigation first, Upali. Careful
        investigation is good for well-known people like yourself
        (Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta No.56).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Buddha then advised Upali to keep offering donations
    to the Jain religion. He said this because he could see the
    good in all religions and because he was free from envy and
    jealousy.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Vacchagatta said to the Lord, &quot;I have heard it
        said that you say that charity should only be given to
        you, not to other teachers, to your disciples, not to the
        disciples of other religions.&quot; Then the Lord said,
        &quot;Those who say this are not reporting my words, they
        misrepresent me and tell lies. Truly, whoever discourages
        anyone from giving charity hinders in three ways. He
        hinders the giver from doing good, he hinders the
        receiver from being helped and he hinders himself through
        his meanness.&quot; (Anguttara Nikaya, Book of Threes,
        Sutta No.57).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Even today many Christians, especially fundamentalists and
    evangelicals, will refuse to have anything to do with
    non-Christians and would certainly refuse to help
    non-Christian charities.</p>
    <p>The Buddha was not boastful or proud, he was not rude or
    self-seeking, he was not easily angered and he did not keep a
    record of wrongs that were done to him. From the day of his
    enlightenment, his every thought, word and action was an
    expression of love and compassion. As one of his
    contemporaries said:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I have heard this said, &quot;To abide in love is
        sublime indeed&quot;, and the Lord is proof of this
        because we can see that he abides in love (Majjhima
        Nikaya, Sutta No.55).</p>
