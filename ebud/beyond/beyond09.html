    <p>If what has been written so far has stimulated in the
    reader the desire to know more about Christianity and
    Buddhism, we will briefly recommend some books for further
    reading.</p>
    <p>A popular and easy to read book exposing many of the
    fallacies in Christianity is <i>Jesus - the Evidence </i>by
    Ian Wilson, 1984. Wilson examines the history of the Bible
    and shows how scholars have demonstrated beyond doubt that it
    is an untidy compilation composed over several centuries. He
    also shows how the man Jesus gradually came to be seen as a
    god.</p>
    <p>Another good book is <i>Rescuing the Bible from the
    Fundamentalists </i>by John Spong, 1991. Spong is a Christian
    bishop and scholar who freely admits that most of what the
    Bible contains is either mythological or erroneous, and he
    gives abundant evidence for this.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the most scholarly and thorough critical study of
    recent times is <i>Is Christianity True? </i>by Michael
    Arnheim, 1984. This outstanding study examines every major
    Christian doctrine and exposes each of them to the cold light
    of reason - and none of them survive the exposure.</p>
    <p>Many excellent books on the teachings of the Buddha are
    available.</p>
    <p>A good introduction is <i>The Life of the Buddha </i>by H.
    Saddhatissa, 1988. It includes a well-written biography of
    the Buddha and a clear account of basic Buddhist concepts.</p>
    <p><i>What the Buddha Taught </i>by W. Rahula, 1985 and <i>The
    Buddha's Ancient Path </i>by Piyadassi Thera, 1979 are good
    introductions.</p>
    <p><i>A Buddhist Critique of the Christian Concept of God </i>by
    G. Dharmasiri, 1988 is an excellent but highly technical
    examination of the modern Protestant concept of God from the
    Buddhist point of view.</p>
    <p>A most interesting book is <i>Two Masters One Message </i>by
    Roy Amore, 1978. In this study the author demonstrates that
    much of what was taught by Jesus is likely to have been
    derived originally from Buddhism.</p>
    <p>Fundamentalist Christianity poses a real threat to
    Buddhism, and while we can never hope to match the
    aggressiveness or organizational abilities of its proponents,
    we can very easily counter them by becoming familiar with
    Christianity's numerous doctrinal weaknesses and Buddhism's
    many strengths. If the Christian challenge stimulates in
    Buddhists a deeper appreciation for the Dhamma and a desire
    to live by that Dhamma, then that challenge can be to
    Buddhism's benefit.</p>
