        human beings we have achieved a level of material progress we would not
        have even dreamed of barely a century ago. The marvels of modern
        technology have given us enormous power over the forces of nature. We
        have conquered many disasters but the ultimate question is: '<i>Are we
        happier than our ancestors were in the past</i>?' The answer is: <i>'No</i>'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The abuse of women,
        children and the underprivileged religious and racial discrimination,
        color bar, and caste distinction continue on unabated.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps those who enjoy
        material comforts suffer more acutely than their 'poor' fellow beings.
        Mental illnesses, stress and loneliness are some of the serious problems
        we now face in our modern society. But the vital question is: <i>Who is
        responsible for all the evils that haunt the world today?'</i></font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are many who are
        quite eager to take the credit for the progress that mankind has
        achieved. Religionists, scientists, politicians and economists- are all
        quick to claim that humanity is indebted to them for progress. But who
        must share the blame? I believe that everyone is equally responsible. <i>Let
        us turn the spotlight on ourselves and ask ourselves to declare in all
        honesty if we also have been responsible for failing to bring peace and
        happiness to our fellow beings</i>.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All of us are responsible
        for some of the horrors taking place in our midst today because we are
        too afraid to tell the truth. Let us take for example the exploitation
        of man's desire for sensual gratification. Greed for money and power has
        led some unscrupulous people to develop a multi-million dollar industry,
        to providing sensual pleasures in every possible way and young children
        are being trapped and victimized in the process.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Never before in the history
        of the world, has the human race been in such great need to be free from
        conflict, ill-feeling, selfishness, decent and strife. We are in dire
        need of peace nor only in our personal life at home and work, but also
        at the global level. The tension, anxiety and fear arising from the
        conflict are not only disruptive but continue to exert a constant drain
        on our well-being, mentally and physically. In their desire to
        completely dominate everything around them, humans have become the most
        violent beings in this world. They have succeeded, to some extent, but
        in so doing have paid a terrible price. They have sacrificed peace of
        mind for material comfort and power.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The basic problem we face
        today is moral degeneration and misused intelligence. In spite of all
        the advances made by science and technology, the world is far from being
        safe and peaceful. Science and technology have indeed made human life
        more insecure than ever before. If there is no spiritual improvement in
        the way we handle our problems then humanity itself is in danger of
        being wiped out.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">GOING BEYOND WORLDLY
        PLEASURES</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The religions of the world
        have always maintained that human happiness does not depend merely upon
        the satisfaction of physical appetites and passions, or upon the
        acquisition of material wealth and power. Even if we have all the
        worldly pleasures, we still cannot be happy and peaceful if our minds
        are constantly obsessed with anxiety and hatred arising from ignorance
        with regard to the true nature of existence.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Genuine happiness cannot be
        defined solely in terms of wealth, power, children , fume or inventions.
        These no doubt bring some temporary physical and mental comfort but they
        cannot provide lasting happiness in the ultimate sense. This is
        particularly true when possessions are unjustly acquired or obtained
        through misappropriation. They become a source of pain, guilt and sorrow
        rather than bring happiness to the possessor.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Too often we are made to
        believe that pleasing the five senses can guarantee happiness.
        Fascinating sights, enchanting music, fragrant scents, delicious tastes
        and enticing body contact mislead and deceive us, only to make us slaves
        to worldly pleasures. While no one will deny that there is momentary
        happiness in the anticipation of pleasure as well as during the
        gratification of the senses, such pleasures are fleeting. When one views
        these pleasures objectively, one will truly understand the fleeting and
        unsatisfactory nature of such pleasures. One will thus gain a better
        understanding of realty: what this existence really means and how true
        happiness can be gained!</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We can develop and maintain
        inner peace only by turning our thoughts inwards instead outwards. We
        must be aware of the dangers and pitfalls of the destructive forces of
        greed, hatred and delusion. We must learn to cultivate and sustain the
        benevolent forces of kindness, love and harmony. The battle-ground is
        within us and is not fought with weapons or with any other sources but
        only with our mental awareness of all negative and positive forces
        within our minds.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness makes a full
        man. A full man speaks with an open mind. And like a parachute, the mind
        works better when it is fully opened. This awareness is the key to
        unlock the door from conflict and strife as well as wholesome thoughts
        emerge.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The mind is the ultimate
        source of all happiness and misery. For there to be happiness in the
        world, the mind of an individual must first be at peace and happy.
        Individual happiness is conducive to the happiness of society, while the
        happiness of society means happiness of the nation. It is on the
        happiness of nations that the happiness of this world is built. Here we
        must use the image of a net. Imagine the whole universe as an immense
        net and each being as a single knot in this net. If we disturb one knot,
        the whole net is shaken. So each individual must be happy to keep the
        world happy.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From the lessons of life,
        it is clear that real victory is never gained by strife. Success is be
        never achieved by conflict. Happiness is never experienced through
        ill-feeling. Peace is never achieved by accumulating more wealth or
        gaining worldly power. Peace is gained only by letting go of our
        selfishness and helping the world with acts of love. Peace in the heart
        conquers all opposing forces. It also helps us maintain a healthy mind
        and live a rich and fulfilling life of happiness and contentment. 'Since
        it is in the minds of men that wars are fought, it is in the minds of
        men that the fortresses of peace must be built'.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">SENSUAL PLEASURES</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Today, especially in many
        so-called affluent societies, people are facing more problems,
        dissatisfaction and mental derangement than in under-developed
        societies. This is because men have become slaves in their sensual
        pleasures and crave for worldly enjoyment without proper moral and
        spiritual development. Their tensions, fears, anxieties, and insecurity
        disturb their minds. This state of affairs has become the biggest
        problem in many countries. Since people in developed societies have not
        learnt to maintain contentment in their lives hence naturally they will
        experience unsatisfactoriness.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are four areas where
        man is trying to find the aim of life:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Material or physical
            level;<br>
            -Likes and dislikes or pleasant or unpleasant feeling;<br>
            - Studying and reasoning;<br>
            - Sympathetic understanding, based on pure justice and fair dealing,</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The last one is the
        realistic and lasting method which never creates disappointment. Today,
        people need more wealth, not only for their living and to fulfill their
        obligations, but because their craving for accumulation has increased.
        It has become a sort of competition.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In experience worldly
        pleasure there must be an external object or partner but to gain mental
        happiness it is not necessary to such have an external object.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Many young people have lost
        confidence in themselves and have to face difficulty in dealing what to
        do with their lives. The main cause of this mental attitude is excessive
        ambition and anxieties created by competition, jealousy and insecurity.
        Such problems naturally create a very bad atmosphere for others who want
        to live peacefully. It is a fact that when one individual creates a
        problem, his behavior in turn effects the well being of others.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Animal never experience
        happiness but pleasure. Happiness is not based on the arbitrary
        satisfaction of one's own self but in the sacrifice of one's pleasure
        for the well-being of others.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">USING WEALTH PROPERTY</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To most people a wealthy
        person, community or nation is one that is 'rich' in the sense of
        possessing assets or money which constitute material gain. The word
        'wealth' originally meant state of well-being (weal). The word
        'commonwealth' carries this meaning. But it is now used to refer to
        property which generally promotes material well-being rather than the
        mental state of being well.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of course we cannot deny
        that desire for wealth is a valuable adjunct to success if held within
        proper bounds. Desire , in itself, is not evil. Unrestrained, however,
        desire leads to restless discontentment, envy, greed, fear and cruelty
        to fellow beings. The accumulation of money may aid in the achievement
        of a kind of happiness to some extent, but does not in itself bring
        total satisfaction. Where most men of vast means fail is when they
        confuse the means with the end. They do not understand the nature,
        meaning and proper function of wealth, that is merely a 'means' by which
        one can gain the 'end' of supreme happiness. But one can be happy
        without being rich. An old Chinese tale will illustrate this.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Once there was a king who
        wanted to know how to be truly happy. One of his ministers advised him
        that to be happy he would have to wear the shirt of a man who was truly
        happy. After a long time he found such a man, but the happy man had no
        shirt to give the king. That was why he was happy!</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Wealth should be used well
        and wisely. It should be used for one's welfare as well as that of
        others. If a person spends his time clinging to his property, without
        fulfilling his obligations toward his country, people and religion, he
        will lead an empty life plague with worries. Too many people are
        obsessed with material gain, to the point that they forget their
        responsibilities to their families and fellow beings. Happiness is a
        strange thing. The more you share it, the more you get satisfaction .</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If one is selfish, when the
        time comes for one to leave the world, one will realize too late that
        one had not made full use of his or her wealth. No one, even a wealthy
        person, will have really benefited from the riches so painstakingly
        accumulated.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some people think that by
        accumulation more and more wealth, they can overcome their problems. So
        they try to become billionaires, working hard, but after becoming
        billionaires, they have to face many more unexpected problems -
        insecurity, unrest, enemies and difficulty in maintaining their wealth.
        This, clearly shows that the accumulation of wealth alone is not the
        solution for human problems. Wealth no doubt can help to overcome
        certain problems but not all the world's happiness can be gained through
        money. Money cannot eradicate natural problems.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Philosophers, great
        thinkers and rationalists have pointed out the nature of human
        weaknesses and how to overcome them. However, many people regard them as
        mere theories and not as solutions to their problems. Sometimes the
        intellect actually creates more problems because it increases our
        egoistic opinions about ourselves.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">THE BUDDHA'S ADVICE FOR
        EARNING</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Contrary to misconceptions
        held by certain quarters that Buddhism, with its spirit of tolerance and
        particularly in its practice of meditation, does not encourage its
        followers to work hard and to be industrious. The Buddha , in his many
        discourses, in fact strongly encouraged his followers not to be idle and
        indolent but to work hard and to be industrious so as to accumulate
        wealth through righteous means to maintain economic stability. Whilst
        encouraging the accumulation of wealth, the Buddha incidentally warned
        his followers not to violate any ethical or religious principles in so
        doing. He also advised that man should not become a slave to the mere
        accumulation of wealth just for accumulation for sake but to protect it
        without neglect and waste. He advised that wealth should serve as an
        adequate means of livelihood for the family, should be utilized to
        assist relatives and friends where necessary, and to help the poor and
        needy as charitable acts.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In his discourse on various
        types of happiness in relation to wealth, the Buddha gave four practical
        classifications of happiness as follows:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Happiness in the
            possession of wealth through righteous and legitimate means</font></p>
            <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Happiness through the
            proper and correct usage of accumulated wealth;</font></p>
            <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Happiness in the
            knowledge free from indebtedness to anyone;</font></p>
            <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Happiness in the
            knowledge that no illicit or illegitimate means had been employed in
            the course of accumulating wealth and that no one had been harmed or
            injured in so doing.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">MAN'S PLACE ON THIS PLANET</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From the Buddhist point of
        view, man is different from animals because only he alone has developed
        his intelligence and understanding to reflect his reasoning. Man means
        'one who has mind to think'. The purpose of religion is to help man to
        think</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">correctly, to raise him
        above the level of the animal, to help him understand his relationship
        with his universe and live in harmony with it so that he reaches his
        ultimate goal of supreme happiness and fulfillment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The three questions which
        have baffled man ever since he was able to satisfy his three basic
        survival needs of food, shelter and procreation are:'Who am I? What am I
        doing here? Am I needed? Throughout the history of man, many
        thought-systems have evolved, with religion being foremost among them,
        to provide answers to these questions. Naturally, since man asked them
        in the first place, the answers were all seen from the point of view of
        man himself.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">MAN IN THE UNIVERSE</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Long ago man had been seen
        himself as being in the centre of the Universe, as its most important
        inhabitant. According to this point of view , the world was made for
        humans, for themselves to obtain from it what they wanted because they
        were the most favored creatures on it and everything that existed on
        this planet was for their sole pleasure.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This so called
        &quot;Humanistic&quot; view may be directly responsible for the terrible
        rape of our planet and our disregard for the rights of other beings
        which co-exist with us. For example there have been tragic cases where
        certain species of animals become extinct through needless slaughter by
        unsympathetic humans in pursuit of their sporting pleasure or business
        purposes. Even today the subjugation of nature by science and technology
        is being applauded. We must increase the number of those amongst us who
        have already realized the vast destruction that has been wrecked by man
        in the name of 'progress'. Up until now nature has been most forgiving
        and it has allowed man to continue to think that this planet was made
        for him to rape and plunder at will, to satisfy his insatiable greed for
        material possessions and sensual gratification. Today there are many
        warning signs to indicate that the comfortable times are about to end.
        Hopefully, if Compassion and Right View will not save the world , then
        at least the same selfishness and desire for self-preservation and
        self-gratification will force man to give some sensible thought to our
        impoverished environment and our suffering fellow creatures on this
        earth.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To understand the place of
        man in the Universe from a Buddhist point of view we must first of all
        look at the Buddha's views on the cosmos. According to Him, the Universe
        is to be understood in terms of a vast cosmic space. His teaching
        categorized the whole universe into three groups: planets with living
        beings, planets with elements and only space itself.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We can see man as a
        specially favored creature that had come into existence to enjoy the
        pleasures of a specially formed planet or the centre of the universe,
        Buddhism views man as a tiny being not only in strength but also in life
        span. Man is no more than just another creature but with intelligence
        that inhabits universe.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Biologically, humans are
        weaker than any other beings big or small. Other animals are born armed
        with some sort of weapon for their own protection and survival. Humans,
        on the other hand have their mind for every thing but not as a weapon.
        Humans are regarded as cultured living beings because they are to
        harmonize with others but not to destroy them. Religion was discovered
        by them for this purpose. Everything that lives share the same life
        force which energizes man. They are part of the same cosmic energy which
        takes various forms during endless rebirths, passing from human to
        animal, to divine form and back again, motivated by the powerful craving
        for existence (the survival instinct) which takes them from birth to
        death and to rebirth again in a never-ending cycle called samsara. The
        three detrimental sources of man which bind him to samsara are Greed,
        Hatred and Delusion.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This cycle can only be
        broken irrevocably through the development of Wisdom which destroy these
        fetters and puts an end to craving. Our share fate as beings who inhabit
        this planet is that we all want desperately to go on living.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All things depend on each
        other for their existence. A man cannot see himself as different from
        (let alone being superior to) other beings because his body is solely
        dependent on food, which means he is dependent on plants, water, oxygen,
        etc. for his existence. At the same time his mind also exists
        dependently because the existence of thoughts rely on sense data which
        are derived from the external world of objects and persons. The whole
        universe must be seen as an immense net: if only one knot in it is
        shaken, the whole net vibrates. Man owes allegiance to the world because
        he is dependent on it for his existence both physically and mentally.
        His attitude towards the world should therefore not be the arrogance of
        a pampered only child but one of humility: the world was not made for
        him alone, nor is the world always made out in his favor. Worldly
        conditions have no favoritism; they are neither kind nor cruel but
        neutral. Man exists because the rest of the world allows him to do so.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore he should not try
        to squeeze things out from the world only for his own benefit. He must
        maintain a sense of awe and respect towards nature and all beings. Man
        is a relative newcomer to the planet Earth. He must learn to respect his
        other brethren. He must learn to behave more like a guest rather than a
        player in a card game where the winner takes all.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It was in recognition of
        this interdependence that the Buddha advised his followers to practice
        metta (loving-kindness) to all, to radiate that compassion towards all
        beings. The Buddha does not mean that men should extend their love to
        fellow human beings only (he certainly does not recommend special
        treatment for their 'fellow Buddhists'). Whenever he talks about loving
        others he always speaks of 'all beings' (sabbe satta) even those lacking
        material form, the conscious, the super conscious.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Three modes of birth:
        living beings are those that are moisture-born, egg-born, womb-born and
        those spontaneously arising in other planes of existence. Clearly the
        Buddha was teaching that if a man is to live on this planet he must
        develop an attitude of loving kindness towards not only fellow human
        beings but all beings that inhabit this planet as well as in other
        planes of existence. Only then can he vanquish the selfish thoughts
        which place his needs and survival above the needs of all others.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhist cosmology man
        is simply the inhabitant of one of the existing planes one can go to
        after death. These range from superconscious levels through the highly
        sensuous down to the four unhappy states. Man occupies a mid-way
        position in these realms. The so-called divine realms are 'happy' state
        but they too are impermanent. Although there are indications to lead us
        to believe that some intelligent living beings do exist in other world
        systems, it is not verifiable whether there are beings similar to humans
        in other planets of the universe. It is in terms of this infinite vast
        cosmic context that Buddhism tries to understand the place of man in the
        universe. In terms of that context man seems to be small. We must add to
        this man's propensity for cruelty, for his ability to inflict pain on
        others which makes him at times far less admirable than animals which
        only attack to satisfy their basic need for food, shelter or sex.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">MAN'S UNIQUE POSITION</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One might argue that this
        is a very negative view of man, relegating him to an inferior position
        and disregarding his magnificent achievements in philosophy, religion,
        psychology, science, the arts, architecture, literature and development
        of culture and the like. Far from it, in this cosmic context humans
        assume a unique position because they have the most rare privilege of
        easy accessibility to salvation. It is for three reasons.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Human world is a good,
        well-balanced mixture of pleasure and pain. When pleasure is intensified
        (in the divine realms) or pain in predominant (in the lower world) one's
        mind does not turn towards spirituality. Buddhists maintain that extreme
        austerity or extreme self indulgence are not conducive to the
        development of wisdom and understanding . The Middle Path between
        extreme pleasure and austerity is advocated and the human world provides
        man the opportunity to tread the Middle Path. The second reason is the
        relative short span of human life and the unpredictability of the time
        of death. Faced with imminent death one is more often inclined to
        spirituality. The third reason is that while in other realms the
        inhabitants are mere passive recipients of the effects of their past
        kamma, man is a favorable position to create fresh kamma, and is thus
        able to shape his own destiny.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All of this gives man the
        responsibility to work out his own salvation in the human plane. He is
        in effect his own Creator and Savior. Many others believe that religion
        has come down from heaven but Buddhists know that Buddhism started on
        the earth and reached heaven.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What this implies is that
        each man has within him the Buddha-seed (potential for perfection) which
        he can develop without any external aid. One can become a Buddha through
        birth in the human plane , because it is here that he can experience
        existence in its entirely. Buddhists would certainly agree with
        Shakespeare's view of the human paradox -</font></p>

        </blockquote>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These principles are not

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The ultimate aim of man in

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Marriage is a partnership
        in which two individuals of opposite sexes but equal worth as human
        beings choose to live together. A happy and lasting marriage requires a
        lot of hard work and commitment where love is fed with shared
        experiences, joys and sorrows.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Marriage is the culmination
        of love by two individuals committed to one another by a common bond.
        'How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and
        breadth and height my soul can reach ...'(Robert Browning). We believe
        as Browning does, that love is the essence of life itself, something
        which transcends boundaries, race and creed.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Marriage has failed to
        fulfill its purposes today because people have failed to recognize the
        importance of equality and respect for women. These privileges are
        enjoyed by many women in a large number of areas of human activity.
        Strangely when it comes to marriage, women are still treated badly. The
        importance of the role of women in society was undoubtedly widened after
        the advent of Buddhism in India, giving them a wide scope to venture
        into vacations besides house-keeping. In spite of this, for the vast
        majority, to get married and rear children remained the normal choice of
        career. But there was a difference: married life was ennobled by the
        noble position given to it by the Buddha himself to such an undertaking.
        He lifted the married women from a state of servant to a state of
        responsibility and importance. As an indication of the Buddha's concern
        for maintenance of happiness through marriage, he laid down specific
        instructions for the guidance of husband and wife.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was full of
        praise for happy couples. Among his lay disciples were Nakulamata and
        Nakulapita who were considered most eminent for having lived together
        amicably for a long time. The Buddha praised them and gave instructions
        to others as to how they too could live happily in marriage. These
        instructions given over two thousand five hundred years ago hold good
        even to this day. Much misery has been experienced in modern times by
        men and women in married life because they deviated from these
        instructions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The institution of marriage
        in ancient India was governed by the concept of caste, the position of
        women, the rights of men and the four stages of the individual's life.
        The Buddha's rejection of the concept of the caste system meant that the
        Buddhist institution of marriage was emancipated from these rigid and
        inflexible rules, regulations and rituals which had become a great
        obstacle to the free and unprejudiced behavior of the members of society
        both male and female.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The discourse of
        Fundamentals of Buddhist Social Ethic, (Sigalovada Sutra) generally lays
        down the basic pattern of relationships between husband and wife,
        parents and children, and enumerates the reprisal duties that bind them
        together emphasizing the most essential aspects of their common life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The comprehensive study of
        the Buddhist institution of marriage outlined in the Buddha's teaching
        clearly shows that was intended for the enjoyment, promotion and
        moralization of biological needs, psychological satisfaction and
        material well-being of both husband and wife without any reference to
        specific customs, sacraments or any kind of ideology, religious or
        otherwise.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Buddha,
        cultural compatibility between husband and wife was considered as one of
        the factors of successful married life. Many of today's problems in
        marriage arise from the inability of the parties concerned to recognize
        the sacrifices involved. Marriage is not simply lust and romance.
        Romance is not a bad thing in itself, but it is emotional and has
        limitations.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There will be less
        disillusion and heartache in marriage if we understand that, from the
        illusions of romance, a deep and abiding love may emerge. Love is a
        passionate and abiding desire, on the part of two people, to produce
        together conditions under which each can express his of her real self
        and to produce together an intellectual soil and an emotional climate in
        which each can flourish, far superior to what either could achieve
        alone.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the past we heard of
        blissfully married couples who shared the sweetness of love earned
        through years of being together, for better or for worse. For most who
        have been long-married couples, 'happily ever after did not just happen.
        Couples in long, happy marriages mentioned this fact of life when asked
        what made their relationships a success'. 'We worked to keep the romance
        alive. We enjoyed our differences and learned from them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">'We voiced our discontents
        freely and deal with them right away instead of letting them build into
        thunderclouds'. But in a way, the thing all successful couples have in
        the common was reflected in this observation: 'Even when things were
        really bad, we were both too stubborn to quit'. Perhaps what
        characterizes modern couples with problems is that they want things to
        work out too easily as it happens on television. No, everything good
        must be earned through hard work.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For many the road to
        marital longevity has not been soothe. The bumps included many things:
        inability to have children, the death of a child, a disabled child. a
        difficult economic crisis and highly stressful career changes.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Although none of the
        couples surveyed said so specifically it was obvious that two other
        factors were important to their marital success. Firstly, even though
        some couples forced considerable differences in personality and
        sometimes carried heavy emotional baggage, they maintained respect for
        one another always and refrained from trying to remake their partners. A
        wife once told her husband: 'You married me for what I am'. He retorted,
        'No, I married you for what you would become'. Now of course both
        parties were wrong because their expectations were different and they
        were unwilling to compromise. Secondly, none of the marriages was marred
        by psychological disturbances too severe to preclude a true partnership.
        There was a wife who always used to insult her husband even for a minor
        mistake stating: 'You are a stupid man'. The husband on the other hand
        was a tolerant man. However, one day when he was scolded by the wife
        using the same word the husband retorted: ' I think you are right. If I
        were not stupid man, do you think that I would ever marry a woman like
        you?' From that day onwards she did not repeat that insulting word.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To achieve a successful
        marriage, couples also need to understand and accept the differences
        between the two genders. Couples sometimes become frustrated with each
        other and wish that their partner was more like them. Knowing and being
        able to tolerate the differences between men and women helps a lot in
        marriage.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A&nbsp;mate who is willing
        to weather the hard times and make the adjustments that come with
        children, job changes, financial difficulties or simply learning more
        about the person one is married to, is the real secret to a successful
        marriage.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Another saying on married
        life: Wife becomes a mistress to a young man, a companion to the middle
        aged, and a nurse to an old man'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Many couples with children
        are determined to stay together at least until their children are grown
        up. With just a little effort these years can be among the most
        fulfilling times in a marriage.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Marriage is a blessing but
        many people turn their married lives into misery and a curse. Poverty is
        not the main cause of an unhappy married life. Both husband and wife
        must learn to share the pleasure and pain of everything in their daily
        lives. Mutual understanding is the secret of a happy family life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In a true marriage, man and
        woman think more of the partnership than they do of themselves
        individually. Marriage is a bicycle made for two. A feeling of security
        and contentment comes from mutual efforts.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A wife is not her husband's
        servant. She deserves respect as an equal. Though a man is generally
        regarded even today as being the bread winner helping out with household
        chores do not demean his masculinity. At the same time, a nagging and
        grumpy wife is not going to make up for shortages in the home. Neither
        will her suspicion of her husband help to make a happy marriage. If her
        husband has shortcomings, only tolerance and kind words will get him to
        see light. It is important in marriage to keep tolerance alive
        throughout. Little things can mean a lot. Right understanding and moral
        conduct are the practical sides of wisdom.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From time immemorial,
        flowers have been considered the language of love. They don't cost much.
        Wives, or for that matter all women, attach a lot of importance to
        birthdays and anniversaries, and caring husbands should never be too
        busy to keep love alive with little tributes and attentions.
        Trivialities such as these are at the bottom of most marital happiness.
        Wives do appreciate such little attentions from their courteous husbands
        and it is this lifelong goodwill that keeps the home fires burning.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A carefully developed
        family affection is a simple formula that works both for keeping
        marriages together and bringing up children of good character. True love
        means being willing to value ones' partner and being unwilling to
        devalue him or her in the presence of other people. This willingness has
        to spring from the heart. The key difference between marriages that work
        and those that do not is how much a couple value each other.
        Criticizing, putting down or belittling a spouse particularly in the
        presence of other people, erodes a relationship. And even this is not
        enough as each still has to value the other as he or she is a rare gem.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes words are not
        necessary if there is understanding. An elderly father one confessed to
        his children that he loved their mother very much and told them to take
        care of her always, even after he was no more. He confided to them that
        she was the best woman in the world and that the family as indeed lucky
        to have her around. The wife, now in her 60's, has seven grown children
        and as many grandchildren. Yet she confessed that she never once heard
        the endearing words 'I love You' ever uttered or whispered to her- not
        even a variation of it. The wife, who belongs to the old school of
        Chinese philosophy, is quite content with her husband's own caring ways
        and concern for her happiness in their blissful married life. Her female
        intuition somehow tells her that deep down in his heart he truly loves
        her and that she could not have been dealt a better deck of cards. It is
        in the nature of some people not to speak out their feelings, but they
        care. We have to watch out for their actions. The next key to a
        harmonious marriage is to work towards achieving one's objective. It is
        a law of nature that if no effort is put into, for instance, a garden,
        weeds will grow instead of beautiful flowers. The same goes for
        marriage.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Faith, not necessary in the
        religious sense, (though it helps tremendously if a couple shares
        similar religious beliefs) is another vital ingredient in a lasting
        relationship.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">How important is sex in a
        marriage? Sex is a natural instinct and if enjoyed within its proper
        boundaries can bring about great happiness. Sex helps to keep a marriage
        glowing, and is an important and vital area that keeps a marriage
        together. It creates intimacy, a shred experience between two people
        which no one else is party to. It makes the relationship precious and
        private. The important thing to appreciate here is the fact that men and
        women see sex differently. While men may view sex as an intense physical
        activity, women do not. For her, it involves an interaction with the man
        she loves, that is with gentleness, his care and concern. Understanding
        the fact that women need intimacy and closeness makes the sexual
        activity a lot more meaningful and fulfilling.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sex is much more than the
        gratification of an appetite. It is the basis of an intimate lifelong
        companionship, and the means of bringing into the world children whom we
        love and cherish as long as we live.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Through the ages we have
        learned that love and mutual respect must be the basis of close intimacy
        between the sexes. Sex, like any other tendency in man, must be
        regulated by reason. Man, not being governed by instincts like lesser
        animals, would find his tendencies running wild were he not to regulate
        them with reason.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There a saying:' Like fire,
        sex is a good servant but a bad master'</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A society grows a network
        of relationships which are mutually intertwined and inter-dependent.
        Every relationship is a wholehearted commitment to support and to
        protect others in a group of community.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Marriage plays a very
        important part in this strong web of relationships of giving support and
        protection. A good marriage should grow and develop gradually from
        understanding and not impulse, from true loyalty and not just sheer
        indulgence.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The institution of marriage
        provides a fine basis for the development of culture, a delightful
        association of two individuals to be nurtured, and to be free from
        loneliness, deprivation and fear. In marriage, each partner develops a
        complementary role, giving strength and moral courage to each other,
        with each manifesting a supportive and appreciative recognition to the
        other's skills.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There must be no thought of
        man or woman being superior - each is complementary to the other, a
        partnership of equality, exuding gentleness, generosity, calm and
        dedication and most important of all, self-sacrifice.</font></p>
