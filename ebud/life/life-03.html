        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">BREAST FEEDING OF THE CHILD
        AND ITS ADVANTAGES</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The modern attitude of
        working mothers towards their children tend to erode the time honoured
        filial piety which children are expected to maintain. The replacement of
        breast feeding by bottle feeding is yet another cause. When mothers
        breast feed and cuddle babies in their arms, the tender affection
        between mother and child becomes much greater. A breast feeding mother,
        through her maternal instinct, often experiences a tremendous
        satisfaction from knowing she is providing her baby, as nature had
        intended, with something of her very own which no one else can give. The
        influence a mother has on the child thus grows and becomes much more
        pronounced. Under such circumstances, filial piety, family cohesion and
        obedience are invariably enhanced.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A variety of arguments have
        been advanced to convince mothers that 'breast is best'. The reasons
        include both physiological and psychological advantages for the infant
        and the mother as well. The protein and other ingredients in human milk
        differ qualitatively from the protein in cow's milk. Breast milk is
        sterile and is not subject to contamination. Breast fed infants are more
        resistant to infections and communicable diseases. They are also less
        susceptible to allergic reactions. It is also cheaper to breast feed an
        infant than to purchase formula milk for bottle feeding. Breast feeding
        offers a superior psychological intimacy that results in emotional and
        cognitive advantages over other feeding methods. Breast-feeding also
        facilitates the development of mother-infant relationships and bonding.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Breast feeding the new born
        is more practical and less time-consuming than bottle feeding. There is
        no need for bottle sterilisers and washing. The milk supply is ready
        whenever the baby needs it. Babies who are breastfed have been found to
        cry less in the later months of the first year compared with those who
        are bottle-fed. Remember, nothing is more rewarding than the love
        between parent and child. Making time for your baby is definitely worth
        it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">During the early days
        following birth, breastfeeding provides the baby with the benefits of
        colostrum. Colostrum is the Pre-milk substance secreted by the breasts
        until milk is produced, usually about the second or third postpartum
        day. Colostrum is rich in all of the baby's essential needs.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Breast milk provides all
        the nutrition and vitamins the baby needs for at least the first six
        months after birth. Breast milk contains immunology factors that help
        prevent a host of diseases and allergies. Except in extreme
        circumstances, as in the case of mothers who suffer from AIDS and who
        can transmit the sickness to their babies, there is no real substitute
        for mothers' milk.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Also, physical contact with
        the mother evidently adds to the satisfaction of feeding. Authorities in
        various fields of child development have insisted that the breast is the
        only satisfactory way of feeding an infant. Breast feeding is
        recommended as many physicians believe it offers an advantage to the
        baby, physiologically as well as emotionally, because of the definite
        advantages that result from the mother's own satisfaction in nursing her
        baby. The baby needs affectionate handling, plenty of time and a relaxed
        atmosphere, just as much as the milk itself.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These traditional traits
        are for the good and well-being of children. It is up to the parents,
        especially the mother to provide them with love, care and affection as
        their rightful dues. The mother is responsible for the child being good
        or wayward. The mother can thus reduce juvenile delinquency!'</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Those who lead their lives
        by going against nature, must face the consequences either physically or
        mentally'.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">BIRTH CONTROL</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Planned parenthood or
        voluntary parenthood under the Family Planning Programme refers to the
        regulation of conception within the family and is often referred to as
        birth control. Planned parenthood refers to the regulation and spacing
        of offspring by legal and ethical means, depending on the health,
        economic condition and circumstances of husband and wife.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One must take into
        consideration the fact that a controlled birth rate is conducive to sane
        living. Rapidly increasing population is a dangerous trend that creates
        problems in the wake of people marching towards sufficiency and secure
        living.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In Asia, where generations
        of people continue to live in sub-human conditions, it is appropriate to
        take advantages of Family Planning, in so far as it does not come into
        conflict with communal problems. A country that is able to support
        itself enjoys the greatest freedom.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is no reason for
        Buddhists to oppose birth control. They are at liberty to use any of the
        old or modern methods to prevent conception. Those who object to birth
        control by saying that it is against God's law to practise it, must
        realise that their concept regarding this issue is not very reasonable.
        In birth control what is done is to prevent the coming into being of an
        existence, and hence there is no killing involved.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">ABORTION</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Although a person has the
        freedom to plan a family according to his own conviction, abortion is
        however not justifiable. This action is wrong because it involves the
        taking away or destroying of a visible or invisible life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The word abortion evokes
        images of desperate young women and back-street abortionists. To many,
        the word also carries an illegal and criminal connotation. In the
        developed West the issue has been politicised as well.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Abortion is defined as the
        expulsion of a foetus from the uterus, brought about by accidental means
        or induction, before it is capable of carrying on its own life. In
        medical terms, abortion is the termination of pregnancy up to the 28th
        week of gestation. After this period, the foetus is regarded medically
        as viable, and any subsequent expulsion of the unborn human being may
        either be a live birth or a still birth.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In law, when abortion is
        committed with malicious intent, it becomes a criminal offence and the
        party causing it may be charged and punished. When an abortion results
        in the death of the woman, the crime is designated as murder.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The abortion issue has
        always remained contentious, but for women faced with an unwanted
        pregnancy, the matter is neither illegal nor political. It is personal
        and one which has to be dealt with quickly, at whatever cost. Under
        certain circumstances, such women in desperate situations may feel
        compelled to resort to abortion. But they should not justify this act of
        abortion, for somehow or other they will have to face the adverse
        consequences of committing such a cruel act.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this country, ending a
        pregnancy is permitted only when it has been ascertained that the
        mother's physical or mental health is in danger. The procedure is
        referred to as therapeutic abortion and it requires the certification of
        two medical practitioners. Any other request for induced abortions would
        contravene the law.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Religious principles should
        never be surrendered for the satisfaction of humankind. Rather they
        should stand for the welfare of mankind as a whole.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">DOMESTIC VIOLENCE</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The problem of domestic
        violence affecting families, particularly in the lower income group, and
        in certain, cases even in affluent societies, has reached alarming
        proportions. It has become necessary for the Government to legislate
        action, resulting in the recent passing of the Domestic Violence Act by
        Parliament in June 1996.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Evidence shows that a
        battered wife in many cases still loves her husband despite all the
        abuses, which she puts down to his alcoholism, gambling, womanising and
        constant financial problems. This is the reality of the problem of
        domestic violence faced by a large number of women today. Many a
        battered wife just endures it because she firmly believes that any
        retaliation on her part might end in her losing custody of her children,
        and her right to inherit the matrimonial home and to enjoy any form of
        financial security.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The public generally holds
        the view that domestic violence is a matter that does not warrant any
        outside intervention. For instance, neighbours will quickly come to a
        woman's aid if they hear her scream that she is being burgled, but when
        she screams from her husband's constant battery, others are reluctant to
        intervene as they consider it a personal family matter. Until very
        recently this view was also held by the police. Under the Domestic
        Violence Act however, police duties now include escorting the abused
        spouse home to collect her belongings, if necessary. What abused wives
        ask for is protection under the law, and not so much that their husbands
        be punished.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Act gives protection to
        the abused spouse without breaking up the family. Under the Act one
        would be able to get a court order barring the abusive spouse from the
        matrimonial home, providing maintenance to the abused spouse and
        children as well as giving her custody of the children. The Act makes
        domestic violence a punishable offence.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">DIVORCE - ONLY AS A LAST
        RESORT</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Divorce is a controversial
        issue among the followers of different religions. Some people believe
        that marriage is recorded in heaven and therefore human beings have no
        right to allow divorce. But, if a husband and wife really cannot live
        together, instead of leading a miserable life and generating more
        conflict, anger and hatred, they should have the liberty to separate and
        live apart peacefully.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Separation or divorce is
        not prohibited in Buddhism though the necessity would scarcely arise if
        the Buddha's injunctions were strictly followed. Men and women must have
        the liberty to separate if they really cannot agree with each other.
        Separation is preferred to suffering a miserable family life for a long
        period of time.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some may prefer legal
        separation which is a kind of divorce except that the marriage exists in
        name for various reasons.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Factors contributing to
        divorce vary. When the flame of love suddenly dies or when the vow to
        'love, honour and cherish each other for life' seems no longer possible
        to maintain, divorce appears to be the best solution. Of course, there
        are other factors too, ranging from extra-marital affairs, in-law
        problems as well as family differences faced by working mothers related
        to the pursuit of a career. In this connection, we are reminded of the
        Buddha's advice that old men should not marry young wives as it can
        create incompatibility, jealousy and suspicion (Parabhava Sutta).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Under the Law Reform
        (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976, and with effect from 1 March 1982,
        Marriage Tribunals have also been set up throughout Malaysia with
        functions to resolve and to reconcile couples, other than those of the
        Muslim faith, who have marital difficulties. (Couples of the Muslim
        faith are separately governed by Syariah Law and come under the
        jurisdiction of the Syariah Court).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Marriage Tribunals have
        been set up in every State, including the Federal Territory of Kuala
        Lumpur. The Act makes it mandatory to refer a matrimonial difficulty to
        the Marriage Tribunal set up under the Act before a divorce petition can
        be filed.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Act provides a time
        frame of six months to see if the couple can reach a settlement. Every
        Tribunal has to meet the statutory requirement of three or four hearings
        per case within the six-monthly period. If there are no signs of
        reconciliation, the Tribunal will issue a certificate to that effect to
        the petitioner. It is only after the certificate is issued that a
        petitioner can file a divorce petition in the High Court through a
        lawyer.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, when parents
        get divorced, their children become the innocent victims who suffer the
        worst consequences of that failed marriage. Divorce is a social
        phenomenon and is something which affects the children psychologically
        and could make them feel insecure. They have to cope with innumerable
        problems of acceptance, adjustment and insecurity. Such young children
        will need constant counselling and constant moral support and comfort to
        ride out this very traumatic phase in their lives.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Divorced parents are often
        portrayed as selfish hedonists interested only in their own happiness,
        and not their children's.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some may have to live with
        a stepparent when their parents remarry and will have to make new living
        arrangements. Divorce is almost like denying child the right to have a
        fulfilled life with both biological parents under one roof. Because of
        their disturbed minds, these children could lose concentration and as a
        result their performance in school could be affected. This will runaway
        children and juvenile crime.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Very often when the divorce
        had been unpleasant and having suffered physically at the hands of their
        angry parents, children grow up being afraid of entering into marriage
        themselves in later life because they view it as threatening their
        safety and holding little hope for happiness. They have lost trust in
        their parents for breaking up the marriage and they also lack trust in
        the opposite sex.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For some children, the
        emotional scars may heal with time. But for others, they may remain.
        Divorce therefore affects not just two people but many other innocent
        parties as well. There must be powerful reasons before anyone seeks to
        resort to divorce.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Most children of divorced
        parents would occasionally cherish and harbour the secret wish that they
        would get reconciled and family life becomes normal again.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Utmost care must be taken
        to ensure that separation is done in an atmosphere of goodwill and
        understanding by adopting reasonable solutions and not by creating more
        hatred. In fact they should make every effort to part amicably as
        friends. If a couple has children, they should try to make the divorce
        less traumatic for them and help them to adjust to the new situation. It
        is most important to ensure that their future and welfare will be well
        taken care of. It is inhuman if the couple desert their children and
        allow them to fend for themselves and lead a miserable life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When a man for whatever
        reason institutes divorce proceedings it is the woman who more often
        than not will be the most hurt in the process. Her cherished dream of a
        happy married life would be shattered, particularly so if the husband,
        involved in an extra-marital affair, is seeking release from the
        marriage vows to be with the 'other woman.' A woman facing impending
        divorce would often express her frustrated feelings which is typical in
        such tragic cases: 'I was devastated. For me the world had come to an
        end and I thought about dying to make him regret for not wanting me.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The dilemma faced by many
        divorced women in Malaysia is the sad fact that she has only the right
        to care for her child but has no authority as legal guardian. In
        connection with this predicament, mothers who have custody of their
        children are forced to appeal to their ex-husbands to exercise what
        should be their (the mothers') right in the first place. What if the
        father does not co-operate by giving his consent or if he cannot be
        traced? The unfortunate child, who may need a passport to study abroad
        for example will be left in a quandary.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The only way a mother will
        ever get to be the legal guardian of her child is when the father dies,
        is declared insane or has a criminal record. Under the circumstances,
        lawyers generally advise women to start applying for custody and
        guardianship as soon as they are separated from their husbands, and not
        wait until divorce proceedings start, but this is never an easy process.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">DISCRIMINATION AGAINST
        WOMEN</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha says that if we
        are to understand anything, we must learn to 'see things as they are'.
        It is after such analysis of women in relation to men, that He came to
        the conclusion that there is no impediment in women to enable them to
        practise religion as men do and attain the highest state in life, which
        is Arahanthood or Sainthood, the highest level of mental purity. The
        Buddha had to face strong opposition in giving full freedom to women to
        practise religion.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At the time of the Buddha,
        before He emancipated women, the customs and traditions were such that
        the women were considered as chattel, to be used by men at their
        pleasure. Manu, the ancient lawgiver of India, had decreed that women
        were inferior to men. Women's position in society was therefore very
        low, and it was restricted to the kitchen. They were not even allowed to
        enter temples and to participate in religious activities in any manner
        whatsoever.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As we have previously noted
        under the heading 'Birth Control', discrimination against females begins
        even before the child is born into this world! The widespread practice
        of female foeticide prevalent in many parts of the world today testifies
        to this horrifying fact. Further on, under the heading 'Women's
        Liberation Movement and its Effect on Family Life', the discrimination
        against women in affluent societies, particularly those aspiring for top
        managerial positions in the corporate sector, will be dealt with in
        detail</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In developing and
        underdeveloped countries however, the situation can only be described as
        being far worse and more deplorable as the following accounts will
        reveal.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In India's ritualistic,
        male dominated society, widowhood is a terrible fate for a woman. There
        are numerous cases of widows (some still in their 20s) who were cast
        away from their families and shunned by society after their husband
        died.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Among superstitious
        families, a widow often is blamed by her in-laws for her husband's death
        and is even ostracised. There are few options left for widows. Hindus
        frown on remarriage for women, although there are no such barriers for
        men. Until modern times, widows were expected to jump on to the funeral
        pyre of their husbands according to a tradition known as sati. Although
        the practice was outlawed by the British several decades ago, the last
        known case occurred as recently as 1996. Most women in India have little
        to look forward to when they become widows.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One typical tragic example
        could be cited of a widow who underwent child marriage which is another
        custom prevalent in rural India. She laments: 'I was married off when I
        was only five years old. My husband, whom I never saw, was 13 and he
        died one month after the wedding. I am now a widow.'</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to the World
        Bank, 65% of Indian women older than 60 are widows. That figure rises to
        80% women older than 70.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The All India Democratic
        Women's Association reports that in India where a woman's identity is
        determined by her being an appendage to a male, widowhood has much
        larger implications than just losing a husband.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The situation is no better
        even in some other neighbouring countries. For a long time, families
        regarded daughters as inferior to sons and treated them accordingly. A
        girl is generally seen as suitable only for household chores. She lives
        through a series of social practices which generate, breed and reinforce
        discrimination against her. She becomes an economic burden and a moral
        liability. Yet, she is expected to raise healthy, hardworking and
        educated children and be a good mother. Many little boys grow up
        thinking their sisters are inferior having seen them treated less well
        than themselves. These beliefs are reinforced by many members of the
        society, including women themselves.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps the single biggest
        issue is the lack of support and the restrictions girls face if they
        want to do something with their lives beyond the traditional roles
        assigned to them as domestic help, baby-sitters for younger siblings,
        cooks and cleaners. In effect, girls are under life-long training to be
        good wives when they grow up.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As a 16 year old girl from
        Rawalpindi, points out: 'Our society does not treat girls well. People
        here do not educate their girls because to them girls are not theirs.
        Girls are seen as belonging to their future in-laws' families and any
        investment in their future is futile. They go to their husbands' homes
        at a young age, usually anywhere from 13. The rest of their lives is
        spent looking after in-laws, and bearing and bringing up children to
        prolong and strengthen their husband's family line'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We need to eradicate this
        type of thinking and make education compulsory and free so that it does
        not become an issue' she says. 'Girls should also be able to have jobs,
        working in places where no one disapproves and preferably with other
        girls so parents can't object. I have always regretted that I was born a
        girl. Sometimes when I was not allowed to do something I would go to my
        room, cry and pray to God to make me a boy'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Girl Child Project in
        such countries is slowly changing all this by developing a core of young
        girls to act as catalysts in creating local awareness of the problems of
        girls and the discrimination they face.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The issue of education
        crops up almost invariably. Many girls have had to fight for their right
        to education. Some were helped in this fight by their untutored mothers
        who believed that their own lives would have been better if they had had
        some schooling.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In many societies a woman's
        place is in the home; a married woman owes her first allegiance to her
        duties as wife and mother. There is no such thing as 'women's lib'. Even
        in some progressive societies women are humiliated. For example in
        public places, they are required not only to sit apart from the men, but
        out of their view -- that is, behind them. When women are placed at the
        back of a room or hall, it acts as a subtle indication that their
        expected role is 'behind' and not 'together with' that of the men.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some people believe that
        women are prone to evil. Therefore, it would be better to get them do
        more domestic work so that they can forget their natural evil attitude.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">WOMEN'S LIBERATION MOVEMENT
        AND ITS EFFECT ON FAMILY LIFE</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the distant past men
        went out to hunt for food for the family and the women remained at home
        to cook and take care of the children and the home. Hence the origin of
        the popular phrase: 'A woman's place is in the home'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the old days, women were
        quite content being home makers. They did not go out to work or pursue a
        career. The stereotype of womanhood -- a life that revolves around
        children and kitchen -- has eroded over the past several decades, as
        more and more women have pursued careers. Rural society in general
        however still promotes motherhood and not careerism. Society accepts
        quite generally the fact that the single woman worker ordinarily
        supports herself and she contributes largely to the support of aged
        parents and younger members of the family. Most women seek employment
        because of economic needs and changing attitudes about personal
        fulfilment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">However with the call for
        women's liberation, many women seem to think that the solution is to
        compete with men outside the home. Such women should consider very
        carefully whether they want to bear children, or to pursue a career. It
        is irresponsible for a mother to bring a life into this world and then
        leave it in the care of others without due consideration for its
        welfare. You are responsible for what you create.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There has been a notable
        increase of married women who are employed. Today, they have forged
        ahead as career women, often playing a dual role of working woman and
        mother. Most working mothers are torn between the guilt of leaving their
        children at home with servants and the call of their careers.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With more and more women
        doing further studies, the number of working mothers is increasing. Over
        the years, women have made substantial advances in the professions and
        now occupy important top management positions in government departments
        and in the private sector. The trend is most pronounced in the urban
        areas. In the political field women have risen to top ministerial
        positions, to the extent that they find themselves more in the limelight
        of public life, whilst their husbands in the background, have to be
        content and remained in the shadows of their wives.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Women executives climbing
        the corporate ladder to top management positions however still face
        subtle form of sex discrimination. The gender gap faced by aspiring
        women, particularly professionals, is most pronounced at the top of the
        corporate ladder.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Boardroom decisions usually
        end up with the remark: 'We are reluctant to groom them for leadership
        jobs because our investment is lost if they leave to become mothers.'</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Gender discrimination at
        the executive level however is not easy to prove; hence the term 'glass
        ceiling' has been coined to describe the invisible but rigid barrier
        that blocks women's path to the upper echelons of corporate power.
        Although some people categorically deny the existence of such a barrier,
        women's routes to the top are blocked by this so called 'glass ceiling .
        Hence to reach the top a woman has to make a choice between career and
        family. Some conscientious working mothers, with domestic helpers to
        look after the babies, have come to realise they could never leave their
        babies at the mercy of strange women; so however much they enjoy their
        office work they decide to give up their careers. It is indeed sad that
        some women on the other hand have chosen to pursue their careers at the
        expense of their families.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A child has a right to be
        satisfied materially, but more importantly spiritually and
        psychologically. The provision of material comfort is secondary when
        compared to the provision of parental love and attention. We know of
        many people from poor homes who in spite of their meagre income have
        brought up children well with penty of love.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Conversely, many rich
        people have provided every material comfort for their children, but
        being deprived of parental love, these children have grown up to become
        psychologically and morally handicapped.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some women may feel that
        advising them to concentrate on the upbringing of the family is below
        their dignity or something degrading and reflects the thinking of the
        old and the conservative. It is true that in the past, women have been
        treated very badly, but this was due more to ignorance on the part of
        men rather than to an inherent weakness in women. The Sanskrit word for
        a housewife is Gruhini which literally means 'leader of the house.'
        Certainly it does not imply that a woman is inferior. Rather it means a
        division of responsibility for the male and the female.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Women have been struggling
        for ages to gain equality with men in the field of education, the
        professions, politics and other avenues. They are now at par with men to
        a great extent. The male generally tends to be aggressive by nature and
        the female more emotional. In the domestic scene, particularly in the
        East, the male is more dominant as head of the family whilst the female
        tends to remain as a passive partner. Please remember, 'passive' here
        does not mean 'weak'. Rather it is a positive quality of'modesty' and
        'gentleness'. If man and woman maintain their masculine and feminine
        qualities inherited from nature and recognise their respective strengths
        and status, then such an attitude can contribute towards a congenial and
        mutual understanding between the sexes.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this connection,
        Gandhi's remarks are very relevant: 'I believe in the proper education
        of woman. But I do believe that woman will not make her contribution to
        the world by mimicking or running a race with man. She can run the race,
        but she will not rise to the great heights she is capable of by
        mimicking man'. Here we can look at the wisdom of the ancient Chinese
        when they created the YIN and YANG symbol. The curved line which divides
        the dark and light segments show that opposites need not take
        confrontational stances. When one dominates the other recedes. When one
        side recedes the other dominates, and so both remain equal. Womem has to
        be the complement of man.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In certain countries, many
        husbands hand over their pay packets to their wives who handle domestic
        affairs. This leaves the man free to concentrate on what he can do best
        for the family. Since each partner knows clearly what his or her
        responsibilities are, there is no conflict between them. The atmosphere
        at home is thus happy and peaceful where their children can grow up
        well.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, the husband must
        see to it that his partner is well cared for, that she is consulted on
        every family decision, that there is enough freedom for her to develop
        her own personality and that she has her own free time to pursue her
        personal interests. In this sense, husband and wife are both equally
        responsible for the welfare of their family. They should not be in
        competition with each other.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A mother should consider
        carefully whether she should continue as a working mother with all the
        attendant pitfalls or to be a housewife giving all her undivided
        attention, due affection and care to her growing children. Strangely,
        some modern mothers, particularly in certain countries with military
        regimes facing a shortage of manpower, are being trained to handle guns
        or other deadly weapons when they should be cuddling their children and
        training them to be good or law-abiding citizens.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In certain countries female
        soldiers often carry arms, though usually for self defence, and they are
        no longer restricted to the rear echelon. In the air, women now fly
        combat aircraft and attack helicopters, not just being drivers of
        military transports, but at home they still display their gentleness and
        caring natures especially with to children.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">CHILDREN AND SEX EDUCATION</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Teaching children the facts
        of sex and sexual development needs to be done with care, sensitivity
        and in a holistic manner. Coping with changes in sexual development is
        an issue every child must face, and the challenge is even more critical
        for children during their early formative years. Educators and parents
        must therefore regard sexuality as part of human drives and needs that
        must be correctly channelled.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The necessity for giving
        correct information about sexual development to children is of paramount
        importance. Children nowadays are exposed to knowledge about sex through
        the mass media (often with gory details), books, through the Internet
        and also from their peers, and if they are not taught to differentiate
        between what is appropriate and what is not, they might end up
        exhibiting inappropriate behaviour. No parents will ever want their
        children to obtain information on sexual development from the gutter.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parents can impart
        knowledge of sex to their children but such information needs to be
        tailored to the child's level of understanding -- in this case, the
        mental age, which may not correspond to the child's chronological age.
        Children are very innocent and can easily be victims of sexual abuse in
        the hands of unscrupulous adults. The child may not even realize that he
        is being used as an object to gratify the deviant sexual needs of
        adults.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One important area is the
        need to inform children as to what constitutes 'appropriate and
        inappropriate touching'. The importance of giving such awareness to
        children is stressed on parents. The child needs to know who is allowed
        to touch him or her and when, and where; what a doctor can touch,
        situations the child should avoid, and how best to stop inappropriate
        conduct in the classroom.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parents themselves need to
        be aware that inappropriate touching could also happen between
        relatives. For instance, parents usually tell their children to 'beware
        of strangers', yet studies have shown that in child sexual abuse cases,
        the majority of abusers are in fact known to the child, or are members
        of the child's own family.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As with other children in
        society, children require open lines of communication with their
        parents. This would include openness in discussing issues connected with
        sex. If any untoward physical contact has occurred they should be
        comfortable in telling their parents about it, instead of being too
        ashamed or too afraid to reveal details.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sex education is important
        because one cannot expect teenagers to follow rules blindly without
        knowing why they must follow them. One of the subjects they should be
        educated about is why they should abstain from sex until after
        marriage.Many people oppose sex education for children because they
        think that 'once you tell them about it, they will go out and abuse it.'
        It is significant to note that in Switzerland, sex education is taught
        in kindergartens and that country has the lowest number of teenage
        pregnancies in the world. What is vitally important is that children be
        taught responsible sexual behaviour from the time they are ready for
        such instruction. A sound sexual education will save the child untold
        stress from guilt, fear, remorse and retribution in the future.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">CRIME NURSERY</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The most fertile grounds
        for nurturing crimes are families. In spite of all the measures taken to
        decrease crime rates, violent crimes are increasing in many families in
        modern, technologically advanced societies. Most of them learn to become
        criminals from the way they are being brought up.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In some countries, while
        adult crime rates have fallen somewhat, crimes committed by youths
        continue to rise. We learn from the mass media that many children take
        guns to their schools. Sometimes we hear that very young children even
        below the age of five, have shot their siblings or parents. Usually
        crimes among youths are related to drugs and alcohol, which are easily
        available to them in some homes. Criminals are not born, but made by
        misguided and inconsiderate families and by the environment in which
        they live.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It has become a 20th
        century fashion among many people to live together without getting
        married. In some cases, children born into such circumstances suffer
        from neglect. Quite often these children end up under the care and
        guidance of one parent, usually the mother. The parent who is more
        irresponsible leaves the children under the care of the other partner.
        Women, since they often experience discrimination, have to work twice as
        hard as their male counterparts to provide for themselves and their
        children. The modern global economy is such that women are more
        disadvantaged than even underprivileged men. As the entire social
        structure has taken a completely different route from that of the
        traditional one, support for the family is also almost non-existent in
        many countries. Women often suffer more as a result and their
        difficulties are reflected in families they try to raise.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Children brought up by
        single parents often don't receive enough parental love and care.
        Psychologically-troubled parents cannot give very sound emotional
        fulfillment to their children. These children's baby-sitters sometimes
        are TV sets or other people who have been brought up the same way as
        those whom they baby sit. Many a time, baby sitters are young girls who
        need money for their own drugs or alcohol. They do not have any training
        in taking care of babies. While baby-sitting, they themselves. may be
        smoking or taking illegal drugs. Under such circumstances, children do
        not receive enough necessary care, guidance, love and, most important,
        basic education.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">No baby sitter can give the
        same love and care as mothers do. Children can never relate to baby
        sitters as they do to their own parents.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When they grow up, such
        children may start their own careless and misguided way of life. They
        don't receive proper religious education. Nor do they know how to
        explore religions on their own. To make things worse for them, TV
        violence become their role model. Many movie producers and writers are
        writing books promoting violence primarily so they can make a few quick
        dollars. Children who grow up without proper guidance lay their hands on
        these books and try to imitate what they watch on TV and what they read
        in books.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Many parents are also not
        very careful about their guns and alcohol. Some parents drink and smoke
        in front of their children. When they lose their sense of responsibility
        under the influence of alcohol, their senses are so dulled that they do
        not remember to put away their bottles, cigarettes and guns in
        appropriate places or to hide them away from children. They also
        unmindfully and carelessly keep their loaded guns accessible to
        children. Children are inadvertently encouraged to satisfy their natural
        curiosity by using guns, alcohol, drugs and cigarettes.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some parents, who
        themselves come from broken families may be without enough education in
        morality and ethics to restrain their senses and so misbehave in front
        of their children. Some parents, grandparents, uncles, and brothers even
        sexually abuse young children. Sexually abused children grow up with
        unforgiving hatred towards their abusers. Sometimes they themselves can
        turn to similar crimes when they grow up.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Society often makes matters
        worse for troubled families and their children. Gun producers are very
        glad to see more and more people using guns to increase their income.
        Drug users make greater profits by using small children, mostly from
        broken families, for distributing and using drugs. Children who make
        money by selling drugs do everything to encourage their peers to use and
        deal in drugs. When their parents are not at home it may be even more of
        a thrill to get hold of some drugs and alcohol from their own parents'
        unlocked repositories.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Divorce has also become the
        norm of the day in many technologically advanced societies. The ones who
        suffer most from divorce are children. In their young and tender years,
        children need all the love and care possible from both parents. That is
        the age they need proper guidance and good examples as models to follow.
        That is the age when the mind absorbs everything quickly like a sponge.
        When their parents are divorced or separated prior to divorce, children
        become devastated and bewildered. Parents, who are struggling themselves
        to handle their emotions and to put their own lives together, cannot
        guide children in the right direction, nor can they pay all the
        necessary attention to children for their healthy growth. If totally
        neglected by parents, children seek solutions to their problems from
        friends, many of whom themselves come from broken families. None of them
        can truly help each other.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even in homes untroubled by
        divorce, children may not see enough of their parents. Parents are
        extremely busy these days making money to provide comfortable lives for
        themselves and their children. Quite often they are not home because
        they have more than one job, to make more money. Some are not home
        because they have to make numerous business-related trips out of town.
        Some parents who may not be travelling are instead overly engaged in
        their work at the office. Some are such workaholics they cannot spend a
        minute in their waking life without doing something related to their
        jobs. Or, from very early in the morning they commute to work and cannot
        return home until late in the evening, bringing home some more work.
        They might go to bed very late in the evening and continue to think of
        their next day's work. They are busy working every waking moment of the
        day and busy thinking of their next day's work even while sleeping.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Asked why they are so
        obsessed with work, such parents might say that they have to earn and
        save to provide for their family. But since they always live in tension,
        they are always grouchy and grumpy. Grumbling, they wake up in the
        morning, and grumbling, they go to bed in the evening. Any tiny little
        thing can irritate them. They don't have any time for themselves or
        their children. They believe that if they earn more their children's
        future will be assured. But no matter how much they earn it is not
        enough. And some parents who have more than they need do not have time
        for their children because they spend more time with their friends than
        with their families.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When children come home
        from school, they often do whatever they like because there is nobody at
        home to supervise them. In some cases, parents pick up their children
        from schools on their way home from work and yet don't have time to
        listen to them. They like children to be seen but not to be heard.
        Children are afraid to talk to their parents lest they might anger them
        for speaking up about their problems. Children's problems may continue
        to grow, when they have no time to discuss them with their parents.
        Their peers are not in a position to give them meaningful advice.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some parents look forward
        to having their children grow up and leave home as soon as possible, so
        they can be free to do what they wish to do. Sadly, their children may
        also look forward to growing up quickly to be free from their parents.
        In extreme cases, some misguided, impatient children even kill their
        parents to take possession of their property. Children wishing to
        achieve their independence as quickly as possible become more selfish.
        We know the problems. There is no close-loving relationship between
        parents and children. But what are the solutions?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, both parents and
        children can be independent and still have a good relationship with one
        another. Relationships between parents and children have been highly
        valued by the Buddha. To promote these good relationships, the Buddha
        has advocated numerous measures. If parents fulfil their duties and
        responsibilities towards children and if children fulfil their
        responsibility toward parents, more harmonious and peaceful families can
        result.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">People who equate money
        with happiness are often at the root of violent crimes. Almost all
        crimes are committed by people who have not been educated in moral and
        ethical values. If you invest all your interest, all your energy and
        time in making money or in sensual pleasure at the cost of your
        children's future, how can you expect your children to learn the
        distinction between good and evil? Or if you teach your children to hate
        your neighbor because the neighbor is different from you and your
        values, how can you expect your children to respect anybody?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Or if you teach your
        children to hate others who follow a religion different from yours, how
        can you expect your children not to be violent? Or if you teach your
        children to hate others for speaking a different language which you
        don't understand, how can you expect them to reduce crimes in the
        society? There is a low number of violent crimes in societies where
        there is a close family link between parents and children, a close
        relationship between relatives and between families. In societies where
        there is a free exchange of time, wealth, energy, knowledge, love and
        care, violent crime diminishes.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Blessed are the parents and
        children who have a loving relationship between them. Blessed is the
        home where there is friendship and harmony. Parents should make some
        sacrifices to give all their love and care to their children. Wise
        parents should invest their time, energy and money to create a healthy
        home environment where they can bring up their children happily. To take
        care of their children, some benevolent parents take turns working
        outside the home. In some cases, it would be advisable for parents to
        change their work schedules, if both must work to earn sufficient income
        to support their families. Sometimes, either the father or the mother
        may decide to stay home to take care of their children if one of them
        earns enough income to support the family.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Good parents should realize
        they are role models for their children. To discipline children, parents
        must be disciplined themselves. If parents are undisciplined, they
        cannot expect any discipline from their children. When parents do try to
        discipline their children, sometimes the children may rebel against
        them. They might even say they hate their parents. Nevertheless, good
        parents should not be afraid of children's comments such as these. When
        children grow up they will realize their parents disciplined them for
        their own benefit.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes, children may
        have an important topic, related to anxious feelings or learning
        problems or peer-problems, and may wish to discuss them with their
        parents. Then, parents must listen to them mindfully, patiently and
        compassionately. During the discussion, if children use abusive language
        parents should reprimand them immediately then allow them to continue
        the discussion. If they show emotion, parents should not play a
        co-dependent role and also become emotional, but listen mindfully,
        hoping to help them. In other words, when children are angry, parents
        should listen to them mindfully and patiently without themselves getting
        angry, so they can be effective in helping children.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parents and children should
        have open and friendly discussions regularly. Parents should admit their
        mistakes and apologize to children. If parents shout, curse or throw
        their own temper tantrum, they should apologize to children either
        immediately or later on and explain the reason why they behaved that
        way. They should determine not to repeat that kind of behaviour in front
        of children. Children also should be encouraged to admit their mistakes
        and apologize to parents. Parents should appreciate the good things
        children do and acknowledge any improvement they have made. Reward and
        punishment works with everybody.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If there are several
        children in a family, parents should be equally fair to all of them. In
        dealing with family problems, parents always should exercise caution to
        do justice to all of the children. If they should praise one child more
        than others in front of everybody, their siblings may become jealous of
        the one that was praised. When parents are full of loving-kindness and
        compassion, solving any family problem is easy.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parents should treat
        children with honour and dignity, as wonderful human beings who are
        going to take the world's responsibility into their hands one day.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Whenever children do
        something good, parents should not forget to appreciate and reward them,
        at least in words. When children do something unethical, immoral and
        harmful, parents should immediately reprimand them and talk to them
        directly. Parents should know when to reprimand them in private and when
        to reprimand them at a family meeting, in front of everybody. Also,
        neither the father nor mother should criticize each other in front of
        children. They should have their own private meeting to discuss
        problems.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parents should choose the
        right words, right attitude, right moment and right place to tell the
        right things to children. In every situation parents should make sure
        that they really and sincerely love their children. They must assure
        their children that they honestly love them. If you humiliate children
        in front of everybody, children may do many wrong things secretly. They
        will also learn to be hypocritical. Parents must be very honest with
        children. If parents are dishonest, children lose respect for them. You
        as parents cannot demand respect if you don't deserve it. You should
        learn to earn it by your own behavior and attitude towards children. And
        don't expect to be their teacher all the time. Children, too can be very
        good teachers to parents.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">'One of the best things
        parents can do to establish and maintain a friendly and loving
        relationship with children is to spend some time practising
        loving-kindness and meditation. They should make it a habit to encourage
        children to join them a few minutes every day practising meditation. In
        many good Buddhist families, parents and children spend a few minutes
        reciting some religious verses. They have little home shrines where they
        gather every day at least for a few minutes.' -- -Ven Dr. Henepola
        Gunaratana, USA.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">JUVENILE DELINQUENCY</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Any discussion of juvenile
        delinquency raises two fundamental questions: (1) Who are the juveniles?
        and (2) What constitutes delinquency? In answer to the first question,
        the most common criterion employed is chronological age. The vast
        majority of the laws dealing with juvenile delinquency throughout the
        world provide an age limit beyond which special procedures and measures
        meant for juveniles are inapplicable. The age limit applicable to
        juveniles in Malaysia will be dealt with later in subsequent paragraphs.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The second question as to
        what constitutes delinquency is more difficult to answer. The word
        delinquency is derived from the Latin deliquesce meaning 'neglect', and
        it may be interpreted in broad terms as neglect on the part of juveniles
        to conform to the accepted standards of behaviour in a given society. An
        antisocial act is defined as a criminal offence constituting delinquency
        when committed by a juvenile.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some of us have a black
        sheep in the family or in our midst. What is the cause? Research has
        disclosed a number of factors which show how a young child may face the
        danger of falling into crime. The main reasons for crimes are stated to
        be: (a) criminal history in the child's family; (b) unhappy family
        back-ground arising from inconsistent behaviour by parents where harsh
        and erratic discipline is mixed with generosity in the provision of
        material gifts; (c) large family size; (d) a record of truancy, and (e)
        failure to do well at school.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A juvenile delinquent
        probably comes from a bad home environment, has no selfconfidence, no
        belief in his own identity and no experience of normal satisfaction. The
        key to the solution will be the family. To what extent are parents
        responsible for this state of affairs? The young persons who commit
        petty crimes could have been neglected in childhood. They want
        possessions and money. But because they do not know how to earn them
        they steal them. Those who commit violent crimes, in addition to having
        been neglected, usually are treated cruelly in childhood. They do not
        feel ashamed about going to prison. They have no sense of letting
        anybody down and they have no desire for social approval.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Divorced parents often
        create serious emotional problems for children. They are deprived of
        family traditions which could have helped them to behave with
        correctness and decorum.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is no way to make
        children do anything once they become truly defiant. Punishment and
        reward have their limitations. When do we start controlling or
        motivating our children? Psychologists maintain that it is in the first
        couple of years of life that the largest part of this process takes
        place during which period parental love arouses the corresponding love
        in children.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This period is vital to
        guide the child as he grows up to be a responsible or an anti-social
        person. In these modern times many six to seven year old children are no
        longer the little darlings we admired and caressed, but are often
        defiant little brats. Parents are largely responsible for such
        behaviour. We should nurture habits of serious critical thought in our
        children, teaching them to measure actions against consequences.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At this stage of
        development of children, the school has an equal responsibility with
        parents. Some children are afraid to go to school for fear of being
        bullied or teased or of being too self-conscious of their appearance or
        worried about doing badly in their school work or have fear of teachers.
        In the light of such experiences, an attempt to make the lives of
        children from five to six years more secure is appropriate.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Recent reports on juvenile
        delinquency released by the Welfare Services Department show a sharp
        increase in the number of criminal cases (300 per cent since 1962)
        committed by those below 18. This is indeed saddening, seeing how much
        effort has gone into programmes and projects to propagate and foster a
        caring society. Over 4000 juvenile delinquents were arrested in 1995,
        compared to about a thousand less in the previous year.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Most of the youths caught
        were those who had difficulties in school. Indiscipline among students
        has reached an alarming stage. Teenage delinquency has been caused by
        the lack of attention received at home, the presence of unhealthy
        elements in 'shady' video game and amusement centres an mixing with bad
        company. The study had singled out students living in squatter areas and
        low cost flats as the most vulnerable and problematic.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir
        Mohamad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, said that if the Government
        closed down certain centres where people encourage young person to get
        into some immoral practices, they may do the same thing secretly.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Police have also expressed
        concern over rising gangsterism and assault cases in schools. Such
        criminal activities need to be curbed to prevent more pupils from
        getting involved in serious crimes. Headmasters and teachers should
        counsel and advise pupils against getting involved in criminal
        activities. The police should be called in only if the problem is beyond
        their control.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Hisham Harun writes in The
        New Straits Times dated March 5, 1997:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">'Police statistics reveal
        that in 1994, the number of arrests for crimes including drug addiction,
        rape, incest, house-break-ins and car thefts stood at 4,192. Out of
        this, a total 1,839 males and 23 females were Malay compared to 590
        Chinese males and 18 females, and 421 Indian males and 10 females</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The following year, the
        number of Malay offenders in this age group rose to 2,402 while the
        number of Chinese youths arrested totalled 922; 507 Indian youths were
        caught. Last year's figures were 2,890 Malays, 770 Chinese (registering
        a drop) and 574 Indians, with Selangor, Iohor and Kedah posting the
        highest crime rates among youths in the past three years. Malay youths
        made up the bulk of offenders in all States.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">National Unity and Social
        Development Ministry statistics seem to support the police figures and
        show that of the 2,898 juvenile cases involving drug abuse and other
        social problems, 61 per cent of the offenders were Malays, 17 per cent
        Chinese and 10 per cent Indians. In addition, Malays make up at least 70
        per cent of inmates at the Hendry Gurney School for boys in Malacca'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sociologists and welfare
        officers point the finger at the pressures of modern living, which
        inevitably lead to a collapse of strong community and family bonds. Who
        then are the people who need counselling? It would appear that the
        parents need it as well, not just the juvenile delinquents.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Datuk Adul Kadir bin Jasin,
        Group editor of The New Straits Times stated in the Sunday Times in
        Malaysia that elders are also to be blamed for the social ills in the
        country.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Adolescence is often a time
        of conflicts - physically, emotionally and psychologicaly. It has now
        been established that most juvenile delinquents are school children.
        When school children display behaviour that merits concern, the
        authorities should call up their parents and make them aware of what has
        been observed about their children.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Such early 'warnings' could
        help parents take some preventive or remedial measures before their
        children add to the statistics of the country's criminal records. As
        such, the home and the schools have very important roles to play in the
        prevention of juvenile deliquency. If parents pay attention to the
        advice given by the Buddha as their duty towards their children, many of
        the problems created by the children can be curbed.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">RUNNING AWAY FROM HOME</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Running away from home is
        becoming a serious problem among our young people which gives parents
        much cause for concern. A 'runaway' youth is one who leaves home without
        permission with the intention of not returning. Young people run away
        because they feel a situation is intolerable. They see running away as a
        solution. But, in fact, it only takes them physically away from the
        problem. The mental stress and the trauma remain.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A social psychologist who
        has studied this modern day problem says running away 'is an irrational
        response to stress and frustration'. Indeed, 'there is enough reason in
        the home and school environments to prompt even the most mentally
        healthy person to consider flight as a way of coping.'</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When a child starts to
        think about running away, he asks himself many questions. He bargains
        with himself a lot more than we adults think. Yet they are willing to
        give up the known security of home, however limited, for the unknown
        promises of a new environment. Why? It is because they are so desperate
        that they perceive that any alternative is better compared to the
        suffering they undergo at home. Running away is rarely well planned. It
        is a spontaneous, impulsive behaviour.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some parents rigidly select
        and restrict their children's friends. Such parents may as a result
        encourage their children to think of running away - towards the promise
        of greater freedom outside their home. Girls tend to run away to escape
        a closed family and their parents' over-protectiveness; for example,
        having to make decisions about boy friends. Boys on the other hand often
        run away because they have been unsupervised for far too long. They have
        developed an impulsive and escapist behaviour, having got used to an
        unstructured life-style.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Strain may also sometimes
        arise from too little parenting. Parents preoccupied with work problems
        may be incapable of correcting their child's behaviour. On the other
        hand running away is almost always tied to excessive parental control
        and unrealistic parental expectations.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The country's current
        strong economic growth has led to various social problems which have
        affected the nation's youths.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With the advent of
        satellite television and the information superhighway, our youths will
        be exposed to even more information containing negative values which
        would lead to moral decay now haunting many youths in developed
        countries. We must prepare ourselves for the challenges of a new world
        ahead.</font></p>
