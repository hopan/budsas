        </font>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I- THE WIFE:</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In advising women about
        their role in married life, the Buddha appreciated the fact that peace
        and harmony of a home rested largely on a woman. His advice was
        realistic and practical when he explained a number of day-to-day
        characteristics which a woman should or should not cultivate. On diverse
        occasions, the Buddha counseled that a wife should:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- not harbor evil
          thoughts against her husband</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- not be cruel, harsh or
          domineering</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- not be spendthrift but
          should be economical and live within her means;</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- guard and save her
          husbands' hard-earned earnings and property;</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- always be attentive and
          chaste in mind and action;</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- be faithful and harbor
          no thought of any adulterous acts;</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- be refined in speech
          and polite in action;</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- be kind, industrious
          and hardworking;</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- be thoughtful and
          compassionate towards her husband;</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- be modest and
          respectful;</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- be cool, calm and
          understanding - serving not only as a wife but also as a friend and
          adviser when the need arises.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhist
        teaching, in a marriage, the husband can expect the following qualities
        from his wife:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">-<b>love: </b>A deep and
        abiding love is the most emotional and spontaneous expression of desire
        and self-fulfillment a husband expects of his wife. It is indeed the
        basis of an intimate life-long mutual relationship and the means of
        bringing into the world children whom they will love and cherish as long
        as they live. Here love is not limited to mere attachment (prema), but
        it is an all pervading quality of wishing for the genuine well-being of
        her husband.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">-<b> attentiveness: </b>To
        be ever heedful, mindful and diligent, as well as to give her undivided
        attention to her husband's needs;</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- family obligations: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">Besides
        fulfilling the duties and responsibilities of the couple's own family,
        the wife should also honor and respect her in-laws and deserving
        relatives and treat them as she would her own parents;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">-<b> faithfulness: </b>Is
        associated with chastity, fidelity and steadfastness of the wife. It
        also implies being trust worthy and giving her constant devotion to her
        husband;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">-<b> Child-care: </b>Motherly
        love is the foundation of all love in the world. As a devoted mother she
        would through her maternal instincts, even venture out at the risk of
        her life, for the protection of her only child;</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- thrift: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">As
        the wife is entrusted with the task of home management it is incumbent
        on her to be that household expenditure is kept well within the family
        budget provided by the husband. To accomplish this task, the wife has to
        economize on her expenditure and exercise thrift, even to the extent of
        being frugal in doing so;</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- the provision of meals: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">As
        the mistress of the house, it is the duty of the wife to prepare good
        nourishing food for the family. The family meal is an important event
        each day as it develops goodwill and togetherness;</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- to calm him down when he
        is upset: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">When the husband
        returns home in an agitated state, the wife has to express herself in a
        soothing manner so as to pacify and comfort him. This will ease the
        situation;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- <b>sweetness in
        everything</b>: Besides expressing her endearing and tender feelings,
        the wife should also possess a charming disposition, be always cheerful,
        pleasant and comely.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">II- THE HUSBAND</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, in reply to a
        householder as to how a husband should minister to his wife, declared
        that the husband should always honor and respect his wife, by being
        faithful to her, by giving her the requisite authority to manage
        domestic affairs and by giving her befitting ornaments. This advice,
        given over twenty five centuries ago, still stand good till today.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Over the centuries, male
        dominated societies have perpetuated the myth that men are superior to
        women but the Buddha made a remarkable change and uplifted the status of
        woman by a simple suggestion that a husband should honor and respect his
        wife. Such a remark may be common today, but when we consider it was
        made 2500 years ago, it is no less than revolutionary!</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A husband should be
        faithful to his wife which means that a husband should fulfill and
        maintain his marital obligations to his wife, thus sustaining the
        confidence in the marital relationship in every sense of the word.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The husband being the
        bread-winner, has to invariably be away from home, hence he should
        entrust the domestic or household duties to the wife who should be
        considered as the custodian and manager of their property and as the
        home economic-administrator.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The provision of befitting
        ornaments to the wife should be symbolic of the husband's love, care and
        appreciation showered on her. This symbolic practice has been carried
        out from time immemorial in Buddhist communities.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately today it is
        in danger of dying out because of the adverse influence of the modern
        way of life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The wife expectations from
        the husband are:-</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- tenderness: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">Being
        gentle and respectful to the wife on all matters when attending to her
        needs;</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- courtesy: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">Being
        polite, obliging, civil and modest in his dealings and consultations
        with his wife;</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- sociability: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">Being
        genial, friendly, communicative and compatible at all times with his
        wife in the company of their friends and visitors to their home;</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- security: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">The
        principal objective a wife seeks in her marriage is security to be
        provided by her husband.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this respect the husband
        is expected to be a tower of strength so as to withstand any form of
        external threat to the family and to provide them with adequate
        protection and safety at all times;</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">-fairness: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">As
        a responsible husband, he should be giving , compassionate and merciful
        as well as being charitable to deserving causes needing his assistance.
        As a father, he has to be just and reasonable to the demands of his
        growing children;</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- loyalty: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">As
        an understanding husband, he should give his undivided loyalty to his
        wife and stand by her, through thick and thin, under any adverse
        situation confronting the family.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">He should be steadfast in
        his principles and one whom the wife could, with complete confidence,
        depend upon in facing any untoward eventuality;</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- honesty: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">Being
        a responsible husband, he has to be upright in his character and be
        frank with his wife on all matters affecting themselves and their
        children. He should not harbor any secrets from his wife as this will
        ultimately erode her trust and confidence in him;</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- good companionship: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">The
        husband should possess an amiable personality and be able to mix with
        people from all walks of life. He should be knowledgeable so as to be
        able to engage in intelligent conversation at all levels of society and
        be approachable to anyone needing his assistance. He also should possess
        a good sense of humour to enliven his listeners who seek his
        companionship; and</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">-moral support: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">As
        a responsible husband, he should be able to stand steadfastly by his
        wife's side to the very end, in the face of any untoward eventuality
        confronting her and lend her moral support and much - needed courage to
        overcome such a situation.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">III- HUSBAND AND WIFE</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The husband is the
        acknowledged head of the family, unless he is incapacitated from
        performing his duties as such. Both in common law and under modern
        legislation, the husband is legally bound to support his wife and
        family, notwithstanding the fact that the wife has her own property or
        income or is capable of earning her own support.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even today where many wives
        work, the nurturing of a family should be a shared experience. Husbands
        have no reason to shirk household duties, to help the wife and train the
        children, especially when there are no servants to do such work.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Apart from these emotional
        and sensual aspects, the couple will have to take care of day-to-day
        living conditions, family budget and social obligations.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, mutual consulations
        between the husband and wife on all family problems would help to create
        an atmosphere of trust and understanding in resolving whatever issues
        that may arise.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">THE FIVE DUTIES TO BE
        PERFORMED BY PARENTS TOWARDS THEIR CHILDREN.</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Buddha
        there are five duties that should be performed by parents toward their
        children.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- <b>The first duty is to
        dissuade them from evil: </b>Home is the first school, and parents are
        the first teachers. Children usually take their elementary lessons on
        good and evil from their parents. Careless parents directly or
        indirectly impart an elementary knowledge of lying, cheating,
        dishonesty, slandering, revenge, shamelessness and fearlessness towards
        evil and immoral activities to their children during childhood. Remember
        the habit of aping. Parents should therefore show exemplary conduct and
        should not transmit such vices into their children's impressionable
        mind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">-<b> The second duty is to
        persuade them to be good</b>: Parents are the teachers at home; teachers
        are the parents in school. Both parents and teachers are equally
        responsible for the future and well-being of the children, who become
        what they are made into. They are, and they will be, what the adults
        are. They sit at the feet of the adults during their im-pressionable
        age.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">They imbibe what is
        imparted. They follow in their footsteps. They are influenced in
        thoughts, words and deeds. As such it is the duty of the parents to
        create the most congenial atmosphere both at home and in the school.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Simplicity, obedience,
        co-operation, unity, self-sacrifice, honesty, straightforwardness,
        service, self-reliance, contentment, good manners, religious zeal and
        other kindred virtues should be inculcated in their juvenile minds by
        degrees. Seeds so planted will eventually grow into fruit-laden-trees.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- The third duty is to give
        the children a good education: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">A
        decent education is the best legacy that parents can bestow upon their
        children. A more valuable treasure there is not. It is the best blessing
        that parents could confer on their children.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Education should be
        imparted to them, preferably from youth, in a religious atmosphere by
        training them to uphold noble human disciplines and humane qualities.
        This has a far-reaching effect on their lives.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">-<b> The fourth duty is to
        see that they are married to suitable individuals: </b>Marriage is a
        solemn act that pertains to one's whole lifetime; this union should be
        one that cannot be dissolved easily. Hence, marriage has to be viewed
        from every angle and in all its aspects to the satisfaction of all
        parties concerned before the wedding.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parents' observations of
        their children's life partners is important for their future married
        life. While parents must accept modern practices like dating and so on,
        children must know clearly that parents have a right to monitor their
        activities, know who their friends are. But there must be also a right
        to privacy and self respect.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhist
        culture, duty supersedes right. Let both parties be not adamant, but use
        their wise discretion and come to an amicable settlement.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Otherwise, there will be
        mutual cursing and other repercussions. More often than not the
        infection is transmitted to progeny as well. It is said that in most
        cases people who perpetrate abuse of others were themselves the victims
        of abuse.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- The last duty is to hand
        over to them, at the proper time, their inheritance: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">Parents
        not only love and tend their children as long as they are still in their
        custody, but also make preparations for their future comfort and
        happiness. They acquire treasures through personal discomfort and
        ungrudgingly give them as a legacy to their children.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parents who bequeath their
        wealth do not want their children to squander it but to benefit from the
        inheritance so that it will enhance their living standard. In all of
        this the bottom line is mutual respect, and concern for the welfare of
        both parents and children.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES
        IN THE UPBRINGING OF THEIR CHILDREN</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parenting is not like any
        other 9 to 5 job. It is never ending and there is never enough time to
        do everything. No matter how old your baby is, newborn or toddler, it is
        never too late to put your baby first and enjoy being a mum or dad.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Many parents think that
        they alone know what is best for the children and therefore expect too
        much from them. They force their children into tuition classes even if
        they can cope with their studies. At the same time they are asked to
        take up ballet dancing (in the case of girls), taekwando (in the case of
        boys), music lessons, computer classes and so on. On top of this, they
        insist that their children obtain straight 'A's in their examinations
        and excel in everything else. In this ratrace they turn their children
        into display objects; possessions which they can be proud to show off to
        their friends and relatives and for others to talk about.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the good old days life
        as a child and a teenager was never stressful because there were not too
        many expectations to fulfil. But children these days, especially those
        in urban areas, seem to have so many things to do and compete in that
        they are deprived of a normal childhood. Many people fail to realise
        that as parents, they have certain rights and also responsibilities. The
        child has his or her rights and responsibilities too. What we have today
        are people who want to be super parents, but in many cases the children
        do not turn out to be super. Parents should therefore be realistic and
        reasonable. They should not set targets which they well know their
        children cannot fulfil, thus avoiding unnecessary stress and
        disappointment to the family. Building a happy family is a continuous
        process.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Hence parents must not only
        be fully aware of their role and responsibilities, but also apply modern
        techniques in parenting accordingly. Remember the saying of the Taoist
        philosopher, Zhuang Zu: 'If you have 6 fingers do not try to make them
        5, and if you have 5 fingers do not try to make them 6. Do not go
        against nature.'</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">You are responsible as a
        concerned parent for the well-being and up-bringing of your children. If
        the child grows up to be a strong, healthy and useful citizen, it is the
        result of your efforts. If the child grows up to be a delinquent, it is
        you who must bear the responsibility. Do not blame others. As parents,
        it is your bounden duty to guide your child on a proper path. Although
        there are a few incorrigible cases of juvenile delinquency, nevertheless
        as parents, you are morally responsible for the behaviour of your
        children. Parental support and control have to be adjusted as the child
        grows. The ultimate goal of parenting is to become a friend to your
        child but only according to his capacity to accept responsibility. A
        mistake some parents make is that they want to be a friend to their
        six-year old. But we need to be careful about what we mean by friend. We
        certainly do not mean we treat a child as if he is an equal in maturity.
        But there must be love, trust and respect. At that age, a child needs a
        parent, not a friend. While building a loving and supportive
        relationship with the children, it is recommended that parents help them
        develop spiritually.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Above all you must have
        time for your child. Time to answer his questions, to help him
        understand the wonder of life. You have to bear in mind that you are
        stifling the creativity in your child when you do not answer the
        questions that he is raising. When a child is asking questions, he is
        indeed seeking to communicate, so the biggest challenge confronting you
        is to respond readily with love, and everything you do should be
        congruent with the natural inquisitiveness in a child.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Being spontaneous is also
        important in getting children involved in things and the greatest
        scientists have been known to be spontaneous. If parents do not know the
        answers to questions they must make it a point to find it out for their
        children instead of brushing them off and telling them that they are too
        busy, or it is not important, thus shutting them up and stifling their
        curiosity. You will feel guilty about telling your children during their
        most tender and inquisitive age: 'Don't ask so many questions!.' As a
        caring and responsible parent you should in fact respond readily to that
        natural inquisitiveness in your child.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The scientific way of
        solving a problem is to look at the problem, find all the data available
        and then put together a solution in a coherent manner. Likewise, a child
        whose curiosity meets with a favoured response will learn to think and
        act scientifically as well as creatively and it will serve him well into
        adulthood.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For instance, when you give
        a toy to your child, you should give it with tender love and joy.
        Instead, certain parents tend to almost shout: 'Don't open it like that.
        Don't break the toy, it is very expensive. Do you know how lucky you are
        to get such a toy?' So what if he indeed breaks the toy? If you can
        afford to buy the toy, he will quite logically think he can afford to
        break it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">You could instead be part
        of his discovery by telling him: 'Come my dear, let's open the toy box
        together,' and use the fun element instead of the negative element. Give
        the present with joy and love. It can be done if you are not stressed
        and unhappy yourself. You must be happy for it is only in a state of
        happiness that one is comfortable and generous.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parents sometimes are to be
        blamed for unwittingly inculcating negative social habits in their
        children. For instance, a parent who asks a child to say that he or she
        is not in when answering a phone call ( a seemingly innocent act )
        plants the first seed of falsehood in the tender mind of the young. If
        allowed to flourish in an environment not conducive to promoting human
        values, the child may well, in the future, become a destructive element
        to the peace, happiness and well being of family and society, and more
        importantly to himself.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Many parents and elders are
        today responsible for planting these seeds of falsehood in many
        different ways. They either encourage falsehood directly, or by acting
        or speaking falsely, initiate and allow the vicious cycle of human value
        degradation to develop. The fate of our children may well depend upon
        the parents and elders developing a right attitude to moral upbringing
        truth and truthful living.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Children echo the language
        of their parents. To prevent the use of rude or vulgar words,
        responsible parents should use pleasant terms, as children generally
        tend to imitate their parents.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A child at its most
        impressionable age needs the love, care, affection and attention of the
        parents. Without parental love and guidance, the child will be
        emotionally handicapped and will find the world a bewildering place to
        live in. Showering parental love on the other hand does not mean
        pandering to all the demands of the child, reasonable or otherwise. Too
        much pampering would in fact spoil the child. The mother in bestowing
        her love and care, should also be strict and firm, but not harsh, in
        handling the child. Show your love with a disciplined hand - the child
        will understand.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parents should spend more
        quality time with their children, particularly during their formative
        years. They should consider giving their children the gift of healthy
        parenting instead of showering them with material presents. This gift
        includes building a child's self-esteem, striving for positive
        communication, granting unconditional love and eliminating aspects that
        hinder the child's psychological development. These are gifts with true,
        deeper meaning. Healthy parenting is the greatest gift a child can
        receive and a parent can give.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, amongst
        present-day parents, parental love is sadly lacking. The mad rush for
        material advancement, the liberation movements and the aspiration for
        equality among the sexes have all resulted in many mothers joining their
        husbands, spending their working hours in offices and shops, rather than
        remaining at home and tending to their off-spring. The children, left to
        the care of relations, day-care centres or paid servants, are bewildered
        on being denied tender motherly love and care.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Providing the child with
        all sorts of sophisticated modern toys (as a form of appeasement) such
        as tanks, machine guns, pistols, or swords that are detrimental to
        character formation is not psychologically advisable. Loading a child
        with such toys is no substitute for a mother's tender love and
        affection. The child as a result is unwittingly taught to condone
        aggression and destruction instead of being taught to be kind,
        compassionate and helpful. Such a child will develop brutal tendencies
        as it grows up. Devoid of parental affection and guidance, it will not
        be surprising if the child subsequently grows up to be a delinquent.
        Then, who is to be blamed for bringing up such a wayward child? The
        parents of course!</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The working mother,
        especially after a hard day's work in an office, followed by household
        chores, can hardly find time for the child that is yearning for her care
        and attention. Parents who have no time for their children now should
        not complain later in life when these same children have no time for
        them. Parents who claim that they spend a lot of money on their children
        but are too busy should not complain when in later life their 'busy'
        children in turn decide to leave them in Homes for the Aged!</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Most women work today so
        that the family can enjoy more material benefits. They should seriously
        consider Gandhi's advice for men to seek freedom from greed rather than
        freedom from need. Of course, given today's economic set-up we cannot
        deny that some mothers are forced to work. In such a case, the father
        and mother must make extra sacrifices of their time to compensate for
        what their children miss when they are away. If both parents spend their
        non-working hours at home with their children, there will be greater
        harmony and understanding between parents and children. We call this
        quality time'. with the family.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Children who are left in
        the care of relatives, day care centres or paid servants, as well as
        latch key children who are left to their own devices at home, are often
        deprived of motherly love and care. The mother, feeling guilty about
        this lack of attention, will try to placate the child by giving in to
        all sorts of demands. Such action only spoils the child.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Most men devote their
        energies and creativity to their work and thus what energy they have
        reserved for the family are merely the 'left overs'. Here is where the
        argument for quality time comes in, usually from guilty parents who want
        to justify whatever time they have left for their children. One of the
        flaws of the quality time concept lies in the fact that the needs of the
        children and the availability of the parents do not always converge.
        When the children need them, they are not around.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parents are often placed in
        a dilemma. Rushing home from a hard day's work, weary parents have their
        own family chores waiting for them. When the day's work is done, it
        would be time for dinner followed by watching T.V., and whatever time
        there is left is hardly enough to attend to a child's rightful dues of
        parental love and affection. More importantly, parents are not around to
        transmit cultural, social and religious values to their children at
        times when children are best attuned to receive them. This cannot be
        done during 'quality time'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some working parents may
        even take their work home or even bring back the stress and tension they
        gathered from their work place. As a result, they may lose their tempers
        at the children.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As husband and wife they
        may not have enough time together and this may even lead to broken
        marriages. There should be increased awareness that strong family ties
        can contribute to the healthy growth of a child.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It can be said that gender
        differences do operate in parent/child relationships. It is said that
        mothers and their grown-up daughters communicate more often, even after
        the daughters are married and have left home.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, it is
        different for fathers and grown-up sons. They are said to only speak
        when absolutely necessary and often about nothing serious. The
        conversation can be like a question and answer session.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The father perhaps thinks
        the son is a big boy and that he should know his role and duties at
        home, towards his parents and outside. But with mothers, it is different
        -- the daughter is forever 'my little girl'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Whatever it is, parents
        have an important role to play in bringing up their children and doing
        it well if they want to help ease the many ills plaguing our society
        today. Good values cannot be taught through words, but through deeds.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parents must be good models
        themselves. The old parental attitude that 'you do whatever father tells
        you to do and not what he does,' does not hold water any more. Parents
        must be of the right character themselves. If we want our children to
        begin life well, with the proper values, we have to start at home.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If things aren't good
        between the boys and their fathers, the latter must begin to look for
        answers within themselves.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sacrifices by both parents
        are needed. They should make time and try as far as possible to get the
        family members involved in all activities pursued, by creating family
        oriented activities.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The essence is on setting
        their priorities right e.g. a priority oriented towards the family and
        marriage, thus creating a closeknit family relationship for a harmonious
        environment.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A HAPPY FAMILY</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is true in every society
        that a family is the smallest social unit. If every family in a country
        is happy, the whole nation will be happy. What constitutes a happy
        family? A happy family is defined as one that is stable in terms of
        social, economic, psychological and physical aspects of life; and where
        there is warm affection and harmony among family members. A family which
        can strike a balance between these factors is indeed a happy family.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But when we look around us
        at the situation in most parts of the world, what do we see? Children
        loitering in the streets and video arcades. They play truant. Children
        are abused, wives are beaten and ageing parents are packed off to old
        folks homes regardless of their feelings. All these are tell-tale signs
        that all is not well at the most basic level of society: these are signs
        of social decadence.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is a sad situation when
        good values and traditions are no longer practised. There is little
        interaction among members of the family and friends and the sense of
        responsibility towards other members of the family is weakening.
        Unhappiness in a family may be attributed to poverty, but having
        material wealth is no guarantee of happiness either, if it simply breeds
        selfishness, cruelty and greed.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A child learns affection
        and love from his parents and, together, they make a happy family unit.
        Through this microcosm of society, it learns about caring, sharing,
        compassion and concern for others. Throughout the ages religion has been
        an important force to organize these values into a system that is easily
        recognized and taught. Thus family and religion are vital components in
        impartirng and nurturing these values.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The family plays an
        important role in the development of its members. The best of Asian and
        Western cultures teach and practise respect for elders, compassion for
        the sick and needy, care for elderly parents and consideration for the
        young.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Children growing up in
        families practising these values will emulate them and act accordingly
        towards others. But given the vast technological advances in modern
        civilization we are fast losing these values. Something must be done to
        bring the family back together and save society.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We must protect and support
        family development as an institution in the light of the rapid
        demographic and socio-economic changes world-wide. Extended families are
        giving way to nuclear families. We can do little to stop this trend but
        the values of respect, concern and compassion must be preserved. Good
        values, both Eastern and Western, must be maintained despite changes in
        lifestyle brought on by modernisation, industrialisation and
        urbanisation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The mother is an important
        figure in family development. As care, love, tenderness and compassion
        are her innate qualities, she imparts these sterling values to her
        children in their upbringing. The mother, because of her love, concern,
        compassion, patience and tolerance thus holds the family together. Her
        espousal of these values may be passed on to her children who are great
        imitators and who learn by examples. We must as a group reinstate the
        traditional function of the mother, although of course to suit modern
        needs and pressures.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Religion too, promotes good
        human values. Strong resilient families and the practice of religion are
        therefore necessary in the promotion of family development.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It could be said that a
        happy family is a group of people living amicably and peacefully
        together with emphasis on religion, discipline and parenthood to create
        a happy family atmosphere. Values like these should be upheld and
        religiously protected so that a family is not influenced by anti-social
        values and unacceptable norms.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Realistic and reasonable
        parents make for a happy family. And the only way parents can build a
        happy family is through the institution of marriage. It worked very well
        in the past. It can do so now, provided we make it relevant to the needs
        of today's living.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">MARRITAL PROBLEMS.</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Almost every day, we hear
        of people complaining about their marriages. Young people reading
        romantic novels and seeing romantic films often conclude that marriage
        is a bed of roses. Unfortunately, marriage is not as sweet as one
        thinks. Marriage and marital problems are inter-related and people must
        remember that when they get married, they will have to face certain
        problems and responsibilities that they never expected or experienced
        before.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">After the euphoria of the
        wedding, the realities of living together will set in for the couple,
        and for some, the prospects are daunting. Lack of communication or
        interaction with members of a family are some of the factors which can
        be attributed to an unhappy morriage. A stage will be reached when
        husband and wife do not even communicate with each other.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Common examples of
        non-communication between husband and wife are: (a) even at the
        breakfast table he is deeply engrossed in the newspaper; (b) when he
        returns from work he will be engrossed with his hobbies or watches
        television, and during weekends goes for golf or indulges in other
        postimes; (c) he does not express any feelings or concern for the wife,
        let alone observing important anniversaries or birthdays.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The wife on her part, after
        getting married, is no longer interested in her figure and general
        appearance. She dresses shabbily. As she no longer reads or maintains a
        stimulating circle of friends, the husband finds that he can no longer
        engage in a stimulating conversation with her. Life then becomes boring
        and this leads the husband to resort to drink and seek solace outside
        the matrimonial home.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When does discontent first
        creep into a marriage? For most couples, the first year is usually a
        good year. For some couples, the adjustments of living together as
        husband and wife may turn out to be a stressful experience. The arrival
        of the first child could also give rise to problems as both man and wife
        grapple with the realities of being first-time parents.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some people say that the
        first year after their marriage the husband would listen to his wife.
        From the second year the wife would listen to her husband. From the
        third year onwards neighbours would listen to both of them when they
        shout at each other.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Usually, discontent will be
        greater if there is no adequate preparation for marriage. For instance,
        pre-marital counselling will help couples prepare for the many
        surprises, pleasant or otherwise, that they may discover in the course
        of their marriage.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The dissatifaction that is
        supposed to hit most men after being married for so many years arises
        from a misconception that <i>'the grass is greener on the other side of
        the fence</i>.' This tendency to be attracted to members of the opposite
        sex has no age limits. Such restlessness can occur anytime during the
        marriage, even for women.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Boredom is the usual cause,
        whereas disappointment with the partner is also a common complaint. When
        expectations are not fulfilled, pockets of grouses will start to
        develop. In any case, when there is no firm commitment to the marriage
        and no religious foundation, anything can happen at anytime to
        jeopardise it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What are the roots of
        discontent? Many wives say that they wish their husbands would listen to
        them more, be more attentive to their needs or express their feelings
        better. It all boils down to a case of communication which is very much
        lacking in most modern marriages. In the past because of their
        upbringing women were content to remain in the background and accept any
        kind of treatment at the hands of their husbands. But times have
        changed. Women are much better educated, hold responsible jobs and
        knowledgeable of their rights. Men must accept these realities and treat
        their wives as equal partners in a marriage. They can no longer be taken
        for granted.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For most men, marriage is a
        goal which they set for themselves to achieve. Having done so, they will
        pour their energies and time into the other most important aspect of
        their lives, that is, their career or business.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The expectations of the
        woman, on the other hand are totally different. After being married, she
        expects more love and intimacy and therefore seeks to spend more time
        with her husband.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Bringing one's outside
        problems to the home and taking it out on the spouse and children is
        damaging to the family's stability and creates a stress spiral.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In Asian societies, the
        problem of in-law interference is a common one. This is particularly so
        if the in-laws are able to influence the decisions of their child. A
        common complaint put forward by wives is that the husbands listen to
        their parents instead of to them. The interference of the inlaws in the
        upbringing of the children is also a common problem. While the
        grand-parents tend to be relaxed with the children and sometimes spoil
        them, the conflict of values between generations is often glaring in
        such cases.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some young couples are not
        happy to allow their children to have close association with their grand
        parents thinking they will learn the old fashioned way of life of their
        grand parents.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In India and Sri Lanka and
        to a lesser extent even in Malaysia, the dowry system is one of the main
        obstacles to a happy union. The dowry could include huge amounts of
        money, a bungalow, a luxury car, all of these or even more, depending on
        how afluent the parents are. And because parents want desperately to
        marry their daughters off, they make promises which they cannot keep and
        the marriage starts to crumble.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The dowry system has been
        abused. In the old days, a dowry was given to the daughter for
        safekeeping in case of an emergency. Then, unlike today, women were
        totally dependent on their husbands and the dowry was a kind of
        insurance in case the husband became unable to support her.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Later, the dowry was to be
        handed over to the in-laws for safekeeping and now it has become
        compulsory for the daughter-in-law's parents to present her future
        in-laws with the dowry.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">People often think that it
        is a duty to get married and that marriage is a very impoftant part of
        their lives. However, in order to ensure a successful marriage, a couple
        has .to harmonise their lives by minimising whatever differences they
        may have between them. A couple must also learn to accept each other's
        shortcomings and personal weaknesses. Even happy, well-matched couples
        can experience conflict, hurt, disappointment and anger. They may
        recognise shortcomings in such areas as showing appreciation of each
        other, willingness to converse and expressing emotions clearly. Do not
        shy away from conflict. Disagreements can lead to marital growth, not
        distance. Quarrels are essential for survival in a healthy marriage. But
        a quarrel can only be successfully terminated if both parties can
        forgive and forget.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Be willing to work at your
        marriage. Do not assume that since the first 10 or 20 years were good,
        the next 10 or 20 will also be good. Love needs to be fed -- with shared
        experiences, joys and sorrows. This requires time, attention, courage
        and understanding.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One of the major causes of
        marital problems is suspicion and mistrust. Both husband and wife should
        show implicit trust for one another and try not to have secrets between
        them. Secrets create suspicion, suspicion leads to jealousy, jealousy
        generates anger, anger causes enmity and enmity may result in separation
        or divorce, suicide or even murder.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If a couple can share pain
        and pleasure in their day-to-day life, they can console each other and
        minimise their grievances. Thus, the wife or husband should not expect
        to experience only pleasure in their wedded lives. There will be a lot
        of painful, miserable episodes, burdens and misunderstandings.
        Discussing mutual problems with one another will give them confidence to
        resolve any obstacle that they will have to face. They must have the
        strong will-power to reduce tension and develop the confidence to live
        together with better understanding and tolerance.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Men and women need the
        comfort of each other when facing problems and difficulties. The feeling
        of insecurity and unrest will disappear and life will be more
        meaningful, happy and interesting if there is someone who is willing to
        share the other's burden.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Marital problems prompted a
        cynic to say that there can only be a peaceful married life if the
        marriage is between a blind wife and deaf husband, for the blind wife
        cannot see the faults of the husband and a deaf husband cannot hear the
        nagging of his wife.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">LIVING TOGETHER OUTSIDE
        MARRIAGE</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Living together before
        getting married, or cohabiting as it is more commonly known, is a cosy
        option among young people in the West, and is progressively catching on
        in .many Asian countries. It is said that about half of the couples in
        the United States and Britain would have lived together before marriage.
        One can learn about it in the movies and in the papers. In the
        conservative East, on the other hand, living together before marriage is
        still very much a taboo. The mere mention of the subject is enough to be
        frowned upon particularly by the elders. We must add however that as the
        world is shrinking so fast many of these values are being adopted in the
        East as well, especially in urban areas.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the United States, where
        living together out of wedlock is becoming increasingly acceptable, one
        out of three marriages results in divorce.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Tragic cases do occur in
        situations where couples live together out of wedlock, for example when
        the female partner gets pregnant and the male partner later disclaims
        responsibility. This often leads to the problem of unwed mothers.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">PROBLEMS OF UNWED MOTHERS</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Media reports of unwed
        mothers abandoning or discarding their babies at rubbish dumps, bushes
        or into toilets, drains and streams are just too dreadful for any
        caring, right-thinking member of society to condone. With such reports
        appearing almost every other day, the public is alarmed, saddened and
        have called for remedial measures to check the growing problem which has
        reached alarming proportions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some abandoned babies
        survive only because they are found in time by garbage collectors,
        residents or passers-by, although they had been exposed to such dangers
        as stray dogs, rats, ants and the elements of cold/heat. One wonders how
        these mothers can abandon their babies, as even animals are known to be
        fiercely protective of their offspring. It has to be remembered that not
        all babies born out of wedlock are from young girls. Adult women too are
        guilty of this terrible practice.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parents should try to
        understand their children. They should ensure that their children will
        turn to them whenever they have a problem.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">People who abandon their
        babies need help. They need counselling. We should not simply blame the
        West every time some problems crop up here. No doubt our youngsters are
        getting more and more westernised in their thinking, outlook, lifestyle
        and actions. Here is where the role of parents comes in.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some parents are too busy
        working that they unintentionally neglect their children. Hence, parents
        should spend more time to instil discipline and educate their children
        on what is wrong and right.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We need a humane approach
        in dealing with the problem of unwed mothers which could start with the
        family where parents and children do not communicate well. When it
        happens to a daughter, she is afraid of being penalised, of not being
        accepted by the family and society as well as the social stigma attached
        to her; and she has nobody to turn to for advice or help. She is already
        paying for her mistake by shouldering the burden alone. Her parents also
        do not accept her and society condemns her and as a result she becomes
        desperate.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To overcome this problem,
        family development efforts must be stepped up where couples will be
        trained to be better parents, and young people will be responsible for
        themselves through programmes on sex education. Religious bodies and
        religious counsellors can greatly assist the government to fight this
        terrible social desease.</font></p>

        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Child prostitution is one
        of the fastest growing businesses in many countries. Tour agencies and
        affluent travellers have brought about this state of affairs to a large
        extent.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sex has become a
        multi-billion-dollar industry and today children are being bought, sold
        and traded like any other mass product,' deplores Aaron Sachs, a staff
        researcher at the Washington - based World Institute.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">'At 10, you are a woman. At
        20, you are an old woman. And at 30, you are dead.' Thus goes a popular
        saying in certain countries.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the ever expanding sex
        market, child prostitutes are among the hottest commodities. This is
        particularly true in Asia, the centre of the child sex industry. The
        Progress of Nations 1995 report of the United Nations Children's Fund
        (UNICEF) lists Thailand as the third country with the most number of
        child prostitutes. About 100,000 children are selling sex in this
        country. The record holder is India with 400,000 to 500,000 children.
        The United States is second with 300,000. The Philippines is fourth with
        60,000.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The number of under 18s
        involved in prostitution probably exceeds two million,' the report says.
        'Best estimates suggest a figure of one million for Asia alone, and
        300,000 for the United States.'</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Although most of the child
        prostitutes are girls, in many parts of the world even boys are used for
        sex.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Rich tourists, according to
        an official of the non-government watch group ECPAT (End Child
        Prostitution in Asian Tourism), 'have realised that human life is
        cheaper in the Third World.'</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Why has child prostitution
        become popular in recent years? One possible reason is the fear of being
        infected by HIV, the virus that causes the dreaded Acquired
        Immuno-deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sex tourists think children
        are AIDS-free. 'With the growing fear of HIV infection, many people are
        always on the search for younger and younger victims, and the demand
        unfortunately has been met by the 'ever-eager middleman,' observes
        Ramesh Shrestha, a UNICEF official based in Hanoi, Vietnam.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Experts cite poverty as the
        reason children are forced into the sex trade. 'Children are attracted
        to prostitution because it pays better than odd jobs,' Philippine
        Senator Ernesto F. Herrera said in his recent privilege speech. Children
        of the streets of Rio, Nairobi, Manila and Bombay often get involved in
        prostitution in order to survive and not by choice, a world congress
        against sexual exploitation of children observed. The congress has cast
        a harsh light on the conditions of poor children around the world, being
        forced out in life to find work without any schooling.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In some other countries,
        street children are among the first to be recruited into prostitution
        and often kept in brothels. Others drift into prostitution on a more
        casual basis and not as part of any network. With no family they simply
        have to find a way to survive. Social dislocation push these children
        into a means of earning a living, which they know is dishonourable but
        provides a more comfortable compensation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In Latin America, street
        children come from among the poorest families, often from violent areas,
        frequently thrown out by the family, according to Per-Erik Astrom of the
        Swedish branch of the 'Save the Children Fund'. He said: 'A child of 15
        in Rio, if he has lived that long, knows everything about survival, owns
        two younger sisters and has become a pimp himself!'</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A Chilean organisation,
        CERSO report: 'Mothers send their children on to the streets to beg
        although they know the dangers that the girls may end up as drug addicts
        and prostitutes.' For more than 10 years now, Ladawan Wongsriwong, a
        two-time Member of Parliament from the northern Thailand province of
        Payco, has been fighting against child prostitution, an industry
        estimated to be worth US$1.5 billion (RM3.6 billion) annually.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Her crusade against this
        social ill involves a four-pronged strategy that includes a campaign to
        make people understand the causes, effects and ways to check the
        problem.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Although people generally
        have more understanding of the problem, there are parents who still hang
        on to the old idea that prostitution is indeed a good career fetching a
        high income for their daughters. We are trying to change all that by
        also having training workshops, meetings and seminars with parents as
        well as dissemination of information through the mass media', says
        Ladawan, 40, who is from Thailand's opposition Democrat Party and
        President of the Young Northern Women's Development Foundation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Ladawan says for the
        legislation to work effectively, it is imperative that all countries
        come to an agreement and co-operate to consider women and child abuse as
        a criminal offence because the child prostitution problem is not only
        the making of Thai people alone, as foreigners have a part in it too.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The demand from European
        tourists and those from other developed countries for young girls seems
        limitless. According to the international children's advocacy group,
        Terre Des Hommes, each year tens of thousands of sex tourists from
        Germany alone visit Thailand, with about 10% of them engaging in sex
        with minors. It is a fact that young girls from poor families, who are
        deprived of continuing their education at secondary level, are being
        lured into prostitution.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It has been reported that a
        Swiss business man sexually abused 1500 children in Sri Lanka within a
        period of eight years!</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is a growing industry
        of commercial sexual exploitation of children for pornographic purposes.
        Thailand has the highest record of child trafficking and juvenile
        pornography. This accounts for the most profane type of paedophile
        material available in illicit video collections containing scenes of
        homosexual paedophilic depravity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The recent discovery of a
        gruesome kidnapping and paedophilic ring in Belgium has awakened public
        opinion and dramatically illustrated the fact that sexual exploitation
        of children is not a problem only in Thailand, Brazil, Bangladesh, India
        and Sri Lanka; it exists practically in every country including Europe.
        The World Congress against commercial sexual exploitation of children
        has initiated co-operation at local, national and international levels
        to combat the child sex problem. Considering the level of international
        commitments, the World Congress has outlined priorities for the
        prevention, protection, rehabilitation and reintegration of child
        victims of sexual exploitation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The term 'child labour' is
        defined as the employment of boys and girls when they are too young to
        work for hire, or when they are employed at jobs unsuitable or unsafe
        for children of their ages or under conditions injurious to their
        welfare. The term has had different meanings at various times and in
        -various communities, depending on society's concept of its
        responsibility for its youth.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In Malaysia, the employment
        of children is governed by the provisions of the Children and Young
        Persons (Employment) Act 1966, which state that a child, or any person
        below 14 years of age, may not be employed except under certain strict
        conditions, such as light work suitable for his or her capacity in any
        undertaking carried out by the family. Under separate conditions, such
        as employment in shops the child must not be less than 16 years old.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Malaysian Labour
        Department has intensified its enforcement activities in the light of
        increasing complaints involving illegal child labour, especially during
        the school holidays. The illegal employment of children stems primarily
        from the acute shortage of labour in the country. The enforcement
        activities of the department have been intensified nation-wide through
        scheduled inspections as well as surprise raids both during the day and
        night.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Child experts at a regional
        meeting in Manila said they needed not just more resources for
        children's welfare, but also greater involvement of the media in
        conveying the plight of Asia's vulnerable children to policymakers.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">'Children who are poor,
        exploited or forced to work, remind the world that economic growth has
        not given them the benefits of prosperity,' said Pratima Kale, Regional
        Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for East Asia
        and the Pacific. 'The situations of inequity can and often do lead to
        anger, frustration and violence if their basic needs are not met; if
        their basic rights are not fulfilled; and if they do not see any hope
        for the future,' she said at the start of the Asian Summit on Child
        Rights and Media.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">SEX DEVIATIONS</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sex deviations, sometimes
        called sexual aberrations, have concerned mankind almost from earliest
        recorded history. It is customary to refer to persons exhibiting what we
        could call sexual deviations, or departures from what modern society
        agrees to be normal, as sex perverts. Thus many persons, otherwise well
        informed in their own minds, have categorised and speak of them casually
        as perverts, sexual psychopaths, sex neurotics and so on, often without
        understanding very clearly the condition to which they refer. Our social
        customs seem to compel society to look upon a sex deviant as one
        bringing disgrace to his family.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sex deviations such as
        homosexuality, bisexuality, transvestism have long been taboo subjects
        rarely brought up in polite conversation by respectable society. Strange
        as it may seem, teenagers today however are far more well-informed and
        open minded in their views on this subject.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">More often than not, one
        associates the word 'homosexual' with effeminate men or men in drag.
        This is the stereotypical image of homosexuality that, like most
        stereotypes, conveniently obscures its complexity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The word 'homosexuality'
        applies to people who are sexually and emotionally attracted to others
        of the same sex. Both men and women can be called 'homosexual' or 'gay',
        but these are only umbrella terms under which lie many shades of
        distinctions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Broadly speaking,
        homosexuals comprise gay men, transvestites (both male and female),
        trans-sexuals (female and male) and lesbians.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And to complicate things
        further, there is a very fine distinction between the interchangable
        terms, 'transvestite' and 'trans-sexual'. As most dictionaries explain
        it, a transvestite is a person who dresses in the clothes of the
        opposite sex, often deriving gratification from this practice.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, a
        trans-sexual is (as commonly understood) someone who has decided to live
        as a person of the opposite sex. Sometimes, a trans-sexual's
        identification with the opposite sex is so strong that he or she goes
        for a sex-change operation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some people who practise
        transvestism may not be gay; they may just enjoy wearing the clothes of
        the opposite sex without being sexually attracted to members of the same
        sex.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A gay is attracted to men
        of his own kind- gays, and not 'straight' men. When asked why a normal
        looking man would fall in love with another, he would say that there is
        nothing abnormal about him. Most people however find it difficult to
        accept gays as normal people.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Transvestites and
        trans-sexuals, on the other hand, consider themselves, and are
        considered by the gay community, as women. They generally feel that they
        are women trapped in male bodies. And as women, they are attracted to
        straight men, and not to gay man.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The world is indeed very
        much a lonely and hostile place for transvestites and trans-sexuals. It
        is difficult for them to have meaningful relationships as very few
        straight men are willing to face the social stigma and emotional hassles
        that come with having a transvertite partner.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What causes a person to be
        gay? According to some researchers, sexual and emotional attraction for
        a partner of the same sex may be a genetic trait, although social
        factors and upbringing are also thought to play a role. Homosexuality is
        not a medical or psychiatric disorder, although regarded as abnormal by
        many. Homosexuality was removed from the list of mental disorders in the
        early 1970s when it was obvious that homosexuals are as psychologically
        welladjusted as heterosexuals are. They have the same capacity to
        function in society, to achieve goals, to have their needs met, and to
        develop a sense of identity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">However, transvestism is
        considered a mental disorder, as transvestites have the feeling of being
        trapped in a man's body, causing a lot of inner turmoil, whereas gay men
        are totally comfortable with their maleness.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Although homosexuals may
        have accepted their sexual orientation, society may not be ready to
        accept them. They may be prepared to share their thoughts and feelings
        with family members and close friends, but not so in public. A
        homosexual person may go through several stages before coming to terms
        with himself or herself. They probably can't do anything about their
        'condition', and we should not contribute to the prevailing social
        pressure that forces many of them to hide their true selves in the
        closet. From the Buddhist point of view this kind of sexual act can be
        regarded as sexual misconduct to those who try to renounce sensual
        pleasure in order to lead a holy life. For others this can be regarded
        as sex abuse.</font></p>
