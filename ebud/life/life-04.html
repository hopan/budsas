        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">MORAL DECAY</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Moral decay is already
        evident in our midst judging from the number of social problems, namely
        drug abuse, loitering, bohsia and lepak culture among youths, illicit
        sex etc. From a study conducted by the Youth and Sports Ministry on
        5,860 youths, 71% smoke, 40% watch pornographic videos, 28% gamble, 25%
        consume alcohol and 14% take drugs. Eleven juveniles from various
        detention centres throughout the country have been identified as
        carriers of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) which causes AIDS.
        Ten of them are in fact below 20 years of age.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The authorities are
        concerned about the juveniles being confirmed HIV carriers and are
        closely monitoring the situation. Initial checks showed some of the
        juveniles were not drug addicts but had been involved with them. The
        majority of the cases were discovered through counselling and voluntary
        medical tests.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This unhealthy trend can
        only be curbed with direct influence from parents. Parents should
        monitor the movements of their children to ensure that they are not
        involved in any immoral or illegal activities.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Without early monitoring
        and control, children can become easy prey to unhealthy influences. If
        this is allowed to continue, the teenagers will move on to more serious
        crimes. The emergence of various social problems must be addressed
        urgently. Hence parents must strengthen the family institution to
        withstand the demands of a changing society.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">PUNISHMENT</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In law, according to our
        Penal Code, 'Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under 10
        years of age. Further, nothing is an offence which is done by a child
        above 10 years of age and under 12, who had not attained sufficient
        maturity of understanding to judge the nature and consequences of his
        conduct on that occasion.'</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is a conclusive and
        absolute presumption in law that a child below 10 is incapable of
        knowing right from wrong although in truth, the child could have done
        the forbidden act with premeditated intention.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The second category of
        children, those between 10 and 12, are in a 'twilight zone' in which
        they are exempted from criminal responsibility unless it is proven by
        the prosecutor that the child was of normal mental capacity with a
        proven mischievous tendency.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Although a child under 10
        is free to do any crime and can escape punishment, he cannot totally
        escape all the consequences. Although there is no punishment as such his
        future behaviour may be restricted. The person who instigates a child to
        commit a crime will be charged as the principal offender, the child
        being treated only as an innocent agent.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Juvenile Court is the
        pivot around which revolves the machinery for the treatment of juvenile
        delinquents. The law relating to juveniles is embodied in the Juvenile
        Courts Act 1947 and Children and Young Persons Act 1947. A juvenile is
        defined as a person aged between 10 to below 18 years.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Juvenile Court is not
        open to the public. Although newspaper reporters may attend they cannot
        reveal particulars that may identify the offender. If found guilty, the
        court does not use terms such as 'convict' or 'sentence' in relation to
        the offender.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The court is presided over
        by a first class magistrate who decides on guilt. He sits with two
        assessors, one of whom should be a woman if possible, to assist him on
        deciding the 'sentence'. Before deciding how to deal with a juvenile,
        the court considers the offender's general conduct, home environment,
        school record and medical history.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The court may admonish and
        discharge, grant a discharge upon the offender entering a bond to be of
        good behaviour to comply with such orders as may be imposed, a committal
        to the care of a relative or other</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">fit person, and order his
        parents or guardian to execute a bond to exercise proper care and
        guardianship, a probation order, an order of committal to an approved
        school or Henry Gurney School, for 'corrective' education, an order to
        pay a fine, compensation or costs.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Imprisonment may only be
        ordered if the offender is aged between 14 and 18 years. It is the last
        resort provided the delinquent cannot be suitably dealt with in any
        other way possible.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A child between 10 and 14
        years cannot be ordered to be imprisoned for any offence. Neither can it
        be committed to prison in default of payment of a fine, damage or costs.
        Under Section 16 of the Juvenile Courts Act, a juvenile cannot be
        sentenced to death. However the restriction is not applicable where a
        juvenile is charged under Essential (Security Cases) Regulations 1975
        which expressly excludes the Juvenile Courts Act. The only situation
        where an ordinary court may try a juvenile is when he is jointly charged
        with another adult or the offence carries the death penalty. Possibly,
        in such cases, the juvenile may be pardoned and committed to the Henry
        Gurney School.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Where a child below 10
        years is intolerably mischievous or even otherwise needs care and
        protection being beyond the control of anyone, the Juvenile Court makes
        an order vesting the custody and protection of the child to an approved
        institution.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One of the most frequent
        measures of treatment applied by juvenile courts is probation. A
        juvenile delinquent is placed under the supervision of a probation
        offlcer whose duties are to befriend and assist him with a view to his
        rehabilitation. Probation is essentially social case work because it is
        the task of the probation officer to find regular employment for his
        charge and assist in his family problems whenever necessary.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The spirit behind the law
        relating to youngsters is that they should be treated differently from
        adults, that is, with compassion and understanding so that they are
        shown the correct path from which they strayed through no fault of their
        own.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The advice that could be
        given to families with young children is to spend quality time with
        them, to listen to what is going on, and what the child may be really
        trying to tell.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;BOSHIA&quot; AND
        &quot;LEPAK&quot; - CULTURE AMONG YOUTHS</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Bohsia&quot; and
        &quot;Lepak&quot; Culture among Youths With rapid industrialisation of
        the country many youths from the rural areas flock to larger cities in
        search of employment in factories. Girls from the rural areas in
        particular come in large numbers to be employed mostly in electronic
        factories. The lure of a care-free life in the city with their many
        shopping complexes, supermarkets and bright lights attract many rural
        youths who generally spend their leisure hours after work indulging in
        'window shopping' or merely loitering around in groups in such places.
        Money is uppermost in their minds - some extra cash with which they
        could enjoy a better quality of fashionable life in the city.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This kind of lifestyle
        among youths in the course of time gave rise to the popular use of the
        terms bohsia and lepak (Bahasa Malaysia). The word bohsia originates
        from Chinese Hokkien meaning 'voiceless'. How the term originated and
        came to be associated with loafing youths in large cities is however
        obscure. Its Bahasa Malaysia equivalent is lepak.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With a large proportion of
        these teenage youths being away from the social controls of normal rural
        family life, it was indeed not surprising to find some of them indulging
        in unwholesome activities in large cities and becoming involved in a way
        of life which would not normally be tolerated back in their own rural
        home towns. Inevitably a decline in ethics set in due to the absence of
        the sanctions of parents and society back in their own villages.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A stage was reached when
        female teenagers in small groups would place themselves as 'pick-ups' at
        strategic locations in shopping complexes, public buildings or street
        corners, only to be 'picked-up' by local youths. The girls are so naive
        they became easy prey to those roving romeos in super motorcycles.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One could in fact approach
        and strike up a casual acquaintance with any factory girl seen loitering
        in the vicinity of shopping complexes and the chances are that she would
        readily accept an invitation from such an acquaintance for a drink or
        snack at a restaurant and later adjourn for a walk or to a disco or any
        place mutually agreed upon.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Later on however, the
        female teenagers, having grown wiser to the scheme of things, elevate
        themselves to solicit acquaintance with affluent older men who would
        prowl around in expensive cars looking for tpick-ups' to keep them
        company. These men in high society would generally be lavish in
        entertaining the girls. The situation in the course of time however got
        out of hand when cases of khalwat (close proximity) were apprehended by
        the police, who also received complaints lodged by wives against their
        husbands involved in vice activities. With continued action and
        surveillance by the police, the bohsia and lepak problems, which at one
        time had occupied news headlines to a large extent, gradually faded
        away.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To fill the void that
        ensued, unscrupulous business operators took the opportunity of raking
        in money by opening up karaoke lounges and video arcades thereby
        providing ideal rendezvous facilities with subdued lighting and popular
        music for 'boy-meets-girl' situations. Despite government regulations,
        karaoke and video arcades still allow children under 18 years of age to
        patronise their premises and their operating hours extend up to 3.00 am
        or 4.00 am. Both sexes mingle freely in the dimly-lit premises and their
        behaviour leaves much to be desired.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Karaoke centres employ
        attractive young ladies as 'guest relation officers' as a front to
        seduce youths to indulge themselves in shows where they are encouraged
        to spend excessive amounts of money. In video-clip shows scantily
        dressed men and women move around lewdly to erotic music. One could
        imagine how much adverse influence it could have on a young mind.
        Teaching moral values in school alone will not create a healthy society.
        Parents too have to weed out negative elements, and the media needs also
        to play a positive role in this regard. Society has to nip the festering
        problem in the bud by disallowing the young mind to be poisoned by such
        lewd video shows.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is a move by the
        Government to clamp down on karaoke lounges and video arcade centres as
        this will help to curb social ills prevalent among youths. Many such
        centres operate under disguise as their main activities are gambling and
        drug peddling. Their activities are highly computerised and, using
        remote control, they can quickly re-set the games when raids are carried
        out on the premises. This has made it difficult for the police to take
        action against them unless they go undercover. The Police are aware of
        criminal activities taking place in video, amusement and karaoke
        outlets.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We want to strengthen
        family ties and promote healthy family values. We do not want our youths
        to spend their leisure time and money in karaoke and video outlets as
        this could lead them astray. By closing video and karaoke outlets youths
        would be less likely to waste their time and this would encourage them
        to engage in wholesome activities or stay at home with their families.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Sigalovada Sutta the
        Buddha has given advice to youths not to mingle during unusual times in
        the streets and certain places where people can influence young people
        into immoral practices.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">THE PROBLEM OF DRUG ABUSE.</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">During the early 1960s, the
        'hippie'subculture swept the West making a deep impact on human
        civilization. A typical 'hippie' was seen as a young unkempt person
        wearing gaudy coloured casual clothes and long hair, advocating freedom
        of thought and expression, and rejecting many of the conservative
        standards and values of society. Smoking cannabis (ganja) was their
        favourite form of drug abuse. Our local youths copied this lifestyle to
        a certain extent. Although with hindsight we can say that the hippie
        movement did have some positive effects, its permissiveness paved the
        way for the greatest scourge mankind has ever known: drug abuse.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When drugs are abused, the
        results can be devastating -- for the abuser, for those who care about
        him or her, and for society at large. Dependence on commonly abused
        drugs has become one of the leading public health problems. The
        escalating drug toll is quite unacceptable, in terms of wasted lives,
        destabilised families, and rising crime rates, quite apart from the high
        costs of funding research programmes, rehabilitation centres and
        specialised law-enforcement agencies. The severe harm addiction causes
        the human body and the difficulty of overcoming the problem are beyond
        doubt.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Repeated use of drugs can
        cause the user to become dependent on them. Physical dependence on a
        drug like heroin for example, is characterised by increasing tolerance
        to the drug - that is, the user has to take ever larger -doses in order
        to achieve the same degree of drug - induced euphoria, or 'high'. And
        this of course makes the withdrawal symptoms, (the often severe physical
        reactions the user may experience when denied the drug) much worse.
        Traditionally, drug addiction has been defined as physical dependence.
        Today the term drug addiction usually refers to a behavioural pattern
        marked by compulsive use of a drug and a preoccupation with getting it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Drug abuse has been rated
        as one of the world's greatest enemies. Society has ascribed the cause
        of this scourge to the moral degradation of our youths who have strayed
        from their normal family home environment to be enticed by influences
        outside the home. Many use drugs as a means to escape from unhappy home
        situations. Parents who are too busy to attend to the social and
        spiritual needs of their adolescent children often neglect them to the
        extent of driving them to seek solace in drug addiction. The lack of
        proper parental guidance and supervision and the low regard for values
        of life, such as morality and spirituality has to a large extent
        contributed to this negative state of affairs. Many addicts began with
        no intention whatsoever of becoming addicted but they were sadly
        mistaken when they became enslaved to the habit.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is significant to note
        that drug trafficking has even surpassed international oil trading as a
        money spinner and is second only to the arms trade. The lucrative trade
        in drugs has made its distribution widespread and caused serious
        socio-economic problems in both developed and developing nations. Drug
        traffickers are in fact known to be using complex corporate structures
        and dealing in intricate business transactions involving banks, trust
        companies, financial institutions and real estate firms.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Drug abusers invariably
        progress on to hard drugs and 'mainliners' live under the perpetual
        threat of an overdose. The common habit of sharing needles to 'fix' or
        inject drugs into one's body system by hard-core 'mainliners' is one of
        the principal causes of the spread of AIDS now threatening the country,
        which will be discussed in detail in the next section.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Government is currently
        spending millions of dollars on various drug rehabilitation programmes
        as the ever growing problem of drug abuse by our youths is increasing to
        alarming proportions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is significant to note
        that infants born to heroin-addicted mothers also become addicts.
        Because the mother's heroin intoxication can penetrate the placenta
        barrier (the buffer between her bloodstream and that of the foetus) and
        pass directly on to the unborn child, doctors try to find out beforehand
        if a mother is on heroin (many would not admit it) so that the child can
        be treated and handled as an addict from the moment it is born. If a
        doctor is unaware of the mother's addiction problem, the new born baby
        may go into an immediate and life-threatening withdrawal state. This can
        include breathing problems, convulsions and trembling.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to reports a vast
        majority (98.8 %) of addicts are men, with more than 80 % of them aged
        between 20 and 39 years. More than 41 % of addicts caught the habit
        because of peer pressure, 36.8 % were seeking pleasure on their own
        initiative while 15.6 % took drugs out of curiosity. Others became
        addicted to overcome mental stress (4.6 %), as a result of medical
        treatment (1%), by accident (0.4 %) and 0.1% as a sexual stimulant.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">How can parents tell if
        their children in the adolescent age group (12 to 21 years) are on
        drugs? Millions of parents are quite rightly concerned about this
        problem and worry about the appeal of drugs to youngsters. What they are
        obviously concerned about is illicit drug use. Your suspicions that one
        of your children is involved in drug-taking may be aroused by an
        unexpected change in his or her behaviour patterns. He or she may appear
        confused, have slurred speech, become aggressive, paranoid or depressed,
        suffer weight loss, display red eyes, drowsiness, reveal declining
        performance at school etc. If faced with irrefutable evidence, it is
        best not to over dramatise the situation but to get the help of trained
        counsellors who will best know how to handle the situation. The worst
        action would be to deny that the problem exists.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One of the best ways to
        help your child avoid drugs is to set a responsible pattern at home - do
        not abuse potentially addictive products, such as alcohol or tobacco,
        yourself. If you find that your child is involved, do not confront him
        while he is affected. Instead approach him later and try to discuss the
        problem and any underlying adolescent difficulties that may relate to
        it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are two major aims to
        bear in mind: to keep on good terms with the child, who will often be
        the only person able to tell you what is going on, and to establish some
        firm facts about the drug used - whether smoked, swallowed, injected or
        inhaled, also how long and how often it has been taken. You should then
        consult-your family doctor, who will advise you on the most sensible
        policy to adopt. If the situation is serious your doctor may refer you
        to a rehabilitation centre or to a hospital.</font></p>

        actual AIDS virus which kills him. The cause of death may be any of the
        wide variety of organisms that can enter the body and, finding little
        resistance, multiply wildly. The victim is thus subject to a variety of
        rare illnesses normally found only in a relatively mild form if they do
        occur, in people with a normal immune system.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">People who have AIDS die
        from a secondary disease. The two illnesses most commonly identified in
        AIDS patients are pneumonia and a rare form of skin cancer, as a result
        of the breakdown of the body's immune system.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Once the virus enters the
        body, it is targeted to attack the immune system of the human body. The
        AIDS virus is carried in the body fluids, particularly blood and semen,
        of people who suffer the disease. Persons so infected can transfer the
        virus to their sexual partners or spread it by contaminated blood during
        transfusions. An AIDS infected mother can transmit the deadly virus to
        her child, during or shortly after birth.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The AIDS virus also
        circulates in the blood of its victims. This is almost certainly why
        intravenous drug users and haemophiliacs are in the higher-risk group.
        Intravenous drug users often share needles, and a needle used by an AIDS
        carrier can transmit the needle used to anyone who uses the same needle.
        Since many people donate blood to blood banks, it is possible that AIDS
        contaminated blood might be given to a haemophiliac, and indeed some
        people have been infected by this way. It is almost impossible, of
        course, to get AIDS by donating blood, since the needles used for the
        procedure are sterile and are discarded after each use.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The inherent danger of the
        deadly disease is that AIDS antibodies, which indicate infection, only
        appear in the blood a few weeks, and sometimes a few months after the
        person has been infected. The incubation period however, varies greatly
        and can be quite long, perhaps as long as five years. Hence it is not
        possible to detect infection immediately after exposure. With no known
        cure or vaccine so far, AIDS prevention is indeed most vital.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The following symptoms
        occur in AIDS: swollen lymph nodes, recurring fevers, night sweats,
        sudden unexplainable weight loss, fatigue, diarrhoea, purplish skin
        lesions and unusual infections.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The results of several
        investigations into the spread of AIDS indicate that people living in
        the same house, sharing eating utensils, or being exposed to sneezes
        from an infected person do not become infected with AIDS virus. Nor is
        it possible to be infected from swimming pools, handshaking or sharing
        toilet seats. The only known routes of infection are sexual contact and
        exposure to contaminated needles or blood.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Nearly half a million
        people around the world are officially reported to have AIDS. This is
        just a third of the estimated total of eleven million people carrying
        the potentially lethal virus HIV.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The global total of
        carriers is estimated to be 446,681 spread over 163 countries. In our
        country alone, the known number of HIV carriers has reached more than
        2,500 and 31 of the 37 AIDS victims have died. By the year 2000, it is
        estimated that more than 60,000 infants will have AIDS, and 120,000
        children will become orphans!</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There has been a 440%
        increase in HIV /AIDS cases over the last five years. Data compiled by
        UNAIDS prove the gravity of our situation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The country's AIDS strategy
        is a plan on AIDS prevention that is based on proper morals. The plan
        will 'go back to the basics', that is, religion, cultural and
        traditional values, as today's teens are indulging in activities their
        forefathers would never have dreamt of doing in their day. The danger of
        sexual misconduct is explained in the teaching of the Buddha.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">ADDICTION TO TOBACCO
        SMOKING</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Tobacco smoking covers a
        wide range of nicotine - laden products and includes cigarettes, cigars
        and pipe smoking. Of the above mentioned categories, cigarette smoking
        is the most prevalent. It has been established statistically that
        nicotine addiction usually starts among the young, and smokers are
        usually hooked to the habit by the time they become adults. 'Catch 'em
        young, and you have 'em for life' seems to be the corporate strategy of
        the tobacco industry.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Right now, Malaysia seems
        to be in a tobacco 'cloud-nine' oblivion. Our sports events, youth rock
        concerts, film shows and trendy holiday programmes are sponsored by
        tobacco companies. They advertise themselves on TV, radio and in the
        print media in a very subtle way by promoting products and services
        totally unrelated to their trade. Although their esteemed end product --
        the all-important cigarette, appears nowhere in sight, the message and
        logo they want to put across to the public nevertheless ring loud and
        clear. Despite public criticism, our authorities continue to allow such
        brand names and logo promotions as well as free distribution of
        cigarette samplesat rock concerts.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Whatever has happened to
        our laws on anti-smoking, and who are enforcing them? Are they to be
        observed only within the vicinity of hospitals, the courts, gas stations
        and certain public buildings? Even the Congress passed Bills recently
        defining nicotine as an addictive substance. Now that the vast US market
        is rapidly being closed to tobacco companies, we can expect a more
        aggressive and well-planned campaign upon the youth in Third World
        countries. Malaysia, an economic success story, is certain to be a
        'prime target'. Are we ready for this onslaught upon our youngsters in
        this country? This pandering to cigarette traders must come to an end.
        Or else, are we admitting that U.S President Clinton cares more for his
        American youngsters than we care for ours.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Malaysia as a responsible
        nation should unite to protect the health of our next generation.
        Government agencies, the corporate sector and local Non-Government
        Organisations (NGO's) should work together on a single policy to thwart
        the insidious strategy of the international cigarette companies. The
        authorities should lay down singleminded policies and detailed plans to
        curb smoking among youths. Cigarette companies are required by law to
        print a warning notice on all cigarette cartons about the dangers
        relating to smoking but, as could be expected, this usually appears in
        almost microscopic print, merely to conform with official policy.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Cigarette smoking is one of
        the contributory causes of heart disease which is already a major killer
        in this country and its medical and social costs are growing each year.
        We cannot afford to allow the tobacco habit to destroy the health of our
        younger generation; hence we must act now, and as one society.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is no such thing as a
        'safe' cigarette. Low-tar, low nicotine cigarettes, according to
        manufacturers' tests, provide some risk reduction as far as contracting
        lung cancer and heart disease is concerned. These tests, however, are
        performed on smoking machines and not on human beings. In addition,
        switching to a low nicotine brand is not a reliable alternative to
        quitting, especially for those who increase the number of cigarettes
        they smoke to maintain former nicotine levels.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even though you do not
        inhale when smoking, you are still holding the smoke in your mouth and
        thus increase the risks of developing oral cancer. In addition, you may
        be inhaling some smoke without being aware of it, and you are breathing
        in glycoprotein ( a tobacco ingredient that may cause some damage to the
        blood vessels) both during the time you are actually smoking each
        cigarette and for a while afterwards.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If you can stop smoking
        instantly, and find that you don't experience an intense craving for
        tobacco or such signs of withdrawal as nervousness and headaches, then
        you would not be classified as addicted. But the chances are that you
        probably would not be able to give up without feeling some symptoms, in
        which case you would be described, and accurately so, as addicted.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is never too late to
        stop smoking, even after 25 years. Quitting offers both short and
        long-term benefits. You will soon notice some changes once you have
        given up smoking. You will be able to taste food better and breathe more
        efficiently and your 'smoker's cough' will clear up. Although your lungs
        will never return to the state they were in before you took up smoking,
        some of the damage may clear up. The good news, of course, is that if
        you quit smoking your lungs will cease deteriorating further.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Before heart surgery
        doctors may ask whether the patient used to smoke or not. If the answer
        is 'yes', they will delay the operation to clean the lungs of 'tar'
        accumulated in the lungs of the smoker.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Many smokers do gain weight
        when they quit. But the good news is that these people gain an average
        of only two to three kilograms. Should you want to avoid weight gain,
        make quitting smoking your first priority. Remember the enormous health
        benefits of quitting smoking, and do not allow your worries about
        gaining weight to get in the way. You can work on reducing weight after
        quitting smoking, as a second priority.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The question often asked
        is: 'Can the smoke from other people's cigarettes harm me?' Yes, it can.
        The scientific evidence concerning the dangerous effects of passive
        smoking (inhaling the smoke of others) on people who live with or work
        near smokers is growing rapidly. Scientists have found a significantly
        higher incidence of respiratory diseases among children whose parents
        smoke. Other studies have shown passive smoking can cause decreased
        airway function in otherwise healthy adults and children. It has been
        reported that the harmful constituents of inhaling cigarette smoke are
        found in passive smoke, sometimes even to a greater extent than in
        inhaled smoke, and that non-smokers do indeed draw these dangerous
        elements into their lungs when they breathe in the smoke of others.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">ALCOHOLISM</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Alcoholism is a chronic
        illness which manifests itself as a disorder of behaviour. It is
        characterised by the repeated drinking of alcoholic beverages, to an
        extent that exceeds customary social customs.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The term 'alcoholic' is
        hard to define exactly since people have different reactions to alcohol
        and the way they use it. It usually takes 10 to 15 years of drinking
        five or more drinks a day (less for women) for a person to develop what
        might be called the full alcohol syndrome -- that is, a state of
        physical dependence with serious damage to health and social
        relationships. In essence, alcoholism is not measured by the amount of
        alcohol consumed but rather by the way a person uses alcohol to deal
        with life's problems, and its effects on one's physical well-being.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Chronic alcohol abuse can
        damage all vital organs in the body. To begin with, it can damage the
        muscle cells of the heart and lead to heart failure and death. As
        alcohol is broken down in the liver, whose chief function is to
        neutralise and remove certain toxic compounds, this organ is the most
        vulnerable to alcohol's harmful affects.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Alcoholism can cause the
        liver to enlarge, become inflamed, and eventually develop the often
        fatal scarring called cirrhosis. One of alcohol's most damaging effects
        is on the brain. Abuse may lead to brain damage and mental disorders.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Alcohol taken in the early
        months of pregnancy can damage the heart of an unborn baby. Pregnant
        women who drink run the risk of causing a variety of abnormalities to
        develop in their unborn children (foetal alcohol syndrome).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Tolerance to alcohol means
        that the body chemistry has gradually adjusted to the presence of the
        beverage. As a result, it takes more of the substance to achieve the
        same response. This is why a person who drinks only rarely may become
        drunk just on a glass of wine. Tolerance, in fact, is one of the two key
        signs of dependence on alcohol. The other is the development of
        withdrawal symptoms when the user stops taking alcoholic drinks. The
        ability to drink a lot depends on several factors, such as the drinker's
        weight and chemistry, his physical and mental state, the length of time
        he has been drinking and the amount of food he has in his stomach while
        drinking.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Certain organisations, as
        part of their social gatherings, encourage their youths to participate
        in beer-drinking contests with offers of attractive prizes to the
        winners. Such organisations in doing so are unwittingly initiating
        innocent youths, many of whom have never taken any form of alcoholic
        drink, into the growing ranks of alcoholics, which eventually will lead
        to all sorts of social and domestic problems to their families and the
        community in general.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Could a person die from
        drinking too much at one time? Although rare, such deaths do occur,
        usually as the result of drinking contests. This is because during such
        events as much as a large tumbler or more of alcoholic beverage may be
        consumed at one go. Such a massive quantity of alcohol can depress the
        respiratory system and, in combination with vomiting, lead to death by
        suffocation. In addition, it can reduce the body's production of glucose
        and cause a coma. Alcohol also can reduce the pain threshold and weaken
        the blood's clotting capacities.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The last of the Five
        Precepts in Buddhism advocates total abstinence from the consumption of
        intoxicants. The strict observance by Buddhists of this precept is
        extremely important for the well-being of one's mental and physical
        health, as disregard for the precept itself undermines the value of all
        the other precepts.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In winding up cocktail
        parties and drink sessions, the common habit among guests and patrons of
        having the extra 'one for the road' should be discouraged at all costs.
        Government's current 'don't drink and drive' policy is indeed
        commendable and should be strictly adhered to for the safety of all road
        users.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Pubs have mushroomed all
        over towns and are luring our youths to indulge in the drinking habit.
        Certain undesirable shows are known to take place in pubs and discos

        violence at home. Many from the low income group also indulge in
        drinking samsu distilled from rice. But what worries the authorities is
        the consumption of cheap illicit samsu (distilled under most unhygienic
        conditions) by unwary drinkers, leading to many cases of deaths that had
        occurred arising from drinking such toxic brews.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">THE GENERATION GAP</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The word 'generation' is
        popularly used as a measure of time, and usually represents about a span
        of 30 years, the period which man requires to attain maturity, and the
        age at which, as a general rule, the first child is born. The
        intervening wide gap between one or more generations is often generally
        referred to as the generation gap.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As could be expected,
        persons from different generations differ considerably in their ways of
        thinking, attitudes, life styles and values and hence do not see eye to
        eye with each other on most matters. Due to the disparity in the ages,
        the elderly group tend to hold set views which run contrary to the way
        of thinking of the younger generation. Differences of opinion will arise
        and this will lead to misunderstanding within the family.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Age old traditions,
        outmoded customs and sectarian attitudes of the elders often come in
        conflict with the aspirations of the youths. The younger generation of
        youths are made to stand critically at cross-roads at such a great
        moment in their inexperienced young lives. They are quite naturally
        averse to interference from elders and unyielding to patronising moods.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some elderly people cannot
        tolerate the modern ideas and ways of living of the younger generation.
        They expect their children to follow the same age-old customs and
        traditions of their forefathers. Instead of adopting such an attitude,
        they should allow the children to move with the times if such activities
        are harmless and beneficial to progress. Elders should call to mind how
        their own parents had objected to certain popular modes of behaviour
        prevalent at the time when they were young. For example, in the '60s it
        was considered shocking for young people to imitate the Beatles and the
        hippies. Those young people have grown up and are in turn shocked by
        their own children's imitation of 'punk' and 'grunge'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These differences in
        perception between the conservative parents and the younger generation
        is a common source of conflict within families of today. This does not
        mean that parents should hesitate to counsel and guide their children if
        they have gone astray due to some erroneous values.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But when correcting them,
        they should observe the principle that prevention is better than
        punishment. Parents should also explain to their children why they
        disapprove or approve of certain values. We know that what we call
        'Asian Values' are good, but only if they are relevant to modern needs
        and can be adapted to suit the present situation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A lack of proper
        understanding between parents and their children is actually causing
        them to distance themselves from each other. There should be more room
        provided for the children to grow and to engage themselves in better
        communication with their parents.</font></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">'I have been with my
          parents for nearly 20 years now. I love them, but I do have problems
          with them. There are misunderstandings between the three of us, and
          the problems seem to be increasing.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These problems stem from
          my actions which my parents do not understand. They do not seem to
          understand the reasons behind what I say and do. I have tried to
          correct and smoothen out the ruffles between us, but to no avail.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">My parents were always
          there for me when I was young, or whenever I needed a shoulder to cry
          on. So I did not mind them telling me what to do and I thought they
          were the greatest people on earth.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">My view of things
          eventually began to differ from theirs, but I kept quiet since I
          feared retribution from them. The problems began when I was old enough
          to voice my opinions.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now, I talk back to my
          parents, not because I want to rebel against them but because I can
          think for myself. I don't claim to know everything my parents know,
          but I can look out for myself. I will ask for help when I need it, but
          whether I want to heed their advice is a different matter.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">My parents still see me
          as a child, one who needs constant supervision. I appreciate that my
          parents look after me, but they should give me some room and not
          smother me. They never hear what I say and then they tell me that I do
          not understand them.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">They also encroach on my
          personal freedom as they do not understand me. Since they always watch
          me, I do not get any freedom to see my friends or do the things I want
          to do.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The appearance of a
        generation in the 1950s which had become incomprehensible to its elders
        now looks far less mysterious than it did at that time of great changes
        in world civilization. Then, the talk was all of 'generation gap', a new
        phenomenon. Young people did not pass directly from school into lifelong
        work, and often manual labour, but had leisure, money and time to spend
        on themselves. A whole culture grew around them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The inability of the old to
        understand the young, the belief by the young that youth will last for
        ever, their resistance to accept mortality -- these things exist in all
        human societies at all times.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The generation gap, with
        its dramas, its heroes and its stubbornnes has become far more complex
        and complicated. It is now accepted as normal in the West that most
        people have little social contact with anyone but their own age groups.
        The initially benign, or at least apparently harmless, element in the
        fostering of differences between the generations now threatens to turn
        into something far darker and more menacing. The 'gap', as it is, is
        widening to a point of becoming a 'chasm'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A major problem confronting
        many rich Western societies - Germany; the United Kingdom, Japan, Italy,
        Spain, among them is that their populations have failed to replenish
        themselves, so that the numbers of old people are fast becoming a burden
        today.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Part of the promotion of a
        detached, self-conscious younger generation in the 1950s and 1960s
        represented a contempt for the old, at the very least, a discarding of
        wisdom, a rejection of experience, a degradation of traditional
        relationships between young and old.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These fostered
        misunderstandings, barriers between young and old, will eventually
        create deeper conflicts in the future. Indeed outrages by children
        against the old are already a serious issue in many parts of the world.
        Such incidents, will certainly increase with time, because of the aged,
        kept alive by technological miracles, by super drugs, by all the
        apparatus which permit life expectancy to increase. Quality of life
        however does not improve with the increase of population, and that's
        where the problem lies.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is not difficult to
        anticipate just what forms of vengeful retaliation will occur when the
        young realise that they are expected to look after the 'surplus'
        population of those they regard as useless, the discarded, the
        illadapted, unproductive and the infirm. These are burdens society is
        increasingly reluctant to shoulder. One can imagine, therefore the
        arguments in favour of euthanasia gaining ground and the practice being
        increasingly accepted.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The problem of demography
        which once focused upon too many babies in the Third World, is likely to
        shift to those who refuse to die particularly in the developed world.
        Already the old say they have lived too long. They may have to be helped
        to remove themselves to make way for the next generation.May the Old and
        Young bridge the gap in the cause of Love and Understanding.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is not necessary to have
        personal experience in certain things to understand whether they are
        good or bad. Here is a an analogy for you to understand this situation.
        A shoal of fishes come across an obstruction in the water with an
        unusually small opening. It is actually a trap laid by a fisherman to
        catch the fish.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some fish want to go inside
        the fence and see what it is, but the more experienced fish advise them
        not to do so because it must be a dangerous trap. The young fish asks,
        'How do we know whether it is dangerous or not? We must go in and see,
        only then can we understand what it is.' So some of them go in and get
        caught in the trap.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We must be prepared to
        accept the advice given by wise men like the Buddha who is enlightened.
        Of course the Buddha himself has said that we must not accept his
        teachings blindly. At the same time we can listen to some wise ones or
        other religious teachers. This is simply because their experience is
        more advanced than our limited knowledge regarding our worldly lives.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parents usually advise
        their children to do certain things and not others. By neglecting the
        advice given by the elders, young people do many things according to
        their own way of thinking. Eventually when they get into trouble, they
        remember the elders and religious teachers and seek their help and
        sometimes even ask the religious teachers to pray for them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Only then do they remember
        religion and seek some blessing and guidance. But they do not think the
        main purpose of a religion is to help us to follow certain noble
        principles to avoid many of our problems before they confront us. Early
        religious education trains the mind to cultivate the universal
        principles which support our way of life to live peacefully.</font></p>

        would be one of youthful vigour with lofty ideals and aspirations. As he

        outlook, he soon realises that his utopian ideals held by him during his
        youth would have to be cast aside, and that he would have to perceive
        life afresh in its true perspective. With advancing age, and with
        mellowed outlook in life, he finds he has to change and adjust his
        lifestyle accordingly. Even his lofty ambitions in life held eminently
        by him in his younger days, will eventually have to come to terms with
        the realities of change. Such is the inevitable life cycle affecting Man

        knowledge that people gain without personal experience, some young
        people think they can solve all their problems. Science can provide the
        material things to solve our problems, but it cannot help us to solve
        many of our life's problems. There is no substitute for wise people who
        have experienced the world. Think about this saying, ' When I was 18, I
        thought what a fool my father was. Now that I am 28, I am surprised how

        out-of-date being based on truth and will remain fresh forever. It is
        impossible to overcome our human problems by ignoring the ancient

        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As parents age, it is
        inevitable that their bodies will gradually weaken and deteriorate in a
        variety of ways, making them increasingly susceptible to physical
        illnesses that can affect every organ in their system. As the
        realisation grows that there is no escape, the aging individual must try
        to find some way to come to terms with the disturbing new reality.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Filial piety is an
        important factor in caring for the aged in our traditional Asian
        society. As Asians it has long been the norm for us to accommodate and
        nurse the aged parents in our own homes as far as possible.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Do children owe any legal
        liability to care for old and disabled parents? Unfortunately the answer
        is 'No'. Parents simply have to depend on the goodwill of their
        children. Although we are proud about our values, and cultural heritage,
        unfortunately the number of elderly citizens with no savings and
        abandoned by their families is growing in Asia. The problem for us to
        consider is whether our values, including filial devotion and reciprocal
        love for children are being eroded because of a breakdown in traditional
        family relations and a changed economic and demographic profile.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Cramped flats and squatter
        houses are not places which are conducive to the accommodation of aged
        parents. There have been numerous cases in which old people have been
        neglected by their children or their relatives. This is a sad situation
        where good values and traditions are no longer practiced.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Welfare homes and their
        environment for the most part are also not places which are conducive to
        the accommodation of aged parents. Of all living alternatives, placement
        in an Old Folks Home is without doubt the most sensitive issue often
        provoking guilt through self accusations of ingratitude, lack of
        devotion or filial piety and abandonment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A nursing home, although
        somewhat expensive, offers the most satisfactory alternative. Each
        person must decide for himself and understand that there are no perfect
        choices. While long term institutionalization is a painful issue, it is
        essential to provide appropriate care for a debilitated parent.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Placement in a nursing
        facility does not mean 'putting your aged parent away', or at least it
        shouldn't. Family involvement remains essential for proper care, from
        the first step of choosing the facility, to maintaining an ongoing
        relationship with the staff, to regularly visiting the parent and
        involving him or her in family matters. They need cheering up and to
        know that there are people who really care for them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Certain irresponsible
        persons with ill or aged parents get them admitted into third class
        wards of hospitals, leaving false addresses and just disappear from the
        scene. This indeed is a most cruel way of disposing of one's own aged
        parents.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A caring attitude as well
        as concern for the aged parents must prevail if the older generation is
        not to be adversely affected by the rapid socio-economic changes of
        urbanisation and industrialisation. It has to be realised that the aged
        are more affected by these changes and the degradation of moral values
        in society. It should also encompass the responsible manner in which the
        elderly are treated, cared for, respected and honoured.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This aspect of caring for
        the aged parents requires collective responsibility. It will also instil
        respect for the elderly as there is no better institution to care for
        the aged parents other than the family itself.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In many discourses the
        Buddha has advised children to pay special attention to father and
        mother. There is an old adage which says: 'Take good care of your
        parents for you will never know how much you miss them when they are
        gone.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">GAMBLING</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Gambling is the wagering of
        money or other-valuables on the outcome of a game, race, contest or
        other event. Although few societies in general have ever wholly approved
        of gambling, none has been able to eradicate it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The hope of making quick
        money easily is what gives gambling its appeal. If the appeal of
        gambling is winning money, the thrill of it is in the risk that the
        wager may be lost. For many people gambling become an addiction.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The games most closely
        associated with gambling involve a heavy element of chance. Whereas
        poker, for instance, requires skill to play well, the outcome of the
        game is determined primarily by the distribution of the cards. Many
        casino games, such as roulette are dictated solely by chance. Betting on
        the outcome of sporting events, especially on horse racing, or on a
        lottery is perhaps the most widespread legal form of gambling, and in
        many countries, governments have created systems to funnel through legal
        channels the vast amounts wagered, retaining a certain proportion for
        their own use. Football pools are popular particularly in the West.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Gambling is not confined to
        any economic or social stratum. Many housewives are known to be
        compulsive gamblers who often neglect their family obligations and their
        children when they become so engrossed in the vicious gambling habit.
        They even gamble away their market provision money and become easy prey
        to loan sharks who are ever ready to come to the 'rescue' of such
        unfortunate women. Compulsive women gamblers are prepared even to go the
        extent of compromising their modesty to these human vultures in order to
        redeem their losses. Compulsive gambling is recognised as a sickness,
        and such organisations as Gamblers Anonymous exist for the purpose of
        helping individuals suffering from the problem.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Illegal gambling
        constitutes one of the largest 'businesses' in existence, and its
        'gross' has been estimated to exceed that of its legal counterpart.
        Gambling can become the cause of the downfall of a person if he or she
        is addicted to it says the Buddha.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Many who become addicted to
        gambling and liquor also become indebted in order to sustain their
        gambling and drinking habits and in so doing easily fall into the
        clutches of unscrupulous money lenders and loan sharks.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Money lenders often charge
        a high rate of interest on loans borrowed by debtors. Although the
        amount of loan advanced is low, their modus operandi is to make the
        borrower sign for a larger amount, as a form of security, In case of
        default by the borrower, the money lender will invariably sue the
        borrower through court proceedings, tendering the borrower's signed
        document for the larger amount as the basis of their claim.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Licensed money lenders and
        loan sharks are the bane of helpless alcoholics and gamblers as they
        often exploit the inherent human weakness of their victims. 'A
        drunkard's mouth dries up his pocket' - so the adage goes.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even people in an affluent
        society resort to money lenders as a means of alleviating themselves
        from tight financial situations. Valuable properties and lands are
        sometimes mortgaged to these money lenders as a form of collateral in
        order to secure a loan for a business venture. Should the borrowers
        default, these unscrupulous money lenders will have no qualms whatsoever
        in resorting to court action to foreclose their claims. The law provides
        for the seizure of the debtor's property to pay the sum owed, plus the
        legal costs incurred. One who is not indebted to anybody experiences
        happiness in this life time says the Buddha.</font></p>

        complicated and entangled in various ways. From our birth up to our last
        breath, numerous problems confront us. It is impossible for any human
        being to exist without facing some sort of problems. The Buddha has
        advised us to understand the nature of our problems if we want to live
        peacefully. He has also advised us to ponder on the purpose of our
        existence and try to find out why we are not satisfied with our lives
        and the world. If we can understand this situation, there will be no
        reason for us to suffer from undue fear, disappointments and
        frustrations.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's approach to
        the problems of human suffering is essentially empirical and
        experimental and not speculative and metaphysical.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is no short cut for
        us to get rid of our problems. We must cultivate our way of life to
        discover the cause of the problems that we are facing. We must
        understand that there is no existence without any friction. If we want
        to be really free, we must examine our problems by reducing our egoism
        through understanding why these problems make life miserable.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We all like to lead very
        happy, contented and peaceful lives but how many of us can really
        experience such happiness? We are willing to do anything in everyway
        possible to gain satisfaction but it is very difficult to experience
        true satisfaction.</font></p>
