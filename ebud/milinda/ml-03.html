      <P>1. The five knowledges are produced by various actions:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 60b, 10-11) = (P: 65, 1-10)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with the following differences: C: <I>Five knowledges</I>: 
      = P: <I>Panca àyatanàni</I> (K. E. not available).</P>
      <B>
      <P>2. Different kinds of actions lead to different types of people:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 60b, 11-18) = (P: 65, 11-29)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with the following differences:</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>Men in the world are complete with head, beard, hairs, skin, 
      face, eyes, ears, mouth, body, the four limbs, but among them, some are of 
      long life, others of short life, some with many diseases, others with few 
      diseases, some are poor, others are rich; some are noble, others are mean; 
      some are of great family, others of small family, some are handsome, 
      others ugly; some are enjoying confidence of others, others are suspected; 
      some are intelligent, others stupid. Why are they not the same</I>?&quot; (K. 
      E. omits: some are of great family, others of small family)</P>
      <P>= P: &quot;<I>By what reason are men not the same? some of short life, 
      others of long life; some with many diseases, others with few diseases; 
      some are ugly, others are handsome; some are of few influence</I>, <I>
      others</I> <I>of great influence; some are of few wealth, others of great 
      wealth; some of low family, others of high family; some are stupid, others 
      are intelligent.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>Just like fruits of tree, some are acid, not sweet, some are 
      bitter, some are pungent, some are sweet, some are really sour&quot;</I> (K.E. 
      omits the last one).</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>All the trees are not the same, some are sour, some are salty, 
      some are bitter, some are pungent, some are astringent, some are sweet</I>.&quot;</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>That is why the Buddha said that in accordance with one&#39;s own 
      bad or good actions, one would reap results&quot;</I> (K.E. <I>richness, 
      poverty, handsomeness, ugliness are due to bad and good actions performed 
      in previous lives. One obtains in accordance with one&#39;s own actions</I>):</P>
      <P>P: &quot;<I>Kammassakà mànava sattà, kammadàyàdà, kammayoni kammabandhù, 
      kammapatisaranà, kam-ma satte vibhajati, yad idam hìnappanìtatàyàti</I>.&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>3. Good deeds shoud be done in the past:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 60b, 18-20; 61a, 1-5): (P: 65, 30-31;66;67,1-3)</P>
      <P>Almost the same in both versions, with the following differences: </P>
      <P>While the C starts with the king&#39;s question whether people wanting to 
      perform good deeds should have done so in the past or at a later time and 
      Na-hsien replied that he should have performed good actions in the past, 
      as good actions performed later were not useful, the P begins with the 
      king asking if the purpose of adopting a religious life was to eradicate 
      that suffering and to prevent other suffering from arising. And when 
      Nàgasena confirmed that, the king asked again if effort should be 
      displayed in the past or now, and Nàgasena replied that effort at the 
      present moment was <I>akiccakaro</I>, but that in the past was <I>
      kiccakaro</I>. </P>
      <P>The three similes are almost the same, with the following slight 
      differences: </P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>To dig a well</I>&quot; </P>
      <P>= P: &quot;<I>To dig a well and a pond</I>&quot;. </P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>AsKing people to plough the field, to manure it and to sow crops</I>:&quot; 
      (K. E. to plough, to sow).</P>
      <P>=P: <I>Asking people to plough the field, to sow seeds, to harvest 
      crops</I>.&quot;</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>Ordering people to train horses, elephants, men in the warfare</I>&quot; 
      (K. E.: to take out war materials)</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>To dig a moat, to build ramparts, watch-towers, strongholds, to 
      store crops, to train yourself in the warfare about elephants, horses, 
      chariots, bows, sword&quot;.</P>
      </I>
      <P>The concluding passage is not the same.</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>Thus the Buddha said: &quot;One should strive to perform bodily good 
      actions in the past, as good actions performed at a later stage are not 
      useful</I>.&quot; Na-hsien advised the king (K. E. omits to mention Na-hsien) 
      not to give up the right path and adopt the wrong path, not to follow the 
      ignorant who discarded good and performed evil and had to lament and wail, 
      without any use; people who discarded righteousness and adopted 
      crookedness had to repent at their death-bed:</P>
      <P>=P: The P has some similar passages but all was considered as spoken by 
      the Buddha, unlike the C, which attributes the last portion to Na-hsien 
      advising the king. The P gàtha is as follows:</P>
      <P>&quot;<I>Doing before what he knows to be his own welfare, the wise man 
      should exert himself, not to have the thinKing of the carter</I>.&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;<I>As a carter, having left the smooth highway and engaged in the 
      uneven path, has to lament over the broken axle</I>&quot;.</P>
      <P>&quot;<I>So the ignorant, who has left the right dhamma and followed the 
      wrong dhamma at his death-bed has to mourn over the broken axle</I>.&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>4. Fire in the hell is far hotter than ordinary fire.</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 61a, 5-17) = (P: 67, 4-30; 68, 1-23)</P>
      <P>The passage in which King Milinda showed his disbelief in two 
      statements of the Elder is almost the same in both versions with some 
      slight differences: </P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>You monks said</I>&quot; = P: &quot;<I>You said</I>&quot;. </P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>A small stone put into ordinary fire, up to evening, does not 
      melt away</I>&quot; </P>
      <P>= P: &quot;<I>A small stone thrown into ordinary smouldering fire the whole 
      day is not dissolved</I>. </P>
      <P>C: <I>A big stone </P>
      </I>
      <P>= P: <I>A big stone as big as an upper chamber</I>. </P>
      <P>To prove that statement, the C quotes four similes. While the P 
      mentions only three. C I = P I; C 2 = P 2; C 3 = P no; C 4 = P 3. </P>
      <P>C I = P I. </P>
      <P>C: &quot; <I>Female sea-serpents, female dragons, female tortoises, female 
      crabs which are pregnant</I>&quot; (K. E. omits <I>female crabs</I>).</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>Makariniyo</I> ( a kind of fish), <I>sumsumàriniyo</I> (female 
      crocodiles), <I>kacchapiniyo</I> (female tortoises), <I>moriniyo</I> 
      (pea-hens), <I>kapotiniyo</I> (female pigeons)&quot;.</P>
      <P>C: <I>Sand and stones</I> = P: <I>Hard stones and gravels.</P>
      </I>
      <P>C: &quot;Due to a natural, special favour and characteristic they did not 
      dissolve&quot; (the translation is rather forced as the passage is not clear).</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>Due to the power of kamma, they did not dissolve.</I>&quot; The P 
      quotes the Buddha as saying: &quot;<I>He will not die as long as his bad kammas 
      are not exhausted</I>&quot;, the C refers also to the same passage, but omits 
      to mention that it was the Buddha&#39;s words.</P>
      <P>C 2 = P 2: </P>
      <P>C: <I>Lionesses, tigresses, female dogs, female cats who are pregnant</I> 
      (K. E.: <I>lionesses, tigresses, female wolves).</P>
      </I>
      <P>= P: <I>Lionesses, tigresses, leopardesses, female dogs. </P>
      </I>
      <P>C 3=P no </P>
      <P>C: <I>cows mares, she-donkeys, tailed deer, female stags, which are 
      pregnant who are eating grass, hay</I>. (K. E. omits <I>she-donkeys</I>).</P>
      <P>C 4=P 3: C: <I>women, ladies of rich family who are eating delicious 
      food</I> (K. E.: only <I>women</I>)</P>
      <P>=P: <I>Delicately nurtured ladies of the Yonakas, of noble caste, of 
      bràhmana caste, of householders who are eating hard food and meat.</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>5. Wind element supports water element:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 61a, 17-18) = (P: 68, 24-30)</P>
      <P>Almost the same. Here the king said that he did not believe in what the 
      monks had said that the great earth rested on the water, the water on the 
      air, the air on the space. To prove that the water rested on the air, 
      Nàgasena took a <I>dhammakaraka</I> ( a water-pot with filter) and showed 
      it to the king. </P>
      <P>The C uses the expression <I>shu-shui-shih</I>; book-water-fitting) 
      which baffles any translation (K. E.: <I>wang-shu-shui</I>: 
      king-book-water.?)</P>
      <B>
      <P>6. A definition of Nibbàna:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 61a, 18-26; 61b. I) = (P: 68, 31-32; 69, 1-15)</P>
      <P>The purport is the same, but the exposition rather differs with many 
      expressions uncommon in both versions.</P>
      <P>C: <I>Nieh-pan path </I>(means that) <I>having gone past, there would 
      be no more becoming.</P>
      <P>=P: Nibbànam nirodho.</P>
      <P>C: &quot;The ignorant people came yearning for, craving for the inner and 
      outer bodies, sitting upon them (rather clinging) so that they could not 
      escape from old age, sickness and death&quot;.</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;All foolish worldling enjoy the internal and the external sense 
      spheres, take pleasure in them and cling to them; so they are carried away 
      by that stream, and are not free from birth, old age and death, from 
      grief, lamentation, suffering, sorrow, despair; I say that they are not 
      free from suffering.&quot;</P>
      <P>C: &quot;The wise men, those who had learned the dharma, did not cling to 
      the internal and external bodies, had no craving. Having no craving they 
      had no sense-desires. Having no sense-desires, they had no pregnancy in 
      womb. Having no pregnancy in the womb, there were no birth, no old age. 
      Having no birth, no old age, they had no sickness, no death; having no 
      sickness (no death), they had no grief, no lamentation; having no grief, 
      no lamentation, they had no inner pain, they obtained Nirvàna.&quot;</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;The learned ariyan disciple does not enjoy internal and external 
      sense-spheres, does not take pleasure in them, does not cling to them. 
      Having no enjoyment, no taking pleasure, no clinging, craving ceases; 
      craving having ceased, grasping ceases; grasping having ceased, becoming 
      ceases; becoming having ceased, birth ceases; birth having ceased, old age 
      and death cease; grief lamentation suffering, sorrow, despair cease. Thus 
      is the cessation of the whole aggregate of suffering,&quot;</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>7. Do all learners of the Dharma obtain Nirvàna?</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 61b, I-2) = (P: 69, 16-22)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with the following differences:</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>Do all learners of the Dharma obtain Nirvàna</I>?&quot;</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>Do all people obtain Nibbàna</I>?&quot;</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>Those who rightly bend upon the meritorious path, who learn and 
      know the right thing, those who practise what should be practised, who 
      give up what should not be practised, who think of what should be thought 
      of, who eradicate what should not be thought of, such people would obtain 
      Nirvàna</I>&quot; </P>
      <P>=P: <I>He who lives righteously, who knows what should be known, who 
      perceives what should be perceived, who gives up what should be given up, 
      who develops what should be developed, who realizes what should be 
      realized, such a man would obtain Nibbàna.</I>&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>8. Nirvàna is happiness:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 61b, 3-6) = (P: 69, 23-31; 70, 1-3)</P>
      <P>The same in both versions.</P>

      <P>(C: 61b, 13-16) = (P: 70, 17-26; 71, 1-2)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with the following differences<I>: C: Five great 
      rivers and each great river has 500 tributaries.</P>
      <P>=P: Five great rivers. </P>
      <P>C: Heng, Hsin-t&#39;a, Ssu-t&#39;a, Po-ch&#39;a, (K. E. Po-ch&#39;a) Shih-p&#39;i-i, (K. E.

      <P>C: It is because those who have attained enlightenent have spoken of

      <P>=P: &quot;Thus having seen the great disciples completely emancipated, I 
      know that the Blessed One is incomparable.&quot;</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>3. The Buddha&#39;s incomparibility is known through his teachings:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 61b, 16-19) = (P: 71, 3-11)</P>
      <P>The purport is the same, but the C is with more details. </P>
      <P>For the P: <I>Formerly, there was a Master in writing, named 
      Tissatthera; he passed away many years ago. How is he known</I>?&quot; &quot;<I>By 
      his writing&quot;. </P>
      </I>
      <P>The C uses many sentences as follows:</P>
      <I>
      <P>Na-hsien asked the king</I>: &quot;<I>Who is the master in writing books</I>?&quot; 
      The king replied: &quot;<I>The master who wrote books was called Chih.</I>&quot; 
      Na-hsien asked: &quot;<I>Have you ever seen Chih?&quot; </P>
      </I>
      <P>The king replied: &quot;<I>Chih died long, long ago. I have never seen him.&quot;</P>
      <P>Na-hsien asked</I>: &quot;<I>O King, you have never seen him, then how do 
      you know that Chih is a master in writing books?</I>&quot; The king replied: &quot;I<I>t 
      is because the ancient books and his writings are handed down to us that I 
      know Chih.&quot; </P>
      </I>
      <P>The P adds a passage saying that &quot;<I>he who sees the Dhamma sees the 
      Lord, the Dhamma being taught by the Buddha.&quot;</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>4. The teachings of the Buddha should be practised for the whole life.</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 61b, 19) = (P: 71, 12-15)</P>
      <P>Both versions are not the same.</P>
      <P>C: <I>The king again asked Na-hsien: &quot;Do you see by yourself that the 
      Buddha&#39;s teachings should be practised for a long time?&quot; Na-hsien replied: 
      &quot;The teachings explained by the Buddha, the rules, the sermons are very 
      quick (?) but, they should be practised up to old age.</I>&quot;</P>
      <P>=P: <I>The king asked: &quot;Ven Nàgasena, is the Dhamma seen by you?&quot; &quot;The 
      disciples should behave up to the end of their life in accordance with the 
      guidance of the Buddha and the concept of the Buddha</I>.&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>5. Rebirth without transmigration:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 62a, 1-4) = (P: 71, 16-29)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with the following differences:</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>People after death receive a new body but the old body does not 
      transmigrate</I>&quot;.</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>Na ca sankamati, patisandahati.</I>&quot; </P>
      <P>The first simile is the same. The second one is slightly different. The 
      C adds one more detail that when the king learnt the sacred books (P: 
      siloham, verse), from the teacher, the teacher continued to know the 
      sacred books.</P>
      <B>
      <P>6. Bad and good actions follow the doer:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 62a, 4-7) = (P: 71, 30-32; 72, 1-18)</P>
      <P>Here the C confines this passage to one paragraph while the P extends 
      it to two panagraphs. There are many points in common between the two 
      versions but their interpretation is not the same.</P>
      <P>So the C passage is translated textually here: &quot;<I>The king again 
      asked: &#39;Is there anything which (can be called) the Knower (P: Vedagù)</I>?&quot; 
      Na-hsien replied: &#39;&quot;<I>There is nothing which can be called the knower.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>&#39;<I>For example, there is a thief who steals fruits from the trees of 
      other people, is the thief guilty</I>?&#39; The king replied &#39;<I>He is guilty</I>.&#39; 
      Na-hsien said: &#39;<I>At the time of planting, there was no fruit, why was 
      the thief guilty</I>?&quot; The king replied: &#39;<I>If the trees were not 
      planted,what causes the fruits to come into being? That is why the thief 
      has no excuses (chuang) (?).</I>&quot; Na-hsien said: &quot;p<I>eople are the same. 
      By reason of the performance of good and bad actions in the present life, 
      he would be born in the next life and obtain a new body.&quot; The king asked</I>: 
      &#39;<I>Is it by reason of the performance of good and bad action of the old 
      body that new good and bad (results) come into existence</I>?</P>
      <P>Na-hsien replied: &quot;<I>The performance of good and bad actions follows 
      the doer, just like the shadow that follows the body. When a man dies, 
      only his body is destroyed, but his performance is not destroyed. Just as 
      at night, one lights the fire to write something, when the fire is 
      extingguished, the writing remains. When the fire is lit, it comes into 
      existence. Thus the performance in the present life leads to its formation 
      in the next life and is received accordingly</I>.&quot;</P>
      <P>The king said: &quot;<I>Very good</I>.&quot;</P>
      <P>P: The P starts with the king&#39;s question if there was anything called
      <I>Vedagù</I> and Nàgasena replied that <I>in the ultimate sense, there 
      was no such thing called Vedag</I>ù. And the king praised Nàgasena.</P>
      <P>In the next paragraph, the king said that if there were no 
      transmigration from one body to an-other, then one would be free from 
      one&#39;s misdeeds.</P>
      <P>Nàgasena replied that if one were not to be reborn, one would be free; 
      if one were to be reborn, one would not be free.</P>
      <P>And Nàgasena quoted the simile of a thief who stole the mango to prove 
      his point. Then he concluded that this name and form performed good and 
      bad actions and due to those kammas, another name and form was reborn and 
      one was not free from was reborn and one was not free from one&#39;s own 
      misdeeds.</P>
      <B>
      <P>7. Bad and good actions cannot be pointed out:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 62a, 7-9) = (P: 72, 19-32)</P>
      <P>There is a slight difference in the interpretation of the simile of 
      this passage. The C want to show that those who are not yet emancipated 
      cannot point out the position of good and bad actions, so in the simile, 
      it shows that when the fruits are not yet born, it is impossible for 
      anyone to foretell that this branch has no fruits.</P>
      <P>The P wants also to show that it is impossible to point out the 
      position of good and bad actions, but in the simile, it shows that when 
      the fruits are not yet born, it is impossible for anyone to point out the 
      position of the fruits in such and such a place.</P>
      <B>
      <P>8. One who is to be reborn knows that he will be reborn:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 62a, 9-11) = (P: 73, 1-8)</P>
      <P>The same in both versions.</P>
      <B>
      <P>9. The Buddha after his Parinirvàna cannot be pointed out:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 62a, 11-13) = (P: 73, 9-22)</P>
      <P>Almost the same. The C adds: &quot;<I>The king again asked Na-hsien: &quot;Is 
      there Nirvàna or not</I>?&quot; <I>Na-hsien replied: &quot;There is Nirvàna&quot;. </P>
      </I>
      <P>The P adds: &quot;<I>The Buddha has passed away without any remainder&quot;.</I> 
      It adds also at the end: &quot;<I>The Buddha can be pointed out through his 
      Dhammakàya, as the Dhamma is preached by the Blessed One</I>.&quot; The 
      remaining is almost the same.</P>

      <P>Almost the same, with some differences in details. </P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>When taking rest, sleeping, they want to be comfortable; when

      <P>C: &quot;<I>The recluses are the same, they do not crave for their body. 
      Although they have to drink, to eat, their mind does not enjoy, does not

      beautiful things, they want to keep the body going on so as to follow the

      <P>=P: &quot;<I>Thus, the religious ones do not love their body. They look 
      after it, without clinging to it, for the sake of the Brahmà life. Thus 
      the body spoken of by the Blessed One is similar to a wound. Therefore the 
      recluse should look after the body like a wound, without clinging to it.</I>&quot;

      <P>4. Is the Buddha a disciple of Brahmà?</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 62b, 4-7) = (P: 75, 30-33; 76. 1-7)</P>
      <P>The purport is the same, but the exposition is slightly different. </P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>Is the Buddha&#39;s conduct similar to that of the Brahmà of the 7<SUP>th</SUP> 
      heaven, having no intercourse with womenfolk</I>?&quot;</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>Buddho brahmacàrì</I>?&quot; </P>
      <P>C: Here at once Na-hsien asked if Brahmà of the 7<SUP>th</SUP> heaven 
      had mindfulness or not and to the king&#39;s positive reply, he pointed out 
      that Brahmà of the 7<SUP>th</SUP> heaven and the higher heavens should be 
      disciples of the Buddha. </P>
      <P>The P puts this passage later, mentions only Brahmà, not the higher 
      heavens. It uses the term <I>sabuddhiko</I> and <I>abuddhiko</I>, not the 
      term <I>mindfulness</I> as in the C. </P>
      <P>The simile used by Nàgasena is not the same in both versions.</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>What is the cry of that bird like</I>?&quot; The king replied: &quot;<I>(That) 
      bird cries like a wild goose</I>.&quot; Na-hsien said: &quot;<I>Then that bird 
      should be a wild goose</I>.&quot; </P>
      <P>The P refers to a king&#39;s state-elephant (<I>hatthipàmokkho</I>), his 
      trumpetting is like a heron&#39;s cry, so it should be said that the 
      state-elephant is a disciple of the heron.</P>
      <B>
      <P>5. The Buddha has no teacher.</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 62b, 7-9) = (P: 76, 8-15)</P>
      <P>Almost the same with some slight differences in expressions. </P>
      <P>C: The king asked Na-hsien: &quot;<I>The Buddha should learn, know and 
      practise the Dharma and the Precepts, shouldn&#39;t he?</P>
      <P>Na-hsien replied: &quot;The Buddha naturally should learn, know and practise 
      the Dhamma and the precepts.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>Is high ordination a good thing</I>? -Yes, O K<I>ing, high 
      ordination is a good thing</I>.</P>
      <P>C: <I>The king asked: &quot;From what teacher did the Buddha receive the 
      Dharma and the precepts</I>?&quot;</P>
      <I>
      <P>Na-hsien replied: &quot;The Buddha had no teacher. When he obtained 
      enlightenment; he knew by himself the Dharma, the Path, unlike disciples 
      who should learn, know the Buddha&#39;s teachings and practise them till old 
      age.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>O great King, the Buddha obtained high ordination at the root of 
      the Bodhi tree when he attained omniscience, but he did not receive high 
      ordination from others in the way the Blessed One laid down the precepts 
      for his disciples to observe up to the end of their life.</P>

      <P>6. Two kinds of tears</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 62b, 9-11) = (P: 76, 16-22)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with the following differences:</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>The tears at the death of one&#39;s father or mother and the tears 
      when one hears the Dharma, these two kinds of tears, are they different</I>?&quot;</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>He who weeps at the death of his mother and he who weeps owing 
      to the love of the Dhamma, of these two kinds of weeping, which tears 
      would act as a medicine, which tears would not</I>?&quot;</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>To him who weeps for his father or mother, his tears are due to 
      his attachment, his thinking of, his grief, sorrow, suffering. This kind 
      of sorrow is the sorrow of the ignorant people. To him who weeps while 
      hearing the sermon of the Buddha, his heart is (full) of compassion, as he 
      thinks of the suffering in the world, so his tears come out. He would 
      obtain the greatest merit</I>&quot;</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>The tears of this one are stained and hot with attachment, 
      hatred and delusion. The tears of the other are unstained and cool. There 
      is medicine in what is cool; there is no medicine in heat</I> (passion).&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>7. The man with passion and the man without passion</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 62b, 11-13) = (P: 76, 23-31; 77, 1-2)</P>
      <P>Almost the same with the following differences:</P>
      <P>C: <I>He who is emancipated and who is not yet emancipated, what is the 
      difference between them</I>?</P>
      <P>=P: <I>What is the difference between a man of passion and a man 
      without passion</I>?</P>
      <P>C: <I>Na-hsien said</I>: &quot;<I>He who is not emancipated is with 
      attachment and desire. He who is emancipated has no attachment, no desire. 
      He wants to eat only for the sake of keeping alive&quot;.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>One is with craving, the other is without passion (ajjhosito 
      atthiko)</I>.</P>
      <P>C: <I>The king said</I>: &quot; <I>I see, people of the world want their 
      body to enjoy (things of the world), want delicious food without being 
      satiated.&quot; Na-hsien said: &quot;He who is not yet emancipated wants things to 
      be delicious and tasty in eating; he who is emancipated, although eating, 
      does not want to enjoy it, does not want it sweet, but only for the sake 
      of keeping alive</I>&quot;</P>
      <P>=P: <I>The lustful man in eating enjoys both the taste and the lust for 
      taste, the passionless man in eating enjoys the taste of food, but not the 
      lust for taste.</P>

      <P>(C: 62b, 13-18) = (P: 77, 23-31)</P>
      <P>Not exactly the same. The C is with more details. Here a textual 
      translation would serve the purpose. </P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>The king again asked Na-hsien: &quot;What makes a man, having done 
      some work, remember it far and for a long time?&quot; Na-hsien replied: &quot;When 
      people are sorrowful, one remembers far and for a long time.&quot;</P>
      <P>The king asked: &quot;By what does one remember, by mind or by memory?&quot; 
      Na-hsien asked the king: &quot;Having learnt and known something, later on do 
      you remember it?&quot; The king said: &quot;Having learnt and known something, later 
      on I forget it.</I>&quot; Na-hsien asked: &quot;At that time, is it due to your mind 
      that you have forgotten?&quot; <I>The king said: &quot;At that time, I have no 
      memory.&quot; Na-hsien said.</I>......(some corruption in the text cannot be 
      translated). </P>
      <I>
      <P>The king again asked Na-hsien: &quot;People remember what they have done, 
      like things done in the past. Now do they use their memory to remember 
      things which are being done in the present? Na-hsien replied</I>: &quot;<I>Things 
      of the past are known by the memory. Things of the present are also known 
      by the memory.</I>&quot;</P>
      <I>
      <P>The king said</I>: &quot;<I>Thus people can remember only things of the past 
      but cannot remember new things</I>?&quot; Na-hsien said: &quot;<I>If things newly 
      done cannot be remembered, past things would be like that.</I>&quot; </P>
      <P>The king said: &quot;<I>People who just learn books, crafts, do they forget</I>?&quot; 
      Na-hsien said: &quot;<I>People who just learn books and arts have their memory 
      so the disciples who have learned would know. That is why there is memory.</I>&quot; 
      The king said: &quot;<I>Very good</I>.&quot;</P>
      <P>The P version is rather different. Nàgasena here wanted to point out to 
      the king that one recollected by the memory, but not by the mind, because 
      if one recollected by the mind, when one forgot things, then there would 
      be no mind, and this would be absurd.&quot;</P>

      <P>Not available in C.</P>
      <P>Nàgasena showed to the king that memory arose depending upon internal 
      stimulus as well as externel stimulus, because without the latter, there 
      would be no need of practice, or art, schooling and there would be no need 
      of teacher.</P>

      <P>(C: 63a, 19-20; 63b, 1-3)=(P: 80, 17-27)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with the following differences.</P>

      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>Depositing 100 cart-loads of stone in a boat</I>.</P>
      <P>C: <I>100 big stones in a boat do not sink due to the boat. Although 
      one has done evil in the past, yet with one thought of the Buddha, one 
      does not fall into the Hell and is reborn in the heaven. A small stone 
      that sinks is like people who do evil but do not know the Dharma of the 
      Buddha; when they die, they will fall into the Hell.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>Good actions should be understood as the boat.</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>3. To remove suffering in the future:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 63b, 3-7) = (P: 80, 28-31; 81; 82, 1-11)</P>
      <P>The purport is the same in both versions but the C explanation is very 
      simple.</P>
      <P>The P starts with the king&#39;s three questions: &quot;<I>Do you exert yourself 
      for the eradication of past suffering, of future suffering, and of present 
      suffering</I>?&quot; (to each question, Nàgasena replied in the negative). 
      These questions are not available in the C.</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>For what purpose do you learn the Dharma and become a monk</I>?&quot;</P>
      <P>=P: <I>If you do not exert yourself for the eradication of suffering of 
      the past, of the future and of the present, so for what purpose do you 
      exert yourself?</P>
      </I>
      <P>C: <I>For the purpose of eradicating past suffering, future suffering, 
      and not wanting to experience it again, we learn the Dharma and become 
      monks.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>What for? For the purpose of stopping this suffering and for 
      preventing other suffering from arising we exert ourselves</I>.</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>If suffering is in the next life, then for what purpose does one 
      prepare to learn the Dharma and become a monk</I>?&quot;</P>
      <P>=P: Here the king asked Nàgasena if there was such a thing as suffering 
      in the future and to Nàgasena&#39;s negative reply, the king said that 
      Nàgasena was very wise to exert himself for the eradication of some thing 
      which did not exist.</P>
      <P>The remaining three similes: to prepare to fight against any would-be 
      enemy, to dig a well and to sow corn are almost the same in both versions, 
      the P giving far more details.</P>
      <B>
      <P>4. How far the Brahmà world is?</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 63b, 7-11) = (P: 82, 12-28)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with some slight differences as follows:</P>
      <P>C: <I>The 7<SUP>th</SUP> Brahma-heaven is very far. If a big rock like 
      the king&#39;s palace is dropped from the 7<SUP>th</SUP> Brahmà heaven, it 
      takes six months (K. E.: six days) to reach this earth</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>If a rock like a kùtàgàra (upper pinnacle) falls down from that 
      place, at a speed of 48.000 yojanas day and night, it takes four months to 
      reach this earth.</P>
      </I>
      <P>C: <I>I was born in Ta-ch&#39;in-kuo named A-li-san</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>Alasando nàma dìpo</I>.</P>
      <P>C: <I>A-li-san is of</I> <I>2000</I> <I>yu-hsun</I> (<I>yojanas</I>) <I>
      distant from here</I> (K. E. or 80.000 li)</P>
      <P>=P: <I>About 200 yojanas</I>.</P>
      <P>The rest is almost the same.</P>
      <B>
      <P>5. The speed taken by a living being in his rebirth.</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 63b, 11-16) = (P: 82, 29-32; 83, 1-20)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with the following difference: C:<I> Chi-pin of 720 li 
      distant</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>Kasmira of 12 yojanas distant.</I> </P>
      <P>The remaining is almost the same.</P>
      <B>
      <P>6. Seven kind of wisdom:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 63b, 16-20) = (P: 83, 21-30)</P>
      <P>Not exactly the same in both versions. While the P refers to <I>satta 
      bojjhang</I>à, the C refers to the following seven: (1) <I>Thinking of 
      good and evil things; </I>(2) <I>exertion</I>; (3) <I>To enjoy the dharma</I>; 
      (4) <I>To subdue the mind in doing good.</I> (5) <I>Thinking of the Path</I>, 
      (6) <I>One mindedness</I>, (7) <I>To meet things without attachment, 
      without hatred</I>.</P>
      <P>C: <I>The wise take only the wisdom that can distinguish between good 
      and evil, and know the Path, but it is not necessary to use the whole 
      seven.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>One uses only one factor of wisdom to become wise: the 
      investigation of the Dhamma. </P>
      </I>
      <P>C: <I>Although the mind of the man is clear, the investigation of the 
      Dharma should be obtained together with the other six so as to attain 
      wisdom.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>Without the investigation of the Dhamma, the remaining six 
      factors of wisdom cannot lead to wisdom.</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>7. Merit is greater than demerit.</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 63b, 20; 64a, 1-3)=(P: 83, 31-32; 84, 1-12)</P>
      <P>Although the purport is the same, the exposition is quite different.</P>
      <P>C: <I>The king asked: &quot;People doing good obtain great merit or people 
      doing evil obtain great demerit</I>?&quot; <I>Na-hsien replied:</I> &quot;<I>People 
      doing good obtain great merit, people doing evil obtain small demerit</I>.&quot;</P>
      <P>=P: <I>Which gives more (result), merit or demerit? -Merit is more, 
      demerit is less</I>.</P>
      <P>C: <I>When people are doing evil daily they repent, so their offence 
      diminishes daily. When people are doing good, day and night they rejoice, 
      so they obtain big merit.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>He who performs demerit is remorseful and recognises his 
      demerit, so his evil does not increase. He who performs merit, is not 
      remorseful. Being not remorseful,gladness arises; Being glad, joy arises; 
      being joyful, his body becomes light; his body being light, he experiences 
      happiness; being happy, his mind becomes concentrated. Being concentrated, 
      he knows things as they really are. Due to that, his merit increases.</P>
      </I>
      <P>C: <I>Formerly, when the Buddha was living, in the country there was a 
      man without hands and feet. He took some lotuses and offered them to the 
      Buddha. The Buddha then told the monks: &quot;This man without hands and feet 
      in 91 kalpas would not fall into the hell, into the animal Kingdom, into 
      the Kingdom of the departed; he would be born in the heaven. Then from 
      heaven, he would be born as man</I>.&quot; </P>
      <I>
      <P>That is why I know that if people do little good, they obtain great 
      merit; if they do evil, they would repent and their (offence) would 
      diminish and be extinguished. That is why I know that when people do evil, 
      their demerit is small.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>A man, whose hands and feet were cut off, having offered a 
      handful of lotuses to the Blessed One, would not enter the purgatory for 
      91 kalpas. Due to this reason, I say merit is more effective and demerit 
      is less effective.</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>8. To do evil without knowing and to do evil knowingly:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 64a, 3-7) = (P: 84, 13-25)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with the following differences:</P>
      <P>C: <I>Burning steel.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>Blazing mass of iron, glowing, burning</I>. </P>
      <P>C: <I>In my country, according to the law, if a great minister commits 
      offence, his offence is grave; if an ignorant man commits an offence, his 
      offence is light</P>
      </I>
      <P>= P: <I>If any of our princes or ministers commits evil, his punishment 
      would be double</I>.</P>
      <B>
      <P>9. Power of travelling:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 64a, 7-10) = (P: 84, 26-32; 85, 1-9)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with the following differences:</P>
      <P>C: <I>Can any person with this body fly up to the </I>7<SUP>th</SUP><I> 
      Brahmà heaven and up to Yu-tan-yueh </I>or<I> other places, he wishes to 
      go</I>?</P>
      <P>=P: <I>Is there anybody who with this body can go up to Uttarakuru or 
      to Brahmà heaven or to other continent</I>?</P>
      <P>C: <I>O King, when you were small, did you in playing jump a chang</I>? 
      =P: <I>O King, do you remember having jumped across the ground a vidatthim 
      (span) or a ratanim (cubit</I>?) .</P>
      <P>Here the P adds: &quot;<I>Ven. Sir, having made up my mind that I should 
      reach such a place, due to this determination of the mind, my body becomes 
      light</I>.</P>
      <P>C: <I>In the same way, he who realizes the Dharma can take this body 
      and fly up to the 7<SUP>th</SUP> Brahmà heaven or to Yu-tan-yùeh.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>In the same way, the monk endowed with psychic powers, who has 
      mastery over his mind, with the power of his mind can travel through the 
      air</I>. </P>
      <P>(K.E. Available, but this passage is placed near the end of the book).</P>
      <B>
      <P>10. Very long bones:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 64a, 10-12) = (P: 85, 10-17)</P>
      <P>Almost the same with the following differences:</P>
      <P>C: <I>There is a bone of 4000 li long.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>100 leagues long.</I> </P>
      <P>C: <I>A big fish called Chih of 28.000 li long</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>Fish of 500 leagues long</I>. (K. E. Available near the end of 
      the book).</P>
      <B>
      <P>11. Stop breathing:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 64a, 12-14) = (P: 85, 18-30)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, but in the C, some expressions are rather difficult to 
      understand, with the following differences:</P>
      <P>C: <I>Have you ever heard about chih (determination)</I>? <I>The king 
      replied: &quot;I have heard about it.&quot;</P>
      <P>Na-hsien asked: &quot;O King, is this Chih inside the body, isn&#39;t it?&quot; The 
      king replied: &quot;I consider the determination to be inside the body</I>.&quot;
      </P>
      <I>
      <P>Na-hsien said: &quot; O King, an ignorant man cannot control his body and 
      speech, cannot follow the Dharma and the precepts. Such a man does not 
      enjoy his own body. Na-hsien said: &quot;People who learn the Dharma can 
      control their body and speech, can follow the Dharma and the precepts, can 
      obtain one-mindedness and the 4<SUP>th</SUP> Dhyàna states so why are they 
      unable to stop their breathing?&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>Here the P is different. At first, Nàgasena asked the king if he ever 
      heard a man coughing (<I>kàkacchamàno</I>) and Nàgasena explained that the 
      man could stop coughing by bending his body (<I>kàyenamite</I>). Then he 
      concluded: <I>That man who is not trained in the body, in the precepts, in 
      concentration, in wisdom, can stop his coughing by bending his body</I>,
      <I>why can a man who is trained in the body, in the precepts, in 
      concentration, in wisdom not stop his breathing?</I> </P>
      <P>(K. E. available only the last portion. The whole passage is found 
      again at the end of the book. It shows that the K. E. is much corrupted.)</P>
      <B>
      <P>12. The ocean:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 64a, 14-15) = (P: 85, 31-32; 86, 1-3)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with a slight difference in expression.</P>
      <P>C: <I>What is called ocean, is it the water that is called ocean or due 
      to another reason</I>?</P>
      <P>=P: <I>Ocean is called ocean; by what reason is the water called ocean</I>?
      </P>
      <P>C: <I>Ocean is called ocean because water and salt mix together by half 
      and half.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>Because there is as much water as there is salt; and as much 
      salt as there is water. That is why it is called ocean</I>.</P>
      <B>
      <P>13. Saltiness:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 64a, 15-16) = (P: 86, 4-7)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with the following differences:</P>
      <P>C: <I>For what reason is the ocean salty like the taste of salt</I>?</P>
      <P>=P: <I>For what reason has the ocean only one taste, the taste of salt</I>?</P>
      <P>C: <I>The ocean is salty because it has been stored up for a very long 
      time and because fishes, turtles have lived together in it</I> (<I>ch&#39;ing-pien</I>?)
      </P>
      <P>=P: <I>Because the water has been stored up for a very long time.</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>14. Power of wisdom:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 64a, 16-18) = (P: 86, 8-16)</P>
      <P>Not exactly the same. The questions are different, but the answers are 
      rather similar. </P>
      <P>C: <I>He who obtains the Dharmas, can he ponder over all subtle and 
      deep matters</I>? </P>
      <P>= P: <I>Can the most subtle thing be divided</I>? </P>
      <P>C: <I>He who obtains the Dharma can ponder over all abstruse, subtle 
      and profound matters</I> </P>
      <P>= P: <I>Yes, all subtle things can be divided.</P>
      </I>
      <P>C: <I>Na-hsien said: &quot;The Buddha Dharma is the most abstruse and 
      profound matter, which cannot be fathomed. But it can be divided (or 
      analysed) by knowledge</I> &quot;</P>
      <P>=P: <I>Dhamma is the most subtle matter, but not all dhammas are like 
      that, as there are expressions of subtleness and coarseness. Whatever can 
      be divided is divided by wisdom, there is no second occasion for being cut 
      by wisdom</I>.</P>
      <B>
      <P>15. There is no spirit in the body:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 64a, 18-20; 64b, 1) = (P: 86, 17-31; 87, 1-2)</P>
      <P>The purport is the same,but there are differences in expressions:</P>
      <P>C: <I>The spirit of a man, wisdom and the nature of things, are these 
      three the same or different</I>?</P>
      <P>=P: <I>Consciousness, wisdom and the life principle in a living being, 
      are these dhammas different in meaning, different in expression or are 
      they the same in meaning and different in expression</I>? </P>
      <P>(Here the C uses the expression <I>spirit</I> for <I>consciousness</I>.)</P>
      <P>C: <I>The soul of a man knows, wisdom realizes the path and the nature 
      of things is emptiness, without any individual</I>.</P>
      <P>=P: <I>The characteristic of consciousness is knowledge, that of wisdom 
      is realization and there is no life-principle in a living being</I>.</P>
      <P>C: <I>How to obtain an individuality? Eyes see material forms; ears 
      hear sounds; nose smells odour; mouth experiences taste; the body knows 
      coarseness, smoothness; the mind knows good and evil, so how to obtain an 
      individuality</I>?</P>
      <P>=P: <I>If there be no life principle, then what sees material forms 
      with eyes, hears sound with ears, smells odours with nose, experiences 
      taste with tongue, feels touch with body and knows things with the mind</I>?</P>
      <P>C: <I>If the individuality can make the eyes see, so when the eye-balls 
      are plucked out, can he see farther and wider? When the ears are torn open 
      and big, can he hear farther and wider? When the nose is dug out to make 
      it big, can it smell odour farther and wider? When the mouth is widely 
      open, can he know taste farther and wider? When the skin is cut and peeled 
      off, can he know coarseness and smoothness? When the mind is thrown out, 
      can the thought become numerous?&quot;. The king replied: &#39;No&#39;</I> (Here the C 
      stops without the usual &#39;well said&#39;) </P>
      <P>= P: The P is almost the same with some slight differences in 
      expressions. Here the P adds: &quot;<I>Thus there is no life principle in a 
      living being</I>. </P>
      <P>(K. E. has only the 1<SUP>st</SUP> portion. The last portion is taken 
      from other paragraph and does not fit in with this passage.)</P>
      <B>
      <P>16. Very difficult is the work done by the Buddha:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 64b, 1-6) = (P: 87, 3-19)</P>
      <P>The purport is the same but the exposition is different.</P>
      <P>C: <I>Na-hsien said: &quot;What the Buddha has done is very difficult, what 
      the Buddha knows is very subtle</I>&quot;.</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>What the Blessed One has done is very difficult.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>C: <I>Na-hsien said: &quot;The Buddha said that (he) knows what is inside 
      the body of a man (or he knows the individuality inside the body if the 
      term</I> <I>jen</I> should be understood in this way), <I>what the eyes 
      see, he understands it all.</I> <I>He understands things concerning the 
      eyes, things concerning the ears, things concerning the nose, things 
      concerning the mouth, things concerning the body, he understands 
      destruction, he understands doubts, he understands </I>what is thought of, 
      he understands the spirit</P>
      <P>=P: (quite different): Here the Buddha is praised in his analysis of 
      these immaterial dhammas, mind and psychic factors such as: <I>this is 
      contact, this is feeling, this is perception, this is volition, this is 
      the mind. </P>
      </I>
      <P>The simile is different but the purport is almost the same.</P>
      <P>C: <I>A man takes some water of the ocean in his mouth, can he know 
      that in his mouth, such portion of is the water of such a spring, such 
      portion is the water of such a stream, such portion is the water of such a 
      river?&quot; The king said: &quot; All the waters have mingled into one, it is very 
      difficult to distinguish them.&quot; </P>
      </I>
      <P>Na-hsien said: &quot;<I>What the Buddha has done is very difficult, he knows 
      how to distinguish the tastes of different waters. Now of the ocean water 
      before the eye, O King, you still do not know, (so how about) the spirit 
      inside the body which cannot be seen, about the six things which cannot be 
      seen</I>?&quot; </P>
      <P>&quot;That is why the Buddha understands all things from the mind and 
      psychic factors up to what is seen by the eyes, what is heard by the ears, 
      what is smelt by the nose, what is tasted by the mouth and what is felt by 
      the body, unpleasant, pleasant, cold, hot, coarse, smooth; from the mind 
      and psychic factors to everything else alike the Buddha knows all and 
      analyses them.</P>
      <P>The P simile is not exactly the same. It refers to a man who enters the 
      ocean, takes some water in his hand and tastes it with his tongue. It is 
      very difficult for him to distinguish that this is the water of the 
      Ganges, this is the water of the Yamunà, this is the water of Aciravatì, 
      this is the water of Sarabhù, this is the water of Mahì.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER">CONCLUSION </P>
      </FONT></B>
      <P>(C: 64b, 6-17) = (P- 87, 21-26; 88;89, 1-16)</P>
      <P>Both are almost the same, but the Pàli is far more detailed. C: Here <I>
      Na-hsien</I> said that is was past midnight, he wanted to go, then the 
      king ordered his attendants to have four rolls of cloths dipped in the oil 
      to serve as torches and see Na-hsien to his place, with all due respect to 
      Na-hsien as if to himself, saying that with a teacher like <I>Na-hsien</I> 
      and with a disciple like himself, the realization of the Dharma should be 
      quick, as all his questions were given suitable answers by <I>Na-hsien.</P>
      </I>
      <P>Here the P first adds Nàgasena&#39;s enquiry as to the time and the king 
      replied that the first watch had passed, the second watch was ushered in, 
      the torches were lit, the four banners were raised and the gift from the 
      king would come from the treasury. Here the P adds that the Yonakas 
      praised Nàgasena as pandita and the king approved of their praises saying 
      that with such a teacher as Nàgasena and such a disciple as himself, a 
      scholar would realize the Dhamma before long.</P>
      <P>C: The king was pleased and ordered clothes worthy of 10.000 (coins) to 
      be offered to <I>Na-hsien</I> from the treasury and informed him that from 
      now on, he together with 800 monks would be invited to take their daily 
      meals in the palace and to be provided with what they desired. But<I> 
      Na-hsien</I> declined, saying that a religious man had no desire.</P>
      <P>The king said that <I>Na-hsien</I> should protect him and should also 
      protect himself, because people would blame the king of being miserly as
      <I>Na-hsien</I> had solved the latter&#39;s doubts but did not receive any 
      thing from him; people also would blame <I>Na-hsien</I> of being unable to 
      solve the king&#39;s doubts so the latter did not offer him anything.</P>
      <P>And the king added that by receiving his present, Na-hsien would 
      protect his fame and help the king to earn merit.</P>
      <P>Here the king quoted the simile of a lion in a golden cage longing for 
      freedom outside to illustrate his own case of being imprisoned in the 
      palace but his mind did not relish and longed to leave the country and 
      study the Dharma.</P>
      <P>=P: The P is almost the same with the following differences: </P>
      <P>C: <I>Na-hsien together with 800 monks daily=P: Atthasatabhattam (800 
      meals).</P>
      </I>
      <P>C: <I>A robe worthy of 100.000 </I>=P: <I>Satasahassa-gghàakà kambalà.</I> 
      Here the P adds: &quot;<I>The king said that if he were to adopt the religious 
      life, he would not live long because he had many enemies</I>.&quot;</P>
      <P>C: Then Na-hsien returned to the temple.</P>
      <P>When Na-hsien had just left, the king pondered over all the questions 
      put to Na-hsien and all the answers given by Na-hsien and he realized that 
      all questions had been replied and explained by Na-hsien himself.</P>
      <P>When he returned to the temple Na-hsien pondered over all the questions 
      put to him by the king and all his replied to them and he realized that he 
      had explained all the questions asked by the king. Na-hsien thought over 
      these matters up to daylight.</P>
      <P>Then he robed himself, took the begging bowl, entered the palace and 
      sat in the royal hall. The king first paid homage to Na-hsien, sat down 
      and informed Na-hsien of what he was thinking on the previous night and 
      said that these thoughts kept him happy up to the morning.</P>
      <P>Na-hsien then reported what he was thinking on the previous night and 
      said that these thoughts kept him happy up to the morning. Having said 
      that, Na-hsien wanted to depart. And the king paid homage to Na-hsien.</P>
      <P>The P is almost the same except that P adds the expression: &quot;<I>well 
      put were the questions asked by the king and well replied were the answers 
      given by Nàgasena.</I> Here the wording is slightly different. The king 
      asked Nàgasena not to think that he had rejoiced the whole night over what 
      he had asked Nàgasena.</P>
      <P>Nàgasena also asked the king not to think that he had rejoiced the 
      whole night over what he had answered the king. Here the P omits the 
      departure of Nàgasena and the homage paid by the king at the end, but 
      mentions instead that both great men praised each other.</P>
      <P>Here ends the Chinese version, while the P adds the Mendakapañho, where 
      King Milinda asked Nàgasena to solve many dilemnas called Mendaka, in 
      which two-pronged questions were put to Nàgasena, each question containing 
      two statements which seem contradictory; and to these questions, Nàgasena 
      gave answers to the entire satisfaction of the king.</P>
      <P>Next come the three books on Anumanapañha, Dhuøtangas and 
      Opammakathàpañha, which are all considered later additions by the Pàli 
      compilers, because the doctrine treated here is more complicated, more 
      subtle and therefore not suitable to such people as the Yonakas at the 
      time of King Milanda. Rather, they are works of several intelligent and 
      well-learned Elders, well-versed not only in the Suttapitaka, but also in 
      the commentaries. That is why they have expanded the original to the 
      present bulk according to the tradition of their school.</P>

      <P>2. Some obscure and curious translations:</P>
      </B>
      <P>Sometime we find some obscure and curious translations, rather puzzling 
      and difficult to explain:</P>
      <I>
      <P>Fu-tao</I>: Underground road? <I>Ch&#39;uan-pai</I>: White? <I>
      Shu-shui-shih</I>: Book-water-filling for the P: Dhammakaraka. <I>Chih</I>: 
      P: Tissatthere. <I>Ta-ch&#39;in-kuo</I>: Country of the Yonakas. <I>Chih</I>: 
      A big fish.</P>
      <P>Dr. Kogen Mizuno is of the opinion that although the C book mentions 
      that the translation was done in <I>Tung-hsin</I> period (317-420), it 
      should have been earlier, probably in <I>Hou-han</I> period, not later 
      than <I>San-kuo</I> period for the following three reason:</P>
      <P>The translated terms are archaic; the Gàthà is translated in prose form 
      and the use of the term <I>Ta-ch&#39;in-kuo.</P>
      </I>
      <P>In his chart, Dr. Kogen Mizuno points out that the terms adopted by our 
      translators are not the same as those adopted by <I>An-shih-kao</I>. It 
      shows that the translation should have been done earlier than <I>
      An-shih-kao</I> period. It couldnot have been dated later than <I>
      Tung-hsin</I> or <I>Hsi-hsin</I> period, but rather in <I>Hou-han</I> 
      period.</P>
      <P>As seen earlier, there is no gàthà form in the C version. Dr. Kogen 
      Mizuno cites the case of the P gàthà: <I>Arogyà paramà làbhà, santutthì 
      paramam dhanam, vissàsa paramà nàti, Nibbànam paramam sukham.</P>
      </I>
      <P>This gàthà is translated by <I>Chih-ch&#39;ien</I> of <I>San-kuo</I> period 
      as follows:</P>
      <I>
      <P>Wu ping tsui li, <BR>
      Chih tsu tsui fu, <BR>
      Hou wei tsui yu, <BR>
      Ni-yuan tsui lo.</P>
      <P>Chu-fu-nien </I>of Tung-hsin period rendered the same gàthà in verse 
      form: </P>
      <I>
      <P>Wu ping ti i li, <BR>
      Chih tsu ti i fu, <BR>
      Chih-ch&#39;in ti i yu, <BR>
      Ni-yuan ti i lo.</P>
      </I>
      <P>As the translator of our text adopts the prose form to translate this P 
      gàthà, the C version should have been older than <I>San-kuo</I> and <I>
      Tung-hsin</I> period.</P>
      <P>In the C version, the term <I>Ta-ch&#39;in-kuo</I> is used to translate the 
      country of the Yonakas.</P>
      <P>According to Dr. Kogen Mizuno, the Greek territory was translated into
      <I>Ta ch&#39;in</I> during and after Hou-han period. So there is possibility 
      that our version was dated in <I>Hou-han </I>period. With the three 
      reasons mentioned above, Dr. Kogen Mizuno concluded that our Chinese text 
      was dated not in <I>Tung-hsin</I> period as mentioned in our text, but the 
      translation was done during, if not earlier than <I>Hou-han</I> period.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tarn mentions that the C translation was made several centuries 
      later than the P version. This is rather doubtful. First, we should note 
      that the original from which the C derives its translation is earlier than 
      the P text. So even if we suppose that the C translation were made later 
      than the P version, it does not imply that all the data supplied in the C 
      version should be dated later than those of the P text.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the date of the P version cannot be ascertained yet and it 
      might have been ranged from 1<SUP>st</SUP> A.D. to 6 A.D. when Buddhaghosa 
      wrote his Visuddhimagga. As to the C translation, Dr Mizuno dated it 
      during the <I>Hou-han</I> period (25.A.D. to 189 A.D.) , or according to 
      the date mentioned in the C text (Tung-hsin period: 317-419 A.D.) So in 
      either case Mr. Tarn is not justified in referring to the C translation as 
      being made several centuries later than the P version. </P>
