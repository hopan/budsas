      <P ALIGN="center">FOREWORD </P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>The title <I>Milindapanha</I>, a combination of foreign and Pali word, 
      indicates that the treatise was primarily meant for the people, who were 
      cognizant of, or associated with the name of King Menander. Many of them 
      were evidently non-Indians, who had a critical mind and were not inclined 
      to accept, out of veneration for the great Teacher, all the views and 
      sayings attributed to Him.</P>
      <P>The first problem discussed in the text is one of the most 
      controversial doctrines of the Buddhists. In this, the question of 
      relation through Kamma between one existence and another of a being was 
      taken up. It may be mentioned here that this is also the first problem 
      taken up in the <I>Kathavatthu</I>, an Abhidham-ma text (<I>Puggalo 
      upalabbhati</I>).</P>
      <P>The Buddhists were the only school of thought to advocate the 
      transference of Kammic effects from one existence to another without 
      admitting the existence and/or transmigration of a Soul (puggala).</P>
      <P>In the Pre-Christian eras, logic was in its elementary stage and so, 
      most of such tough problems were solved with the aid of similes and not by 
      logical arguments. The similes were also of the popular type, and were 
      very likely meant not for the intelligensia but for the common people 
      among whom there must have been many Indo-Greeks and Indo-Bactrians.</P>
      <P>The arguments found in the Kathavatthu, which is a much earlier text 
      than the Milinda-panoha, is of a higher order. The latter, though written 
      in a popular style, with similes of everyday life, offers a clear 
      exposition of the fundamentals of the Buddhist doctrines, disciplinary 
      rules and moral teachings.</P>
      <P>As early as 1860, the learned editor of the Milindapanoha, V. 
      Trenckner, assigned the text to the 1<SUP>st</SUP> century A.D. and came 
      to the conclusion on the basis of the use of the phrase &quot;<I>Tam yatha 
      nusuyata</I>&quot; instead of the usual Pali words &quot;<I>Evam me sutam</I>&quot; that 
      the original text was in Sanskrit and was composed in N.India, where King 
      Menander had his dominion, and that it could have no connection with 
      Ceylon.</P>
      <P>This view, I think, still holds good not withstanding the tradition 
      that Gunabhadra (393-468) carried with him a copy of this text to China 
      from Ceylon, as referred to by Prof. Demieville (vide BEFEO. XXIV. 1924). 
      There are eleven versions of this text in Chinese, the translations having 
      been made from the 6<SUP>th</SUP> to 13<SUP>th</SUP> Century A.D. (1) The 
      Chinese translated the Sanskrit Tripitaka, mostly found in N. India and 
      Central Asia, which were the centres of the Sarvastivadins and the 
      Dharmaguptas, who compiled the Tripitaka in Semi-Sanskrit.</P>
      <P>In fact, there are no Chinese translations of the Pali text except 
      perhaps the <I>Samantapasadika</I>, and the <I>Vimuttimagga</I>, about the 
      exact relation of which to the <I>Visuddhimagga</I> of Buddhaghosa has not 
      yet been ascertained.</P>
      <P>On a comparison of the available text of the Sanskrit Tripitaka with 
      their Pali counterparts and Chinese translation, it appears that there was 
      a considerable difference between the Sanskrit and the Pali versions while 
      there was close agreement between the Sanskrit texts and Chinese 
      translations. Hence, it cannot be expected that the Chinese versions of 
      the Milindapanoha would faithfully correspond to the Pali version. The 
      present editor Dr. Thich Minh Chau has amply corroborated this fact by his 
      close examination of the Pali and Chinese versions of the Milindapanoha as 
      also of other Sutras of the Nikayas.</P>
      <P>In Chinese translation are available only the first three parts of the 
      Milindapanoha. According to the opinions of Dr. Thich Minh Chau as also of 
      the Japanese and European scholars, these three chapters formed the 
      original, and the other portions are later accretions from century to 
      century as was the practice with the Indian authors and commentators of 
      the early days. It is very likely that the Chinese translation followed 
      the Sanskrit original closely.</P>
      <P>In BEFEO (XXIV), Prof. Demieville briefly compared the introductory 
      chapters and surveyed the contents of the Pali and Chinese versions and 
      translated the Chinese version into French. He made critical study of 
      Menandre, Sakala, Nagasena as an arhat, a schismatic and author of the 
      Trikayasastra, etc.</P>
      <P>In the present work, the author filled up the gap left by Prof. 
      Demieville. He compared the Pali and Chinese versions line by line and 
      pointed out the marked differences between the two versions exhaustively.</P>
      <P>He mentioned incidentally that there was a difference in approach to 
      the Buddhist texts by the Indian and Chinese thinkers and writers. On a 
      close comparative study of the two versions, he arrived at the conclusion 
      that the present available Pali text is an enlarged version of an earlier 
      Pali text, which was a translation of the original text, and the latter 
      actually formed the basis of the Chinese versions, and that the remaining 
      four parts of Trenckner&#39;s edition were added later by the compilers of the 
      Pali text.</P>
      <P>In the chapter on &quot;<I>Probe into the anteriority and fidelity of the 
      Pali and Chinese versions</I>&quot;, he adduced forceful arguments, which haved 
      a value of their own.</P>
      <P>The author has dealt with the following topics :</P>
      <P>(i) Previous lives of Nagasena and Millinda;<BR>
      (ii) Doctrines mentioned in the text; and<BR>
      (iii) Similes, citations and gathas.</P>
      <P>The author, a monk of Vietnam, mastered both Pali and Chinese languages 
      and gave finishing touch to his knowledge of Pali at the Nalanda Pali 
      Institute. Being well-versed in the two languages, he could compare the 
      two versions in original, problem by problem, and point out their 
      agreements and differences. His findings, therefore, are very valuable.</P>
      <P>His presentation of the materials is clear and impressive. By this 
      work, he has rendered a distinct service to the cause of Buddhistic 
      studies, in which the present day scholars are getting more and more 
      interested. I hope he will carry on such further comparative studies of 
      Pali and Chinese texts, and open up a new vista in our knowledge of the 
      history of Buddhism in Asia.</P>

      <P>Here I have selected the Milindapañho, the Pali text edited by V. 
      Trenckner to use in my comparative study. For the C text, I have to adopt 
      the Japanese Hsu ts&#39;ang edition, case Ts&#39;ang as it is handy and the T&#39;ai 
      sho edition is not available at Nàlanda. I wish that the Nàlandà 
      authorities would remedy this deplorable lacuna, because the T&#39;ai sho 
      edition has been widely used by scholars all over the world; and 
      references to another edition, as I have done in this work, are not much 
      welcomed by scholars in general.</P>
      <P>The C <B>Na-hsien-pi-ch&#39;iu-ching</B> has two texts, one of two volumes, 
      mentioned in my work as K. E. (Korean Edition), and the other of three 
      volumes. I have opted for the three-volume one, as the former text is too 
      much corrupted, with 17 dialogues missing, and with the order of some 
      dialogues altered although in some passages, it stands closer to the P 
      version. But in my comparative study, all the main differences between the 
      two Chinese texts are quoted so as to enlighten the readers of any great 
      differences between the two versions.</P>

      <P>When I had finished the comparative study of the P Milindapañho with 
      the C Na-hsien-pi-ch&#39;iu-ching, but not yet the introduction, I received 
      the Japanese book &quot;<B>On the Recensions of Milindapanho</B>&quot; by Dr. Kogen 
      Mizuno, sent to me by a Japanese scholar, Mr. Egaku Malda.</P>
      <P>Mr. Nagasaki, a Japanese scholar of the Nava Nàlandà Mahàvihàra was 
      kind enough to translate this book into English for me, and I am quite 
      happy to find that Mr. Kogen Mizuno&#39;s conclusions quite tally with my own, 
      and what is more gratifying, he has brought out some new and convincing 
      proofs as to the anteriority of the two texts.</P>
      <P>So in recognition of his competent scholarship, I have quoted some of 
      his findings in my work to support my view, at the same time, I try to 
      bring some portions of this valuable work to the notice of the readers at 
      large.</P>
      <P>My heartfelt thanks are hereby conveyed to the three above Japanese 
      scholars, who have contributed much to the improvement of my present work. 
      I am much indebted to Prof. Nalinaksha Dutt, former Head of the Pàli 
      Department, Calcutta University, who has been kind enough to write a 
      foreword to this work, thus enhancing its prestige and quality by his 
      enlightened scholarship.</P>
      <P>My thanks go out also to Prof. P. V. Bapat of Poona who has gone 
      through my work with the conscientiousness of a seasoned scholar and has 
      offered many valuable suggestions and rectifications. His knowledge of 
      both the Pàli and the Chinese languages is really a precious asset that 
      commands respect and makes his advice highly valuable.</P>
      <P>As always, the Nava Nàlandà Mahàvihàra with its peaceful atmosphere and 
      its rich library offers me a veritable sanctuary where I can devote all my 
      time to research works and studies, undisturbed and unhindered. May its 
      Director, its staff and its inmates receive here the expressions of my 
      thanks.</P>
