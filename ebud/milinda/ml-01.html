      <P>Aims and structure of the present work</B>: </P>
      </FONT>
      <P>But unfortunately, most of the above work, such as those in German, 
      French and Japanese, are not easily available to the scholars and students 
      of Buddhist literature in India. My present work is an attempt to fill 
      this lacuna, and present a fresh and systematic comparative study of the P 
      and of the C texts. It gives an exhaustive and detailed study of the two 
      texts, and places side by side all the corresponding C and P passages, at 
      the same time taking notes of all similarities and dissimilarities between 
      the two versions. Thus the readers have all the data before them and will 
      be able to formulate their own conclusion, if such is their desire. In 
      addition to this, my work is also a probe into the anteriority of the P 
      and the C texts, by making use of the conclusions in some of my 
      predecessors&#39; works which (unfortunately not many) are at my disposal, and 
      also by quoting all internal and external evidences available so as to 
      prove my standpoint and conclusion upon this problem. Up to now, we can 
      affirm with certainty that the original of the Chinese text is earlier 
      than the Pàli text, as proved in the chapter: &quot;<I>A probe into the 
      anteriority and fidelity of the P and the C versions</I>.&quot; (See infra 
      p.24-35)</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">-ooOoo-</P>
      <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">I. POINTS IN COMMON IN THE P AND THE C VERSIONS </P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>A comparative study of the P <I>Milindapañha</I> and the C <I>
      Na-hsien-pi-ch&#39;iu ching</I> shows clearly that both versions derive from 
      the same source as they have many points in common between them.</P>
      <P>Except for the accounts of the previous lives of Milinda and Nàgasena, 
      where divergences abound and the last four books of the P text, which are 
      not available in the C version, the remaining passages can be said to be 
      similar, barring some additions and omissions here and there; the trend of 
      the dialogues is almost identical, the dialogues veer round the same 
      theme, with unimportant divergences scattered unevenly.</P>
      <P>Even in the widely divergent accounts of the previous lives of Nàgasena 
      and Milinda, seven points of similarities between the two versions are 
      listed below, thus showing unmistakably the same source from which the 
      respective compilers drew their inspirations.</P>
      <P>1. In the Pàli, the novice and the monk both made vows and they were 
      later born as King Milinda and monk Nàgasena in accordance with their 
      vows. In the Chinese, the Bràhmana who was an elephant in his previous 
      life and the Bràhmana who was a hermit and friend of the first Bràhmana 
      made each a vow and both were born as Na-hsien and Mi-lan, in conformity 
      with their aspirations.</P>
      <P>2. The P mentions Nàgasena&#39;s birth as a son in a Bràhmana family. He 
      was taught the three Vedas and Brahmanical knowledge and did not know the 
      Dhamma and the monks.</P>
      <P>In the C, the elephant was reborn also as the son of Bràhmana family 
      and when he grew up, he did not hear the Buddha-Dharma and did not see the 
      monks. Afterwards, he left the world and studied heretical doctrines.</P>
      <P>3. The P mentions Ven. Rohana who was taken to task by Ven. Assagutta 
      for being absent when the whole company went to request God Mahàsena to be 
      born in the world.</P>
      <P>Ven. Assagutta assigned to him the duties of going to Nàgasena&#39;s 
      parents&#39; house to beg for alms for seven years and a half and to draw 
      Nàgasena away from the household life and to ordain him.</P>
      <P>In the C text Na-hsien had an uncle called Lou-han, an Arahant who 
      ordained Na-hsien and gave the ten precepts. Lou-han can be identified 
      with Rohana.</P>
      <P>4. The P mentions Arahant Assagutta who dwelt at Vattaniya hermitage 
      and under whom, Nàgasena passed three months of the rainy season. The C 
      speaks of a Buddhist temple called Ho-ch&#39;an in which dwelt 500 Arahant 
      monks having for leader Ven. O-po-yueh,whose temple Na-hsien resorted to. 
      Thus Vattaniya hermitage can be equated with Ho-ch&#39;an Buddhist temple and 
      Arahant Assagutta with Arahant O-po-yueh.</P>
      <P>5. In the P, Nàgasena preached the Abhidhamma to the lady-disciple and 
      both the preacher and the listener attained the Sotapatti stage to the 
      great joy of Assagutta who said that Nàgasena had hit two quarries with an 
      arrow-shot.</P>
      <P>In the C, Na-hsien preached the Dharma to a layman devotee and both 
      also attained the stage of stream-winner and Na-hsien was praised by Ven. 
      O-po-yueh as having hit two targets with one arrow-shot.</P>
      <P>6. In the P, Ven. Dhammarakkhita blamed Nàgasena on his failure to 
      attain Arahantship. On that very night, Nàgasena strove hard and attained 
      Arahantship. In the C, Na-hsien was expelled from the Sangha owing to his 
      disobedience to his teacher&#39;s order, and out of repentence he strove hard 
      and attained arahantship.</P>
      <P>7. In the P, after his attainment of Arahantship, Nàgasena went to the 
      city of Sàgala and stayed at Sankheyya hermitage to challenge King 
      Milinda; in the C, Na-hsien came to the country of She-chieh and stayed at 
      Hsieh-chih (or ti)-chia temple to challenge King Mi-lan.</P>
      <P>From the above seven points of similarities, we might come to the 
      conclusion that although so many details differ, both versions derive from 
      the same source of documentation and have a common background, that is the 
      original of the C and the P translations.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">-ooOoo-</P>
      <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">II. POINTS OF DIFFERENCE </P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>But the points of difference are far more interesting and important as 
      they show the trend in the mind of the compilers, the objectives they are 
      aiming at in these accretions and omissions, thereby helping to detect the 
      sects they belong to and serve as a probe into the question of anteriority 
      and nearness to the original of each version.</P>
      <B>
      <P>A. TITLES</P>
      </B><I>
      <P>C: Na-hsien-pi-ch&#39;iu-ching: Na-hsienbhikshusùtra</P>
      <P>P: Milindapañho: The Questions of Milinda</I>.</P>
      <P>Thus the C classifies this text as one among the sùtras, although it 
      does not begin with the traditional &quot;<I>Evam me suta</I>m&quot;. Here the C 
      selects the name of the monk to be the title of the text, while the P 
      prefers that of the king.</P>
      <B>
      <P>B. PLAN OF THE WORK: </P>
      </B>
      <P>The C text comprises three books, the first book from page 52a to 
      p.57a, the second from p.57a to p.61b; the third book from p.61b to p.64b, 
      without any headings, endings and divisions into paragraphs, except at the 
      end and at the beginning of a book.</P>
      <P>The P text is divided into seven parts: </P>
      <P>Part 1: Bàhirakathà or introduction with the account of the previous 
      lives of Nàgasena and Milinda, from p. 1 to p. 24.</P>
      <P>Part 2: comprises Lakkhanapañha from p. 25 to p. 64.</P>
      <P>Part 3: Vimaticchedanapañha from p.65 to p.89</P>
      <P>Part 4: Mendakapañha from p.90 to p. 328.</P>
      <P>Part 5: Anumànapañha from p. 329 to p. 347.</P>
      <P>Part 6: Dhutangapañha from p.348 to p. 362</P>
      <P>Part7: Opammakathàpañha and Milinda&#39;s Arahantship from p.362 to p.420</P>
      <P>Thus the C version omits Parts 4 to 7 of the Pàli Version.</P>
      <B>
      <P>C. DIALOGUES</P>
      <P>(a) Number</P>
      </B>
      <P>According to the ingenious chart drawn by Dr. Kogen Mizuno, the C has 
      only 69 dialogues while the P adds 12 dialogues more in its own version:
      </P>
      <P>1. Dial. No. 3 (P.M.P.,p.32) on Manasikàro which is considered as one 
      of the factors leading to emancipation.</P>
      <P>2. Dial. No. 18: (P.M.,p.48), in which conditions for not being reborn 
      are enumerated.</P>
      <P>3. Dial. No.23: (P.M.P.,p.50), on the impossibility of knowing the 
      beginning in the past.</P>
      <P>4. Dial. No. 25: (P.M.P.,p.52) on the rise of sankhàra not without 
      conditions.</P>
      <P>5. Dial. No. 32: (P.M.P.,p62) on the characteristic of vinnànam.</P>
      <P>6. Dial. No. 34: (P.M.P.,p.62) on the characteristic of vicàra.</P>
      <P>7. Dial. No. 48: (P.M.P.,p.71), on Dhammas seen by Nàgasena.</P>
      <P>8. Dial. No. 51: (P.M.P., p.72) on the absence of any being 
      transmigrating from one body to the other.</P>
      <P>9. Dial. No. 62: (P.M.P.,p.77), on the dwelling place of Panna.</P>
      <P>10. Dial. No. 63: (P.M.P., p.77), on the meaning of transmigration.</P>
      <P>11. Dial. No. 65: (P,M.P., p.78), on the rise of Sati either by 
      abhijànantà or by katumikà.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(b) Order of the Dialogues: </P>
      </B>
      <P>The Order of the dialogues can be said to be identical, except in two 
      instances: 1) The C places <I>faith</I> before <I>precepts</I>, while the 
      P puts <I>Sìla</I> before <I>addha.</I> Again, the dialogue on <I>the 
      omniscience of the</I> <I>Buddha</I> is placed farther in the P version.</P>
      <B>
      <P>D. PREVIOUS LIVES OF NàGASENA AND MILINDA</P>
      <P>(a) Divergences</P>
      </B>
      <P>The account of the previous lives of Nàgasena and Milinda are totally 
      different in both versions, as testified by the following divergences: </P>
      <P>1. The P places the story in the time of Kassapa Buddha and refers to a 
      novice who was heedless of the order given three times by a monk, and 
      received a blow of the broom-stick from the latter. The novice, while 
      crying and performing his duties, made his first aspiration to become 
      powerful and glorious like a midday sun.</P>
      <P>Again, when he saw the mighty waves of the Ganges bellowing and rushing 
      forth, he made a second aspiration to be able to carry away all the 
      debates like the billows of the Ganges. Due to these aspirations, the 
      novice was reborn as Milinda, King of Sàgala in India.</P>
      <P>The monk, when going down to the river to take bath and on hearing the 
      novice&#39;s aspiration, also made a wish to be able to unravel and solve any 
      puzzles asked by this young novice. Due to this aspiration, the monk was 
      later born as Nàgasena.</P>
      <P>The C is totally different here. It traces the past up to the time of 
      the present Buddha only, not up to Kassapa Buddha. It refers to the 
      episode of the Buddha when he was tired by the affluence of his listeners 
      and retired to a secluded place. There he was followed by an elephant-king 
      who also wanted to flee away from the disturbances of his herd.</P>
      <P>The Buddha, knowing the elephant&#39;s mind, preached the Dharma to him and 
      the elephant attended upon the Buddha, sweeping, watering and trampling 
      down the path on which the Enlightened One used to take his walk.</P>
      <P>Later the elephant died and was born as the son of a Bràhmana family 
      who, when grown up, left his family, studied heretical doctrines and 
      stayed in the forest. Near by lived a hermit and both became well 
      acquainted. One of them made a vow to become a recluse and strive after 
      Arahantship and he was reborn as Na-hsien. The other man made a vow to 
      become a king and make all people follow his teachings and he was reborn 
      as King Mi-lan.</P>
      <P>2. In the P, there is a protracted passage which refers to the 
      innumerable company of Arahants asking God Mahàsena to be born into the 
      world so as to defeat King Milinda and protect the Dhamma, Mahàsena&#39;s 
      rebirth as Nàgasena in Brahmana Sonuttara&#39;s family, his study of Vedic and 
      Brahmanical lores, Ven. Rohana&#39;s assignment to initiate Nàgasena into the 
      religious life and into the Dhamma, Rohana&#39;s begging for alms for seven 
      years and ten months, his meeting with Nàgasena, his ordaining Nàgasena as 
      a novice and his teaching the Abhidhamma to Nàgasena.</P>
      <P>In the C, it mentions simply that Na-hsien, at the age of 14 or 15, had 
      a paternal uncle named Lou-han who was an Arahant and possessor of psychic 
      powers. Na-hsien came to see him, told him of his delight in the Buddha 
      doctrine and begged for ordination. Lou-han pitied Na-hsien and ordained 
      him as a sàmanera.</P>
      <P>Na-hsien daily recited the doctrine, pondered over the Dharma and 
      Vinaya, attained the four dhyànas and grasped the essence of the doctrine. 
      Here there is no mention of teaching first the Abhidharma to Nàgasena.</P>
      <P>3. In the P, Nàgasena preached to the lady-devotee the deep Abhidhamma 
      and the doctrine related to emptiness (sunnatà), while in the C, Na-hsien 
      preached to a layman-disciple first about charity, morality, heaven. Then 
      when he found that the layman was glad at heart, he preached to him the 
      deeper Dharma, that all impermanent Dharmas were liable to suffering. Here 
      also, there is no mention of Abhidharma.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(b) Passages missing in either version: </P>
      </B>
      <P>In either version, there are certain passages and details missing: </P>
      <B>
      <P>Not available in the C text: </P>
      </B>
      <P>1. The monk and the novice were born and reborn in countless existences 
      as gods and men between Buddha Kassapa and Buddha Gotama and the latter 
      had predicted about them as he had predicted about Moggaliputta Tissa, 
      that 500 years after the Buddha&#39;s Parinibbàna, these two would appear in 
      the would, propound the Dhamma and help disentangling knotty points of the 
      doctrine.</P>
      <P>2. The P refers to the six heretical teachers and the conversation of 
      King Milinda with Pùrana Kassapa and Makkhali Gosàla, whose replies did 
      not satisfy the king and made him proclaim that all Jambudìpa was empty of 
      recluses and Bràhmanas capable of holding discussion with him.</P>
      <P>3. The C text is also silent about the episode beginning with the 
      company of Arahants begging God Mahàsena to be born in the world so as to 
      challenge King Milinda and protect the doctrine, and also about the 
      episode in which Ven. Rohana is described to have gone for seven years and 
      ten months to Bràmana Sonuttara&#39;s house and to have taught the Abhidhamma.</P>
      <P>4. Five times the P mentions the Abhidhamma, first in the introductory 
      gàthà where Nàgasena was mentioned as an expert in Abhidhamma, secondly 
      when Rohana taught Nàgasena the seven books on Abhidhamma from 
      Dhammasangani up to Patthàna, thirdly when Nàgasena recited to the company 
      of Arahants the seven Abhidhamma texts in full, to the thunderous applause 
      of Brahmà God and the shower of Mandàrava flowers. Again Nàgasena preached 
      the Abhidhamma to the lady-devotee and both attained the Sotapatti stage. 
      Last of all, Nàgasena on his way to Pàtaliputta expounded the Abhidhamma 
      to the merchant who played the host to him.</P>
      <P>5. Nàgasena, while accompanying his teacher in his begging round, 
      mentally blamed his teacher of being empty-headed and foolish to have 
      taught him first the Abhidhamma and due to that, he was told by his 
      teacher to go and challenge King Milinda so as to atone for his unholy 
      thoughts.</P>
      <P>6. Nàgasena went to Ven. Dhammarakkhita in Pàtaliputta to study the 
      three Pitakas under him, and within three months he mastered the whole of 
      it.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Not available in the P text</B>: </P>
      <P>There are certain passages which are missing in the P text but 
      available in the C text: </P>
      <P>1. Missing in the P text are the story of the present Buddha and the 
      elephant seeking solitude (which is reminiscent of the story of the monks 
      of Kosambi), the story of the elephant who, after the Buddha&#39;s demise, 
      came to the temple to listen to the recital of the doctrine, his rebirth 
      in a Bràhmana family, his growth into a youth who did not hear the 
      Buddha-doctrine and did not see the monks, his adoption of a hermit life, 
      his acquaintance with another hermit, their vows and their being born as 
      Na-hsien and Mi-lan.</P>
      <P>2. Na-hsien&#39;s expulsion from the Sangha due to his disobedience to his 
      teacher&#39;s order,his repentance, his striving for and attainment of 
      Arahanthood and his rehabilitation into the Order are not found in the P 
      text.</P>
      <P>3. After his Arahanthood, Na-hsien&#39;s preaching tour from village to 
      village, from town to town, the spiritual attainment of his audience, the 
      welcome he received not only from men but also from Inda, Brahmà etc.... 
      these details are missing in the P text.</P>
      <P>Thus the accounts of the previous lives of Nàgasena and Milinda differ 
      widely in both versions, although points in common are not lacking. The 
      moderation in the C version speaks highly for its originality and we have 
      reason to believe that the original version was altered by the P compilers 
      to suit their own doctrine and school.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(E) DIFFERENCES IN DETAILS</P>
      </B>
      <P>In the attitudes of the personages, in the quotations of the places, 
      rivers, distances, there are some differences in the two versions, and 
      some of them are listed below: </P>
      <P>I. In the P, King Milinda, after having sent a messenger, came to see 
      Elder àyupàla along with 500 Yonakas; in the C, first Ven. Ye-ho-lo was 
      invited to come and meet King Mi-lan. The monk replied that the king 
      should come but not he; and the king came along with 500 attendants.</P>
      <P>2. In the P, the king, after having sent a messenger, came himself with 
      500 Yonakas to pay a visit to Nàgasena; in the C, King Mi-lan sent an 
      invitation to Na-hsien to come to the place, and Na-hsien accepted the 
      invitation and came himself with a retinue.</P>
      <P>3. In the P, King Milinda himself detected Nàgasena sitting in the 
      middle of the Sangha and he rejoiced to have recognised Nàgasena without 
      any help: in the C, it was the king who asked the minister: &quot;<I>Who is 
      Na-hsien</I>?&quot; and when the minister pointed out the monk to him, King 
      Mi-lan said that his guess was right.</P>
      <P>4. The C starts the conversation between the king and the monk, first 
      with Na-hsien preaching the Dharma to King Mi-lan without the latter 
      asking him. He preached that the Buddha doctrine proclaimed that <I>men&#39;s 
      safety was the highest profit; men&#39;s contentment was the greatest wealth, 
      men&#39;s faith was the highest blessing and Nirvàna was the highest 
      happiness.</I> The P omits this passage and starts the conversation with 
      King Milinda asking about Nàgasena&#39;s name.</P>
      <P>5. On the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> day of the convesation, the C mentions that 
      Na-hsien was accompanied by 80 monks including Ven. Yeh-ho-lo, while the P 
      refers up to 80.000 monks and omits àyupàla. In the C, it was 
      Chan-mi-li-wang-ch&#39;un, who came alone to Na-hsien and asked Na-hsien some 
      questions, while the P mentions the coming of Devamantiya, Anantakàya and 
      Mankura and it was Anantakàya who asked questions.</P>
      <P>6. The second reception of King Milinda to Nàgasena is almost the same 
      in both versions, except that in the C, King Mi-lan paid homage to 
      Na-hsien and after the meal, offered to each monk a robe with a pair of 
      sandals, and to Na-hsien and Yeh-ho-lo a set of three robes and a pair of 
      sandals. And when only ten monks remained behind with Na-hsien, Mi-lan 
      ordered his lady-folks to sit behind a curtain and witness the 
      conversation.</P>
      <P>The P omits the offering of sandals, the presence of àyupàla and that 
      of the lady-folks. It adds that King Milinda took a lower seat and sat 
      down.</P>
      <P>7. The C quotes five rivers: (a) Heng, (b) Hsin-t&#39;a, (c) Ssu-t&#39;a, (d) 
      Po-ch&#39;a, (e) Shih-p&#39;i-i, while the P quotes Gangà, Yamunà, Aciravati, 
      Sarabhù and Mahì. Dr. Kogen Mizuno identifies the five rivers quoted in 
      the C version as Gangà, Sindhù, Sità, Vakshù and Sarasvatì. These five 
      except the Gangà, are the great rivers which flow through N. W. India, 
      while four of the five rivers mentioned in the P are flowing through the 
      Eastern parts of India.</P>
      <P>8. The C mentions that a big rock like the king&#39;s palace takes six 
      months to reach the earth if dropped from the seventh Brahmà heaven, while 
      the P mentions that if a rock like a Kùtàgàra falls down from the 
      Brahmà-heaven, at a speed of 48.000 yojanas day and night, it takes four 
      months to reach this earth. </P>
      <P>The C mentions A-li-san as distant from She-chieh of 2000 yu-hsùn 
      (yojana), while the P mentions that Alasanda island is distant from Sàgala 
      about 200 yojanas.</P>
      <P>The discrepancy in the distance between the P and the C versions makes 
      W.W. Tarn remark that the C translation altered the locality of Menander&#39;s 
      birth, making Alasanda as 2000 yojanas from Sàgala instead of 200. He 
      complains as unfortunate that a number of French scholars (Pelliot, 
      Deùmieùville, Finot, Grousset, Leùvi) should have championed this against 
      the P version. According to him, the C translator had never heard of 
      Alexandria of the Caucasus and knew only of Alexandria in Egypt and 
      altered 200 yojanas to 2000 accordingly. But on the same page (Note 4), 
      Tarn remarks that the name Alasanda occurs three times in Part II (Pàli 
      text p.327, 321 and 269) and in the last passage, it is Alexandria in 
      Egypt beyond question, while the other two passages mention Alexandria of 
      the Caucasus. Whatever it might be, at least Tarn concedes that once 
      Alexandria might have belonged to Egypt.</P>
      <P>Again the C mentions Mi-lan being born as a prince, while the P refers 
      to Milinda as being born at Kalasigàma (in a village). So Tarn opines that 
      Menander was born as a commoner but the C translator turned him into a 
      prince.</P>
      <P>As to Nagasena, the C mentions him as being born in a village called 
      Kajangala under the Himàlàya while the C mentions Chi-pin (Kashmir) as 
      being his place of birth. Mr. Tarn seems to place too much trust in the 
      fidelity of the P version. But our present study shows that alterations 
      and interpolations are galore in the P version and it is not without 
      reason that the French scholars favour the C version.</P>
      <P>Anyhow, the Milindapañha, being a book &quot;<I>of didactic ethics and 
      religious controversy cast into the form of historical romance</I>&quot; should 
      not be referred to as historical evidence and we all are aware that we 
      should not expect much historical data from our Milindapañha.</P>
      <P>Again Chi-pin is mentioned as 720 li distant in the C, while the P 
      mentions only 12 yojanas being the distance between Kashmir and Sàgala. 
      Further the C speaks of bones of 4000 li long and a big fish called Chih 
      of 28.000 li long, but the P mentions only 100 leagues and 500 leagues 
      respectively.</P>
      <P>9. When the conversation came to an end, according to the C version, 
      Na-hsien said that it was past midnight and he wanted to go. Then the king 
      ordered his attendants to have four rolls of cloth dipped in oil to serve 
      as torch and see Na-hsien to his place, with all due respect to Na-hsien 
      as if to himself, saying that with a teacher like Na-hsien and a disciple 
      like himself, the realization of the Dharma would be quick, as all his 
      questions were given suitable answers by Na-hsien.</P>
      <P>Here the P first adds Nàgasena&#39;s enquiry as to the time and the king 
      replied that, the first watch had passed, the second watch was ushered in, 
      the torches were lit, the four banners were raised and the gift from the 
      king would come from the treasury. Here the P adds that the Yonakas 
      praised, Nàgasena as a pandita and the king approved of their praises 
      saying that with such a teacher as Nàgasena, and such a disciple as 
      himself, a scholar would realize the Dhamma before long.</P>
      <P>10. The king was pleased and ordered clothes worthy of 10.000 (golden 
      coins) to be offered to Na-hsien from the treasury and informed him that 
      from now on, he together with 800 monks, would be invited to take their 
      daily meals in the palace and provided with what they desired.</P>
      <P>The P is almost the same, but it refers not to 800 monks but to 800 
      meals (atthasatabhattam). The P adds the king&#39;s saying that if he were to 
      adopt the religious life, he would not live long because he had many 
      enemies.</P>
      <P>11. At the end, the C mentions Na-hsien&#39;s departure and the king paying 
      homage to the monk. The P omits both but mentions instead that both great 
      men praised each other.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(F) DIFFERENCES IN DOCTRINES</B>: </P>
      <P>Differences in doctrines are found scattered here and there in both 
      versions, and they are interesting and important as they reveal the sect 
      of the compilers and the age of the texts in question.</P>
      <B>
      <P>1. Abhidhamma: </B>Throughout the three books in the C version, not 
      even for once is Abhidharma mentioned. On the contrary, within the first 
      three books of the P version, Abhidhamma is mentioned eight times: </P>
      <P>(i) In the introductory gàthà, Nàgasena is mentioned as an expert in 
      Abhidhamma</P>
      <P>(ii) Rohana taught Nàgasena the seven books on Abhidhamma from 
      Dhammasanganì up to Patthànà.</P>
      <P>(iii) Nàgasena recited to the company of Arahants the seven Abhidhamma 
      texts in full to the thunderous applause of Brahmà gods and the shower of 
      Mandàrava flowers.</P>
      <P>(iv) Nàgasena preached the Abhidhamma to the lady-devotee and both 
      obtained the Sotapanna stage.</P>
      <P>(v) On his way to Pàtaliputta, Nàgasena expounded the Abhidhamma to the 
      merchant who played host to him.</P>
      <P>(vi) Nàgasena referred to Abhidhamma in his answer to Anantakàya&#39;s 
      question with such effect that the latter became a lay-disciple.</P>
      <P>(vii) Nàgasena again refers to Abhidhamma classification of 108 kinds 
      of feelings.</P>
      <P>(viii) Nàgasena explained the non-existence of the soul with reference 
      to the Abhidhamma exposition.</P>
      <P>Again the P speaks of the seven <I>Sabbacitasàdhàranà cetasikà,</I> 
      such as<I> phasso, vedanà, sannà, cetanà, ekaggatà, jivitindriyam, 
      manasikàro,</I> which can be found only in the P Abhidhamma, as other 
      sects do not accept <I>Jivitindriyam</I> to be classified as <I>
      sabbacittasàdhàranàcetasikà</I>.</P>
      <B>
      <P>2. The 37 Bodhipakkhiyas: </P>
      </B>
      <P>The C has given the 37 factors of enlightenment which are almost the 
      same as the usual Pàli ones, but their definitions are not exactly the 
      same. Thus the <I>cattàro satipatthànà</I> can be said to be almost 
      similar to the P ones, but for the <I>four sammappadhàn</I>à, the C 
      translates as<I> Ssu-i-tuan</I>, <I>the four eradications of the mind,</I> 
      due to the confusion between <I>pradhàna and prahàna.</P>
      </I>
      <P>The definition is rather curious: &quot;The Buddha said: &quot; <I>Having 
      analysed the four resting places of the mind, one would not think of any 
      further, this is called the four eradications of the mind.&quot;</I> Thus it is 
      far different from the usual P definitions for <I>sammappadhàna.</P>
      </I>
      <P>The same can be said of the four psychic powers which the C defines as: 
      &quot;<I>The eyes can see everything; the ears can hear everything; the mind 
      knows others&#39; mind; the body can fly&quot;, </I>which differs greatly from the 
      usual P<I> chandiddhipàdo, cittidhipàdo, viriyiddhipàdo and 
      vìmansiddhipàdo.</P>
      </I>
      <P>Again the <I>five faculties and the five powers</I> are also not the 
      same. The five faculties, are defined as<I> &quot;not attachment of the mind to 
      good and bad shapes, sounds, odours, tastes, touches; the five powers</I>, 
      defined as <I>control of eyes, ears, nose, mouth, body&quot;</I>, which are 
      different from the P <I>Saddhindriyam, viriyindriyam, satindriyam 
      samàdhindritam</I>, <I>pannindriyam, saddhàbalam, viriyabalam, satibalam, 
      samàdhibalam, pannàbalam.</P>
      </I>
      <P>As for the <I>seven factors of wisdom</I>, the C enumerates as follows: 
      (a) i (<I>mind</I>) for <I>sati</I>. (b) kho (<I>joy</I>) for <I>Piti,</I> 
      (c) i (<I>serenity</I>) for <I>passaddhi</I>, (d) hu (<I>protection</I>) 
      for <I>upekkh</I>à, the remaining three are the same with the P. The 
      Eight-fold Path is almost the same in both versions except that the C uses 
      the term <I>straight</I> for the P term <I>samm</I>à and<I> fang-pien</I> 
      (means) for the P <I>vàyàmo.</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>3. Paticcasamuppàda or the Dependent Origination: </P>
      </B>
      <P>It is almost the same in both versions, but the terminology adopted in 
      the C is not so clear-cut and somewhat unusual for some expressions. They 
      are as follows in the C: (i) <I>ignorance</I>, (ii) <I>spirit (sheùn)</I>, 
      (iii) <I>body</I>, (iv) <I>name</I>, (v) <I>form</I>, (vi) <I>the six 
      knowledges</I>, (vii) <I>their touches with their respective objects</I>, 
      (viii) <I>knowledge of pain and happiness.</I> (ix) <I>attachment, 
      craving,</I> (x) <I>lust and, desire</I>, (xi) <I>becoming</I>, (xii) <I>
      birth, </I>(xiii) <I>old age,</I> (xiv) <I>disease,</I> (xv) <I>death</I> 
      (xvi) <I>lamentation</I>, (xvii) <I>grief</I> (xviii) <I>inner despair</I>.
      </P>
      <P>If we put <I>name</I> and <I>form</I> together, <I>old age, disease, 
      death, lamentation, grief, inner despair</I> together, it comes to the 
      same number twelve as in the P. </P>
      <P>The C <I>soul</I> for <I>sankhàra</I>, <I>body</I> for <I>vinnàna</I>m,
      <I>six knowledges</I> for <I>salàyatana</I>m, <I>lust and desire</I> for
      <I>upàdàna</I>m are rather forceful and show that the C translator was not 
      yet acquainted with the exact rendering in C of these terms at the time of 
      the compilation of the C text. </P>
      <P>Again, this law is explained in the negative order as follows in the C: 
      &quot;<I>The wise men, who had learned the Dharma, did not cling to the 
      internal and external body, had no craving. Having no craving, they had no 
      sense-desires. Without sense-desires, there was no pregnancy in the womb. 
      Without pregnancy in the womb, there were no birth, no old age. Having no 
      birth no old age, there were no sichness, no death, Having no sickness, 
      (no death), they had no grief, no lamentation. Having no grief, no 
      lamentation, they had no inner pain, they obtained Nirvàna</I>.&quot; </P>
      <P>Again here we remark that the C formula is still in a fluid condition, 
      not yet solidified into an unyielding shape. This is starting somewhere in 
      the middle and we have similar cases in the Mahànidànasutta of the Dìgha, 
      vol.II. </P>
      <P>Also in Visuddhimagga, Chapter XVII, we have different methods of 
      contemplation upon this law. We may begin at the middle and go backward or 
      forward, or we may commence with the last and go backward (patiloma), as 
      we can go forward (anuloma).</P>
      <B>
      <P>4. Vedanà or feelings: </P>
      </B>
      <P>The P refers to the Abhidhamma classification of 108 kinds of feelings; 
      but the C omits the Abhidhamma reference and classifies them as follows: 
      (i) <I>six things arousing internal joyful feelings in men</I>; (ii)<I> 
      six things arousing external joyful feelings in men</I>; (iii)<I> six 
      internal things arousing internal sorrowful feelings in men;</I> (iv) <I>
      six external things arousing not joyful feelings in men;</I> (v) <I>six 
      things arousing neither sorrowful nor joyful feelings in men;</I> (vi) <I>
      six external things arousing sorrowful feelings in men.</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>5. The three characteristics: </P>
      </B>
      <P>While the P mentions the three characteristics as <I>anicca, dukkha, 
      anatta</I> realized by those who possess wisdom, the C offers a slightly 
      different reading, although the purport is the same.</P>
      <B>
      <P>6. Seven kinds of wisdom</B>: </P>
      <P>The P refers to seven <I>bojjhangas</I>, while the C mentions the 
      following seven: (i) <I>thinking of good and evil things;</I> (ii) <I>
      exertion</I>; (iii) <I>to enjoy the Dharma</I>; (iv) <I>to subdue the mind 
      in doing good</I>; (v) <I>thinking of the Path;</I> (vi) <I>onemindedness</I>; 
      (vii) <I>to meet things</I> without attachment, withouth hatred.</P>
      <B>
      <P>7. Yoniso manasikaro and pannà or Right consideration and wisdom: </P>
      </B>
      <P>The P states that sheep, goats, oxen, buffaloes camels, asses have <I>
      yoniso manasikàro</I> but not <I>pannà; </I>but the C states that oxen, 
      horses, the six domestic animals have wisdom but their heart is different.</P>
      <B>
      <P>8. Nibbàna</B>: </P>
      <P>C: <I>Nieh-pan path</I> (means that) having gone past, there would be 
      no more becoming = P: <I>Nibbànam nirodho ti.</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>9. Saddhà or faith: </P>
      </B>
      <P>In the definition of <I>faith</I>, the C omits its <I>lakkhana</I>, but 
      says simply that <I>faith</I> means <I>without</I> <I>doubts</I> and adds: 
      &quot;<I>Faith in the existence of the Buddhas</I>, <I>the Buddha-dhamma and 
      the Order of monks; faith in the existence of arahants, in the existence 
      of the present world, of the next world; faith in the existence of filial 
      piety towards parents; faith in good remuneration for good actions, in bad 
      remuneration for bad actions.&quot;</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>10. High ordination and wisdom: </P>
      </B>
      <P>As to the dialogue about the Buddha having no teacher, the C says that
      <I>when the Buddha obtained his enlightenment, he knew by himself the 
      Dharma, the Path</I>, unlike his disciples who should learn and know the 
      Buddha&#39;s teachings and practise them till old age. But the P refers to the
      <I>High ordination (Upasampadà</I>) saying that he did not receive High 
      ordination from others in the way the Blessed One laid down the precepts 
      for his disciples to observe till the end of their lives.</P>
      <B>
      <P>11. Sati or mindfulness</B>: </P>
      <P>Both versions enumerate 16 ways from which memory springs up; they are 
      in the same order, but their explanations are not the same and the P adds 
      another extra, the 17th <I>anubhùta</I>, meaning <I>experience</I> 
      although it mentions only 16.</P>
      <B>
      <P>12. Vinnnam, Pannà, Jiva or conciousness, wisdom and life-principle:
      </P>
      </B>
      <P>While the P refers to <I>vinnnam, pannà and jiva</I> in a living being, 
      the C mentions instead <I>the spirit</I> of a man, <I>wisdom and the 
      natural</I>. The C defines these three dharmas as follows: &quot;<I>The spirit 
      of a man knows, wisdom realises the Path and the natural is emptiness, 
      without any individual</I>&quot;. The P defines that the characteristic of <I>
      consciouness is knowledge, that</I> of wisdom is <I>realization and there 
      is no life principle in the living being.</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>(G) SIMILES</P>
      <P>(1) Similarities and dissimilarities.</P>
      </B>
      <P>Similes abound in <I>Milindapañha</I> and <I>Nàgasena</I> <I>bhikshu 
      sutra</I>, and a comparative study of them shows clearly that both 
      versions derive from the same source as they are almost the same. But we 
      notice a deliberate attempt on the part of the compilers not to follow the 
      original blindly, but to add more or less details so as to show their own 
      originality.</P>
      <P>Thus the six similes used by Nàgasena to prove the link between the 
      present nàma-rùpa and the next one, are almost the same in both versions, 
      with the following differences. </P>
      <P>In the 1<SUP>st</SUP> simile: C: <I>fruits of plants </P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>mango fruit.</P>
      </I>
      <P>In the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> simile: C: <I>crops and ripe grains</I> </P>
      <P>=P: <I>rice and sugareane</I>.</P>
      <P>In the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> simile: C: <I>the fire burns walls, rooms, and 
      houses </P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>the fire burns the fields of others.</P>
      </I>
      <P>In the 4<SUP>th</SUP> simile: C <I>a man lights a torch</I>, <I>places 
      it on the wall so that he can eat his food</I>; the torch <I>burns wall, 
      bamboo, wood, house and town</P>
      <P>=P: a man lights a lamp, ascends the pavillion, the lamp burns grass, 
      village.</P>
      </I>
      <P>To illustrate the definition of<I> contact (phassa),</I> three similes 
      are used. The 1<SUP>st</SUP> two similes about the <I>two rams, the two 
      hands clapping each other</I> are the same. In the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> one, the 
      C refers to <I>two stones</I>, while the P mentions <I>two cymbals (samà)</I>.</P>
      <P>Again the simile of a treasurer who opens a king&#39;s treasure is almost 
      the same in both versions, except that the objects seen are different. </P>
      <P>C: <I>Coins, gold, silver, gem, jade, silken fabrics, cotton, mixed 
      scents, mixed colours </P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>Treasures of the king, of blue, yellow, red, white, crimson 
      colours</I>.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(2) Different explanations.</P>
      </B>
      <P>Sometimes, the explanations of the similes are not the same. Thus in 
      the simile to illustrate <I>Vicàra</I>, the P refers to <I>a copper vessel 
      which is beaten (àkotitam) and produces a humming sound (anuravati); when 
      it is beaten, it is initial thought: when it produces sound, it is 
      sustained thought</P>
      </I>
      <P>=C: <I>When the copper plate is put into fire by a man, there is sound; 
      when he raises his hand (?), there is sound; thus when there is thought, 
      there is inner move.</P>
      </I>
      <P>Again there is a slight difference in the interpretation of the simile 
      about the <I>impossibility of pointing out bad and good actions</I>, the C 
      wants to show that those who are not yet emancipated cannot point out the 
      position of good and bad actions, so in the simile, it shows that when the 
      fruits are not yet formed, it is impossible for anyone to foretell that 
      this branch has no fruits.</P>
      <P>The P also wants to show that it is impossible to point out the 
      position of good and bad actions, but in the simile, it shows that when 
      the fruits are not yet formed, it is impossible to point out the position 
      of the fruits in such and such a place.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(3) P with more details.</P>
      </B>
      <P>Instances are not rare when the P offers more details than the C. Thus 
      the P refers to the simile of <I>wheat-reapers, who with their left hand 
      take hold of the wheat and with a sickle in their right hand, cut the 
      wheat</I> to illustrate that the recluse with <I>right consideration 
      (yoniso manasikàro) takes hold of the mind and by wisdom, cuts off his 
      depravities.</P>
      </I>
      <P>But the C, while quoting the same simile, mentions simply that people 
      endowed with wisdom eradicate craving and sense-desire just like wheat 
      reapers.</P>
      <P>Again both versions resort to four similes to illustrate that <I>good 
      qualities depend upon Sìla or morality as foundation</I>. They are not in 
      the same order and the P offers more details. </P>
      <P>C1=P2; C2=P1; C3=P3; C4=P4. </P>
      <P>Thus in C3=P3, the C mentions simply that if an architect wants to 
      build a big town, first he should measure and lay the foundation, then he 
      would be able to build the town. But the P mentions more details, such as
      <I>clearing the place where the town is located, the removal of all stumps 
      and thorns, the levelling of the earth, then the laying out of streets, 
      squares, cross-roads, </I>etc. and so he builds the city.</P>
      <P>About <I>volition</I>, both versions refer to the same similes about <I>
      a man drinking poison and causing others to drink</I>, about his bad 
      actions and inducing others to perform bad actions. But here the P adds 
      two more similes, the case of a man <I>who drinks ghee, butter, oil, 
      honey, mollasses and causes others to drink</I>, and the case of a man who 
      performs good actions and induces others to do the same.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(4) C with more details.</P>
      </B>
      <P>Sometimes the opposite is witnessed, that the C offering more details. 
      Thus in the first simile about <I>exertion</I>, the P speaks of <I>a 
      falling house</I>, the C adds one more instance, that <I>of a wall on the 
      verge</I> of <I>collapsing</I>. In the dialogue about wisdom, the C adds 
      the simile of <I>a man cutting down a tree with a knife</I> to show that 
      wisdom is like a sharp knife cutting down demeritorious dharmas.</P>
      <P>We can see that the same source inspires the C and the P compilers as 
      to the similes to illustrate the explanations. But the compilers seem not 
      to content themselves with a faithful reproduction of the original. They 
      added new similes to be more convincing, reduced some which looked rather 
      out of the mark, and resorted to new materials to suit the local colour, 
      thus bringing about all these differences which we find in the similies of 
      the tow versions.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(H) GÀTHÀ AND QUOTATIONS</P>
      <P>1) Gàthà.</P>
      </B>
      <P>As far as gàthas are concerned, we can say that there is no gàthà in 
      the C version. The P contains ten gàthàs within the first three books, six 
      gàthas having no corresponding passages in the C version, and four gàthas 
      having the C corresponding prose passages.</P>
      <P>The following six gàthas are not found in the C version: </P>
      <P>(i). A gàtha in which Milinda and Nàgasena are introduced with their 
      outstanding qualities at the beginning of the text.</P>
      <P>(ii). A gàthà in praise of Nàgasena&#39;s fine qualities and learning and 
      announcing his staying at Sankheyya hermitage.</P>
      <P>(iii). A gàthà describing Milinda&#39;s forebodings in the presence of 
      Nàgasena.</P>
      <P>(iv). Sister Vajirà&#39;s gàtha about the conventional name of a cart and 
      of a living being quoted by Nàgasena in support of his explanation.</P>
      <P>(v). Two gàthas put together, quoted by Nàgasena as spoken by the 
      Buddha in praise of Sìla which is the foundation upon which Samàdhi, Pannà 
      and the growth of all good qualities are built up.</P>
      <P>(vi). One gàthà quoted by Nàgasena as spoken by the Blessed One 
      praising the virtue of <I>Saddhà, Appamàda, Viriya and Pannà.</P>
      </I>
      <P>The following four gàthas are put under the gàthà garb by the P text, 
      while the C uses the prose form for them.</P>
      <P>(vii). Sàriputta&#39;s attitude towards death and life.</P>
      <P>(viii). The Buddha&#39;s advice not to be like a carter who engaged the 
      cart in an uneven path and had his axle broken.</P>
      <P>(ix). The Buddha&#39;s admonition describing the body as a place of nine 
      apertures, ill-smelling and impure.</P>
      <P>Thus the gàthàs which cannot be found in the C might be added later on 
      by the P compilers and that the prose form in the C version for the 
      corresponding gàthà in the P version might be considered to bear a stamp 
      of more pronounced antiquity when compared with the P version.</P>
      <B>
      <P>2) Quotations.</P>
      </B>
      <P>As far as quotations are concerned, they are not exactly the same in 
      both versions. Thus speaking about the emptiness of a cart, the C mentions 
      that the Buddha sùtra said that <I>with the coming together of wood, with 
      the necessity of making a carriage, people obtained a carriage.</I> But 
      the P text quotes Sister Vajirà&#39;s gàthà as follows: </P>
      <P>&quot;<I>Yathà hi angasambhàrà hoti saddo ratho iti&quot;<BR>
      &quot;Evam khandhesu santesu hoti satta ti sammuti</I>&quot;</P>
      <P>Again speaking about <I>sati (mindfulness)</I>, the C quotes a sùtra as 
      saying that <I>one should protect and check one&#39;s own mind and the six 
      cravings in the body. With the strict check and holding fast of the mind, 
      one can transcend the world;</P>
      </I>
      <P>But the P mentions that the Blessed One said that mindfulness was 
      useful to all.</P>
      <P>Again explaining the difference among the various types of people, the 
      C quotes the Buddha as saying that <I>in accordance with one&#39;s own bad or 
      good actions, one would reap their result</I>, while the P refers to the 
      Buddha&#39;s words: &quot;<I>Kammassakà mànava sattà, kammadàyàdà, kammayoni, 
      kammabandhù, kammapatisaranà, kammam satte vibhajati, yad idam 
      hinappanìtatàyati.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>Another instance of the difference in the quotations is the passage to 
      illustrate that the body is foul, impure. The C quotes: &quot;<I>The Buddha 
      sùtra said: People have nine apertures like nine wounds caused by spear. 
      The nine apertures are ill smelling and places of impurity.</I>&quot; The P 
      quotation is slightly different: &quot;<I>Covered by living skin, with nine 
      apertures, a big wound, from where completely ooze out impure and 
      ill-smelling things.</I>&quot;</P>
      <P>From these quotations of the same purport but of different wording and 
      details, we can surmise that the C and the P translators and compilers 
      might have quoted from their own sources.</P>
      <P>But another feature is witnessed here in this comparative study of the 
      quotations in the C and the P versions. The C merely quotes: &quot;<I>The 
      Buddha sùtra said&quot;</I>, and in one passage, it refers to <I>Sùtra and 
      Vinaya of the Buddha</I> or rather <I>Dharma and Vinaya of the Buddha.</P>
      </I>
      <P>Here we observe that the C never mentions the Tripitaka or quotes any 
      àgamas. But the P text within the first three books profusely quotes from 
      the Tipitaka, and mentions even the name of the Sutra, the Nìkàya, the 
      seven Abhidhamma books and last of all, the name Tipitaka. Thus the name 
      of <I>Mahàsamayasuttanta, Mahàmangalasuttanta, Samaci-ttapariyàyàsuttanta, 
      Ràhulovàdasuttanta, Paràbhava </I>are mentioned in the P text, 
      respectively at p. 19,20.</P>
      <P>The <I>Samyuttanikàya</I> is quoted at p. 36. The word <I>Abhidhamma</I> 
      is mentioned in the P text at the following pages: 1, 12, 16, 17, 45 and 
      56. The term <I>Abhidhamma</I> books are enumerated at p. 12 from <I>
      Dhammasangani to Patthàna.</P>
      </I>
      <P>Again the term <I>Tipitaka</I> is mentioned at pp. 18 and 21; and at p. 
      1, the three <I>Vinaya, Suttanta</I> and <I>Abhidhamma</I> are quoted. All 
      these show that the P text was compiled at a time when the division into 
      Suttanta, Vinaya and Abhidhamma, and the classification of the Suttas into 
      Nikàyas were already current and more or less solidified.</P>
      <P>The quotation of all the seven books on <I>Abhidhamma</I> signifies 
      that the P version was compiled after the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Council, when the 
      Abhidhamma text were supposed to be collected, and also after the complete 
      growth of the Abhidhamma literature.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">-ooOoo-</P>
      <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">III. THE SCHOOL OR SECT TO WHICH THE P AND THE C 
      VERSIONS BELONG. </P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>It is crystal clear that the P text belong to the Theravàda school, 
      which adopts the Pàli as its language. The quotation of the seven 
      Abhidhamma books, the reference to the seven 
      Sabbacittasàdhà-ranacetasikas, and the stereotyped formula of the 
      Paticcasammuppàda speak out clearly that the P Milindapañha belongs to the 
      Theravàda school.</P>
      <P>But it is really difficult to guess the probable sect of the C text, as 
      there are absolutely no evidences to help us to detect what sect it is 
      likely to belong to. All the proofs above show that the C original was 
      compiled at a time when the growth of the Abhidhamma had not yet matured 
      and that the classification of the Buddha-dharma into àgama or Nikàya was 
      not yet widely adopted.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER">IV. A PROBE INTO THE ANTERIORITY AND FIDELITY OF THE P 
      AND C VERSIONS </P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>With the comparative study of the two versions done above with the main 
      similarities and divergences pointed out and explained, now we have enough 
      data and materials to probe into the anteriority and fidelity of each 
      version.</P>
      <P>Mr. Rhys Davids in his Dialogues of the Buddha, p.x, has expressed his 
      opinion on this subject as follows: &quot;<I>Whether (as M. Sylvian Levy 
      thinks) it ( the Pàli Milindapañha) is an enlarged work built up on the 
      foundation of the Indian original of the C books, or whether (as I am 
      inclined to think) that original is derived from our Milinda...</I>&quot;, thus 
      Mr. Rhy Davids is of the opinion that the P text is earlier than the 
      original from which the C translation is made.</P>
      <P>But he did not elaborate further and advanced no proofs to support his 
      view, except offering a preference and a mere guess. After a close study 
      of the two texts, I am inclined to disagree with Mr. Rhys Davids and 
      subscribe fully to Mr. Sylvian Levy&#39;s opinion. &quot;<I>The P text is nothing 
      but a later enlarged recension of the P translation of the original from 
      which is derived our C text, this original being in Sanskrit or a kind of 
      Prakrit prevalent in N.W. India. Thus the C text can claim to be earlier 
      and closer to the original than its P counterpart.</I>&quot; The following 
      external and internal evidences amply and convincingly speak in favour of 
      the anteriority and fidelity of the C version: </P>
      <P>(1) Anachronism in the P text.<BR>
      (2) P reference to Abhidhamma.<BR>
      (3) P reference to Tipitaka and Nikàya.<BR>
      (4) C formulas of doctrine not yet solidified.<BR>
      (5) C text prior to the formation of schools or sects;<BR>
      (6) Genuineness of the C version.<BR>
      (7) Abundance of miracles in P version.<BR>
      (8) Moderation of the C version.<BR>
      (9) Addition of the last four books in the P version.<BR>
      (10) Divergences between the Roman and the Siamese editions.<BR>
      (11) Divergences between Buddhaghosa&#39;s quotations and the readings of the 
      Milindapañha.<BR>
      (12) The P text is but an enlarged translation.</P>
      <B>
      <P>1. Anachronism in the P Text</B>.</P>
      <P>The P version, by referring to the six heretical teachers and the 
      conversation of King Milinda with Pùrana Kassapa and Makkhali Gosàla 
      commits a gross anachronism, which is condemned even by Rhys Davids as: &quot;
      <I>And the plagiarism is all the more inartistic as the old names are 
      retained, and no explanation is given of their being born twice at an 
      interval of 500 years...</I>&quot;</P>
      <P>The six heretical teachers who were contempora-ry of the Buddha could 
      not possibly live long enough to enter into philosophical conversation 
      with our King Milinda.</P>
      <P>Some scholars tried to explain away this glaring anachronism by saying 
      that these persons were only the six teachers&#39;disciples, who happened to 
      bear the same name with their teacher&#39;s, However ingenious this argument 
      might appear at first glance to be, it cannot stand a close scrutiny.</P>
      <P>We can concede the possibility of one disciple bearing the same name 
      with his teacher, but with no stretch of imagination can we picture that 
      six disciples holding together the same with their respective six teachers 
      assembled together a century later to propound the doctrine of their 
      teachers to King Milinda.</P>
      <P>Morever, it is clear that the Pàli compilers wanted to re-enact the 
      meeting of King Ajàtasattu with the six heretical teachers in 
      Sàmannaphalasutta with Milinda and Nàgasena playing the role of Ajàtasattu 
      and the Buddha respectively. The omission of this obvious anachronism in 
      the C text speaks strongly in favour of the originality of the C version.</P>
      <B>
      <P>2. Pàli references to Abhidhamma</B>: </P>
      <P>The absence of any reference to the Abhidhammapitaka in the C text 
      scores another point in favour of the originality of the C version. The P 
      within the first three books, mentions as many as eight times the 
      Abhidhamma literature. As the growth of the Abhidhamma literature was 
      rather late when compared with that of the Suttapitaka and the 
      Vinayapitaka, the C version with the total absence of any reference to 
      Abhidhamma convincingly strikes an earl note,earlier than its P 
      counterpart.</P>
      <P>Here we can infer that at the time of the compilation of the P.M.P., 
      the position of the Abhidhamma was not yet strongly consolidated; so its 
      sponsors had to strengthen its position by even relegating the Suttanta to 
      the background.</P>
      <P>Thus Nàgasena started first with the study of the Abhidhamma; and only 
      after he had realized the anomaly of such a programme did he come to study 
      the Suttanta under Ven. Dhammarakkhita. Again when he preached the Dharma 
      to the lady-devotee and to the merchant, he bypassed the Suttanta and 
      preached to them the Abhidhamma.</P>
      <B>
      <P>3. P References to the Tipitaka and Nikàya: </P>
      </B>
      <P>As seen above the P has quoted the term Tipitaka at p. 18 and p. 21; 
      and at p. I, all the three Vinaya, Suttanta and Abhidhamma are mentioned. 
      Again the term Samyuttanikàya is quoted at p.36. These quotations show 
      that the P text was compiled at a time when the Buddhavacanas were already 
      classified into Suttanta, Vinaya and Abhidhamma and that the Suttanta was 
      already subdivided into Nikàyas.</P>
      <P>But the C ignores all these references, and mentions only Buddha, 
      Buddhasùtra, or Sùtravinaya thereby showing that it was compiled at a 
      time, very near to the demise of the Buddha, when the above divisions and 
      classification had not yet been in vogue. Thus the C steals another step 
      ahead of the P text, as far as the question of anteriority and fidelity is 
      concerned.</P>
      <B>
      <P>4. Formulas of doctrine</B>: </P>
      <P>The comparative study of sets of doctrine, such as the 
      Paticcasamuppàda, the 37 Bodhipakkhiyà as seen above show that the P 
      formulas have already assumed a codified form, strictly stereotyped, 
      common throughout the Tipitaka. But the C ones are still liable to change 
      and did not reach yet the solidified form of later stages. Thus the C 
      version shows once more the stamp of antiquity and anteriority over the P 
      text.</P>
      <B>
      <P>5. The original of C text might be prior to the formation of Buddhist 
      schools: </P>
      </B>
      <P>This stamp of antiquity of the C text is again enhanced by the fact 
      that the original of the C text might have been composed prior to the 
      formation of the Buddhist schools, because we cannot detect any 
      characteristic in the C text which helps classify it into one of the 20 
      Buddhist schools which sprang up after the demise of the Buddha.</P>
      <P>But it is crystal clear to everyone that the P version belongs to the 
      Theravàda school, with its references to the seven books on Abhidhamma, 
      with its classification of the Cetasikas into seven Sabbcittasàdhàranas 
      etc... Thus the original of the C text can be considered earlier than that 
      of the P text.</P>
      <B>
      <P>6. Genuineness of the C version</P>
      </B>
      <P>Some details in the C, when compared with their P counterparts look far 
      more convincing and genuine than those found in the P version, and this 
      genuineness of the C text tilts further the scale of anteriority and 
      antiquity in its favour.</P>
      <P>(a) In the P, when Nàgasena preached to the lady devotee, he expounded 
      first the Abhidhamma doctrine about <I>Sunnat</I>à , thus ignoring the 
      Suttanta; but the corresponding C passage faithfully reflects the very 
      teachings preached by the Buddha in his early days of setting the Dharma 
      in motion. Na-hsien preached as follows: &quot;<I>People should give charity, 
      perform meritorious acts and observe moral precepts. In the present life, 
      they will be safe, in the next life, they will be reborn either in the 
      heaven or in the world as men of wisdom, intelligence and wealth. They 
      will not be reborn in the Hell, in the Kingdom of hungry ghosts, or in the 
      animal Kingdom. People who do not observe the Dharma and moral precepts 
      suffer in the present world and in the next life, will fall into the three 
      evil realms for an indefinite period. Na-hsien knew that the lady- devotee 
      was glad at heart, then he preach the deeper Dharma, that all things are 
      passing away, inpermanent; being impermanent, they are subject to 
      suffering&quot;. </I>This passage is almost the same with that preached by the 
      Buddha to Yasa in Mahàvagga: &quot;<I>Bhagavà anupubbim kathesi, seyyathìd-am 
      dànakatham sìlakatham saggakatham kàmànam àdinavam okàram sankìlesam, 
      nekkhamo ànisamsam pakàsesi; yadà Bhagavà annàsi Yasam Kulaputtam 
      kallasittam,mucittam vinivaranacittram udaggacittam pasau nacittam; atha 
      yà Buddhànam sàmukkamsika dhammadesanà tam pakàsesi-dukkham samudayam 
      nirodham maggam.&quot;</I> Thus the C version reflects the tradition of early 
      days of Buddhism, when Lord Buddha just started His preaching, as recorded 
      in Mahàvagga.</P>
      <P>(b) Again when Na-hsien first met King Mi-lan, he preached at one to 
      the king without the latter asking him. He preached thus: &quot;<I>The Buddha 
      doctrine proclaims that men&#39;s good health is the highest benefit, men&#39;s 
      contentment is the greatest wealth, men&#39;s faith is the highest blessing, 
      and Nirvana is the highest happiness.&quot;</I> This passage is omitted in the 
      P version, which starts at once with the king&#39;s question about the 
      philosophical meaning of a name. Thus the Pàli procedure cannot be said to 
      be as natural as that of the C text.</P>
      <P>(c) In the P, King Milinda detected Nàgasena sitting in the middle of 
      the Sangha and rejoiced to have recognised Nàgasena without any help. In 
      the C, it was the king who asked the Minister &quot;<I>Who was Na-hsien</I>?&quot; 
      and when the minister pointed out the monk to him, King Mi-lan said that 
      his guess was right.</P>
      <P>This feat of King Milinda draws this comment from Rhys-David: &quot;<I>In 
      the corresponding passage of the Sàmannaphalasutta, Jìvaka points out the 
      Buddha to Ajàtasattu, this would be in the memory of all his readers, and 
      our author alters the story in this case to show how superior Milinda was 
      to the royal interlocutor in the older catalogue.</I>&quot; The C version, 
      which sticks to the earlier tradition, looks far more genuine and older 
      than its P counterpart.</P>
      <P>(d) Again another feature bears testinomy to the accuracy of the C 
      passage against the P corresponding one. Speaking about the 
      incomparability of the Buddha, the P quotes the simile of five great 
      rivers: <I>Gangà,Yamunà, Aciravatì, Sarabhù, Mahì,</I>while the C mentions
      <I>Heng, Hsin-t&#39;a, Ssu-t&#39;a, Po-ch&#39;a,Shih-p&#39;i-i</P>
      </I>
      <P>The five rivers in the C text are identified by Dr. Kogen Mizuno as 
      Ganga,ø Sindhù, Sità, Vaksù and Saravati. These five, except the Ganges, 
      are the great rivers which flow though N. W. India, while all the five 
      rivers mentioned in the P are flowing through the Eastern parts of India.</P>
      <P>As we know, the Milindapañha with its reference to King Milinda should 
      be composed somewhere in the Western parts of India, where the memories of 
      the Greek king were still fresh, and it was but natural that its compilers 
      should refer to the big rivers which they were well-acquainted with, i.e. 
      in N. W. India. Exception should be made of the Ganges which was 
      well-known throughout India by its long course and its holiness.</P>
      <P>So the C which mentions the four big rivers belonging to the N. W. 
      India lends favour to the conception of its being closer to the original 
      than its P counterpart. Dr. Kogen Mizuno is of the opinion that when the 
      original of the C <I>Na-hsien-pi-ch&#39;iu-ching</I> was adopted and changed 
      by the Pàli Buddhists, then the four rivers in the N.W. were not familiar 
      with the people in the Eastern part, so they were changed to Yamunà, 
      Aciravatì, Sarabhù and Mahì, all well-known to the Eastern people of 
      India.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the P mentions many of places which were located in the East 
      such as Kajangala, where Nàgasena was supposed to be born, Pàtaliputta and 
      Asokàràma where Nàgasena went to study the Suttanta under Ven. 
      Dhammarakkhita.</P>
      <P>According to Dr. Kogen Mizuno, Hsuan Tsang refers to Kajangala as <I>
      Chieh-chu-wen ch&#39; i-lo</I> which was situated in the Eastern part of 
      Champà in Magadhà, probably in the Eastern part of Pàtaliputta, 100 
      yojanas distant. But the C does not refer to any place in the East. This 
      fact shows that the original Indian text might have been revised by 
      compilers living in Eastern India and well-acquainted with rivers and 
      places located in the East; while the original of the C version, with the 
      almost complete absence of any localities in the East (except the Ganges) 
      shows that it was really composed in the N.W. part of India, therefore it 
      is more genuine and more trust-worthy than its P counterpart.</P>
      <B>
      <P>7. Abundance of Miracles in the P version: </P>
      </B>
      <P>Another fact which proclaims the nearness to the original of the C 
      version against the P version is the abundance of miraculous feats in the 
      P version, while the C prefers rather a mantle of simplicity and 
      moderation, which are the main features of early Buddhism. Thus in the 
      birth story of Nàgasena, the P traces back the story up to Buddha Kassapa, 
      while the C refers to our Lord Buddha only.</P>
      <P>Miracles are not rare in the P version of the previous life of 
      Nàgasena. Thus the whole company of Arahants led by Ven. Assagutta 
      vanished from Yugandhara mountain and appeared in the Tàvatimsa heaven, 
      where they were welcomed by Sakka, the king of gods, who in turn 
      introduced God Mahàsena to the company of Arahants.</P>
      <P>Three times Sakka on behalf of the brethren requested God Mahàsena to 
      be born in the world of men so as to refute King Milinda of his heretical 
      views, three times Mahàsena refused. When Mahàsena was born in the womb of 
      Sonuttara&#39;s wife, three miracles happened. Weapons became ablaze, grains 
      ripened in a moment and there was a heavy rain out of season.</P>
      <P>Further, Nàgasena is depicted to have known by heart all the seven 
      books on Abhidhamma, after hearing them only once. Again in seven months, 
      when Nàgasena recited the whole of Abhidhamma in full, the earth quaked, 
      the Gods applauded, the Brahmà Gods clapped their hands and from heaven 
      showered down sweet-scented sandalwood dust and Mandàrava flowers. The 
      same phenomenon greeted Nàgasena once again when he attained Arahantship.</P>
      <P>To this profusion of miracles, the C counterpart strikes rather a note 
      of admirable moderation and genuineness. There are absolutely no miracles, 
      except that Na-hsien and his uncle were said to obtain the five Abhinnà 
      (superknowledges), being able to fly through the air, acquiring the divine 
      ear, the divine eye, knowing places of rebirth etc....., but no one 
      demonstrated his miraculous powers, and when Na-hsien obtained 
      Arahantship, there was no mention of the Gods&#39; applause, of the shower of 
      Mandàrava flowers and scented sandal-wood dust to celebrate the event.</P>
      <P>Again the P mentions the name of Moggaliputta Tissathero, the famous 
      convener of the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Buddhist Council, along with the Buddha&#39;s 
      prediction as to the future life of Milinda and Nàgasena, with the obvious 
      reference to Moggaliputta being also predicted by the Buddha to be the 
      future convener of the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Buddhist council.</P>
      <P>Here the Siamese edition adds the name of Ven. Assagupta, being also 
      predicted by the Buddha. Of course, the C maintains a meaningful silence 
      over these two names and thereby scores another point of nearness to the 
      original against the P tradition.</P>
      <B>
      <P>8. Moderation in the C version: </P>
      </B>
      <P>While the P mentions that Nàgasena was surrounded by 80.000 monks (<I>asìtiyà 
      bhikkhusahasse-hi)</I> in his first meeting with the king, the C refers 
      only to 500 monks who accompanied Na-hsien when he met the king.</P>
      <P>Again àyupàla mentioned that 18 kotis of Brahmà deities and an 
      innumerable company of other gods attained the eyes of wisdom when the 
      Buddha preached the first sermon; and when he expounded <I>the 
      Mahàsamayasutta, the Mahà mangalasutta, the Samacittapariyàyasutta, the 
      Ràhulovàdasuttanta,</I> innumerable was the multitude of gods who attained 
      the <I>Dhammàbhisamaya</I>, penetration of truth. But A-yeh-ho in the 
      corresponding C passage replied simply in the affirmative without 
      mentioning all these details. Once more the moderation of the C truly 
      reflects the simplicity and anteriority of the C version.</P>
      <P>Further more, the sobriety in the C descriptions matches very fittingly 
      with the simplicity of the early Canon, while the P seems to delight in 
      poetical verbosity and lengthly description, as seen clearly in the 
      description of Sàgala, Milinda and Nàgasena and in Milinda&#39;s challenge to 
      one statement of Nàgasena.</P>
      <B>
      <P>9. Addition of the last four books in the P version</B>: </P>
      <P>One more factor which enhances the originality of the C is its ending 
      with the third book, while the P adds four more books on <I>Mendakapañha</I>,
      <I>Anumànapañha, Dhutangas and Opammakathàpañha.</I> A&#39;survey of these 
      added books shows unmistakingly that they were later additions to the 
      original one by the P compilers.</P>
      <P>Ven. Ananda Kausalyàyana in his article on Milindapañha is of the 
      opinion that the C translators might have dropped the last four books, but 
      he did not elaborate any further and did not advance any conclusive proofs 
      as to the omission of the C translators. But the following reasons induce 
      us to believe that the original of the C text really stops with the third 
      book.</P>
      <P>(a) The end of the third book already constitutes a befitting 
      conclusion to the book. After the second conversation, all questions and 
      answers appeared to be already exhausted, the gifts were sent and both 
      took leave of each other, without any hints as to another meeting. 
      Moreover, the P text ends this book with the following words: &quot;<I>Milindapañhanam 
      pucchavissajjanàsamattà&quot;</I> which conveys the impression that the 
      conversation and thereby the book have ended.</P>
      <P>(b) The doctrine in the last four books is not easily understandable to 
      the simple folk in general, such as the Greeks at that time. The first 
      three books refer generally to the doctrine about <I>the existence of 
      atman, Nirvàna, about rebirth and death, samsàra, the activities of citta, 
      cetasikas and their characteristics</I>. The explanation is enlivened with 
      simple and easy similes. So people of no deep knowledge in Buddhism like 
      the Greeks at the time of Menandros could follow and understand easily.</P>
      <P>But the doctrine which is tackled in the four added books is more 
      complicated, more subtle, and which requires a thorough understanding not 
      only of the Suttapitaka, but also of the Atthakathà. Dr. Kogen Mizuno is 
      of the opinion that the last four books are not historical dialogues 
      between Nàgasena and Milinda, but they are rather works of several 
      intelligent and learned monks well versed not only in the Suttapitaka but 
      also in the commentaries.</P>
      <P>Again we can accept Menandros or Milinda as a Buddhist who esteemed and 
      favoured Buddhism. But to depict him as undertaking the eight vows, 
      dressing in yellow robe, with all the appearance of a hermit, only after 
      two days&#39; discussion with Nàgasena is already too far-fetched. However, 
      our credulity receives a severe shock, when Milinda was described as 
      adopting the religious life and attaining Arahantship as well.</P>
      <P>All the above descriptions, which go against historical facts and 
      common acceptance, serve to expose the ungenuineness of the last four 
      books of the P version and reveal the fidelity of the C version.</P>
      <B>
      <P>10. Divergences between the Roman edition and the Siamese edition: </P>
      </B>
      <P>One more proof of the volatile character of the P version is the 
      difference between the Roman edition, which is based mostly upon the 
      Cingalese version, and the Siamese edition. I avail myself of the data 
      collected by Dr. Kogen Mizuno in his &quot;<I>On the recension of Milindapañha</I>&quot; 
      confining myself to checking the accuracy of his statement, and adding the 
      corresponding pages of the Siamese edition together with some more 
      instances, if need be.</P>
      <P>(a) Between the 34<SUP>th</SUP> and the 35<SUP>th</SUP> dialogues of 
      the Roman edition, the Siamese edition adds two lines more on <I>
      manasikàro</P>
      </I>
      <P>(b) Between the 70<SUP>th</SUP> and the 71<SUP>st</SUP> dialogues of 
      the Roman edition are inserted two dialogues about colour to be seen by 
      one who after death in one world is born into another and about the door 
      by which a <I>Patisandhi</I> consciousness enters the womb.</P>
      <P>(c) The 59<SUP>th</SUP> dialogue is amplified in the S edition. In the 
      Roman edition, the dialogue has only eight lines and the C translation 
      only five lines, but the S edition extends up to three pages.</P>
      <P>(d) After the 7<SUP>th</SUP> chapter and before <I>Mendakapan-ha,</I> 
      the S edition adds the <I>Visesapañha</I>.</P>
      <P>(e) In the Roman edition p. 80 about <I>Vassasata</I>, the S edition, 
      adds an extra gàthà.</P>
      <P>(f) In the Roman edition p. 86, about differences between <I>vinnànam, 
      pannà, and jìva</I>, the S edition adds one paragraph of four lines about 
      &quot;<I>Where is Pannà?&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>Thus the above quotations clearly show that even the P traditions are 
      not homogeneous and final, but liable to additions and growth as testified 
      to by these differences between the Roman edition and the Siamese edition.</P>
      <B>
      <P>11. Buddhaghosa&#39;s quotations from Milindapañha</B>: </P>
      <P>One curious fact which was revealed by Rhys Davids in his translation 
      of the Milindapañha should be taken note of here. He pointed out that the 
      actual words quoted by Buddhaghosa in his commentary on the &quot;<I>Book of 
      the Great Dececase</I>&quot; and on the <I>Ambatthasutta</I>, are not the same 
      as those of our author at the corresponding passages of Mr. Trenckner&#39;s 
      text, although they are the same in substance. Two other quotqtions are 
      cited by Dr.Morris.</P>
      <P>Mr. Davids is of the opinion &quot;<I>It is premature to attempt to arrive 
      at the reason of this difference between Buddhaghosa&#39;s citations and Mr. 
      Trenckner&#39;s edition of the text.</I>&quot; but at least we can say that the P 
      Milindapañha text passed through several redactions with accretions and 
      omissions till we have it now in the Cingalese and Siamese editions.</P>
      <B>
      <P>12. The Pàli text is but an expanded translation</B>: </P>
      <P>Mr. Rhys Davids also has pointed out: &quot;<I>It is stated in the preface 
      (of a Cingalese translation of the Pàli Milindapañha) that the account of 
      the celebrated discussion held between Milinda and Nàgasena about 500 
      years after the death of the Buddha, was translated into the Magadhi 
      langguage by &#39;teachers of old&#39; (Pùrvacarin wisin).</P>
      </I>
      <P>We do not know from what original it is translated, but what we can say 
      is that the P version is but a translation which is open to accretions and 
      omissions and this fact and the above one speak strongly in favour of the 
      C version being nearer to the original than the P version.</P>
      <P>We can say that except the dissident voice raised by Rhys Davids in 
      favour of the P text, almost all the Western and Eastern scholars, such as 
      Sylvian Levy and Dr. Kogen Mizuno favoured the nearness to the original of 
      the C version and considered the P version a later amplified recension of 
      the original work, of which the C is a more faithful translation, of 
      course with some moderate changes.</P>
      <P>The P compilers based their work upon this original, added profusely 
      items and doctrines in consonance with the tenets of the Theravàda school 
      and expanded the original into its present bulk.</P>
      <P>Prof. Demieville in his book: <I>Les Versions Chinoises du Milindapañha
      </I>(B.E.F.O. Vol XXIV, 1924, p. 34-35) has given his findings and views 
      on this problem as follows: </P>
      <P>&quot;<I>The original text contains</I>: </P>
      <P>1. <I>An introduction with the following elements: Description of 
      localities, biographical sketch of Nàgasena tracing the various stages of 
      his religious life (noviciate ordination, entering the stream, 
      Arahatship), with some traditions on his monastery and his Teachers; 
      introduction of Milinda and record of his fruitless controversy with one 
      Buddhist monk; meeting of Milinda and Nàgasena.</P>
      </I>
      <P>2. <I>Record of the controversy. The second portion of this book seems 
      to be subjected to ancient additions; the first portion reaches us almost 
      intact in the two versions.</P>
      </I>
      <P>To the introduction were added later on the <I>Avadànas</I> of the two 
      heroes and the biography of Nàgasena was altered and amplified and this 
      brought about two different recensions, one of which was translated into 
      Chinese toward the 4<SUP>th</SUP> Century A.D. and the other into Pàli in 
      the 5<SUP>th</SUP> Century A.D... The Chinese version was codified into 
      two recensions complete and incomplete with not much difference from each 
      other. </P>
      <P>On the contrary, the Pàli version underwent many alterations. 
      Considerable passages were interpolated in the preliminary portion in 
      Ceylon, posterior to the 5<SUP>th</SUP> Century. The legend of Milinda 
      suggests reminiscences of Ajàtasastru and Asoka. As to the four 
      supplementary books, they were probably added in Ceylon, where the first 
      part was already found since the fifth century.&quot;</P>
      <P>Although it is rather difficult to prove that the four supplementary 
      books were added in Ceylon as asserted by Prof. Demieville, his views 
      amply support the anteriority and the fidelity of the Chinese version over 
      the Pàli version.</P>
