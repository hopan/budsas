      <P>(A) Opening Of The Text.</P>
      </B>
      <P>The C opens at once with the previous life of Na-hsien and of the king; 
      while the P starts with an introductory gàthà in which Nàgasena and 
      Milinda are introduced with their outstanding qualifications quoted and 
      praised. It adds an exhortation to listen to the questions and answers 
      asked and replied by the king and the monk respectively. Then the prose 
      starts with &quot;<I>Tam yathà anusùyate</I>&quot; and the description of Sàgala.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(B) Previous Lives Of Na-Hsien and Mi-Lan</P>
      </B>
      <P>As the P text is already widely known, only a detailed account of the 
      previous lives of Na-hsien and Mi-lan according to the C text is given 
      below.</P>
      <P>(C: 52a,5-19; 52b;53a, I-14)</P>
      <P>Lord Buddha was at She-Wei (Sàvatthi) Ch&#39;i trees (Jetavana), Kei-ku-tu 
      garden (Anàthapindikàrà-ma). Daily more than 10,000 people, bhikshus, 
      bhikshunis, layman disciples, laywoman disciples, deities, kings, great 
      ministers, honourable men, people and followers of 96 heretical religious, 
      (more than 10.000 people) came to Lord Buddha to listen to the Dharma.</P>
      <P>Being weary by this large attendance. Lord Buddha entered the mountain, 
      came under a clump of Hsiao-lo trees and pondered over the pure Dharma. 
      Not far from his place, there was a herd of more than 500 elephants with 
      an elephant king who was virtuous, sage, and knew how to discern good 
      actions from bad actions. </P>
      <P>The herd of elephants surrounded him and the little ones, while 
      drinking water, made it dirty, while eating grass and young plants, 
      trampled upon them. Thus the elephant king could not drink pure water and 
      eat clean grass.</P>
      <P>So the elephant-king left the herd, entered the mountain and came under 
      a clump of Hsiao-lo trees. He saw the Buddha sitting under the tree, 
      became happy, lowered his head, kneeled down to pay homage to Lord Buddha 
      and stood at one side. The Buddha thought: &quot;<I>I left my crowd of people 
      to come to this place; the elephant-king also left the herd and came to 
      this place. Both shared the same purpose.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>Then the Buddha preached the doctrine to the elephant and showed the 
      similarity between the two concerning their highest position among their 
      respective followers and their desire for solitude. The elephant-king 
      understood what the Buddha had said.</P>
      <P>He saw the Buddha walking to and fro on the circumambulatory path. He 
      took water from the pond, watered the path, used the plant-leaves to sweep 
      it clean and with his feet, he trampled down the path and levelled it.</P>
      <P>Thus the elephant-king served the Buddha day and night. After the 
      Buddha&#39;s Parinirvàna, he wandered round in search of the Buddha but could 
      not find him and used to cry with bitterness and to abstain from food. </P>
      <P>At that time, there was a Buddha monastery on the top of a mountain 
      called Chia-yuan. In this vihàra, dwelt 500 monks who had attained 
      Arahantship and who used to recite the Dharma up to morning. He knew the 
      six days of recital and would come on those days (K.E. adds: The 8<SUP>th</SUP> 
      , the 14<SUP>th</SUP> , the 15<SUP>th</SUP> , the 23<SUP>rd</SUP> , the 29<SUP>th</SUP> 
      and the 30<SUP>th</SUP> ).</P>
      <P>The monks came to know of this and waited till the arrival of the 
      elephant to start the recitation of the Dharma. The elephant-king used to 
      listen to the Dharma up to morning without sleeping, lying down and 
      moving. He died and owning to his listening to the Dharma and his service 
      to the Buddha, after long time, he was born as a son in a Brahmin family.</P>
      <P>When he came of age, he did not hear about the Buddha-dharma and did 
      not see the monks. Afterwards, he left the household life, entered the 
      forest and was engaged in the study of Brahmanism (K.E. Of heretical 
      religions), at the top of a mountain. Near by, lived a Brahmin hermit and 
      both became well-acquainted.</P>
      <P>One of them thought: &quot;<I>If in this world I am unable to overcome 
      sorrow, suffering, old age and sick ness, after my death, I shall be born 
      in the Hell, in the animal Kingdom, in the Kingdom of the departed spirits 
      or in a poor family. To escape all these, I make a vow to become a 
      recluse, wear the yellow robe and strive after transcendental attainment 
      and Nirvàna (K.E. Arahantship and Nirvàna)</I>&quot;. The other man thought: &quot;<I>I 
      hope to become a powerful king, reigning all over this world and making 
      all people obey my command.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>Afterwards, both died and were born as men. The one who made vow to 
      become a king was born as a prince of a city near the sea and was named 
      Mi-lan. The other who made a vow to become a monk and strive after 
      transcendental attainment and Nirvàna was born in Tien-chu (Jambudipa), in 
      the district of Chi-pin (Kashmir) and was named T&#39;o-la. He was born along 
      with the yellow robe on him owing to his vow in his previous life.</P>
      <P>In this house, an elephant was born on the same day. As in T&#39;ien-chu, 
      an elephant was called Nàg, so the father named his son Na-hsien. Na-hsien 
      grew up and reached 14, 15 years of age. He had a paternel uncle named 
      Lou-han who was a recluse, peerless, endowed with heavenly eye, with 
      heavenly ear, capable of flying through the air, entering the Never 
      Ceasing Hell, endowed with miraculous powers, and knowing how to read the 
      thoughts of all creatures from deities, men up to insects, and the places 
      of their rebirth.</P>
      <P>Na-hsien came to see his uncle, told him of his own delight in the 
      Buddha doctrine and requested his uncle to ordain him and to receive him 
      as his disciple. Lou-han knew Na-hsien&#39;s good deeds in his previous life 
      and his wisdom, so Lou-han gave him the ten precepts and ordained him as a 
      novice.</P>
      <P>Na-hsien daily recited the doctrine, pondered over the Dharma and the 
      Vinaya, attained the four Dhyànas and grasped the essence of the doctrine, 
      but he did not obtain the high ordination. At that time, there was a 
      Buddhist temple called Ho-ch&#39;an in which dwelt 500 recluses who had 
      attained Arahantship.</P>
      <P>The highest among them was O-po-yueh who knew the past, the present and 
      the future of things in the world. When Na-hsien reached 20 years of age, 
      he received high ordination and came to the Ho-ch&#39;an tenple, at Ven. 
      O-po-yueh&#39;s place.</P>
      <P>At that time, it was a full moon day and for the sake of reciting the 
      rules of the great recluses (Pràtimoksha), the monks entered the hall, 
      Na-hsien entered also and sat among them. Ven. O-po-yueh saw that all the 
      monks were Arahants except Na-hsien. He said that just like black grains 
      of rice among white grains of rice, Na-hsien was black and not an Arahant 
      while all the monks were white and pure.</P>
      <P>On hearing this, Na-hsien felt deeply sorrowful, worshipped the monks, 
      went out of the hall and thought: &quot;<I>It is unbecoming of me, who am not 
      yet emancipated to sit in the assembly of monks who are already 
      emancipated. It is like a jackal sitting among the lions. From now on, if 
      I do not attain Arahantship, I shall not enter the hall</I>.&quot;</P>
      <P>O-po-yueh knew Na-hsien&#39;s thought, stroke Na-hsien&#39;s head and said: &quot;<I>Before 
      long you will attain arahantship, do not worry</I>&quot;, and he asked Na-hsien 
      to stay there. Na-hsien had a teacher more than 80years old named 
      Chia-wei-yueh. There was a great layman-disciple who daily offered food to 
      Chia-wei-yueh&#39;s disciple (K.E.:To Chia-wei-yueh).</P>
      <P>Na-hsien was told by the teacher to go to this layman-disciple with his 
      begging bowl and bring back food. The teacher asked Na-hsien to fill his 
      mouth with water and proceed to the layman&#39;s house to take food.</P>
      <P>The layman-devotee saw Na-hsien young, good looking, far above common 
      people, of sharp intelligence and capable of expounding the Dharma. When 
      Na-hsien entered his house, the layman-disciple paid homage to him and 
      said that he had offered food to the monks for a long time and the monks 
      had preached the Dharma to him (K.E.: Not preached). Now he asked Na-hsien 
      to expound the Dharma to him so that his mind might be emancipated. 
      Na-hsien thought that his teacher ordered him to fill his mouth with water 
      and not to speak. If now he spat out the water and spoke, he would disobey 
      his teacher&#39;s order. So how should he act now?</P>
      <P>Then he thought: &quot;<I>The lay-devotee is intelligent and of noble 
      aspiration. If I preach to him, he may attain the truth.</I>&quot; So Na-hsien 
      spat out the water and expounded the Dharma: &quot;<I>People should give 
      charity, perform meritorious acts and observe moral precepts. In the 
      present life, they will be secure; in the next life, they will be reborn 
      either in the heaven or in this world as men of wisdom, of intelligence 
      and of wealth (K.E. omits: Of wisdom and of intelligence). They will not 
      be reborn in the Hell, in the Kingdom of hungry ghosts, in the animal 
      Kingdom (K.E. adds: In a poor family). People who do not observe Dharma 
      and moral precepts suffer in the present world and in the next life, will 
      fall into the three evil realms, for an indefinite period.&quot; (K.E. omits 
      the whole passage</I>.&quot;).</P>
      <P>Na-hsien knew that the lay-devotee was glad at heart, then he preached 
      the deeper dharma, that <I>all things were passing away, not permanent; 
      being impermanent (K.E. Being conditioned), they were subject to 
      suffering. The men&#39;s body in the world was the same. But people in the 
      world considered their body as being their self (K.E. not available), so 
      they were not independent. The path to Nirvàna was all happiness. He who 
      attained Nirvàna was not subject to birth, old age, sickness, death, 
      sorrow and to dejection. All his evil and suffering were eradicated.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>When Na-hsien finished his preaching, the lay-devotee attained the 
      first stage of Stream-winner and Na-hsien himself obtained the same 
      attainment. The lay-devotee was overjoyed and offered excellent, delicious 
      food to Na-hsien. Na-hsien asked him first to fill the teacher&#39;s bowl with 
      food. </P>
      <P>After his meal, Na-hsien (K.E. adds: washed his hands and rinsed his 
      mouth), took the bowl filled with food and brought it to his teacher. The 
      teacher on seeing him said: &quot;<I>You have brought very good food with you, 
      this means that you have acted against the Sangha, so you should be 
      expelled and will not be allowed to stay among the Order.</I>&quot;</P>
      <P>Ven. O-po-yuch said: &quot;<I>Just like a man who, with one arrow, shoots 
      two targets, such a man should not be expelled. Na-hsien attained the 
      Stream-winner stage, so did the lay-devotee. Do not expel him</I>.&quot; Ven. 
      Chia-wei-yueh said: &quot;<I>Even if with one arrow, he shoots 100 targets, he 
      still commits an offence against the Sangha, he is not allowed to stay in 
      the middle of the Order. The observance of the rules by others cannot be 
      equated with the attainment of Na-hsien. It is better to punish Na-hsien 
      to serve as a reminder for the future.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>The Sangha kept silent. So the teacher expelled Na-hsien. Na-hsien 
      worshipped his teacher and the Order, went out of the monastery, entered a 
      deep mountain, sat under a tree and exerted himself, reflecting upon the 
      Dharma day and night without break and attained Arahantship.</P>
      <P>Now he could fly, had divine eye and ear, knew the minds of others and 
      previous births. When Na-hsien attained Arahantship, he re-entered 
      Ho-ch&#39;an temple, came before the Sangha, confessed his offence and asked 
      for rehabilitation. The Sangha accepted his request.</P>
      <P>Then Na-hsien worshipped the Order, undertook a preaching tour from 
      village to village, from town to town, and exhorted people to perform 
      meritorious acts. Some people received the five precepts and attained the 
      Stream-winner stage, the Once-returner stage, the No-returner stage; some 
      become monks and attained Arahantship.</P>
      <P>The four heavenly kings of the first heaven Tao-li-t&#39;ieh <I>(P: 
      Tàvatimsa</I>), Ti-Shih (<I>P: Inda</I>) of the second Tushita heaven, 
      Brahmà of the seventh heaven came, worshipped Na-hsien, and Na-hsien 
      preached the Dharma to them. Na-hsien&#39;s fame was well-known in the heaven. 
      Wherever he went, deities, human beings, spirits, dragons welcomed him, 
      were happy to see him and obtained merit.</P>
      <P>Then Na-hsien came to the country of She-chieh (<I>P:Sàgala</I>) and 
      stayed at Hsieh-chih(or ti)-chia temple. At that time, at the seaside, 
      there was a prince, Mi-lan by name. When he was young, he studied and knew 
      heretical religions well and no heretical teachers could beat him in 
      arguments. When his father died, Mi-lan became king. The king asked his 
      minister if in the country there were any religious men or lay people who 
      were able to hold discussions with him about religions. The minister 
      replied that there was a Buddhist monk who was intelligent and clever, and 
      who would be able to discuss religious doctrine with the king.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(C) Description of Sàgala:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 53a, 17-20): </P>
      <P>&quot;<I>In the North of Ta-ch&#39;in country there was a Kingdom called 
      She-chieh, a citadel of ancient kings. This country enjoyed internal and 
      external peace and its people were good and honest. The city was 
      surrounded on all four directions by an underground road (Futao?). The 
      gates of the citadel were adorned with sculptures and engravings</I>.</P>
      <I>
      <P>In the palace, the ladies had (special) apartment. The streets and 
      markets were aligned rows after rows. Roads and thoroughfares were large, 
      with shops ranged on both sides. Elephants, horses, chariots, infantry, 
      gentlemen and ladies were prosperous and crowded; recluses, religious men, 
      relatives, workers, people together (K.E. not available) with small 
      Kingdoms were wise and noble</I>.</P>
      <I>
      <P>People were dressed in dazzling colours. The women and girls were white 
      (Ch&#39;uan-pai?) and they adorned themselves with jewels (K.E, not 
      available). The land was high, dry and rich in precious stones. Customers 
      from four directions came for trade and paid for their trade in golden 
      coins; five kinds of crop were in plenty and even modest families had 
      savings. Stalls near market were selling pastry and foodstuffs to satisfy 
      every hunger, and grape juices and various sorts of wine slacken all kinds 
      of thirst (K.E.,not available). (All) were enjoying happiness difficult to 
      describe.&quot;</P>
      <P>(P: I, 13-21; 2,1-15):</P>
      </I>
      <P>Here the P far excels the C in its description pf Sàgala. While all the 
      C details are found more or less in the same form in the P text, the P 
      description of the city far outdoes the C counterpart in richness of 
      details, in romantic background and in dazzling style.</P>
      <P>Thus the city of Sàgala is eulogized in such a beautiful and romantic 
      description: <I>nadi-pabbata-sobhitam ramanìya-bhùmippadesabhàgam 
      àràmuy-yànopavana-talàka-pokkha-rani-sampannam 
      nadipab-bata-vana-ràmaneyyakam (a beautiful country well-decorated with 
      rivers and mountains; abounded in delighful parks, gardens, groves, lakes, 
      ponds, rivers, hills, forests).</I> </P>
      <P>While the C mentions simply that the city was surrounded in four 
      directions by an underground road running round and with gates adorned 
      with sculptures and engravings, the Pàli describes:&quot;<I>Vividha 
      vicitra-dalha-mattàla-kottakam varapavara-gopurat-oranam 
      gambhìraparikhà-pandarapàkàra-parikkhitta- antepu- ram (with various 
      strong ramparts and towers, gateways, archways, deep moats, white walls, 
      inner town.)</I> </P>
      <P>The same can be said of the C description of people dressed in fine 
      dazzling colours, while the P speaks of Sàgala streets crowded with 
      elephants, horses, carriages, pedestrians, a resort for handsome men and 
      beautiful women and people of all classes and conditions, with shops 
      selling Kàsi cloths, Kotumbara stuffs and a variety of other linens. </P>
      <P>While the C refers simply to the country full of precious stones and 
      pearls and that the merchants paid their wares in golden coins, the P 
      poetically speaks of an abode of dazzling hidden treasures 
      (pajjotamànanidhi-niketam) full of golden coins, silver, gold, copper and 
      earthenwares. At the end, the P compares the city of Sàgala as the city of 
      the gods (Devapura) like Alakam-andà and like Uttara-kuru in crops.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(D) Milinda:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 53b, 1-2;)</P>
      <P>The C text refers to King Mi-lan in the following terms: &#39;<I>King 
      Mi-lan governed the country in accordance with the right Dharma. He was 
      skilful and clever, knew well the religious theories of the world and 
      capable of asKing puzzling questions concerning the past, the future and 
      the present.</I> (K.E. not available) <I>He was expert in administrative 
      works and arts of warfare (K.E. not available). As far as strategies in 
      warfare were concerned, he mastered them all. He knew the 96 heretical 
      doctrines. Inehaustible were the questions put to him and he guessed at 
      once the meaning of the words scarcely uttered.</P>
      </I>
      <P>(P: 3, 26-32; 4-I-5):</P>
      <P>Here again the P far excels the C in the description of Milinda&#39;s 
      outstanding qualities. He is described as <I>pandito byatto medhàvi 
      patibalo, well learned in 19 arts and sciences such as Suti Sammuti, 
      sankhyà, yogà, nìti, visesikà, ganikà, gandhabbà, tikicchà, càtubbedà, 
      purànà, itihàsà, jotisà, màyà, hetu, mantanà, yuddhà, chandasà, muddà 
      (tradition, lore, Sankhyà, Yogà, Nyàya philosophy, Vaisesika philosophy, 
      arithmetic, music, medicine, the four Vedas, the Purànas, the Itihàsas, 
      astronomy, mystic formular, logic, mantra spells, warfare, poetry, art of 
      calculation). As a debater, he is duràsada, duppasaho (hard to challenge, 
      hard to overcome) and was recognised as leader of all heretical heads. He 
      was matchless in strength, in agility, in valour, in wisdom, very wealthy, 
      very prosperous and with countless army forces.</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>(E) Meeting of Ven Ayupala with King Milinda:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 53b. 2-11): (P: 19, 7-32)</P>
      <P>(1) In the P, King Milinda asked his privy councillors as to whom he 
      might visit to discuss the Dhamma and the five hundred Yonakas answered 
      the king. In the C, the king addressed to his ministers by his side and 
      minister Chan-mi-li-wang-ch&#39;un answered his question.</P>
      <P>(2). In the P, King Milinda, after sending a messenger, came to see 
      Elder Ayupàla along with 500 Yonakas; in the C, first the monk Yeh-ho-Lo 
      was invited to come and meet King Mi-lan, the monk replied that the King 
      should come but not himself, and the king came along with 500 attendants.</P>
      <P>(3). Milinda&#39;s question is almost the same in both versions; in the P, 
      Ayupàla answered that for the sake of living in righteousness and living 
      in spiritual calm (Dhammacariyasamacariyatthà) the monks adopted the 
      religious life; in the C, Yeh-ho-Io replied that they learned the Buddha 
      doctrine so as to live in righteousness and to obtain merits in the 
      present and also in the next life.</P>
      <P>(4) While in the C, the monk Yeh-ho-Io merely replied in the 
      affirmative, when King Mi-lan asked whether there were laymen who could 
      live in righteousness and obtain merits in the present and in future 
      lives; in the P, Ayupàla added to his affirmative answer five instances to 
      support his reply: when the Buddha delivered the <I>
      Dhammacakkapavattanasutta, the Màhasamayasuttanta, the Mahàmangalasutta, 
      the Samacittapariyàyasuttanta and the Ràhulovàdasuttan-ta,</I> 18 kotis of 
      Brahmàgods and other deities who were not monks attained the penetration 
      of truth (Dhammàbhisamaya).</P>
      <P>(5) In the C, King Mi-lan simply said that Yeh-ho-Io had given up his 
      worldly life in vain and Yeh-ho-Io could not answer the king; in the P, 
      King Milinda added a long passage in which he pointed out that the present 
      practice of the <I>13 dhutangas by</I> the monks was not moral practice 
      (sìla), was not ascetism, was not purity of life but rather a kind of 
      punishment for their misdeeds in the past and to this long invective, 
      Ayupàla kept silent.</P>
      <P>(6) The C adds a sentence in which the ministers declared the king 
      winner and Ven. Yeh-ho-Io accepted his defeat. The P also adds a passage 
      in which King Milinda deelared Jambudìpa to be empty of recluses and 
      bràhmanas able to discuss with him and solve his doubts.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(F) Meeting between Nàgasena and Milinda:</P>
      </B><I>
      <P>(C: 53b. 11-20; 54a, 1-2): (P: 21,12-21;22;23;24)</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>1. Nàgasena&#39;s learning and qualities:</P>
      </B>
      <P>The C refers to Na-hsien as <I>the teacher of monks, the knower of the 
      essence of the Dharma, clever in explaining the twelve divisions of the 
      Scriptures, expert in making out chapters and sentences, the knower of the 
      Path to Nirvàna, unchallenged, unconquered, the dispeller of doubts</I> 
      (K.E. not available), <I>with wisdom like the ocean, the tamer of the 96 
      heretical doctrines, well respected by four categories of disciples of the 
      Buddha </I>(K.E.: simply disciples of the Buddha), <I>a place of refuge 
      and an object of respect for the wise men </I>(K.E. not available),<I> the 
      teacher of the Dharma.</I> Again Na-hsien is referred to as <I>a fierce 
      lion, with subtle wisdom, with clear understanding of the abstruse points 
      in the sacred lore, able to remove doubts.</P>
      </I>
      <P>All the above details count nothing if we compare them with the 
      corresponding ones of the P version which sails itself in a long eulogy of 
      Nàgasena&#39;s qualities far outstripping the C texts in rich metaphors and 
      romantic settings. Thus Nàgasena was described as <I>Sàgaro viya akkhobbho 
      (unshakable like the sea), giriràjà viya niccalo (imperturbable like the 
      king of mountain) etc...dhàrento dhammapajjotam (the upholder of the torch 
      of Dhamma)........ pagganhàpento dhammad-dhajam (holding aloof the banner 
      of Dhamma), uppalàsento dhammasankham (blowing the conch of Dhamma), 
      àhananto dhammabherim (beating the drum of Dhamma).</I> Among the details 
      in the P version, the following points are interesting. The P mentions 
      Nàgasena <I>as Tepitako, master of the three baskets, thus including the 
      Abhidhamma in the Canon</I>. It refers also to <I>navangasatthusàsana 
      pariyattidharo</I>, thus opting for the nine divisions of the Scriptures 
      instead of the twelve divisions mentioned in the C. The number of monks 
      following Nàgasena in the P text mounts up to 80.000 which strikes a 
      rather exaggerated note, while the C text simply mentions the followers of
      <I>Na-hsien.</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>2. Meeting between Nàgasena and King Milinda:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(a) In the P version, when King Milinda heard his attendants mention 
      Nàgasena&#39;s name, he suddenly felt afraid and was also frightened when he 
      was in the presence of Nàgasena with a foreboding of approaching defeat. 
      The C omits the first passage in which King Milinda became afraid at the 
      mere name of Nàgasena (K.E. adds Chan-mi-li-wang-ch&#39;un saying that 
      Na-hsien was able to discuss the Dharma with Brahma-deities of the 7<SUP>th</SUP> 
      heaven, what to speak of the king of human beings).</P>
      <P>(b) In the P version, the king himself, after having sent a messenger, 
      came with 500 Yonakas to pay a visit to Nàgasena, while in the C version, 
      King Mi-lan sent an invitation to Na-hsien to come to the palace and see 
      him and Na-hsien accepted the invitation and came himself with a retinue.</P>
      <P>(c) Both versions mention King Milinda&#39;s fear when brought into the 
      presence of Nàgasena, but the P adds a passage in which the author resorts 
      to a long series of similes to describe the king&#39;s fear such as an 
      elephant surrounded by rhinoceroses, a serpent surrounded by garulas etc.</P>
      <P>(d) In the P, King Milinda himself detected Nàgasena sitting in the 
      middle of the Sangha and rejoiced to have recognised Nàgasena without any 
      help; in the C, it was the king who asked the minister: &quot;<I>Who was 
      Na-hsien</I>?&quot;, and when the minister pointed out Na-hsien to him, King 
      Mi-lan said that what he guessed was right.</P>
      <P>(e) The P adds two gàthas, the first of which is a eulogy of Nàgasena&#39;s 
      qualities, and the second mentions Milinda&#39;s foreboding when he came into 
      Nàgasena&#39;s presence.</P>

      <P>1. Questions about a name:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(a) (C: 54a.2)</P>
      <P>The C version starts first with Na-hsien Preaching the Dharma to King 
      Mi-lan, without the latter asking him. He preached thus: &quot;<I>The Buddha&#39;s 
      doctrine proclaims that men&#39;s good health is the highest benefit, men&#39;s 
      contentment is the greatest wealth, men&#39;s faith is the highest blessing 
      (Hou) and Nirvàna is the highest happiness.</I>&quot; This passage is missing 
      in the P.</P>
      <P>(b) (C; 54a.2-4).</P>
      <P>The king then asked Na-hsien: &quot;<I>What is your name</I>?&quot; Na h-sien 
      replied: &quot;<I>My parents gave me the name Na-hsien and called me Na-hsien. 
      Sometimes they called me Wei-hsien, sometimes they called me Shou-lo-hsien 
      (K.E-: Shou-na-hsien), sometimes they called me Wei-chia-hsien. Due to 
      that, people came to recognise me. People in the world have names only</I>.&quot;</P>
      <P>(P:25, 1-27; 26, 1-3):</P>
      <P>The P is with more details. It adds that Nàgasena also referred to his 
      Brahma-farers calling him by the name Nàgasena. The C speaks of four names 
      given by his parents, <I>Na-hsien, Wei-sien, Shou-lo-hsien, Wei-chia-hsien</I>. 
      The P also quotes four names: <I>Nàgasena, Sùrasena. Virasena, Sìhasena.</P>
      </I>
      <P>While the C refers simply: &quot;<I>Due to that, people came to recognise 
      me. People in the world have names only,&quot;</I> in the P, Nàgasena referred 
      to his names as mere conventional terms, mere names without any 
      individuality therein: &quot;<I>sankhà samannà pannatti vohàro nàmamattam...na 
      h&#39;ettha puggalo upalabbhati&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>And the P adds a long passage in which Milinda called the Yonakas and 
      the monks to witness this declaration of Nàgasena and he asked Nàgasena a 
      series of questions to prove the falsity of Nàgasena&#39;s declaration, such 
      as: <I>if there was no individuality, then who gave the four requisites to 
      the monks, who enjoyed them, who observed the precepts</I>? etc....</P>
      <P>(c) (C: 54a, 4-10):</P>
      <P>King Mi-lan then asked Na-hsien a series of questions to which the 
      latter replied in the negative such as: &quot; <I>Is the head Na-hsien</I>?&quot;, &quot;<I>Are 
      the eyes Na-hsien</I>?&quot; The matters referred to are in the following 
      order: &quot;<I>Head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, neck (K.E.adds I: chin), 
      shoulder, arms, feet, hands, buttocks, legs, complexion, painful feelings, 
      meritorious,demeritorious body, liver, lungs, heart, spleen, arteries, 
      intestines, the coming together of material forms, painful and pleasant 
      feelings, meritorious, demeritorious body and mind, the non-coming 
      together of material forms</I>, <I>sound, echo, cough, breath. In all 
      there are 30 matters.</P>
      </I>
      <P>(P: 26, 5-24):</P>
      <P>The matters referred to are not the same and not in the same order, 
      They are as follows: <I>hairs, hairs of the body, nails, teeth, skin, 
      flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidney, heart, liver, diaphragm, 
      spleen,lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, excrements, bile, phlegm, 
      pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, skin-grease, saliva, nasal mucus, oil of 
      the joints, urine, brains, material form, feelings, perception, mental 
      tendencies, consciousness, all the five aggregates together, others than 
      the five aggregates</I>. Here in the P, King Milinda accused Nàgasena of 
      speaking falsehood as he saw Nàgasena in flesh before him, but the monk 
      spoke of Nàgasena as merely a name.</P>
      <P>(d) (C: 54a, 10-16):</P>
      <P>Then Na-hsien asked King Mi-lan what the carriage was, while referring 
      to many parts in a carriage such as <I>axle, felloe, spokes, hub, shaft, 
      yoke, bottom of a carriage, pole, roof, the putting together of wood, the 
      non-putting together of wood, sounds, noise. (K.E.: Axle, hub, spokes, 
      felloe, shaft, yoke, bottom of a carriage, roof, the putting together of 
      wood, sounds.) To all these questions</I> King Mi-lan replied in the 
      negative.</P>
      <P>Then Na-hsien asked: &quot;<I>What is the chariot</I>?&quot; To such a question, 
      King Mi-lan kept silent. Then Na-hsien said: &quot;<I>The Buddhasùtra said that 
      with the coming together of wood, with the necessity of making a carriage, 
      people obtain a carriage. A man is the same. With the coming together of 
      head.....up to...meritorious, demeritorious body, mind, it comes to be 
      known as a man.&quot;</I> The king said: &quot;<I>Very good, very good</I>&quot;.</P>
      <P>(P: 26, 25-32; 27; 28, 1-12):</P>
      <P>Here again the P offers more details. It adds a long passage in which 
      Nàgasena referred to the delicate upbringing of the king and of his coming 
      in a carriage. Then Nàgasena asked what a carriage was. The matters 
      referred to here are in the following order: <I>Pole, axle, wheels, 
      framework, shafts, yokes rope, goad, the putting together of these parts, 
      things outside these parts of the carriage.</P>
      </I>
      <P>Here the P adds another long passage in which Nàgasena now accused King 
      Milinda of speaking a falsehood as the king said that he came in a 
      carriage, whereas Nàgasena found that a carriage was merely a name. He 
      called upon the Yonakas and the monks to bear witness to the king&#39;s 
      declaration. And the Yonakas shouted their approval and challenged the 
      king to come out of this impasse. Then the king denied having spoken an 
      untruth. Due to the coming together of these different parts of a 
      carriage, the conventional term &quot;carriage&quot; was used.</P>
      <P>Then Nàgasena approved of the king&#39;s answer and said that it was due to 
      the coming together of 32 organic matters and of the five aggregates that 
      the conventional appellation &quot;Nàgasena&quot; was used. Then he quoted sister 
      Vajirà&#39;s gàthà to prove his explanation, Here also King Milinda praised 
      Nàgasena&#39;s reply as <I>wonderful and marvellous</I>, <I>saying that he had 
      solved the most puzzling question and would elicit the Buddha&#39;s approval 
      were the Buddha alive.</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>2. Seven years of ordination:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(P:28, 13-27).</P>
      <P>The passage in which King Milinda asked Nàgasena about his years of 
      seniority is missing in the Chinese text.</P>
      <B>
      <P>3. Ways of discussion:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 54a, 16-20; 54b, 1-2) = (P: 28, 28-33;29,1-15)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with the following slight differences.</P>
      <P>C: <I>Wise men speak words of contention, words of explanation, words 
      that are high, words that are low, words that bring in victory, words that 
      bring about defeat, right words, wrong words. Wise men know what is right, 
      what is wrong; that is the highest</P>
      </I>
      <P>wisdom. Wise men do not become angry. Thus do wise men discuss = P: 
      Here the P refers to <I>àvethanan (explanation, winding up), nibbethanam 
      (unravelling), niggaho (censure), patikammam (redress), viseso 
      (distinction), pativiseso (sub-discrimination)</I> and says that wise men 
      are not angy during the discussion. As to the discussion of a king, it is 
      almost the same in both versions. (K.E. 45b, 10-15, adds another way of 
      discussion, that of <I>a foolish man who does not know words that are 
      correct, words that are incorrect, and tries to win over by inconsiderate 
      compulsion.)</I> </P>
      <P>Again the C adds two more sentences to the verbal dual between the king 
      and Nàgasena. The P stops with these words. &quot;<I>Kim pana Bhante tayà 
      vissajjitanti?&quot; (What have you answered?) &quot;Kim pana mahàràja tayà 
      pucchitanti&quot; (What have you asked, O King?)</I> <I>the C adds two more 
      sentences: &quot;The king said: &quot;I asked nothing&quot;, Na-hsien replied: &quot;I replied 
      nothing.&quot;</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>4. Invitation to come again for discussion:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 54b,2-9)=(P: 29,16-32; 30,1-16)</P>
      <P>Almost the same in both versions with the following differences:</P>
      <P>(a) The C mentions <I>Chan-mi-li-wang-ch&#39;un and other attending 
      ministers</I>=P: <I>Devamantiyo ca Anantakàyo ca Mankuro ca Sabbadinno ca.</P>
      </I>
      <P>(b) In the C version, King Mi-lan became angry and threatened to punish 
      the minister called the Stingy One <I>(P: Sabbadinna)</I>, when the latter 
      insisted on Na-hsien coming accompanied by ten monks only while in the P, 
      Sabbadinna was simply rebuked and silenced by the king.</P>
      <P>(c) Both versions mention that the king departed on horse back, while 
      muttering the name of Nàgasena The C adds that the king thought of 
      Na-hsien up to the next morning.</P>
      <B>
      <P>5. Talk between Anantakàya and Nàgasena:</P>
      </B><I>
      <P>(C: 54, 9-17)=(P: 30,17-31; 31,1-11)</P>
      </I>
      <P>Almost the same. The C mentions that Na-hsien accompanied by 80 monks 
      including Yeh-ho-Lo, while the P refers up to 80.000 monks and omits 
      Ayupàla. In the C, it was Chan-mi-li-wang-ch&#39;un who came alone to Na-hsien 
      and asked Na-hsien some questions, while the P mentions the coming of 
      Devamantiya. Anantakàya and Mankura, and it was Anantakàya who asked 
      question.</P>
      <P>The conversation between Nàgasena and Ananta-kàya is almost the same 
      with the following difference:</P>
      <P>(a) C: <I>A man who blows a reed whistle, a man who blows a goldsmith 
      pipe, a man who blows a horn </I>=P<I>: Vamsadhamaka, Singadhamaka</I>. 
      (K.E. refers to only two cases and omits a person who blows a horn).</P>
      <P>(b) In the P, Anantakàya confessed his inability to converse with such 
      a mighty arguer, in the C, <I>Chan-mi-li-wang-ch&#39;un</I> said that he did 
      not know the interval between breathing in and breathing out and requested 
      Na-hsien to reply.</P>
      <P>(c) In the P, Nàgasena explained that there was no <I>Jìva</I> 
      (principle of life) and that breathing in and out are <I>kàyasankhàra 
      (activities of the body)</I>; in the C, Na-hsien explained that breathing 
      in and breathing out were functions of the body, speaking was a function 
      of the tongue, and doubt in the mind was a function of the mind, each had 
      its own master; but if one analysed and looked at them, it was only empty 
      space, there was no Na-hsien.</P>
      <P>(d) The P mentions that Nàgasena referred to Abhidhamma to explain to 
      Anantakàya with such an effect that the latter became a lay-disciple; in 
      the C, there is no mention of Abhidharma, Chan-mi-li-wang-ch&#39;un understood 
      Na-hsien&#39;s explanation, accepted the five precepts and became a 
      lay-disciple.</P>
      <B>
      <P>6. Another meeting between Nàgasena and King Milinda:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 54b, 17-20; 55a,1) = (P: 31, 12-26)</P>
      <P>King Milinda&#39;s reception to Nàgasena is almost the same in both 
      versions, except that in the C, King Mi-lan paid homage to Na-hsien and 
      after their meal, offered to each monk a robe with a pair of sandals and 
      to Na-hsien and Y<I>eh-ho-lo</I> a set of three robes and a pair of 
      sandals. And when only ten monks remained behind with <I>Na-hsien</I>, 
      King <I>Mi-lan</I> ordered his lady-folk to sit behind a curtain and 
      witness the conversation. The P omits the offering of sandals, the 
      presence of Ayupàla and that of lady-folk. It adds that King Milinda took 
      a lower seat and sat down.</P>
      <B>
      <P>7. Aim of adopting a religious life:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 55a, I-6)=(P: 31, 27-32, I-II)</P>
      <P>Milinda&#39;s question is almost the same in both versions, except that the 
      C puts the highest aim of religious life first, while the P puts it after. 
      Nàgasena&#39;s answer is not exactly the same.</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>We want to eradicate suffering of the present world and do not 
      want suffering of the next world. For this purpose, we adopt the religious 
      life. We consider it to be the highest good&quot;.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>Our adoption of a religious life is to eradicate this suffering 
      and to prevent other suffering to arise. Our supermundane aim is the 
      Parinibbàna without clinging.&quot;</I> </P>
      <P>Among the categories of monks who go forth, the P adds one extra, those 
      who go forth for fear of robbers. </P>
      <P>C: <I>Those who go forth for fear of officials</I>.</P>
      <I>
      <P>=P: Those who go forth for fear of kings. </P>
      <P>C: Those who go forth because of poverty.</P>
      <P>=P: Those who go forth for the sake of livelihood.</P>
      </I>
      <P>C: <I>There are those who really want to eradicate suffering of the 
      present life and of the next life, so they go forth</I> </P>
      <P>=P: <I>Those who go forth rightly are those who go forth for the only 
      purpose (of eradicating this suffering and preventing further suffering to 
      arise.</I>) The rest is almost the same, except that the wording is 
      slightly different.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(8) About rebirth:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 55a, 6-10)=(p: 32, 12-32; 33. 1-10)</P>
      <P>Here the C uses one paragraph, while the P uses three paragraphs with 
      Milinda&#39;s praise: &quot;<I>Kallo si Bhante Nàgasenàti&quot;</I> separating them. 
      Both versions are almost the same. With the following differences:</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>People who have craving and longing for sense-desires are to be 
      reborn in the next life, those who have no craving, no longing for 
      sense-desires are not to be reborn in the next life&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P:&quot;<I>He who is with depravity (sankileso) will be reborn, he who is 
      without depravity (nikkileso) will not be reborn.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>Here the P adds that when questioned by the king if he were to be 
      reborn or not, Nàgasena replied that if he were with clinging, he would be 
      reborn; if he were without clinging, he would not be reborn. Both versions 
      agree that it is on account of three factors that one was not to be 
      reborn.</P>
      <P>While wisdom and other good qualities are the same, the C mentions: &quot;<I>Thinking 
      of the right dharma with one-mindedness</I>,&quot; While the P prefers <I>
      Yoniso manasikàro</I> for the first factor. The difference between <I>
      Pannà</I> and <I>Yoniso manasikàra</I> is clearly stated in the P, that <I>
      sheep, goats, oxen, buffaloes, camels, asses have right consideration but 
      not Pann</I>à, but the C states that <I>oxen, horses, the six domestic 
      anomals have wisdom but their heart (or mind) is diferent.</P>
      </I>
      <P>In the P, <I>Uhana (examination)</I> is considered to be the 
      characteristic of <I>right consideration</I> and <I>chedana</I> as the 
      characteristic of <I>wisdom</I>. Here Nàgasena quoted the simile of <I>
      wheat reapers</I> (<I>yavalàvak</I>à), who with their left hand took hold 
      of the wheat, and with sickle in their right hand cut the wheat, to 
      illustrate that the <I>recluse by right consideration took hold of the 
      mind and by wisdom cut off his depravities.</P>
      </I>
      <P>But the C, while quoting the same simile, mentions simply that <I>men 
      endowed with wisdom, eradicate craving and sense-desire just like the 
      wheat-reapers.</I> Here the P is far clearer than the C.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(9) Other good qualities:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 55a, 10-20; 55b. I)=(P: 33, II-14; 34, 26-30; 35; 36, I-18)</P>
      <B>
      <P>(a) Other six qualities: </B>C: <I>Faith, filial piety, exertion, 
      thinking of good, one-mindedness, wisdom</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P (Only five<I>): Morality, faith, exertion, concentration, wisdom</I>.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(b) Faith:</B> Almost the same with the following differences: The P 
      omits the definition of <I>faith,</I> as described in the following terms 
      in the C text: &quot;<I>Faith means without doubts. Faith in the existence of 
      the Buddha, the Buddha-dharma and of the Order of monks; faith in the 
      existence of Arahants, in the existence of the present world, of the next 
      world; faith in the existence of filial piety towards parents; faith in 
      good remuneration from good actions, in bad remuneration from bad 
      actions.&quot;</I> </P>
      <P>While the P mentions the characteristic of faith as <I>sampasàdanà </I>
      (tranquillizing, serenity) and <I>sampakkhandanà </I>(aspiration, 
      emulation) the C mentions simply: &quot;<I>When one obtains faith, the mind 
      becomes pure and the five bad qualities are eradicated.</P>
      </I>
      <P>C: <I>Five bad qualities </I>=P: <I>Nìvaranàni.</P>
      </I>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>If these five bad qualities are removed, then the mind is pure.</I>&quot;</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>When faith arises, the hindrances are eradicated. The mind, 
      free from hindrances, becomes clear, purified, unstained</I>&quot;. The simile 
      of the purifying gem is almost the same except that the P offers more 
      details.</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>Water-purifying gem (or) gem clear like a brilliant moon&quot;=P: 
      &quot;Udakappasàdako mani</I>&quot;.</P>
      <P>The five bad qualities mentioned by the C are: <I>lust, anger, sloth 
      and torpor (K.E.: proness to lying down),</I> <I>sport and enjoyment</I> 
      (K.E.: Songs and enjoyment), <I>doubt,</I> while the P mentions simply <I>
      Nìvaranàni</I>.</P>
      <P>As to the second characteristic of faith, the C puts it into another 
      paragraph while the P combines the two characteristics into one. Here both 
      versions are almost the same. </P>
      <P>C: <I>&#39;Faith as exertion or endeavour&#39;</P>
      <P>= P: &quot;Sampakkhandanalakkhanà</I>.&quot; </P>
      <P>The simile is almost the same but the quotation is rather different.
      </P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>He whose heart has faith can save himself. People of the world 
      can check and overcome the five sense-desires by themselves</I>. <I>He who 
      knows that body is suffering can save himself. People with the help of 
      windom achieve their morality&quot;</I> (1)</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>With faith he crosses the ocean; by vigilance, the ocean of 
      life; by exertion, he gets over suffering; by wisdom, he purifies 
      (himself).</I>&quot;</P>

      <P>(c) C: Filial piety = P: Sìla:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 55b. 1-13) = (P: 33, 14-32; 34, 1-25)</P>
      <P>The C translation of <I>Filial piety</I> is rather misleading, although 
      the definition in both versions is almost the same. The C mentions <I>the 
      37 qualities (leading) to Bodhi</I> and follows the usual order, while the 
      P mentions: <I>
      indriya-bala-bojjhanga-magga-satipatthàna-sammappadhàna-iddhipàda-jhàna- 
      vimo-kkha-samàpatti.</I> Here the C is more with details as it gives the 
      definition of all the 37 qualities, which makes an interesting study when 
      compared with the usual P definition.</P>

      <P>C: (Ssu-i-chih): </I>with <I>sati</I> translated as I and <I>upatthàna</I> 
      as <I>chih</I> (meaning to rest). The later translators prefer <I>
      Ssu-nien-ch&#39;u</I> which interprets <I>upatthàna</I> as place. The four 
      are: <I>Kuan-shen-shen chih</I> (not shen-shen-kuan-chih as in the text):

      <P>The C refers to <I>the four eradications of the mind</I>, while the

      translator interpreted <I>padhàna</I> as <I>pahàna</I>. The later 
      translators opted for the term <I>Ssu-cheng-chin</I> (the four right 
      exertions). The definiti-on here is rather curious: &quot; <I>The Buddha said: 
      Having analysed the four resting places of the mind, one would not think 
      any further, this is called the four eradications of the mind&quot;</I>. Thus 
      it is far different from the usual P definitions. </P>
      <P>(K.E. mentions simply four things which are as follows: C<I>heck on

      of bad dharmas from the heart; prevention of good dharmas in the heart

      <P>(K. E.: &quot;<I>Again there are four things which one can perform as one

      astringent tastes, but there is no attachment of the mind to them; when 
      the body receives harsh, rough touches, there is no dislike.</I>&quot; Thus 
      here the C interpretation is totally different from the usual P 
      explanation: <I>saddhindr-iyam, viriyindriyam, satindriyam, 
      samàdhi-ndriyam, pannindriyam. </P>
      <P>(K.E. explanation is as follows: faith, filial piety, exertion,

      <P>C: &quot;<I>Control of the eyes, control of the ears, control of the nose, 
      control of the mouth, control of the body so that the mind does not fall</I>

      <P>(vi) C: Ch&#39;i-chueh-i=P: Sattabojjhangàni</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>Here the C uses the expression <I>I</I> (mind) for <I>anga</I>. The

      meaning of the expression. C:<I> Mind, discrimination, exertion, joy,

      (serenity) for <I>passaddhi</I>, <I>Hu </I>(Protection) for <I>upekkh</I>à.

      <I><B>
      <P>(viii) Similes</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>Both versions resort to four similes to illustrate that good qualities 
      depend upon Sìla or morality as foundation. They are not exactly in the 
      same order and the explanations are almost the same with the P offering 
      more details. </P>
      <P>C 1=P 2; C 2=P I; C 3=P 3; C 4=P 4. </P>
      <P>Thus in C 3=P 3, the C mentions simply that if an architect wants to 
      build a big town, first he should measure and lay the foundation then he 
      will be able to build the town. But the P mentions more details, such as 
      clearing the place where the town is located, the removal of all stumps 
      and thorns, the levelling of the earth, then the laying out of streets, 
      squares, cross-roads, etc and so he build the city.</P>
      <P>The C concludes this passage with Na-hsien saying that <I>if one thinks 
      of the Dharma with one-mindedness, lust and craving would cease by 
      themselves.</I> The P here quotes two gàthàs, the first is the same with 
      the introductory gàthà of Visuddhimag-ga and both gàthas emphasize that S<I>ìla 
      should be the basis for all spiritual developments and attainments.</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>(d) Exertion</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 55b, 13-17)=(P: 36, 19-41; 37, 1-4)</P>
      <P>Almost the same.</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>To hold fast to good qualities, to support good qualities&quot;.</I> 
      (K.E. Only to support good qualities)</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>With the support of exertion, all good qualities do not vanish 
      away&quot;.</I> In the first simile, the P speaks of a falling house, the C 
      adds one more instance, that of a wall on the verge of collapsing.</P>
      <P>The second simile is almost the same in both versions, except that the 
      C adds that people with bad qualities are like the weak army. When people 
      use good qualities to destroy bad qualities, it is like the king who sends 
      reinforcements to the weak army. With the help of five good qualities, one 
      destroys the five bad qualities, just as the reinforced army wins over the 
      battle.</P>
      <P>In the C, Na-hsien concluded this paragraph by saying that exertion 
      helped people attain the meritorious path, and go beyond the worldly path 
      without falling back again; the P quotes a saying of the Blessed One, 
      explaining that <I>the noble disciple with the help of exertion eradicates 
      evil, cultivates good qualities, eradicates what is faulty, cultivates 
      what is not censurable and thus purifying himself</I>.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(e) C: Mindfulness=P: Sati</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 55b, 17-20; 56a. 1-2)=(P: 37, 5-34; 38, 1-17)</P>
      <P>Here the C uses the term <I>I</I> (Mind) to translate the term <I>Sati</I>. 
      C: &quot;<I>Mind thinks of demeritorious dharma =P: &quot;Sati apilàpanalakkhanà.&quot;</I>
      </P>
      <P>Here the C explains that the trainee in the Dharma should be mindful of 
      the 37 qualities leading to enlightenment. With his mindfulness, he knows 
      the meritorious and the demeritorious, what should be practised, what 
      should not be practised; he distinguishes between the black ones and the 
      white ones. Having pondered over he then gives up the demeritorious and 
      cultivates the meritorious. The P explanation is almost the same and it 
      adds more good dhammas such as <I>samatho, vipassanà, vijjà, vimutti</I>.</P>
      <P>As for similes, the C adds an extra one about a man who uses a thread 
      to string various flowers together and thus they are not scattered by the 
      wind. </P>
      <P>The simile of a treasurer of a universal monarch is almost the same in 
      both versions, except that the C simile omits the enumeration of 
      elephants, horses, chariots, infantry, adds gem, jade, glassy matters, 
      precious stones. In the second explanation, the C mentions that 
      mindfulness helps to allow in only meritorious dharmas and to keep out 
      demeritorious dharmas.</P>
      <P>Here the P mentions <I>upaganhana</I> as the second characteristic of 
      Sati in the sense that Sati helps to select out the qualities which are 
      beneficial from those which are not beneficial, the good qualities from 
      tha bad ones. The simile is almost the same in both versions. The C adds a 
      quotation from a sùtra by Na-hsien as follows: &quot;<I>One should protect and 
      check one&#39;s mind and the six cravings in one&#39;s own body</I> (?). <I>With 
      the strict check and holding fast of the mind, one can transcend the 
      world&quot;,</I> while the P mentions that Sati is useful to all.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(f) C: Concentration=P: Samàdhi</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 56a, 2-5)=(P: 38, 18-32; 39, 1-4)</P>
      <P>Almost the same in both versions. Except some epithets more or less. In 
      the C, the concluding sentence is a quotation from the Scriptures as 
      follows: &quot;<I>One-mindedness is the foundation of all good qualities. The 
      trainee in the Dharma should first take refuge in one-mindedness. The 
      man&#39;s body is subject to birth and death so many times in the past, just 
      like the water flowing down the current, always in constant succession, 
      without interruption</I>.&quot; The P quotes the Blessed One saying: &quot;<I>O 
      monks, you should cultivate concentration; he who is concentrated knows 
      things as they really are</I>.&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>(g) C: Wisdom=P: Pannà</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 56a, 5-8)=(P: 39, 5-21)</P>
      <P>Almost the same in both versions. C: &quot;<I>To lighten the meritorious 
      dharmas&quot;</I>=P: <I>Obhàsanalakkhan</I>à.Here the P adds that wisdom makes 
      the four noble truths clearer and helps the yogàvacara realise the three 
      characteristics of impermanence, suffering and no-self, while the C simply 
      refers that the man endowed with wisdom is able to transcend the suffering 
      of birth and death. Here the C adds another simile of a man cutting down 
      the trees with a knife to show that wisdom is like a sharp knife cutting 
      down demetorious dharmas. The other similes are almost the same.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(h) The meritorious dharmas</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 56a, 8-10)=(P: 39, 22-32)</P>
      <P>Almost the same. In this passage, Nàgasena shows that although 
      meritorious dhammas are different, they serve the same purpose of 
      eradicating the demeritorious dhammas. The simile is almost the same. At 
      the end of Mi-lan&#39;s praise, the C adds the king saying that Na-hsien 
      quoted the Scriptures very readily.</P>

      <P>(1) The person who is reborn, does he remain the same or become 
      another?</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 56a, 10-20; 56b, I) (P: 40; 41, 1-10)</P>
      <P>The explanation is almost the same in both versions, but the 
      expressions used and the details contained therein are not exactly the 
      same. C: &quot;<I>When a man dies and is reborn in a meritorious or in a 
      demeritorious realm, the spirit of the body who is reborn, does it remain 
      the same as the old one or not remain the same?&quot;</I> =P: &quot;<I>He who is 
      reborn does he remain the same or become another</I>?&quot;</P>
      <P>Here the C uses the expression: &quot;<I>The spirit of the body.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>Nàgasena asked the king whether the latter was the same or another when 
      he was a baby and now he grew up, the latter replied that he and the child 
      were different.</P>
      <P>Then Nàgasena objected that if it were so, then the King had no mother, 
      no father, no teacher, no learning, no morality, no wisdom. The C is the 
      same but it omits the objection raised by Nàgasena.</P>
      <P>The next question is rather different in both versions. C: Na-hsien 
      asked &quot;<I>When a man is in the womb of the mother, the embryo which is 
      just formed and the embryo which become turbid, and when it assumed skin 
      and flesh; when he is newly born and when he is some years old, is the old 
      embryo the same throughout? When a man learns a book, can another man do 
      that work for him?&quot;</I> The king replied that another man could not do the 
      work for him.</P>
      <P>Again Na-hsien asked: &quot;<I>If a man infringes the law and is punished, 
      can a non-guilty one replace him?&quot;</I> The king replied: &quot;<I>This cannot 
      be</I>.&quot; In the P, Nàgasena asked: &quot;<I>Is the mother of the embryo in 
      abbuda</I>...pesi....ghana stages... <I>Is the mother of a child of some 
      years old different from the mother of a grown-up person? Is the person in 
      the training stage different from the person who has finished his 
      training? Is the person who is an evil doer different from the person who 
      has his hands and feet cut off? </I>And the king replied: &quot;<I>Certainly 
      not</I>.&quot;</P>
      <P>The simile of a lamp burning throughout the night and of the milk 
      turning simultaneously into curd, butter, ghee are almost the same in both 
      versions. with some differences in details and expressions.</P>
      <P>But the summing up passage offers an interesti-ng reading in both the C 
      and the P text. C: &quot;<I>The spirit of a man goes on continuously like this, 
      one goes away, one comes into being. From one spirit, one is born, becomes 
      old and dies. From the last spirit, one is reborn again to a new life and 
      goes on continuously, thus it is not the same with the old spirit nor it 
      is different from the old spirit. After death the spirit would go to be 
      reborn again.&quot;</I> </P>
      <P>The P is rather simpler: &quot;<I>Thus, O King, the continuity of states is 
      maintained, one comes into existence and another passes away, the 
      continuity seems to be neither earlier nor later</I>. <I>Thus, it is 
      neither the same nor the other, but the being goes together with the last 
      consciousness.</P>

      <P>(2) The person who is free from rebith, is he aware of this?</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C:56b, 1-5)=(P: 41, 11-28)</P>
      <P>There is not much difference between the two versions, except the 
      following: C: &quot;<I>When he knows by himself that there is no craving no 
      sense-desire, no use of bad qualities, then he knows that he will not be 
      reborn&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>With the cessation of cause (hetu) and condition (paccaya), he 
      knows that he will not be reborn.&quot;</I> </P>
      <P>The simile is almost the same, with the P offering more details. While 
      the P adopts the same concluding passage, the C offers a slightly 
      different reading. &quot;<I>The man who obtains the Path is the same. When he 
      knows by himself that he has already eradicated craving pleasant and 
      painful feelings, with a mind devoid of desire, then he knows that he will 
      not be reborn.</I>&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>(3) Intelligence and wisdom.</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 56a, 5-20)=(P: 41, 29-31; 42, 1-18)</P>
      <P>The subject-matter is the same, but there are many different details 
      between the two versions. The P begins with a question put by the king as 
      to a man who had intelligence, if he also possessed wisdom and to the 
      positive reply of Nàgasena, the king asked if both were the same and 
      Nàgasena replied also in the positive.</P>
      <P>The C starts with a question not available in the P: &quot;<I>The man who is 
      not to be reborn again, does he possess wisdom which is different from 
      (other) people?</I>&quot; And Na-hsien replied: &quot;Yes&quot;.</P>
      <P>The next two questions are similar to the P ones. While the C simply 
      mentions that what he did not learn before was beyond his understanding, 
      the P adds two more that is: <I>Agatapubbadisàya</I> and <I>
      assutapubbanàmapannattiya</I> (places not yet visited and names and 
      expressions not yet heard).</P>
      <P>While the P mentions the three characteristics <I>anicca, dukkha and 
      anatta</I> (impermanence, suffering and no-self) which are realized by 
      those who possess wisdom, the C text presents a slightly different 
      reading: &quot;<I>The man endowed with wisdom sees that people and things are 
      always gone to the past (anicca) returm to emptiness (sunnata) and not 
      independent (anatta); what the man&#39;s heart craves for and delights in are 
      the source of all suffering and are leading to suffering. The man endowed 
      with wisdom knows the impermanence, the rise and the fall of all matters.</I>&quot;</P>
      <P>As to the passage in which Nàgasena showed to King Milinda that wisdom 
      having done its work would disappear while the work (that is understanding 
      of the three characteristics of impermance, suffering and no-self) would 
      remain, both versions are almost the same. The simile of a letter written 
      at night, of the five pots to put out the five, of the doctor using five 
      kinds of medicine, of the warrior using five arrows is almost the same 
      with some details more or less.</P>
      <P>One difference here is to be noted.</P>
      <P>The five good qualities mentioned are not exactly the same.</P>
      <P>C: <I>(i) Faith in goodness and in the existence of evil (?), (ii) not 
      infringing the precepts, (iii) energy, (iv) endowed with wisdom, mindful 
      of good, (v) one-mindedness in reflecting on the Dharma.</P>
      <P>=</I>P:<I> Saddhindriyam, viriyindriyam, satindriyam, samàdhindriyam, 
      pannindriyam.</P>
      </I>
      <P>(K. E. Only the 1<SUP>st</SUP> portion is available. Its last portion 
      refers to something else, which is not relevant to the passage in 
      question).</P>
      <B>
      <P>4. Feeling suffered by the emancipated one:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 56b, 20; 57a, 1-4) (P: 44, 19-34; 45, 1-7)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with these two differences:</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>He is liable to suffer bodily pain because the view on body 
      still exists; he is not liable to mental pain, because the mind has got 
      rid of demeritorious dharmas, without any desire&quot;.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P. &quot;<I>He is liable to suffer bodily pain because the cause and the 
      condition of bodily pain still exist; he is not liable to suffer mental 
      pain because the cause and the condition of mental pain do not exist. The 
      Blessed One has said: &quot;He feels only one kind of feeling, bodoly feeling, 
      not mental feeling.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>The rest is almost the same, but the C text seems to have missed one 
      line with these questions from the king in succession. Sàriputta&#39;s gàthà 
      is not exactly the same in both versions.</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>I do not seek for death, I do not seek for birth. I only bide my 
      time; when my time comes, I shall go&quot; (Not exactly in gàthà form).</P>
      </I>
      <P>P<I>: &quot;Neither death nor life I welcome. I bide my time, aware and 
      mindful&quot;. (K.E. not available).</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>5. Different kinds of feelings</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 57a, 9-19; 57b, 1-10)=(P: 45, 8-30; 46, 1-40)</P>
      <P>Not exactly the same in both versions. In the P, the king asked if a 
      pleasant feeling was good, or evil or neutral, and Nàgasena replied that 
      it might be any one of these three, then the king refuted that if these 
      dhammas were good, they could not be painful; and if they were painful 
      they could not be good, the good dhammas could not be painful.</P>
      <P>The C is different and not so clear. The king asked if a man is 
      unhappy, is it <I>kusala</I> or <I>akusala</I>? (The Buddha&#39;s reply is 
      given in words which are not clear). The king said: &quot;<I>It is as if the 
      conditioned dharmas have no suffering</I>&quot; (?). </P>
      <P>The next passage in which Nàgasena used the simile of a man holding at 
      the same time a hot iron ball and a lump of ice is almost the same in both 
      versions.</P>
      <P>But the passage in which Nàgasena explained various kind of feelings is 
      different.</P>
      <P>The P refers to the Abhidhamma classification of 108 kinds of feelings: 
      Three kinds of pleasant, unpleasant and neutral feelings, each divided 
      into six kinds of feelings connected with the world and six kinds of 
      feelings connected with renunciation, then it comes to 36 feelings. These 
      feelings are again</P>

      <P>(1) The root of the past, of the future, of the present:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 58b, 3-8) = (P: 50. 10-22)</P>
      <P>Both versions explain that <I>ignorance</I> is the root cause of the 
      past, of the future and of the present, but while the P follows this 
      explanation with the Law of <I>Paticcasamuppàda</I> along with the usual 
      twelve <I>nidànas</I> from <I>avijjà</I> up to <I>
      jarà-maranam-soka-parideva dukkha-domanass-upàyàs</I>à, the C also adopts 
      the same explanation but this chain of causation is not the same as that 
      of the P.</P>
      <P>The C order is as follows: <I>(1) ignorance, (2) spirit (shen), (3) 
      body, (4) name, (5) form, (6) the six knowledges, (7) their touch with 
      their respective object, (8) knowledge of pain and happiness, (9) 
      attachment, craving, (10) lust, desire, (11) becoming, (12) birth, (13) 
      old age, (14) disease, (15</I>) <I>death, (16) lamentation, (17) grief, 
      (18) inner despair.</P>
      </I>
      <P>If we put <I>name</I> and <I>form</I> together, <I>old age</I>, <I>
      disease, death, lamentation, grief, inner despair</I> together, it comes 
      to the same number twelve as in P. The C <I>soul</I> for <I>sankhàr</I>à,
      <I>body</I> for <I>vinnàna</I>, <I>six knowledges</I> for <I>salàyatana</I>,
      <I>lust and desire</I> for <I>upàdàna</I> are rather forceful and testify 
      that the Chinese translator was not yet fully conversant with the terms of 
      the law and could not properly render them into Chinese. The later Chinese 
      translators adopted the same terminology with the P text. (K. E. not 
      available).</P>
      <B>
      <P>(2) Birth and death have no end.</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 58b, 8-19) = (P: 50, 23-27; 51, 1-24).</P>
      <P>Almost the same in both versions. C: &quot;<I>Due to that, birth and death 
      have no end the old former body cannot be obtained&quot;.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>The ultimate point in the poast is not known</I>.&quot; The three 
      similes to illustrate this passage are almost the same in both versions. 
      The P further quotes an explanation of the Buddha about the Law of 
      Paticcasamuppàda, starting with the eyes: &quot;<I>Dependent on eyes and 
      material forms, eye consciousness arise. The meeting of these three 
      factors is touch. Dependent upon touch, arise feelings; dependent upon 
      feelings arises craving; from craving arises action (kamma); from kamma, 
      eyes arise; then the circle starts again.</I> The C explanation is almost 
      the same. But it adds: &quot;<I>From craving arise lust and desire; from lust 
      and desire arises becoming; from becoming, arises birth; from birth there 
      arise good activities and bad activities; from good and bad activities, 
      birth arises.</I>&quot; (In the same way, with the other àyatanas and their 
      respective objects). (K. E. not available).</P>
      <B>
      <P>(3) The root cause of birth and death cannot be obtained:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 58b, 19-20; 59a, 1-3) = (P: 51, 25-35; 52, 1-9)</P>
      <P>Both versions are not the same. Some passages of the C text are rather 
      obscure to understand as some lines are missing. The C explains that the 
      root-cause of birth and death cannot be obtained and for mankind, craving 
      and desire are the root cause of birth and death. </P>
      <P>The P mentions that the ultimate point in the past can not be 
      perceived, but some can be perceived. The point of the past before the 
      start of the origin cannot be perceived. But the beginning of each link 
      can be perceived. (K. E. not available).</P>
      <B>
      <P>(4) The positive and negative aspects of the Law of Dependent 
      Origination.</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 59a, 3-10) = (P: 52, 10-27)</P>
      <P>Almost the same in both versions except some differences in 
      expressions. The C starts first with the coming together of the sense 
      organs, their respective objects and their respective consciousnesses. 
      From this coming together arise painful and pleasant feelings, which give 
      rise to craving; from craving, attachment and desire arise; from 
      attachment, from desire arise the aggregates of suffering which constitute 
      a human being. Eyes, ears, mouth, body, soul (mind), consciousness, cause 
      touch (?) to arise; from touch arise painful and pleasant feelings; from 
      painful and pleasant feelings arises craving; from craving arise desire 
      and attachment; from desire and attachment arises becoming; from becoming 
      arise birth; from birth arise old age and disease, from disease arise 
      death; from death arises grief, from grief arises lamentation; from 
      lamentation arises pain in the heart. Human life is like that.</P>
      <P>Then the C deals with this Law of Dependent Origination in the negative 
      way, starting first with the non-existence of eyes, the non-seeing of 
      material form, resulting in non-knowledge (or rather non- consciousness). 
      Due to non-knowledge, there is non coming together; due to the non-coming 
      together, there are no painful, no pleasant feelings; due to no-painful, 
      no pleasant feelings, there is no craving; due to no-craving there is no 
      desire, no attachment; due to no-desire, no attachment, there is no 
      becoming; due to no-becoming, there is no birth, no old age; due to no 
      birth, no old age, there is no sickness, no death; due to no sickness, no 
      death, there is no grief, no lamentation; due to no grief, no lamentation, 
      there is no suffering in the inner heart; due to no such suffering, one is 
      emancipated and obtains Nirvàna. (The same is said of the other 
      sense-organs).</P>
      <B>
      <P>(5) Everything is generated from some causes, not without causes:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 59a, 10-15) = (P: 52, 28-32; 53; 54; 1-16)</P>
      <P>Almost the same. While the P uses the term <I>sankhàr</I>à which come 
      into being not without a gradual becoming <I>(bhavanta</I>), the C 
      mentions in a general way that in the world, everything is generated from 
      causes, not without causes; and as a summing up for each simile, the C 
      mentions that due to the coming together of elements(<I>dhàtus</I>), a man 
      comes into being.</P>
      <P>As to the similes, the C mentions only six similes while the P adds 
      another extra, about trees, which come into existence due to sowing seeds 
      in the earth. The remaining six similes are of the same purport, but there 
      are some slight differences as to the wording and the expressions.</P>
      <I>
      <P>C1 = P1</I>:</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>Wall, mud, soil come from earth&quot; </P>
      <P>= P: &quot;This mud come from the earth&quot;. </I>It adds<I>: &quot;With the exertion 
      of women and men:.</P>

      <P>C: &quot; A potter takes the earth, water, makes it into mud, shapes it into 
      various forms and burns them&quot; </P>
      <P>= P: &quot;A potter digs up the clay out of the earth and shapes it into 
      various vessels.&quot;</P>
      <P>C3 = P4:</P>
      <P>C: &quot;A lute without strings, without frame, without people playing 
      cannot produce sound&quot; </P>
      <P>= P: &quot;A lute without sling (patta), without leather, without belly 
      (doni), without arm, without neck, without strings, without plectrum, 
      without man&#39;s effort.&quot;</P>
      <P>C4 = P5:</P>
      <P>C: Without both sticks, without man&#39;s twirling&quot;</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;Without lower piece of wood (arani), without twirling stick 
      (aranìpotako), without twirling cord (araniyottakam), without upper piece 
      of wood (uttaràrani) without tinder (colakam), without man&#39;s effort.&quot;</P>
      <P>C5 = P6:</P>
      <P>C: &quot;Without holding a speculum, without sun, without sky&quot;.</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;Without gem, without heat, without cow-dung, fire cannot be 
      produced.&quot;</P>
      <P>C6 = P7:</P>
      <P>C: &quot;Without mirror, without light, if one wants to see one&#39;s own 
      image.&quot;</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;Without mirror, without light, without face.&quot; </I>(K. E. not 
      available).</P>
      <B>
      <P>(6) Is there an individuality or a soul?</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 59a,19-20;59b,1-16)=(P; 54,17-64;55;56;57,1-3)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, but the wording as well as the exposition is rather 
      different. In the P, the king asked if there was a thing called Vedagù 
      (soul) and Nàgasena asked what <I>vedagù</I> was. Then the king explained 
      that <I>vedagù</I> was the living principle inside the body, which saw 
      forms with the eyes, heard sounds with the ears, smelt odours with the 
      nose, savoured tastes with the tongue, felt touches with the body and 
      thought if things with the mind, just as they were sitting in the palace 
      and looked out of any window,</P>
      <P>Then Nàgasena asked if it was possible for the living principle in the 
      body to see forms not only through the eyes, but through the other organs 
      as well and the king replied in the negative. The same should be said of 
      the other four sense-organs and the mind.</P>
      <P>The C is rather different. It starts with the king&#39;s question if in the 
      world there was what was called a man (not a soul) and Na-hsien replied in 
      the negative and he asked the king what he meant by a man. And the king 
      replied that the living principle in the body was called a man. </P>
      <P>Then Na-hsien asked the king if that man in the body could use eyes to 
      see material forms, use the mind to think, and the king replied in the 
      positive. Then Na-hsien asked the king if it was possible for them to see 
      anything they liked through the windows, now that they were sitting in the 
      palace with windows open to four directions and the king replied in the 
      positive.</P>
      <P>Then Na-hsien asked the king if it was possible for the living 
      principle in the body to use any kind of orifice to see material forms, 
      such as the ears to see material forms, the nose to see material forms... 
      and the king replied in the negative. The same should be said of the other 
      four sense-organs and the mind.</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>The king&#39;s speeches before and after did not agree to each other</I>&quot;.</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;Ma kho te mahàràja yujjati purimena và pacchimam pacchimena và 
      purimam (What you said later did not agree to what you had said before, 
      what you had said before did not agree to what you said later&quot;.</P>
      <P>The other three instances were used by Nàgasena to show that while the 
      sense-organs in appropriate conditions could work far and wide, the living 
      principle inside the body was limited by the powers of the sense-organs 
      themselves. These instances are almost the same in both versions, except 
      the following differences:</P>
      <P>C: <I>The treasurer or storekeeper</I> = P: <I>Dinna</I>. </P>
      <P>C: <I>A big jar of wine</I> =P: <I>A trough full of honey</I>.</P>
      <P>But the conclusion of this passage is rather different. Here Nàgasena 
      explained the non-existence of the soul with reference to the Abhidhamma 
      exposition, that due to eyes and material forms, eye-consciousness arises 
      and with the coming together of these three factors the following dhammas 
      arise together: <I>phasso, vedanà, sannà, cetanà, ekaggatà jìvitindriyam, 
      manasikaro</I>. The remaining sense-organs are dealt with in the same way.</P>
      <P>The C explanation is rather different and curious. C: &quot;<I>Man, owing to 
      the eyes, sees material forms. Then the soul craves for </I>(soul here is 
      in the sense of individual). <I>Due to the soul shaking, there arise 
      painful and pleasant feelings, thoughts, mindfulness which come up 
      together</I>. In the same way with the ears, the nose, the mouth, the body 
      and the mind. Due to the mind and objects <I>of the mind, the soul has 
      craving. Due the soul craving, there arise painful and pleasant feelings. 
      From painful and pleasant feelings arise thoughts, arises mindfulness and 
      gradually up to the notion of impermanence.</I> (K. E. not available).</P>
      <B>
      <P>(7) Eye-consciousness and mind-consciousness.</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C:59b, 16-20; 60a, 1-11) = (P: 57, 4-30; 58;59;60, 1-2)</P>
      <P>In this passage, Nàgasena showed to the king that where 
      eye-consciousness ( as well as other consciousnesses) arose, 
      mind-consciousness also arose, and that the former arose first, the latter 
      came next, but there was no order, no command, no intercourse between 
      them; and such a phenomenon happened <I>due to bending down, due to the 
      existence of a door, due to habit and due to practice.</P>
      </I>
      <P>Then Nàgasena explained them with appropriate similes to the king. Both 
      versions are almost the same, with the following differences:</P>
      <I>
      <P>C: Spirit (sheùn)=P: Manovinnànam.</P>
      <P>C: Eye=P: Eye-consciousness.</P>
      <P>C: Due to the track of the car.</P>
      <P>=P: Cinnattà (travelled over, made a habit of).</P>
      <P>C: By repetition (shu)=P: Samudàcaritattà.</P>
      </I>
      <P>In the third simile, while the P simply mentions that the second cart 
      follows the first, the C says that the second cart follows the track left 
      by the first.</P>
      <P>In the fourth simile, both texts are not the same. While the P mentions 
      that in matter of such crafts like muddà gananà sankhà lekhà, the beginner 
      is rather slow and clumsy, but by dint of practice, he becomes an expert, 
      the C is rather different. Here the term used is <I>shu</I>, meaning <I>
      repetition</I> and also <I>counting,</I> <I>calculating; books, 
      commentaries, learning</I> are called <I>repetition</I>. And it proceeds 
      to show that due to the coming together of all the six consciousnesses, 
      there arises knowledge, but not due to one consciousness. (K. E. not 
      available).</P>
      <B>
      <P>(8) Contact:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 60a, 11-14) = (P: 60, 3-25)</P>
      <P>Although the definition of contact is almost the same in both versions, 
      yet there are some differences in expressions and details. While the P 
      mentions that where mind-consciousness arises, there are also contact, 
      feelings, perception, volition, initial thought, sustained thought, the C 
      refers to the coming together of eye (consciousness), painful and pleasant 
      feelings having contact as root. </P>
      <P>The similes are the same in both versions. The first two similes about 
      the two rams, the two hands clashing together are the same. In the third 
      one, the C refers to two stones while the P mentions 2 cymbals (sammà). 
      (K. E. not available).</P>
      <B>
      <P>(9) Feeling:</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 60 a, 14-17) = (P: 60, 26-34; 61, 1-8)</P>
      <P>The definition of feelings and the two similes of a man enjoying 
      sense-pleasures due to some service to the King and of a man who enjoys 
      heavenly pleasure due to his meritorious activities in the past life are 
      the same in both versions with some slight differences as follows:</P>
      <P>C: <I>To feel oneself is happiness.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P: <I>Vedayitalakkhanà vedanà anubhavanà lakk-hanà ca</I> ( 
      Experiencing, Enjoying).</P>
      <P>C: <I>Sense-desires </I>=P: <I>Five kinds of sense-desires</I>.</P>
      <P>C: <I>Past meritorious bodily actions, vocal actions and mental actions</I>.</P>
      <P>=P: <I>Good actions in the past</I>. </P>
      <P>(K. E. not available).</P>
      <B>
      <P>(10) Perception</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 60a, 17-18)=(P: 61, 9-18)</P>
      <P>Slightly diferent. C: <I>Chueh </I>=P: <I>Sannà.</P>
      </I>
      <P>C: <I>To know is perception</I>=P: <I>Sanjànanalakkhana-sannà.</P>
      </I>
      <P>And the P adds: &quot;<I>He recognises blue colour, yellow, red colour, 
      white colour, crimson colour</I>&quot;. The simile of a treasurer who opens a 
      king&#39;s treasure is almost the same except that the objects are different.</P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>Coin, gold, silver, gems, jade, silken fabrics, cotton, mixed 
      scents, mixed colours</I>&quot;.</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>Treasures of the king of blue-yellow-red-white-crimson colours</I>&quot;. 
      (K.E. not available).</P>
      <B>
      <P>(11) Volition</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 60a, 18-20)=(P: 61, 19-32; 62, 1-7)</P>
      <P>Almost the same, with some slight differences. </P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>Due to what one thinks, one acts</I>&quot;.</P>
      <P>=P: &quot;<I>Cetayitalakkhanà cetanà abhisan-kharana-lakkhanà càti</I>&quot;.</P>
      <P>Both similes about a man drinking poison and causes others to drink, 
      about his bad actions and inducing others to perform bad actions are the 
      same. But here the P adds two more similes, the case of a man who drinks 
      ghee, butter, oil, honey, molasses and causes other to drink, and the case 
      of a man who performs good actions and induces others to do the same. 
      These two similes are missing in the C.(K.E. not available).</P>
      <B>
      <P>(12) Consciousness and initial thought</P>
      </B>
      <P>(P: 62, 8-28)</P>
      <P>Here the P adds two passages dealing with the characteristic of 
      consciousness and initial thought with appropriate similes. These two 
      passages are not available in the C. (K. E. not available)</P>
      <B>
      <P>(13) Sustained thought </P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 60a, 20; 60b, 1-2)=(P: 62, 29-31; 63, 1-3)</P>
      <P>Slightly different. C: <I>Inner move </I>=P; <I>Vitakka.</I> </P>
      <P>C: &quot;<I>When there is thought, then there is inner move&quot;.</P>
      </I>
      <P>=P &quot;<I>ANumajjanalakkhano vicàro (Investigation</I>)&quot;. The simile is 
      not exactly the same. The P refers to a <I>copper vessel which is beaten 
      (àkotitam),and produces a humming sound (anuravati); when it is beaten, it 
      is initial thought; when it produces humming sound, it is sustained 
      thought</I>.</P>
      <P>=C: &quot;<I>When the copper plate is put into fire by a man, there is 
      sound; when he raises his hand (?) there is sound. Thus when there is 
      thought, there is inner move.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>Na-hsien said: &quot;<I>When it is burnt, there is vibration (perhaps 
      vitakka), when it produces various sound, there is motion, practice 
      (perhaps vicàra)</I>&quot;. Here the C is not clear. (K. E. not available).</P>

      <B>
      <P>2. Can salt be weighed?</P>
      </B>
      <P>(C: 60b, 6-10) = (P: 64, II-24)</P>
      <P>The purport is the same, but the exposition is rather different. </P>
      <P>The C text runs as follows: &quot;<I>The king again asked Na-hsien: &quot;A man 
      with eyes sees the taste of salt. Can he separately distinguish it</I>?&quot; 
      Na-hsien said: &quot;O<I> King, do you know like that</I>? <I>Can you with the 
      eyes, see and know the taste of salt</I>?&quot; The king said: &quot;<I>Can the eyes 
      know the taste of salt</I>?&quot; Na-hsien said: &quot;A m<I>an uses the tongue to 
      know and distinguish the taste. Man with the tongue can know the taste of 
      salt, but with the eyes cannot know the taste of salt</I>.&quot; The king again 
      asked:&quot;<I>Can a man with the tongue know the taste?&quot;</I> Na-hsien said: &quot;A 
      m<I>an with the tongue can know the taste&quot;</I>. The king asked: &quot;<I>Is the 
      taste of all salt to be known separately by the tongue</I>?&quot; Na-hsien 
      replied: &quot;<I>The taste of all salt is to be known separately by the tongue</I>.&quot; 
      The king again asked Na-hsien: &quot;<I>There is salt brought by chariot, there 
      is salt brought by cow, can the chariot and the cow know the taste of salt</I>?&quot; 
      Na-hsien replied: &quot;<I>The chariot and the cow cannot know the taste of 
      salt</I>.&quot; The king asked Na-hsien: &quot;<I>Can the taste of salt be weighed</I>?&quot; 
      Na-hsien replied: &quot;O <I>King, you only know how to weigh the taste of 
      salt.</I> <I>The taste of salt cannot be weighed. But its weight can be 
      weighed</I>.&quot; The king said: &quot;<I>Very good, very good !&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>The P is not the same in exposition. The P first begins with Nàgasena 
      asking the king if the salt could be known by the eyes. And to the 
      positive reply of the king, the Elder asked him to be careful. Next the 
      king asked: &quot;If all salt is known by the tongue, why does a chariot bring 
      cartloads of salt? Is not salt (taste) only to be brought?&quot; Then Nàgasena 
      explained that it was not possible for the salt (taste) to be brought. 
      Those dhammas were one as to their nature, but different as to their <I>
      range (Gocàra)</I>. Besides salt had heaviness. And this weight could be 
      measured, but the taste of salt could not be measured.</P>
      <P>Here the P mentions the end of the questions asked by King Milinda to 
      Nàgasena, while the C does not even adopt a new paragraph. (K.E. not 
      available).</P>
