    <hr width="25%">
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was eight years ago, amid the
    material comforts of city living and the demanding pressures
    of academic pursuits, that I first encountered the gentle and
    profound teachings of the Buddha. At that time a natural
    curiosity about the nature of the mind, and encounters with
    the concepts of biology and theoretical physics, had awakened
    in me a healthy appetite for intellectual nourishment. It is
    therefore not surprising that I was immediately attracted to
    the philosophical and psychological genius of the Buddha.
    What I at that time accepted intellectually of Buddhism led
    me, in due course, to the practice of meditation, which is
    the central axis of Buddhist spiritual life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I began my meditation practice with
    mindfulness of breathing (<em>anapana-sati</em>) and
    cultivation of loving-kindness (<em>metta-bhavana</em>), two
    techniques widely practised by Theravada Buddhists in Sri
    Lanka, Thailand, and Burma. As I had no teacher at the time,
    and consequently had to rely on a small paperback manual on
    Buddhist meditation, my practice did not really take off. It
    remained intermittent and rather unenthusiastic until some
    five years ago, when I met my Buddhist teacher, the Venerable
    Shravasti Dhammika. He became instrumental in launching me
    into serious and committed meditation practice, practice that
    has continued to the present day. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above preamble sets the
    background for this account of my subjective experiences
    during some two years of practising mindfulness of breathing
    and loving-kindness meditation. In the first half-year, this
    comprised a daily average of fifteen minutes of mindfulness
    of breathing followed by ten minutes of loving-kindness
    meditation. By the second year, the daily average for the two
    types of meditation had increased to about forty minutes and
    twenty minutes respectively. That second year also included
    two semi-intensive retreats. The first retreat lasted four
    days, during which the daily practice time totalled four and
    a half hours; the second was of three days duration, with the
    daily practice time increased to six hours. This, however,
    was not the whole of my meditative regime during the period
    in question. I was also practising general mindfulness (<em>satipatthana</em>)
    as far as possible when not engaged in formal mindfulness of
    breathing and loving-kindness meditation. However, that
    mindfulness practice is not described here. </font></p>
    <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Meditative
    Techniques</font><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness of breathing, or
    anapana-sati, is a traditional Buddhist meditation technique
    aimed at purifying and unifying the mind through sustained
    concentration on the breath during inhalation and exhalation.
    Attention is fixed at the nostrils, at the point against
    which the moving air strikes, because it is there that the
    entry and exit of breath can be observed. No attempt is made
    to hold or stop the breath, or to deliberately deepen or
    force it into a definite time rhythm. As Nyanaponika Thera
    states, &quot;The only task here is to follow the natural
    flow of the breath mindfully and continuously, without a
    break or without unnoticed break.&quot;&nbsp; Any thoughts
    that arise in the course of the meditation are merely noted,
    and attention is gently returned to the point of observation.
    A major goal of the practice is the attainment of states of
    deep unification called <b>jhanas</b>, characterised by total
    immersion of the mind in its object and a progressive
    elimination of thoughts and emotions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation on loving-kindness, or
    metta-bhavna, is another traditional Buddhist meditation
    technique. It has the twofold aim of (a) strengthening the
    quality of unbounded and universal loving-kindness within the
    mind, and (b) attaining the first three jhanas. The practice
    begins with sitting quietly with fully or half closed eyes
    and back erect, and arousing within oneself the emotion of
    joy and kindness. One then silently wishes &quot;May I be
    well and happy,&quot; while suffusing oneself with kind and
    loving emotions. This is followed by evoking the image of
    someone that one respects or likes, and extending these
    emotions to him or her, while wishing, &quot;May you be well
    and happy.&quot; The same procedure is then used in turn for
    a neutral person, a disliked person, and finally for all
    sentient beings. It thus involves a gradual progression in
    the extension of loving-kindness, from the individual to all
    living beings without exception, and in all directions: in
    front, to the right, behind, to the left, below and above.
    The commentarial advice given for beginners in this practice
    is not to extend loving-kindness to someone of the opposite
    sex, as this might evoke emotions of lust or attachment. A
    dead person who was dear to one is also an unsuitable object,
    as this might arouse emotions of grief and sadness. It is
    stressed that the first person to be suffused with
    loving-kindness should be oneself, since self-acceptance
    forms the basis of any genuine acceptance of other beings. </font></p>
    <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The First Four
    Months</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I began meditating with fifteen
    minutes of mindfulness of breathing each day. During the
    first few weeks of practice, I was overwhelmed by the barrage
    of thoughts, images, emotions, and even sounds or voices,
    that were constantly &quot;swimming&quot; in the mind. This
    was not evident to me until I had to make repeated attempts
    to focus attention on a single object (the breathing). I
    started to become aware of how unaware I had always been of
    these ubiquitous mental states and contents. The constant
    flow of images and inner sounds would so often occupy the
    entire field of consciousness that it was extremely difficult
    to pay concentrated attention to the breath. This led to a
    gradual build-up of frustration and doubt, which on certain
    days grew almost unbearable. On such days I would abandon my
    fruitless attempts to attend to the breath and instead engage
    in chanting traditional praises to the Buddha, Dhamma and
    Sangha. This would often result in a certain degree of
    upliftment and purity of mind that imparted a quiet
    tranquility to my otherwise difficult practice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Devotional practices, such as
    chanting and symbolic offerings of light, flowers and
    incense, while not essential to Buddhist practice, have often
    been found useful in calming and unifying the mind -- a
    valuable preliminary to formal meditation practice. With
    persistent effort, and a firm, affirming confidence in
    Dhamma, I was gradually able to maintain concentration on the
    breath for increasingly longer periods without unnoticed
    break. By the end of the fourth month of practice, I was able
    to maintain concentration for twenty minutes at a time with
    comparative ease. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each day, following my mindfulness
    of breathing, I would proceed to the practice of
    loving-kindness meditation. This involved extending loving
    thoughts and feelings to myself and others without undue
    thinking and emotional involvement. My initial attempts
    brought the feeling that the whole procedure was rather
    contrived and artificial. I had felt, at the time, that the
    practice was not very different from the psychological
    technique of auto-suggestion and therefore was suspect.
    Nevertheless, I decided to temporarily suspend my scepticism
    and critical appraisal of the practice so as to give it a
    fair trial. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another difficulty I encountered in
    the course of this practice was constant emotional
    involvement in the images I had evoked, whether of a loved
    one or of a disliked one, often resulting in a whole train of
    discursive thinking connected with the images. At such times
    I would forget the aim of the practice and become completely
    immersed in my personal mental melodramas. It usually took me
    some time to notice that I had wandered. This recognition had
    the effect of automatically re-establishing the practice. By
    the end of the first two months, I was feeling increasingly
    doubtful about the value of this practice. The sense of its
    artificiality came to me with greater intensity than before.
    I persisted nevertheless. By the fourth month of practice, I
    found myself more able to stay with the practice without
    being sidetracked. I also began to feel more natural and at
    ease with the p</font></p>
    <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The First Year</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By this time in my breath-watching
    practice, the flow of thoughts was no longer the main
    problem. Instead, the increased ability to sustain attention
    elicited an intensifying boredom in the observation process.
    The breath was by nature not at all interesting to watch, and
    I was very quickly overcome by a dullness and drowsiness of
    mind. There came a point when brief periods of awareness
    would be interrupted by longer periods of a
    semi-consciousness, sleep-like state, during which the mind
    was totally inattentive to the breath. The meditation
    sessions often resulted in a heavy, uncomfortable pressure in
    the head that would subside whenever the mind was aroused by
    some object or activity of great interest. This made me more
    aware of the intimate link between the body and the mind, and
    of how profoundly psychological states influence one's
    physical condition. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By the beginning of the seventh
    month of practice, I was sitting in meditation for a total of
    forty-five minutes per day: half an hour of mindfulness of
    breathing, followed by fifteen minutes of loving-kindness
    meditation. Drowsiness continued to be a problem in observing
    the breath, but never seemed to interfere with the practice
    of extending kind and loving thoughts. This seemed to be
    because radiating loving-kindness to mentally-evoked images
    aroused more interest than watching the breath at the
    nostrils. It was not until the end of the seventh month of
    breathing practice that I began to experience a relative
    freedom from drowsy episodes, except on days when I was
    physically tried. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There were days when the benefits
    of meditation practice became apparent to me, as the mind
    began to grow in calmness and alertness. Such times were
    often characterized by a pliancy and lightness of mind
    coupled with a seemingly effortless attention to the
    breathing process. During these periods, I noted a sense of
    enthusiastic interest in the practice. Whenever this mental
    quality was present, boredom and drowsiness would be absent.
    With this noticing of the mutual exclusivity of incompatible
    mental states, I felt I had realized a simple but significant
    and fundamental aspect of the nature of the mind. On certain
    occasions, this enthusiastic interest in Dhamma practice
    would manifest as an emotion of uplifting joy which would
    pervade the whole upper body. Any thoughts that were still
    present seemed to have lost much of their force and energy,
    such that they no longer had the power to distract the
    focused attention. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Upon terminating the meditation
    session, I would experience a deep sense of peace and
    relaxation, which would linger on throughout the day, as long
    as activities were not too rushed or emotionally intense.
    Also, such occasions would result in a spontaneous and
    expansive flow of warm and kind feelings, which naturally led
    to a deep and genuine experience of loving-kindness for all
    beings. On such days, and for a long time after that, my
    earlier doubts about, and resistance to, loving-kindness
    practice dissolved. I was finally able to touch a deep and
    loving part of my heart to a degree I never thought possible.
    The gradual extension of loving-kindness from myself to all
    beings resulted in a state of consciousness which, though
    brief, was blissful, expansive, and non-limiting. </font></p>
    <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Second Year</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the second year of practice, I
    increased the mindfulness of breathing to forty minutes daily
    and the loving-kindness meditation to twenty minutes. It was
    also during this period that I did the two semi-intensive
    retreats mentioned earlier. My ability to attend to the
    breath without unnoticed break steadily improved, though it
    was still not without the regressions into excessive
    discursive thinking, worries, fantasies, and occasional bouts
    of drowsiness. I noticed that whenever the mind was immersed
    in trains of thoughts, there was almost invariably some
    underlying emotional state that seemed to be generating these
    thoughts: worry, fear, anticipation, excitement, or (more
    subtly) a state of apathy or lack of interest (resulting in
    thoughts as a means of distraction or entertainment).
    Generally, however, there was improved concentration and a
    heightened capacity to be relaxed yet alert and relatively
    tranquil in the course of my daily life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In loving-kindness practice there
    was becoming evident an increased ability to feel genuine and
    sincere acceptance of, even warmth for, a disliked person. As
    I practised looking deeply at the image of the disliked
    person in question, with a non-judgemental mind, and without
    entering into unprofitable conceptual proliferation about her
    faults and weaknesses, I found myself more able to appreciate
    her as another being who shares in the universal ailments of
    greed, aversion, delusion, and hence suffering. With this
    change in perspective came a corresponding decrease in
    dislike and an increase in warm, positive feeling for the
    person. These manifested in an improved and more harmonious
    relationship between us. It was also becoming increasingly
    easy for me to extend deep feelings of love and acceptance to
    myself, to those dear to me, and in fact to all beings. While
    it was technically impossible to conceptualize each and every
    living being in the universe, it remained possible for me to
    visualize as many beings as I could recall (both human and
    non-human) and to relate similar feelings of warmth and love
    to them without judging or discriminating. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One profound experience I had in
    the course of this practice left a deep and lasting
    impression on me. On the occasion in question, I sat and
    commenced with mindfulness of breathing as usual, which left
    my mind with a sense of lightness and happiness. As I
    proceeded to wish myself well and happy, a sudden gush of
    rapturous joy welled up within me in the region of the middle
    chest, then spread and permeated my neck, face, head,
    shoulders, hands, and even down to my lower abdomen. With
    this pervasive and uplifting feeling came a momentary
    one-pointedness and an expansion of the spatial boundaries of
    consciousness. In retrospect, I realised that in that moment
    of oneness and expansion the mind was totally still with not
    a single thought. However, slight trickles of thought soon
    re-emerged as the experience of mental concentration and
    expansion gradually faded. These thoughts seemed to move much
    more slowly than usual and lacked the power to disturb my
    tranquillity. In such a state, I continued with the expansion
    of loving-kindness to a dear one, a neutral person, a
    disliked person, and finally to all beings, with a depth,
    authenticity, and naturalness that previous sessions had
    lacked. I was left with an openness of heart and a
    sensitivity of spirit that carried over into the next two
    days or so. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There were also three related
    experiences worth mentioning here. The first was an ability
    to notice increasingly minute details of the breathing
    process. I noticed that every inhalation ended with a short
    pause, during which no movement of the breath occurred; then
    followed the movement of exhalation, which ended in another
    short pause. This cycle repeated itself with the commencement
    of the next inhalation. I also observed that even the
    fleeting phenomenon of a single breath (one inhalation or
    exhalation) had extension in time, a distinct beginning,
    middle, and end of movement. The attention, however, was not
    equally keen and clear in all three phases, the middle and
    end of each breath often being more distinct than the
    beginning. It seemed to me that the reason for this was that
    breathing had been so much an unconscious and involuntary
    process that I was normally unaware of its existence, let
    alone of the distinct phases of the whole process. It was
    thus to be expected that any attempt to observe the process
    keenly would result in an intermittent awareness, which often
    arose somewhat more slowly than the inhalation itself. The
    task was, therefore, to cultivate an evenly-applied
    mindfulness that would sustain itself through all three
    phases of the inhalation -- and indeed through the whole
    breathing cycle, incorporating the pauses and and the three
    phases of each inhalation and exhalation. The recognition
    that an evenly-applied mindfulness was my next task proved to
    be another important insight into how the mind is to be
    focused -- an insight that has greatly facilitated my
    concentration practice since then. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I therefore put an increased amount
    of energy into watching clearly the distinct phases of both
    inhalation and exhalation together with the pauses, with the
    aim of sustaining an even, continuous attention throughout.
    With repeated effort, I finally succeeded in achieving this
    for an extended period. Following this a new type of sensory
    experience became apparent. I felt vivid tactile sensations,
    in the form of subtle rapid vibrations, at the tip of each
    nostril and around the upper lip. These tactile sensations
    became more distinct and concrete whenever mindfulness
    increased in intensity and duration. At this stage, when
    strong continuous mindfulness was present, the three phases
    of the breathing were no longer apparent, as they seemed to
    have dissolved into a rapid succession of minute vibrations.
    The flow of rapid vibrations occupied the whole field of
    consciousness, and there was a deep one-pointedness and an
    immense vacuity of mind. For an instant, my whole physical
    world would seem to have collapsed into oblivion, with a
    total loss of bodily perceptions except for the concentrated
    awareness of rapid vibrations. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From this second experience, and
    apparently as a direct consequence of it, there immediately
    followed the third experience. Sustained application of
    attention to the vibratory sensations would gradually lead to
    a point where the vibrations would suddenly disappear,
    leaving a spacious ground of greatly expanded awareness that
    seemed to have no distinct boundaries. It was as if the
    threshold of consciousness had been reached. This altered
    state of consciousness was, however, very short-lived,
    lasting only for a finger-snap. Its termination was followed
    by the preceding experience of tactile vibrations. This
    profound experience occurred very rarely, and mostly during
    the periods of retreat when the pressures and distractions of
    mundane existence were largely absent. It would invariably
    result in a state of strong mindfulness and mental clarity,
    heightened perceptual sensitivity and calmness, which would
    then persist for hours or even days on end. </font></p>
    <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Critical Appraisal</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above is a phenomenological
    account of my experience with mindfulness of breathing and
    loving-kindness meditation. It is of interest to compare this
    account with the Buddha's descriptions of meditative
    experience as recorded in the Pali suttas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <strong>first jhana</strong>,
    the first stage in the process of mental unification, is
    repeatedly described in the suttas as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Being thus detached from
        sense desires, detached from unwholesome states, he
        enters and remains in the first jhana, which is with
        thinking, and pondering, born of detachment, filled with
        delight and joy. [D.i, 73] </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As mentioned earlier, there was a
    time during my breath-watching practice when, in the absence
    of certain &quot;unwholesome&quot; states (namely
    frustration, doubt, drowsiness, excessive thinking) and the
    presence of enthusiasm and joy, the mind was effortlessly
    attentive to the breathing process, pliant, and light.
    &quot;Thinking&quot; and &quot;pondering&quot; were present
    but the thoughts lacked the energy and power to distract the
    mind from its object of concentration. This experience seems
    to correspond very closely to the Buddha's description of
    first jhana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Tevijja Sutta, the Buddha
    describes how the noble disciple goes forth into the holy
    life, practises the moralities, attains the first jhana
    (account similar to the one above), and then proceeds to
    loving-kindness meditation: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Then, with his heart filled
        with loving-kindness, he dwells suffusing one quarter,
        the second, the third, the fourth. Thus he dwells
        suffusing the whole world, upwards, downwards, across,
        everywhere, always with a heart filled with
        loving-kindness, abundant, unbounded without hate or
        ill-will. [D.i, 250-251]</em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As mentioned before, when my
    loving-kindness meditation was preceded by a pliancy and
    lightness of mind with relative freedom from thoughts,
    spontaneous feelings of joy and warmth would arise from
    within and lead to an almost effortless pervasion of the
    whole world with loving-kindness. In that state, the mind was
    filled with a sense of delight and openness. This experience
    seems to correspond to the Buddha's description just quoted.
    More importantly, it lends credence to the idea of sequential
    progression in meditative training: prior attainment of the
    first jhana greatly facilitates successful practice of
    extending loving-kindness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sutta description of the <strong>second
    jhana</strong> is as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Again, a monk, with the
        subsiding of thinking and pondering, by gaining inner
        tranquillity and oneness of mind, enters and remains in
        the second jhana, which is without thinking and
        pondering, born of concentration, filled with delight and
        joy. [D.i, 74]</em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In describing one profound
    experience I had in the course of loving-kindness practice, I
    mentioned three specific mental factors present, namely an
    uplifting joy permeating my body, mental one-pointedness, and
    a momentary but total absence of thoughts. This experience
    was, therefore, significantly similar to the Buddha's
    description of the second jhana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sutta describe a further set of
    advanced meditative attainments, namely the <b>arupa</b> or <strong>formless
    jhanas</strong>, four distinct and progressively more subtle
    stages. The first arupa jhana is described as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>By completely transcending
        all perception of matter, by the vanishing of the
        perception of sense reactions, and by non-attention to
        the perception of variety, realising: &quot;Space is
        infinite,&quot; one enters and abides in the Sphere of
        Infinite Space. [D.ii, 71] </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I described above the experience of
    rapid subtle vibrations that occupied the whole field of
    consciousness, with loss of body sense and of perception of
    distinct breath phases. This bears a loose similarity to the
    sutta account just quoted. The disappearance of body sense
    and of distinct breath phases seems to correspond to the
    &quot;vanishing of the perception of sense reactions&quot;
    and &quot;non-attention to the perception of variety.&quot;
    The sense of limitless expansion of the mind-space -- filled
    completely by the perception of subtle vibrations -- and the
    apparent disappearance of the breath and the physical world,
    further suggest that my experience was of the first arupa
    jhana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second arupa jhana is described
    thus: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>By transcending the Sphere
        of Infinite Space, thinking: &quot;Consciousness is
        infinite,&quot; one enters and abides in the Sphere of
        Infinite Consciousness. [D.ii, 70]</em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This invites comparison with the
    third set of experiences described earlier. The sudden
    disappearance of the vibrations, accompanied by dissolution
    of the boundaries of consciousness and thus attainment of a
    wider-encompassing awareness, can be seen as corresponding to
    the characteristics of the second arupa jhana as just quoted.
    </font></p>
    <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Some Final
    Thoughts</font><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Diligent and sustained practice of
    mindfulness of breathing and loving-kindness meditation is a
    fruitful and spiritually fulfilling endeavour that results in
    an enhanced state of awareness and a transformation of
    unwholesome mental patterns in one's daily life. The above
    comparison indicates, furthermore, that the altered states of
    consciousness to which these practices lead correspond
    closely to certain of the jhanas as described in the Pali
    texts. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">An important point to note is that
    the jhanas are not permanent states which, once arisen, will
    remain unfluctuating. Persistent diligent, and insightful
    practice is essential to the consolidation of such positive
    mental states in one's meditation and life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Personally, I find that these
    practices have brought a deeper understanding of the
    following words of the well-known meditation master, Sumedho
    Thera: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>[The Buddhist texts] are
        not meant to be &quot;sacred scriptures&quot; that tell
        us what to believe. One should read them, listen to them,
        think about them, contemplate them, and investigate the
        present reality, the present experience with them. Then,
        and only then, can one insightfully know the truth beyond
        words.</em></font></p>
