      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">B</FONT>ertrand Russell defines matter (Rupa) as the series of appearances of
      substance that obeys the laws of physics. That is, (appearance of) Rupa is
      independent of the observer, place and time. The Buddha defines it
      differently for his purpose to describe the arising and ceasing of Dukkha.
      <p>Matter or Rupa is inertia or patigaha and consist of the mahabhuta:
      earthy or solid or persistent, watery or cohesive, fiery or ripening, airy
      or distended or moving. This is an elemental description of behaviour of
      matter. To be experienced, in any one or a combination of sights, smell,
      sounds, tastes, tangibles and ideas or imagination, Rupa appears as shape,
      size, colour; putrid, fragrant; melody, rhythm; sweet, sour; coarse, soft;
      exciting, dull etc. These are the percepts or qualities by which the
      mahabhuta are recognized or perceived.
      <p align="center"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><b>Widely misunderstood</b> </FONT>
      <p>Thus, Nama is the appearance of Rupa, 'what it looks like' and not 'how
      it is', whether solid, watery, fiery or airy. In other words, Rupa by
      itself cannot be said to exist. It must appear and there must be
      consciousness to recognise it. Space can be added but it has no standing
      of its own. Russell and the Buddha agree up to this point.
      <p>Namarupa&nbsp; as widely misunderstood, is not mind and matter. The 
      Buddha did not teach how to bend teaspoons or influence the throw of a 
      dice with the mind! Namarupa&nbsp; is name and matter. Nama is designation, or name -
      adhivacana. It is defined as vedana, sanna, cetana, phassa and manasikara
      (feelings, perceptions, intentions, contact, attention).
      <p>When objects come within range and appear as shape, size, colour;
      putrid, fragrant; melody, rhythm, sweet, sour; coarse, soft; exciting,
      dull etc, and when there is the intact eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and
      mind with respective eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind-consciousness,
      there is engagement or contact (phassa). Contact is with me and things.
      <p>The experience instantly evokes or provokes feelings, perceptions and
      intentions. This is how there comes to be the amassing, storage, memory
      and growth of matter, feelings, perceptions and, intentions. (Mahahatthipadopama
      Sutta). When we see and touch a flower and cognize shape, colour,
      fragrance, and silkiness there is accompanying pleasant feelings and
      intentions.
      <p>When we see and touch say, a naked body, and as our attention (manasikara)
      shifts around parts of the naked body, the experience produces varying
      lust or revulsion. But no two persons may have identical feelings,
      perceptions and intentions.
      <p>The observer has affected the object. No amount of physics can explain
      this though quantum theory tries to close the stable door after the horse
      has been stolen. Without an observer there is no object.
      <p>The eye cannot experience sound, smell and taste. The ear cannot
      experience colour, sweetness or roughness. And so on. That is, Rupa is
      independent of all six modes of consciousness.
      <p>Experience is a complex generation from the impact of two or more
      senses with things. A feeling is not perceived and a perception is not
      felt. Feelings and perceptions are cognized. That is, Nama or the
      appearance of Rupa requires or entails consciousness.
      <p>What is felt is only Nama. What is totally cognized is Namarupa&nbsp; and
      there must also be consciousness.
      <p align="center"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><b>Notes on Dhamma </b></FONT>
      <p>Namarupa&nbsp; and vinnana is an overlapping, an imbrication like tiles on a
      roof. There is more to be said here that is outside the scope of this
      essay. Interested persons are referred to the writings of Ven. Nanavira
      Thera in 'Notes on Dhamma'.
      <p>Since the Dhamma is about Dukkha, about feelings, about the inherent 
      tendencies of the body and inclinations of the mind, Namarupa&nbsp; and vinnana
      are basic for understanding Dhamma.
      <p>The Buddha says that whatever is felt is Dukkha. How should the meaning
      of this be understood?
      <p>We can now immediately say that is because whatever is experienced is
      namarupa. 'A stupid or intelligent man, monks, constrained by nescience
      and attached by craving, has thus acquired this body. So there is just
      this body and name and matter externally: in that way there is a dyad.' (Samyutta.
      II, 24).
      <p align="center"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><b>Perceptions and intentions </b>
      </FONT>
      <p>The body or Rupa is independent of consciousness but together with its 
      appearance, as we normally take it, it is Namarupa. Namarupa&nbsp; externally is
      all cognized things apart from one's own body. We exist in relations with
      the surroundings and our feelings, perceptions and intentions are
      determined by sense data from contact with surrounding objects, thoughts
      and imaginations.
      <p>The advertising people, unlike physicists, have understood rupa. Notice 
      how they contrive to get objects to evoke and provoke feelings, 
      perceptions and intentions by manipulating shape, colour, smell, sound, 
      touch etc. Things on a supermarket shelf seem to be screaming 'Take me!' 
      'Eat me!' Everywhere, in the home, on the road, in the forest or anywhere 
      anyhow, we are confronted with Namarupa&nbsp; - human, animal, plant or
      inanimate. Their impact is pleasant or unpleasant feeling.
      <p>Feelings lead to craving or attachment. This is the origin of Dukkha. 
      So long as we have intact senses and mind, Namarupa&nbsp; will hold us in their
      thrall. So long as we let ourselves be caught in this trap, because we
      possess six senses, often unguarded, so long will the end result be Dukkha.
      <p>All feelings are dependent on contact. 'The world is tormented by
      contact' says the Buddha. All things dependent on other things (Sankhara)
      are impermanent. All things impermanent and subjective (Aniccata) are
      Dukkha.
      <p>So how do we get out of this Namarupa&nbsp; trap? Theoretically, we can
      understand from the foregoing that the way to do it is to excise or
      de-couple the nama-body from the rupa-body (Namakaye-patigaha,
      rupakaye-adhivacana). That is precisely the aim of Dhamma.
      <p>There is then left only Rupa and vinnana - six elements of earth,
      water, fire, air, space and consciousness - as in the Arahat.
      <p align="center"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><b>The end of Dukkha </b></FONT>
      <p>When this scission is achieved, in the seen shall only be the seen, in
      the heard only the heard, in the sensed only the sensed, in the cognized
      only the cognized. We shall then not be 'with that' and when we are not
      'with that' we shall not be 'in that'. When we are not 'in that' then we
      shall not be here nor there nor in between the two.
      <p>We shall have neither pleasant, nor unpleasant nor neutral feelings and
      perceptions. It shall be the end of Dukkha.
      <p>For most of us, that is a million miles away. Nevertheless we should 
      beware of Namarupa, internally and externally. We should attenuate the 
      havoc of Namarupa&nbsp; on consciousness. We should strive to achieve dispassion
      (Viraga) from understanding the operating principle of Paticcasamuppada,
      of dependent arising. We should practise, meditate and cultivate
      mindfulness and control of the five senses and the mind. This is
      understanding Namarupa.
