              The research work in all makes the effect that <I>citta</I> has 
              little to do with particularly distinctive quality in terms of its 
              characteristic integral involvement in the whole field of mental 
              states and activities in the broadest sense. The mental states 
              under its range that come into the scope of our attention, 
              however, have been molded into these: (1) General state of 
              sentient being; (2) Lustful heart; (3) Evil heart; (4) Purposed 
              heart; (5) Ready-for-truth <I>citta</I>; (6) Calm and passionless
              <I>citta</I>; (7) Composed <I>citta</I>; (8) Loving kindness <I>
              citta</I>; and (9) Emancipated <I>citta</I>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Attempts to sum up the comprehensive 
              depictions of <I>citta</I> in the previous chapters may arrive at 
              dry and isolated definitive notions about what <I>citta</I> is. 
              This way of approaching to the knowledge of <I>citta</I> is 
              reasonably warned against, but will help a quick review in terms 
              of sharpness and briefness it appears after the removal of all 
              that is elaborative and superfluous. In addition of nine mental 
              states above mentioned, we can collect the several groups of 
              meanings that the <I>citta</I> should be assumed to purport.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>Citta</I>, most generally, is the 
              nonphysical, all mental activities or mental agencies. <I>Citta</I> 
              in regard to the direction of mental activities is the heading and 
              the subordinate to the heading as well.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Towards its emplacement, <I>citta</I> is 
              advocated to be the core of one&#39;s personality; the center of 
              understanding, of perceptual and cognitive activities; the 
              possessor of knowledge of all types, ordinary or super-mundane. <I>
              Citta</I> is the center and focus of man&#39;s emotional nature; the 
              conscious center of activity, purposiveness, continuity and 
              emotionality. <I>Citta</I> is the ideological leadership in man&#39;s 
              mind, his character and personality. It goes further to say that
              <I>citta</I> is a personal identity or surviving entity from 
              existence to existence.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>Citta</I> in action is mental instrument 
              and also the reactions to impressions. It is both the subjective 
              and objective aspects of consciousness or thinking. It accepts and 
              investigates object. <I>Citta</I> sometimes is simply an idea or a 
              thought or a feeling. <I>Citta</I> is striving, desire, volition 
              and purpose; intention, impulse and design; perception, memory, 
              judgment and reasoning. <I>Citta</I>, expressively speaking, is 
              &#39;inner speech&#39;. In the form of <I>mano</I>, <I>citta</I> is one of 
              the six psychological senses. </P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">As a seat and organ of thought <I>citta</I> 
              &#39;thinks&#39; of its object by arranging itself in a thought process.
              <I>Citta</I> is both the cause of a variety of mental effects and 
              the resultant thought. It is the store house of &#39;mental seeds&#39; or 
              the arsenal of dispositional properties.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>Citta</I>, in another parlance, is a flux 
              of thought or a wide and complex nexus of mental states in flux or 
              a series of events in an incessant process of mentation. <I>Citta</I> 
              is that which comes to be and passes away. It is the experience in
              <I>Nibbāna</I>-release.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">All the conceptual cuttings given above by no 
              means exhaust the variety of definitions pertaining to <I>citta</I>. 
              On the other hand, it should be warned with strong precaution that 
              none of them can be exactly correct in regard to the meaning of <I>
              citta</I> per se; they are not totally wrong either. They are 
              actually the conception molds whereas <I>citta</I> seems to be 
              that which is not to be molded. The conceptual cuttings, 
              nevertheless, should be but something helpful as a guide map 
              particularly for clear-cut reference or consultation.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal" ALIGN="center" STYLE="text-align:center">*</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Although involved in multi-dimensional and 
              multi-functional manifestations, <I>citta</I> depicted in Buddhist 
              system, sometimes too general to have a delineated sketch, 
              sometimes so specific as a idea or a thought, has basically 
              nothing to do with metaphysics. The Buddhist <I>citta</I> does not 
              suggest any idea about an entity or an eternal reality of the kind 
              that Parmenides, a Greek philosopher (515 B.C) 
              holds up. The multiplicity of existing things, their changing 
              forms and motion, in his opinion, are but an appearance of a 
              single eternal reality. The Buddhist non-substantial position 
              would not easy for those as Sāti and Parmenides to comprehend 
              because in the depth of their mind there must be an inherent 
              craving for continual existence.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The Buddhist light thrown upon the 
              origination of <I>citta</I> also reflects the freedom from such a 
              craving. <I>Citta</I> is but one phase in the circle of ever 
              changing process of becoming and passing away. This phase 
              conventionally clad in the term <I>citta</I> is preceded by other 
              phases that can be named <I>saṅkhāra</I>, <I>upādāna, āyatana, 
              anusaya, nāma-rūpa,</I> according to the specific canonical 
              passages that we chance upon with the conclusion-orientated mind. 
              Considering the preceding phases the cause or the origin of <I>
              citta</I> is similar to acting as the blind who touched a 
              particular segment of, and began to boast his knowledge about, the 
              elephant. All the references recorded in the Buddhist canonical 
              literature about the origination of <I>citta</I> or any other 
              phenomena do not break away from the principle of depending 
              origination.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">That <I>citta</I>, although a competent 
              candidate for representing one&#39;s personality, is depending upon 
              other factors for its coming into being disapproves of the 
              speculations about the creator deity who has been credited with 
              the creation of the world where we live.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The common knowledge about of the supreme 
              creator deity can be briefed into the six characteristics: (1) He 
              is all wise and all powerful. The world comes into being because 
              of his wisdom, and he is able to actualize the world because of 
              his power. (2) The deity exists alone prior to the creation of the 
              world. No explanation can therefore be given of his existence, 
              before which one confronts the ultimate mystery. (3) His creation 
              a conscious and deliberate one with a definite plan in mind and is 
              not based on a trial-and-error basis. This again is an aspect of 
              the creator&#39;s wisdom and power. (4) The creation of the world is 
              simultaneously an expression of the freedom and purpose of the 
              deity. His relationship to the created order after the creation is 
              again an aspect of his freedom. (5) The creator deity removes 
              himself from the world after it has been created. After the 
              creation the deity goes away and only appears again when a 
              catastrophe threatens the created order. (6) The supreme creator 
              deity is often a sky god, and the deity in this form is an 
              instance of the religious valuation of the symbolism of the sky. 
              All of the above mentioned six points and their possible 
              corollaries are speculative and extrinsic to the Buddhist system.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">On the other hand, the Buddhist <I>citta</I> 
              does not involve in a sudden or casual creation that seems to need 
              no material, like the trick of a magician who &#39;creates&#39; a pigeon 
              with the &#39;power&#39; of his magical hat, mantras, and stick.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal" ALIGN="center" STYLE="text-align:center">*</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">In Hinduism and Tantric Buddhism, sacred 
              utterances (syllables, words, or verses) are considered to possess 
              mystical or spiritual efficacy. Various mantras are either spoken 
              aloud or merely sounded internally in one&#39;s thoughts, and they are 
              either repeated continuously for some time or just sounded once. 
              Most mantras are without any apparent verbal meaning, but they are 
              thought to have a profound underlying significance and are in 
              effect distillations of spiritual wisdom. Thus, repetition of or 
              meditation on a particular mantra can induce a trance-like state 
              in the participant and can lead him to a higher level of spiritual 
              awareness.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Besides the mantras that are credited with 
              inducing trance-like state and spiritual awareness, there are the 
              mantras of another kind that are said to be for other psychic or 
              spiritual purposes, such as protecting oneself from evil psychic 
              powers. That the <I>Dīgha Nikāya</I> (<I>sutta</I> 32), which is 
              usually considered to be among the earliest Buddhist texts, 
              records the <I>Ātānātiyā</I> of this protective kind seems not to 
              be consistent in the context of the early Buddhism.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Examination of the <I>citta</I> in the main 
              trait of Buddhist system renders the effect that the Buddhists 
              would consider language no more than a means that matters only on 
              the basis of its functioning. The value of a word or a sound, 
              though a certain number of specific words or utterances as above 
              mentioned are usually credited with magical and sacred power 
              especially in <I>Vedic</I> literature and some later Buddhist one, 
              should be empirically reduced to the conveyance of ideas. In the 
              same line, the earliest texts do not show much care about which 
              word - <I>citta</I>, <I>mana</I>, or <I>viññāṇa</I> - must 
              consistently stand for the aspects of human psyche in case they 
              are asserted together. The scholastic selection of the word to be 
              used seems to concede and give place to the instantaneous 
              conveying of ideas. No matter which word was chosen in the 
              primitive period of time, the spontaneous understanding of the <I>
              Dhamma</I> on the side of the audience who were consequently 
              supposed to tend towards a positive perspective of life was all 
              that had been first and foremost concerned for. Hence the three 
              terms at the period of time seem to share a dearth of distinct 
              usage and were interchangeable.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The ancient people in general seem to be with 
              a lack of reason in their fetishism but the present day intellects 
              whose sense of reason is highly advanced are still under the sway 
              of the same fetishism of an &#39;advanced&#39; kind which is in the guile 
              of the very reason. Friedrich Nietzsche in <I>Twilight of the 
              Idols</I> argues that we find ourselves in the midst of a rude 
              fetishism when we call to mind the basis presuppositions of the 
              metaphysics of language... only thus does it create the concept 
              &#39;thing&#39;... &#39;Reason&#39; in language: oh what a deceitful old woman!

              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">In addition to a lack of sound educational 
              discipline, the limited assess to a handful of partly and casually 
              gathered data and a tinge of gung-ho attitude have brought about 
              the belief that there are three positions regarding the so-called
              <I>ego</I> or <I>citta</I> or self and the <I>Dhamma</I>: (1) both 
              are existences, (2) the former is nonexistence and the latter is 
              existence, and (3) both are nonexistence. The first position is 
              then imposed on the lay people; the next, on the <I>Hīnayanist</I> 
              or the Buddhism expressed in the <I>Nikāyas</I>; and the last, to 
              the <I>Mahāyānists</I>. This conviction would fade away in the 
              light from the <I>Nikāyas</I>: The <I>Dhamma</I> is expressed in 
              the form of language. Both the <I>Dhamma</I> and language are but 
              a means that should be made use of to attain an desirable end; it 
              then is to be left aside as a raft after the faring. Neither the
              <I>Dhamma</I> nor the <I>ego</I> (or <I>citta</I> or self) in the 
              Buddhist system has much to do with the metaphysical speculation 
              about existence or nonexistence.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal" ALIGN="center" STYLE="text-align:center">*</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">While both the Buddhist <I>citta</I> and the
              <I>Vedic</I> one share together to some extent the common range of 
              meaning, the latter diverges to another direction insomuch as its 
              emotional aspect is concerned. The divergence towards emotional 
              tone is reasonable on the sacrificial background of the <I>Vedic
              </I>sacred literature. They are hymns or verses composed around 
              1500-1200 BC in archaic <I>Sanskrit</I> and current among the 
              Indo-European-speaking peoples who entered India from the Iranian 
              regions. The hymns formed a liturgical body that in part grew up 
              around the cult of the soma ritual and the sacrifice. They 
              extolled the hereditary deities, who for the most part personified 
              various natural and cosmic phenomena, such as fire, sun, dawn, 
              storms, war and rain, honor, divine authority, and creation. The 
              extolment is the main theme in their sacrificial rituals so as to 
              glorify the god(s) in blessing and to appease in case of their 
              wrath. In this direction the <I>Vedic</I> <I>citta</I>, therefore, 
              is not one of mental processes and psychical events as that of 
              Buddhism but a <I>citta</I> of emotion. The emotional <I>citta</I> 
              is not only the agent, on the part of the sacrificers, that 
              incites the god(s) to take pathetic actions as requested, but also 
              the receptor, on the part of the god(s), of the incentives.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal" ALIGN="center" STYLE="text-align:center">*</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">On the other hand the <I>Upaniṣadic citta</I> 
              is different from the Buddhist one in its tending towards the 
              metaphysical tone. The reason for this is suggestible on its 
              ideological background: The old <I>Upanishads</I> may be part of 
              the <I>Brahmanas</I> (commentaries) of their respective <I>Vedas</I> 
              but are distinguished from them both by increased philosophical 
              and mystical questioning and by their diminished concern with <I>
              Vedic</I> deities and sacrificial rites. Of fundamental importance 
              to all Hindu thought is the equation in some of the <I>Upanishads</I> 
              of <I>atman</I> (the self) with <I>Brahman</I> (ultimate reality). 
              The nature of morality and of eternal life is discussed, so are 
              such themes as the transmigration of souls and causality in 
              creation.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The <I>citta</I> in the Buddhist literature 
              is expressed in a morality-orientated setting and characterized by 
              the absence of a supreme god competent for creation and tends 
              towards the state freed from impurities and self-inflation of all 
              kinds. The <I>Upanishadic</I> texts, otherwise, mention <I>citta</I> 
              in the context of the philosophical concern with the nature of 
              reality and of a development toward the concept of a single 
              supreme being which the knowledge is directed toward reunion with.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The supreme being with characteristic power 
              and wisdom have been said to be super-sensuous and credited with 
              the creation of the world whereas Buddhism does not assigned the 
              creation to any specified agent, more exactly, it does not build 
              the concept of creation. There is creation means there is the 
              starting point. Buddhism, however, consents that the world, by and 
              large, has neither the beginning, nor the end. The reality is an 
              ever ongoing process that escapes our capacity of fathoming. The 
              identification of the world with <I>dukkha</I>, as sometimes 
              referred to in the Buddhist canon, opens a new perspective of its 
              ending. There is then an end of such a world, which is the 
              extinguishment of all kinds of defilements and cravings. On the 
              other hand, the <I>Upanishadic citta</I> that survives the 
              dissipation or the end of the world is not traceable in the 
              Buddhist literature.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal" ALIGN="center" STYLE="text-align:center">*</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">It is remarkable that the <I>citta</I> in 
              Buddhist system does not seem to be <I>per se</I> (to be by 
              itself). The manifestations of <I>citta</I> as recorded are 
              usually in association with more specified mental variables that 
              decide the function or the character it is bearing. Some scholar 
              goes further to say that it is nothing but the wholeness of all 
              the attributing variables. So <I>citta</I> is not something like 
              the <I>tabula rasa</I>. This helps in understanding why when 
              putting it forth as a general state we are bond to associate it 
              with some quality, whether sensational or emotional, safeguarded 
              or subjected to downfall, and why, in the <I>Abhidhamma</I> 
              literature, to define a single <I>citta</I> means to get in touch 
              with many other factors relating to it. All this once again 
              suggests the non-substantiality position of Buddhism regarding to 
              the concept of <I>citta</I> and the phenomena of all other kinds 
              as well.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>Citta</I>, expressively speaking, is 
              visualized as a kitchen jar that is so flimsy and insubstantial 
              that only the sugar or salt or some spicy contained in it matters 
              and is counted. The jar somehow is not at all. Such an 
              visualization reduces <I>citta</I> to nothing but a loose and 
              false &#39;boundary&#39; or concept that is made of human limited and 
              defective mentation for keeping and expressing the more 
              specifiable of mental activities and features. Hence some later 
              interpretations in terms of absolute truth regard <I>citta</I> as 
              the wholeness of all the mental properties that are present at the 
              given point of time.</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal" ALIGN="center" STYLE="text-align:center">*</P>
              <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Conclusively, <I>citta</I> as a concept is 
              bafflingly elusive and we have to grasp it indirectly by setting 
              up a variety of its manifest facets gleaned from the <I>Sutta 
              Piṭaka</I> and by representing its multilevel in the <I>Abhidhamma 
              Piṭaka</I>. Investigation into the concept of <I>citta</I> has 
              inspired the philosophical enquiries such as its origin and 
              masterful position, its fraudulence and feasibility, its hindrance 
              and liberation, and so on. <I>Citta</I>, moreover, proves to be 
              among the most important psychological concepts in Buddhism 
              therefore a full-fledged understanding of it would culminate in 
              the mastery of the Buddhist psychology. The mastery, nonetheless, 
              would by no means be complete in all contents and purposes until 
              it incorporates a self-transformation towards the ultimate truth 
              since the nature of the knowledge is - in correspondence with the 
              nature of the knower - also transformed. Rather than being given 
              it is discovered and found<A HREF="#_edn2" NAME="_ednref2" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: VU Times">[2]</SPAN></SPAN></A>. 
              The self-transformation by nature, nonetheless, is 
              self-transcendence for which the actual and painstaking taming of 
              the <I>citta</I> is an inevitable process.</P>
