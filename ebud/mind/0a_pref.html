          <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN STYLE="font-size:24.0pt">T</SPAN>o be more 
          than a comprehensive coverage of what would be said about the Buddhist 
          concept of mind (<I>citta</I> in Pāli) when sectarianism was not 
          exertive yet in the Pāli Tipiṭaka 
          this book is actually an attempt at a full-fledged understanding of 
          the <I>citta </I>when Buddhism was in its pristine state as recorded 
          in the early Buddhist literature.</P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The authoritativeness of the original texts is 
          strongly appreciated and highlighted to such an extent that allows a 
          full-scale survey of their date of composition. This should baffle any 
          disregard to their authenticity position. Here authenticity is 
          synonymous with originality and originality is synonymous with the 
          precedence regarding the time of their composition and incorporation 
          into the sacred texts. Consequently, I brief to some extent the dating 
          and stratification of the canonical texts - especially the <I>Sutta Piṭaka</I> 
          which is most substantial of the Buddhist canonical literature and 
          best able to serve a sense of purity - in view that the earlier a 
          particular text is, the more authentic it should be.</P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">With the scientific and meticulous measures 
          employed in the investigation the author of this book challenges any 
          bias or prejudgment that readers may be previously conditioned with. 
          As being suggestive rather than decisive the book, nevertheless, gives 
          them ample space to put in their own conclusive remarks.</P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The <I>citta</I>&nbsp; that the author is dealing 
          with in this book is worked upon as a technical term and a concept. 
          Its lexical meanings in general and applied ones in the Buddhist 
          canonical context are surveyed. How the fundamental and condensed 
          shade of the concept <I>citta</I> figures in the Buddhist system as 
          well as in the contemporary <I>Brahmanic</I> ones is sketched out. As 
          the pivotal core of this book the <I>citta</I>&nbsp; is put into 
          consideration with a view towards an exhaustive perspective. With the 
          supplement of lexical elucidation, tabular illustration, doctrinal 
          relevance the work should virtually exhaust all the cases of 
          conceivable <I>citta</I> in the <I>Sutta Piṭaka</I>. 
          It is supposed that all and every occurence of the term <I>citta</I>, 
          no matter how slightly substantial it may be, is not spared. In spite 
          of that the work is not to be cut and dried as a pure research work 
          usually is, but rather readable with stories and episodes from the 
          texts and thoughtful and sometimes humorous remarks by the author.</P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The issues inherent of psycho-philosophical 
          interest, however, will be elaborated on with further analysis and 
          deeper ideation. The author puts into the spotlight the interesting 
          issues such as the <I>citta</I> of the Buddha at the eve of 
          propagating the <I>Dhamma</I> and at the time of <I>Nibbāna</I>, the 
          impressive power of mind-reading by the full cultivated mind, the 
          double face and the feasibility of <I>citta</I>, the identity of soul 
          or mind as well as the relationship between body and mind, the 
          particular type of <I>pīti </I>that is able to transport the physical 
          body of a female devotee through the air, the depth psychology&#39;s 
          concern regarding various kinds of mental process. This concern is 
          resulted in a survey in the last chapter of the different types of <I>
          citta </I>explicated in the <I>Abhidhamma Piṭaka</I> 
          especially the <I>Dhammasaṅgaṇi</I> 
          where <I>cittas</I> figure dominantly.</P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">I afford myself this occasion to thank Prof. K. 
          T. S. Sarao who helped me in avoiding many mistakes that I would have 
          committed. The remaining ones are my own responsibility. I extend my 
          thank to Prof. Mahesh Tiwari, Prof. K. K. Mittal, Prof. Sanghasen 
          Singh whom I ever had a good time with, and benefited from.</P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">My thanks are also due to the library staff of 
          Delhi University Library System, Delhi 7, the Theosophical Library, 
          Theosophical Society, Adya, Chennai, and the Library of Tibetan Works 
          and Archives, Dharamsala (H.P). The majority of my consultation 
          materials were owed from their helping hands.</P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">My heart reaches out to my teachers, brothers and 
          sisters in Dhamma, my friends and loved ones, my failure to name them 
          all just makes their memory to be engraved deeper in my soul.</P>

          <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN STYLE="font-size:24.0pt">V</SPAN>ietnam</I>, 
          located in Southeast Asia, adopted Buddhism from two main reservoirs
          <I>India</I> and <I>China</I>, but she was not in a position to do 
          further transmission. The terminus of the stream of Buddhist thought 
          which since its advent has been highly colored by the <I>Chinese</I> 
          culture and faintly by <I>Brahmanic</I> one brings about a thirst for 
          the pristine freshness that only the original source of thought can 
          assuage. A sense of purity, therefore, is inspired and underlies my 
          intent to do some study on the basis of the earliest Buddhist 
          scriptures.<U1:P></U1:P></P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The knowledge about Buddhism thus conditioned has 
          been spelled by the Buddhists of Northern tradition whereas the 
          tradition of <I>Theravāda</I> <I>bhikkhus</I> and that of the <I>
          Mendicant Bhikkhus</I> who attempt to embrace impartially the optimal 
          essentials of the preceding two
          <A HREF="#_edn1" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference">
          <SPAN STYLE="font-size:10.0pt">[i]</SPAN></SPAN></A> are of 
          proportionable influence. Although at the conglomeration of such 
          different trends of thoughts, what I understand about Buddhism 
          especially about the concept of <I>citta</I> that is so important in 
          all the three systems, however, is still neither complete nor 
          satisfactory.<U1:P></U1:P></P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">On resorting to the source of knowledge overseas 
          as far as my hand can reach out to I has found so far that the 
          Buddhist concept of <I>citta</I> is not been exclusively focused on by 
          English writers yet. A quick review in this respect makes it known 
          that <I>citta</I> along with other important concepts in Buddhist 
          psychology are discussed proportionately in <I>The Dynamic Psychology 
          of Early Buddhism </I>by Rune E. A. Johansson. Therefore, the 
          psychological account of the concept of <I>citta</I> thereat is by no 
          means comprehensive; let alone the fact that Rune E. A. Johansson 
          chooses to confine to the <I>Sutta Piṭaka</I> 
          for the basis on which his book is prepared. The concept of <I>citta</I>, 
          on the other hand, is especially dealt with by Jan T. Edgardt in <I>
          Buddhist and Western Psychology</I>, who, however, prefers to base his 
          account on the <I>Majjhima Nikāya</I> only.<U1:P></U1:P></P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Consideration of all that has been mentioned 
          above makes me decide the proposed title of my thesis: <B>A Study of 
          the Concept of <I>Citta</I> as Depicted in the <I>Pāli Tipiṭaka.</I><U1:P></U1:P></B></P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">With an explorational and investigative mind I 
          take pains to glean all the data about <I>citta</I> from the whole <I>
          Tipiṭaka</I> especially the <I>
          Sutta Piṭaka</I>, the most 
          substantial of the literature. The data thus collected will be 
          carefully studied and systematically processed into the main body of 
          the research work the whole of which consists of 7 chapters.<U1:P></U1:P></P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The first chapter, as usual, is for the 
          preliminary matters about <I>citta</I> as a technical term and as a 
          concept. Its lexical meanings in general and applied ones in the 
          Buddhist canonical context are presented. How the fundamental and 
          condensed shade of the concept <I>citta</I> figures in the Buddhist 
          system as well as in the contemporary <I>Brahmanic</I> ones is roughly&nbsp; 
          sketched out. With keen interest in the authenticity of the primary 
          source I spend the last portion of this chapter for the dating and 
          stratification of the canonical texts in view that the earlier a 
          particular text is, the more authentic it should be.<U1:P></U1:P></P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The <I>Sutta Piṭaka</I> 
          is most substantial of the Buddhist canonical literature and best able 
          to serve my sense of purity so that the second chapter is prepared in 
          the direction, highlighting the besetting but interesting issue of its 
          dates of composition that have been variously tabulated by the leading 
          scholars.<U1:P></U1:P></P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Exploration into the <I>Vinaya Piṭaka</I>, 
          basically the rules and regulations that conduct the activities of the
          <I>Saṁgha</I>, shows that the 
          term <I>citta</I> appears is too scanty to state something 
          substantial, therefore, skipped over.<U1:P></U1:P></P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">All the data of <I>citta</I> throughout the <I>
          Sutta Piṭaka</I> will be 
          objectively collected and classified under different headings, nine in 
          number. With the supplement of lexical elucidation, tabular 
          illustration, doctrinal relevance, the first four headings compose the 
          third chapter; the remaining five, the fourth chapter. The two 
          chapters should virtually exhaust all the cases of conceivable <I>
          citta</I> in the <I>Sutta Piṭaka</I> 
          so long as its literary occurrence is concerned.<U1:P></U1:P></P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The fifth chapter that divers itself from the 
          literary concern will deal with several selected matters inherent of 
          psycho-philosophical interest. Some of them are inspired by the 
          ideological relevance that falls out of the scope of the previous 
          literary grounded chapters. This chapter in all will be prepared with 
          further analysis and deeper ideation.<U1:P></U1:P></P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The sixth chapter is an account of <I>citta</I> 
          in the <I>Abhidhamma Piṭaka</I> 
          where, especially in the <I>Dhammasaṇgaṇi</I>, 
          descriptions of different types of <I>citta</I> figure dominantly. 
          Hence this chapter will be specified as&nbsp; classifications of <I>
          citta</I> and will be prepared with faithfulness to the original 
          source.<U1:P></U1:P></P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The seventh and last chapter will conclude the 
          research work by summing up all that has been previously accounted 
          with the addition of some other afterthoughts more or less relating to 
          the concept of <I>citta</I>.<U1:P></U1:P></P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">I would like to take the occasion to express the 
          gratefulness I feel for my parents who bore me, brought me up well 
          with their characteristic love, spelling the first chapter of my life 
          with the example of their hard-working and moral lives. The seeds of 
          morality they implanted in my budding soul keeps on growing in the 
          depth of my personality and is still guiding me in the present time. 
          They both demised and I have badly felt indebted thenceforth.<U1:P></U1:P></P>

          Sangha of Bhikkhu Buddhist Association and Venerable Thích Giác Toàn, 
          member, Executive Council of Vietnam Buddhist Sangha, from whom I was 
          vested with the fully ordained monkhood. The compassion and wisdom 
          underlying their indefatigable activities set up in me an example of 
          devotional lives and a source of encouragement. It goes without saying 
          that without their taking care of my spiritual and financial problems 
          whenever I find myself at a low ebb, I would not have advanced up to 
          the present extent.<U1:P></U1:P></P>

          Department of Buddhist Studies, Delhi University, whose supervision

          self-confidence. This is appreciated especially when I am groping for 
          the way to prepare the thesis. His scientific open-mindedness actually 
          helps in paving the smooth path for the thesis to come to the 
          successful completion that I am enjoying now. I would like to extend

          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Prof. K. T. S. Sarao whose academic record is 
          admirable and under whose scientific supervision and guidance my M.

          Minh Thu and Mr. Bùi Đức Hải whom I have ever had some memorable days 
          to be with, and now I would like to extend thanks to.<U1:P></U1:P></P>

          memorable summer of 1997. The premise lingered with an antique and 
          poetic air that I have ever experienced was quite in tune with a sense 
          of antiquity I had when consulting the old books in their custody. 
          Some of the books, that I have even been in touch with, witness the 
          close of the nineteenth century.<U1:P></U1:P></P>

          Buddhism.<U1:P></U1:P></P>
          <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Last but not least, my heart reaches out to my

          the way. My failure to name them all, hundreds in number, just makes
