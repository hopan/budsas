  face="Times New Roman">n this chapter, I will discuss the methods through which the
  Abhidharma investigates our personalities and our relations to the world around us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two ways to depict a given person and his
  relation to the world around him: deductively and inductively. The rational or deductive
  method begins with an abstract idea and applies that idea to one's experience. The
  empirical or inductive method begins with the facts we encounter in experience; through
  observing and analyzing, interpreting and understanding these facts, we build up a picture
  of ourselves and the world around us. In short, the rational method begins with the
  abstract and tries to apply it to the concrete, whereas the inductive method begins with
  the concrete and builds up a picture of reality gradually and progressively.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The inductive method, which is the one used in the
  Abhidharmic system, is quite close to the method of science, except that in science the
  focus of the inductive process is outward and in the Abhidharmic system the focus is
  inward, on the mind. This is why the Abhidharmic method is sometimes called introspection
  or, to use a traditional term, meditation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we say that the Abhidharmic method is empirical and
  inductive, we mean that it has to do primarily with mental experience. Sometimes we say
  that meditation is like internal or mental microscopy: it is a way of investigating very
  closely the facts of experience. The Abhidharmic method of introspection yields results
  because it manages, through meditation, to slow down mental processes to a point where we
  can see and understand them. In this respect there is a remarkable parallel between the
  Abhidharmic method and the scientific method. In science, when we want to find out how a
  certain transformation actually takes place, we slow down the process or speed it up. In
  Abhidharmic meditation, too, we can slow down mental processes so that we can see what is
  actually happening, or we can speed things up. If we could see our human life, from birth
  to death, within the space of five minutes, it would give us great insight into the nature
  of life. However, because this is usually not possible, we slow things down. This is the
  basis of Abhidharmic meditation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The lists of mental factors and the like in the books of
  the Abhidharma may appear tedious and speculative at first glance, but in fact they are
  just the written form of the data we find in this very careful investigation of
  experience. Far from being speculative, the Abhidharma is the result of careful and close
  introspective analysis of experience. That said, you may question the use of studying the
  Abhidharma at all, thinking that it is surely more useful to sit in meditation and
  reproduce the Abhidharmic experience of reality in one's own meditation. This is true to
  the extent that, as in all aspects of Buddhist teaching, direct as well as indirect
  acquaintance is required.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With the Abhidharmic view of the elements, the picture we
  get when we analyze experience is certainly much more effective if it is a direct picture
  achieved through our own meditation. But even if it is an indirect picture gained through
  study, it is still of use to us, because when we sit down to meditate we will already have
  some intellectual acquaintance with the general outline of the picture we are trying to
  bring into focus. In this sense studying the Abhidharma can be useful in bringing about an
  indirect understanding of ourselves and the world around us in Abhidharmic terms.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two ways Abhidharmic investigation works: (1)
  through analysis, and (2) through synthesis, or relation. The basic structure of these two
  methods is given in the first and last books of the Abhidharma Pitaka, the Dhammasangani
  (Classification of Factors) and the Patthana (Book of Causal Relations), respectively.
  These are the two most important books of the Abhidharma. It is through the analytical
  method and the synthetic or relational method that the Abhidharma arrives at a basic
  understanding of not-self and emptiness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us look first at the analytical method and then at the
  relational method; finally, we will combine the two, as, indeed, we must to reap the full
  benefit of the Abhidharmic method of investigation. In The Questions of King Milinda
  (Milinda Panha), it is said that the Buddha has accomplished a very difficult task: 'If a
  man,' Nagasena says in reply to King Milinda, 'were to take a boat out to the sea, and if
  he were to take a handful of sea water and were then able to tell you that in it this much
  water is from the Ganges, this much from the Yamuna, and this much from the other great
  rivers of India, this would certainly be a very difficult thing to accomplish. In the same
  way, the Buddha has analyzed a single conscious moment of experience -- for instance, the
  experience of seeing a form--into its various component parts: matter, feeling,
  perception, volition, and consciousness.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Analysis is the dissection of an apparently unitary,
  homogeneous whole into its component parts. This analysis can be applied not only to the
  self, as we find in the analysis of personal experience, but also to external objects:
  just as we can break down the personality into the five aggregates, so we can break down
  external phenomena into their component parts. For example, we can break down a table into
  its legs, its top, and so forth, and, even further, into the molecules and atoms of
  various elements that compose the table.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The purpose of dissecting an apparent whole is to uproot
  attachment to internal and external phenomena. Once we recognize that this apparently
  homogeneous self is really just a collection of components, our attachment to the notion
  of the self is weakened; similarly, once we realize that external phenomena are just
  collections of individual smaller components, our attachment to external objects is
  weakened. What do we have as a result of our analytical process? Internally, we are left
  with moments of consciousness; externally, we are left with atoms. If we consider the two
  together, we are left with elements, or factors of experience.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mental and material elements of experience do not in
  themselves bring us to the ultimate understanding of reality because we are left with
  moments of consciousness and atoms of matter--elements of experience. These elements
  remain irreducible no matter how long and how far we go in our process of dissection.
  Although we come up with smaller and smaller parts, we are left with a picture of reality
  that is broken up into little bits and pieces as a result of dissection. This in itself is
  not an accurate and complete picture of reality.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To arrive at the ultimate picture of reality, we need to
  couple the analytical approach with the synthetic or relational approach. That is why a
  great Buddhist scholar and saint, Nagarjuna, once expressed his reverence for the Buddha
  as 'the teacher of interdependent origination.' The truth of interdependent origination
  pacifies and calms the agitation of thought-construction. This is an indication of the
  importance of relation, interdependence, or conditionality in understanding the real
  nature of things. It is also why scholars have focused on the Book of Causal Relations,
  which supplies the other half of the Abhidharmic method of investigation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as, through analysis, we arrive at the
  insubstantiality of personality and phenomena (because we see that they are made up of
  component parts), so, through the process of relational investigation, we arrive at the
  emptiness of personality and phenomena (because we see that the component parts which
  constitute them are all conditioned by and relative to each other). We arrive at this
  insubstantiality and emptiness by focusing on the teaching of interdependent origination.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can see how, within a given thing--be it the
  personality or an external object--the component parts depend on one another for their
  existence. For instance, within a single phenomenon, such as an apparently unitary table,
  there are several component parts (the legs, the top, and so forth) that depend on each
  other for their existence as part of a table. Similarly, the table depends on its
  antecedent causes (the wood, the iron, and action of the craftsman who put it together)
  and also on proximate conditions (like the floor on which it stands).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can also explore the idea of interdependence in
  relation to three dimensions: time, space, and karma. For instance, the table is dependent
  in terms of time in the sense that, prior to the table existing, a series of events
  occurred--the cutting of lumber, the construction of the table, and so forth. This
  sequence of events led to the arising of the table. Similarly, the table is dependent in
  terms of space in the sense that it stands on the floor, and so forth. The third dimension
  of conditionality operates beyond time and space. This dimension is explained by karma,
  because karma has its effects depending on time and space, yet it is not directly apparent
  in time and space. Because of karma, an action done at a very distant point in time and
  space can have its effects here and now. Conditionality is therefore not only temporal and
  spatial, but also has a karmic dimension.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us take two examples to establish more firmly what we
  mean by the analytical approach and the relational approach. Take a chariot, which is a
  phenomenon, an identifiable entity. We apply the analytical approach to the chariot by
  breaking it down into its component parts: the wheels, axle, body, shaft, and so forth.
  Application of the synthetic method looks at the same chariot in terms of the lumber that
  goes to it, the action of the builders who put it together, and so forth. Alternatively,
  we can take the classical examples of the flame in an oil lamp, which exists dependent on
  the oil and the wick, and the sprout, which depends on a seed, soil, sunlight, and so
  forth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The analytical and the relational methods together yield
  the ultimate picture of things as they really are. They yield this ultimate picture
  through careful investigation. We use the analytical method to break things up into the
  component parts of an apparent whole; then we use the relational method to show that these
  component parts do not exist independently and separately but depend on other factors for
  their existence.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many places in the Buddha's teaching where
  methods of investigation are used singly and then in combination. For example, we apply
  mindfulness first to internal phenomena, then to external phenomena, and finally both to
  internal and external phenomena. By using analysis and relation together, we overcome many
  problems. Not only do we overcome the idea of self, substance, and personality, we also
  overcome the problems that result if we believe in the independent existence of separate
  factors and ideas like existence and nonexistence, identity and difference.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The analytical and the synthetic approaches are actually
  reflected in the chemistry of the brain. Neurologists have discovered that the brain is
  divided into two hemispheres, one whose function is analytical and one whose function is
  synthetic. If these two functions are not in harmony, not in balance, personality
  disturbances result. Someone who is too analytical tends to overlook the more intuitive,
  dynamic, fluid aspects of life, while someone who is too relational tends to lack
  precision, clarity, and focus. Thus even in our personal lives we need to combine
  analytical and relational thinking.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The psychological and neurological dimensions of these two
  approaches are also clear in the development of western philosophy and science.
  Philosophies in which the analytical approach is predominant have left us with realistic,
  pluralistic, and atomistic systems like the philosophy of Bertrand Russell. By the same
  token, in the latest developments of science, such as quantum theory, we find a more
  relational view of reality gaining ground. When we look at the history of philosophy and
  science in the West, we can see that each of these two approaches to investigation has
  been dominant at one time or another.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps we are reaching a point where we can combine the
  two even in western science and philosophy. Perhaps we can arrive at a view of reality not
  too different from the one that the Abhidharma arrives at through the experience of
  introspective meditation -- a view of reality that is both analytical (in that it rejects
  the idea of a homogeneous whole) and relational (in that it rejects the idea of
  independent, separately existing bits and pieces of reality). We would then have a very
  fluid and open view of reality in which experience saturated by suffering could be
  dynamically transformed into experience free from all suffering.</font></p>
