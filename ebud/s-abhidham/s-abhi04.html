  face="Times New Roman">n Chapter 3, I introduced several schemes for classifying
  consciousness that may be difficult to grasp, particularly for newcomers to Abhidharmic
  studies. Hence there are two additional points I would like to make as we proceed with our
  discussion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">First, to acquire understanding, one needs to cultivate
  (1) study, (2) consideration, and (3) meditation. It is not enough just to hear or read
  about the classifications of consciousness: one needs to consider exactly how they
  function, exactly what their meaning is. From my own experience, these schemes of
  classification will not begin to make sense until one spends some time running them back
  and forth in one's mind. Finally, after study and consideration, one can use them in one's
  meditation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Second, to understand these classifications, it helps to
  consider a more concrete and accessible model. Suppose you want to know how many people
  are likely to watch daytime television in Singapore. You might classify the population
  into employed and unemployed; again, you might divide the unemployed group into
  English-speaking and Chinese-speaking, so you know how many are likely to watch English
  programs compared to Chinese ones. You might divide the population into male and female,
  or into school-going and non-school-going, and the school-going group into those who
  attend English schools and those who attend Chinese schools. Given a certain group of
  factors -- in this case, the individual people who make up a population -- there are many
  ways to classify them depending on what you want to find out.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the same way with the Abhidharmic classification of
  consciousness: we have a set of types of consciousness, and we classify them in different
  ways according to what we want to find out. If we remember this general rule about why and
  how we classify factors of consciousness, and then run the schemes back and forth in our
  minds, they will begin to make more sense.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this chapter we will look at the form-sphere
  consciousness (rupavachara) and the formless-sphere consciousness (arupavachara; see
  Chapter 3). Here we are primarily concerned with the analysis of types of consciousness
  that arise from meditation, concentration, or absorption (jhana). As in the genesis of the
  Abhidharma itself, Sariputta played a vital role in the beginnings of Abhidharmic analysis
  of consciousness. In the Anupada Sutta it is mentioned that, after achieving the various
  states of meditation, Sariputta applied an Abhidharmic type of analysis by enumerating,
  classifying, and identifying the types of consciousness he had experienced.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Much emphasis was placed on analysis even in the early
  period of Buddhist history, because the experience of extraordinary states of meditation
  can be easily misinterpreted. In non-Buddhist traditions, such states are consistently
  misinterpreted as evidence of a transcendental, supranatural being or of an eternal soul.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By pointing out that states of meditation, like experience
  in general, are characterized by impermanence, transience, and insubstantiality, analysis
  wards off the three defilements of: (a) craving or attachment to the supernatural and
  extraordinary states of consciousness achieved through meditation; (b) false views, that
  is, the misinterpretation of these states of meditation as evidence of the existence of a
  transcendental being or eternal soul; and (c) conceit, which arises from the notion that
  one has achieved extraordinary states of meditation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The cultivation of states of meditation and the attainment
  of the absorptions is a very important part of Buddhist practice because it is the aim of
  mental development, which is one of the three major divisions of the Buddhist path (i.e.,
  morality, mental development, and wisdom). To achieve these states of meditation, one
  needs to create the foundation of morality and withdraw to some extent from involvement in
  worldly activities. Having achieved these preliminary conditions, one then proceeds to
  cultivate the states of meditation through various methods.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Briefly, one proceeds by means of some forty traditional
  objects of meditation, which include ten supports (kasina). These objects are coordinated
  to the temperament of the meditator. In other words, particular objects of meditation are
  prescribed for certain kinds of temperament. In general, one begins with an external
  support, gradually that external support is internalized and conceptualized, and finally
  that support is discarded and one enters the state of meditation proper.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Five factors of absorption (jhananga) are crucial to
  developing the states of meditation that result in the type of consciousness belonging to
  the form and formless spheres: (i) initial application (vitakka), (ii) sustained
  application (vichara), (iii) interest, enthusiasm, or rapture (piti), (iv) happiness or
  bliss (sukha), and (v) one-pointedness (ekaggata). These five factors are also evident in
  most types of consciousness, including the sense-sphere consciousness and even the
  consciousness of some of the more developed animals.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Take, for instance, one-pointedness. Every conscious
  moment participates in one-pointedness to some degree. This one-pointedness enables us to
  focus on a particular object in our conscious experience. If it were not for
  one-pointedness, we would not be able to pick out an object of consciousness from the
  stream of objects of consciousness. The five factors of absorption play a particular role
  in the development of meditative consciousness in that they raise our consciousness from
  the sense sphere to the form sphere, and thence to the formless sphere, through
  intensification. Intensification implies the enhancement and development of the power of
  particular functions of consciousness. Intensification of the first two factors, initial
  application and sustained application, leads to the development of the intellect, which
  can then serve to develop insight. Similarly, intensification of the fifth factor,
  one-pointedness, leads to the development of fully concentrated or absorbed consciousness.
  Intensification of all five factors leads progressively to the attainment of supernormal
  powers.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The five factors also help elevate one's consciousness
  from the sense sphere to the form and formless spheres by removing the five hindrances
  (nivarana): initial application corrects sloth and torpor; sustained application corrects
  doubt; enthusiasm corrects ill-will; happiness corrects restlessness and worry; and
  one-pointedness corrects sensual desire.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us look more closely at the five factors of absorption
  to see how they produce concentrated consciousness. To do this, we need to look in greater
  detail at their meaning. In the context of developing meditative consciousness, initial
  application (vitakka) is better termed 'applied thought,' since it means 'hitting upon,'
  'striking,' or 'mounting.' Vitakka mounts the mind, placing it on the object of
  meditation; vichara (sustained application) then keeps the mind firmly on that object,
  maintaining the placement of the mind. The third factor of absorption--enthusiasm,
  interest, or rapture (piti)--motivates one to pursue the activity of meditation
  diligently.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It may be helpful to contrast interest (piti) and
  happiness (sukha) to understand the relationship between the two. Interest and happiness
  belong to two different classes of experience: interest to the volitional class
  (sankhara), and happiness to the feeling class (vedana). On the one hand, interest is
  active anticipation and enthusiasm; on the other hand, happiness is a feeling of
  contentment or bliss. The commentaries have given the following example to illustrate the
  relation between the terms. Suppose a man in a desert is told that there is a pond of
  fresh water at the edge of a village nearby. Upon hearing the news, he experiences a keen
  sense of interest (piti) and is motivated and encouraged by the information. But when he
  actually reaches the pond and quenches his thirst, he experiences happiness (sukha). Thus
  it is interest or enthusiasm that encourages us to proceed toward concentrated
  consciousness, whereas happiness or bliss is the actual experience of mental happiness
  that results from concentrated consciousness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One-pointedness (ekaggata) is collection, non-distraction
  of the mind, focusing the mind without wavering on the object of meditation. It is like
  the flame of a lamp which remains steadfast in a room free of drafts.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When all five factors of absorption are present, we have
  the first form-sphere consciousness, or absorption. As factors of absorption are
  eliminated one by one, we progress step by step to the fifth form-sphere consciousness. In
  other words, when we eliminate initial application, we have the second form-sphere
  absorption; when sustained application is removed, we have the third form-sphere
  absorption; when interest is removed, we have the fourth form-sphere absorption; and when
  happiness is removed, we have the fifth form-sphere absorption.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These five types of consciousness are karmically active,
  wholesome types of consciousness. In addition, there are five reactive, resultant and five
  inactive or functional types of consciousness. The first five are karmically active and
  are present in this life. The second five are the result of the first five; in other
  words, cultivation of form-sphere absorption results in rebirth in the form sphere. The
  third five are the five form-sphere absorptions as practiced by the liberated ones
  (Arhats), who have broken the bonds of action and reaction; hence the five form-sphere
  absorptions are regarded as inactive when practiced by them. Thus there are fifteen types
  of form-sphere consciousness: five wholesome-active, five resultant, and five inactive.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When one has attained the fifth form-sphere consciousness,
  one experiences dissatisfaction with the limited nature of the form-sphere absorptions.
  One then progresses to formless-sphere meditation, again by means of an object of
  meditation, commonly one of the ten supports (kasina). One achieves this transition by
  extending the support until it covers the infinity of space, then discarding the support
  and meditating on the infinity of space, thereby achieving the first of the
  formless-sphere absorptions.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this is achieved, one progresses to the second
  formless-sphere absorption, which dwells on the infinity of consciousness. At this stage,
  rather than focusing on the object of the meditating consciousness (i.e., the infinity of
  space), one focuses on the subject of the meditative consciousness (i.e., the
  consciousness that pervades infinite space, or infinite consciousness).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third formless-sphere absorption dwells on the present
  nonexistence of the preceding infinite consciousness that pervaded infinity. In other
  words, the third formless-sphere absorption dwells on nothing at all, nothingness, or
  voidness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, the fourth formless-sphere absorption dwells on
  the realm of neither perception nor non-perception, a condition where consciousness is so
  subtle that it cannot be described as existent or nonexistent.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As with the form-sphere absorptions, there are three sets
  of formless-sphere consciousness (but with four instead of five types each). Four
  formless-sphere types of consciousness belong to the wholesome-active category; four
  belong to the resultant-reactive category, that is, rebirth in the formless sphere; and
  four belong to the inactive or functional category, the formless-sphere absorptions as
  practiced by the Arhats. In sum, there twelve types of formless-sphere consciousness: four
  wholesome-active, four resultant, and four inactive.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we look at the progression in the formless-sphere
  absorptions, we see a gradual unification and rarefaction of consciousness -- an
  absorption in the infinity of the object (space), then an absorption in the infinity of
  the subject (consciousness), followed by an absorption in nothingness, and, finally, an
  absorption in neither perception nor non-perception. You will remember that, when we
  talked about consciousness and its object as the fundamental, germinal structure of
  experience, we had in the sense-sphere consciousness the most fragmented type of
  experience, where consciousness and its object are broken down into many factors. As we
  progress through the form and formless spheres, gradually we have a unification of the
  subject and a unification of the object, so that when we arrive at the fourth
  formless-sphere absorption, we have reached the summit of mundane experience.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is interesting that the form-sphere and formless-sphere
  absorptions were known to yogis before the time of the Buddha and were practiced by the
  Buddha's contemporaries. We have reason to believe that the two teachers with whom Gotama
  studied before his enlightenment were practitioners of these meditations. The
  formless-sphere absorptions were the highest level of spiritual development to which man
  could aspire before the Buddha, on the night of his enlightenment, demonstrated that
  absorption has to be combined with wisdom to become truly supramundane.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is why it is said that, although one can achieve the
  highest development possible in meditation and be reborn at the pinnacle of the formless
  sphere, when the power of that meditative absorption -- which is, after all, impermanent
  -- wanes, one will be reborn in a lower sphere. For this reason, one must go beyond even
  these very rarefied and highly developed levels of meditative consciousness. One has to
  couple the concentrated and unified consciousness of the absorptions with wisdom; only
  then can one progress beyond the mundane to the supramundane types of consciousness.</font></p>
