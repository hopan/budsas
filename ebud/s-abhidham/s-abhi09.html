  face="Times New Roman">he analysis of relations, or conditionality, is as important as the
  analysis of consciousness and the other aspects of psycho-physical experience we have
  considered in the last few chapters. This analysis has often been neglected in studies of
  the Abhidharma, which is paradoxical if you remember that, of the seven books of the
  Abhidharma Pitaka, the Book of Causal Relations (Patthana), which deals with
  conditionality, is one of the largest. It is only by devoting sufficient attention to the
  analysis of conditionality that we can avoid some of the pitfalls of an overly analytical
  view of reality. I alluded to this in Chapter 2, when I devoted some time to examination
  and comparison of the analytical and the relational methods of investigation, which
  together make up the comprehensive approach of Abhidharma philosophy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps because the analytical approach of the Abhidharma
  has received more attention than the relational, we find Abhidharma philosophy categorized
  as 'realistic pluralism' by some scholars. This kind of categorization awakens all kinds
  of associations with movements of modern western philosophy, such as positivism and the
  work of Bertrand Russell. It implies that the result of Buddhist analysis is a universe in
  which numerous individual, separate, and self-existing entities exist in their own right
  and ultimately. While this may have been the view of some early schools of Buddhism in
  India, it is certainly not the view of mainstream Buddhism, whether Theravada or Mahayana.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The only way we can avoid this pluralistic, fragmentary
  view of reality is by taking due account of the relational approach outlined in the
  Patthana and also developed in the Compendium of Relations (Abhidhammattha Sangaha). By
  doing so, we will achieve a correct and balanced view of Buddhist philosophy, a view that
  takes into account the static and analytical aspect of experience as well as the dynamic
  and relational aspect.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The importance of understanding relations, or
  conditionality, is clearly indicated in the Buddha's own words. On a number of occasions
  the Buddha specifically associated the understanding of conditionality, or interdependent
  origination, with the attainment of liberation. He said that it is because of the failure
  to understand interdependent origination that we have so long wandered in this round of
  repeated rebirth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's enlightenment is frequently described as
  consisting of his penetrating the knowledge of interdependent origination. This very close
  connection between the knowledge of interdependent origination and enlightenment is
  further illustrated by the fact that ignorance is most frequently defined, both in the
  sutras and in the Abhidharma, as either ignorance of the Four Noble Truths or ignorance of
  interdependent origination. Now, the theme underlying both the Four Noble Truths and
  interdependent origination is conditionality or causality, the relation between cause and
  effect. Thus the knowledge of conditionality is equivalent to the destruction of ignorance
  and the attainment of enlightenment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The analysis of conditionality in the Abhidharma tradition
  is treated under two headings: (1) the analysis of interdependent origination, and (2) the
  analysis of the twenty-four conditions. We will look at them separately and then together,
  to see how they interact, support, and inform each other.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I will not explain each of the twelve components of
  interdependent origination here, since they are described elsewhere. I would, however,
  like to briefly mention the three fundamental schemes of interpretation of the twelve
  components: (a) the scheme that divides and distributes the twelve components over the
  course of three lifetimes--past, present, and future; (b) the scheme that divides the
  components into afflictions, actions, and sufferings; and (c) the scheme that divides the
  components into active (or causal) and reactive (or resultant) categories. In this third
  scheme, ignorance, mental formation or volition, craving, clinging, and becoming belong to
  the causal category and can belong to either the past life or the present life, while
  consciousness, name and form, the six senses, contact, feeling, birth and old age and
  death belong to the effect category and can belong to either the present life or the
  future life. Thus there is an analysis of cause and effect, or conditionality, in the
  formula of interdependent origination.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The twenty-four conditions are not mutually exclusive.
  Many of them are partly or entirely identifiable with one another. The only explanation
  for several instances of almost (if not completely) identical factors is the desire of the
  authors' to be absolutely comprehensive, so as to avoid the slightest possibility of
  neglecting a mode of conditionality.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us look at each of the twenty-four conditions in turn:
  (1) cause, (2) objective condition, (3) predominance, (4) contiguity, (5) immediacy, (6)
  simultaneous origination, (7) reciprocity, (8) support, (9) decisive support, (10)
  preexistence, (11) post-existence, (12) repetition, (13) karma, (14) effect, (15)
  nutriment, (16) control, (17) absorption, (18) path, (19) association, (20)
  disassociation, (21) presence, (22) absence, (23) separation, and (24) non-separation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A distinction must be made between cause, or root cause,
  and condition. We need to look at the Abhidharma literature if we want to distinguish
  cause from condition, because in the Sutra literature the two terms seem to be used
  interchangeably. Generally, we can understand the distinction by recourse to an analogy
  taken from the physical world: while the seed is the cause of the sprout, factors like
  water, earth, and sunlight are the conditions of the sprout. In the Abhidharmic treatment
  of conditionality, cause operates in the mental sphere and refers to the six wholesome or
  unwholesome roots--non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion and their opposites, greed,
  hatred, and delusion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Objective condition refers generally to the object which
  conditions experience. For example, a visual object is the objective condition of visual
  consciousness. Predominance refers to four categories of mental or volitional activities
  -- wish, thought, effort, and reason -- which have an overriding influence on factors of
  experience.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Contiguity and immediacy are virtually synonymous and
  refer to the conditioning of a thought-moment by the immediately preceding thought-moment.
  Contiguity and immediacy also refer to the conditioning of a given state of mind or matter
  by the immediately preceding state of mind or matter. We can perhaps understand this
  better if we think of contiguity and immediacy in the sense of immediate proximity in time
  and space, respectively.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Simultaneous origination can be seen in the case of the
  mental aggregates of consciousness, volition, perception, and feeling, and also in the
  case of the four essentials of matter (earth, water, fire, and air). Reciprocity or
  mutuality refers to the mutual dependence and support of factors, as in the case of the
  legs of a tripod that depend on and support one another. Support means the basis of any
  particular factor, in the way that the earth is the support of trees or canvas is the
  support of a painting. But when simple support becomes decisive support, it should be
  understood in the sense of inducement in a particular direction. This will become clearer
  when we examine how the twenty-four modes of conditionality function in relation to the
  twelve components of interdependent origination.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Preexistence or antecedence refers to the preexistence of
  factors that continue to exist after subsequent factors come into being. This is
  illustrated by the preexistence of the sense organs and objects of the senses, which
  continue to exist and thereby condition subsequent physical and mental experience.
  Post-existence complements preexistence and refers to the existence of subsequent factors
  such as mental and physical experience that condition preexisting factors like the sense
  organs and objects.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Repetition is important in the sphere of mental life and
  leads to skill or familiarity. This is exemplified in the seven moments of impulse
  consciousness (see Chapter 7). Repetition is particularly important in the sphere of
  wholesome and unwholesome action because it increases the force of wholesome or
  unwholesome thought-moments. Karma is volitional action of a wholesome or unwholesome
  variety. Effect or result indicates that the reactive aspect of previous karma has an
  influence and serves to condition coexisting phenomena. It is interesting to note that
  even effects do, to a limited extent, function as conditions or as causes. This will
  become clear if we remember that we are considering the functional rather than the
  essentialistic definitions of such factors.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nutriment refers to not only physical food, which is one
  of the conditions of the physical body, but also to mental food, such as impressions,
  which are the mental food of the aggregate of feeling. Control refers to confidence,
  mindfulness, and so forth, which master or control their opposites. Absorption refers not
  only to meditative absorption but also to absorption in a more general sense, which
  encompasses both wholesome and unwholesome absorptions. You may remember that the factors
  of absorption (jhananga) are not necessarily wholesome and pertain not only to the states
  of meditative absorption but also to a general condition of intensification of
  consciousness, whether wholesome or unwholesome (see Chapter 4).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Path refers to the path leading to unhappy states
  encompassing wrong views, wrong effort, and so forth, and also to the Noble Eightfold
  Path. Association refers to the conditioning of a factor by a similar factor, whereas
  disassociation is the conditioning by a dissimilar factor, such as the way sweetness and
  bitterness, light and darkness condition each other. Thus conditionality is not only
  positive but also negative. In other words, a particular factor of experience is
  conditioned not only by factors that are similar but also by factors that are dissimilar.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Presence refers to the necessary existence of certain
  conditions in order that other phenomena occur. For instance, light must be present for
  the experience of a visible form to arise. Absence is, like disassociation, a negative
  form of conditionality. For example, the disappearance of light is a condition for the
  arising of darkness. Separation and non-</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">separation are identical to disassociation and
  association, respectively.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The twenty-four modes of conditionality operate in
  conjunction with the twelve components of interdependent origination. For example,
  ignorance, the first of the twelve components, conditions volition, the second component,
  by way of two modes of conditionality: objective condition and decisive support. This can
  be understood as follows: Volition can be meritorious or demeritorious, and ignorance
  functions as the decisive support of both. Ignorance functions as the decisive support
  conditioning meritorious volition if it is made the object of your meditation, in that the
  desire to free yourself from ignorance induces you to practice meditation and so forth.
  Conversely, if an unwholesome state of mind, such as greed (which is born of ignorance),
  becomes the object of your absorption, then ignorance functions as the decisive support of
  demeritorious volition. If you then commit an unwholesome action (steal a cookie, say), it
  is because ignorance has functioned as a decisive supporting condition inducing you to
  create the unwholesome volition on which the unwholesome action was based. Ignorance can
  also condition volition by way of contiguity, repetition, and so forth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Volition (the second component of interdependent
  origination) conditions rebirth consciousness (the third component) by means of karma and
  decisive support, while consciousness conditions name and form (the fourth component)
  through reciprocity and also by means of support. Thus each of the twelve components
  conditions the subsequent component in a particular way identifiable in terms of the
  twenty-four conditions. We could cite more examples, but they would only reiterate how
  these twenty-four modes of conditionality condition the twelve components of
  interdependent origination.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The idea at the heart of the teaching of interdependent
  origination and the teaching of conditionality is the avoidance of the two extremes, the
  erroneous views of eternalism and nihilism. The Buddha said that seeing the doer of an
  action and the one who experiences the fruit of that action as identical is one extreme,
  while seeing them as different is another extreme. He taught the avoidance of these two
  extremes when he taught the Middle Way, which emerges from an understanding of
  interdependent origination and conditionality.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we examine the twelve factors of interdependent
  origination in the light of the twenty-four modes of conditionality, we find that in all
  twelve factors there is no self, but only processes conditioned by other processes --
  processes that are, in their actual nature, empty of self and substance. This
  understanding of the emptiness of self and substance is achieved through an understanding
  of conditionality.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is in this sense that the consciousness belonging to
  this life and the consciousness belonging to the next life are neither identical nor
  different. When we understand the relationship between this life and the next -- between
  the doer of an action and the experiencer of an action -- as one that cannot be described
  in terms of either identity or difference, we arrive at an understanding of the Middle
  Way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The relationship between this life and the next is one of
  cause and effect, and the relation of cause and effect is one of neither identity nor
  difference. In this way we can successfully avoid both the extreme of belief in an eternal
  self and the extreme of rejection of the law of moral responsibility, or karma.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can perhaps make this conditioned relationship between
  cause and effect clearer by looking at examples from daily life. Take the case of the seed
  and the sprout. The sprout originates dependent on the seed, but the sprout and the seed
  are neither identical nor different. They are obviously not identical, but by the same
  token, neither are they altogether different. Similarly, when a sound produces an echo,
  the two are not identical but neither are they altogether different. In the same way, this
  life and the next life are neither identical nor different; rather, the next life arises
  dependent on this life, volition, and ignorance.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this process of conditioned arising, there is no
  persistent, permanent, and identical self, but neither is there an annihilation of the
  continuity of the process of cause and effect. If we can understand the relation between
  cause (or condition) and effect (or result) as a relation that cannot be described in
  terms of identity and difference, permanence and annihilation, we will understand
  emptiness, the Middle Way, and how not-self and insubstantiality are compatible with moral
  responsibility and rebirth.</font></p>
