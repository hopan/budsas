  <hr align="center" width="25%" noshade>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" SIZE="6">I</font><font face="Times New Roman">n this
  series, I will discuss the philosophical and psychological aspects of Buddhism presented
  in the seven books of the Abhidharma Pitaka of the Pali canon. I will not look in great
  detail at the lists of factors, or dharmas, found in many competent books on the
  Abhidharma. Instead, my objectives here are three: (1) to outline and describe the
  principal methods and characteristics of the Abhidharma, (2) to relate the Abhidharma to
  what we generally know about the teachings of the Buddha, and (3) to relate Abhidharma
  philosophy to our situation as lay Buddhists.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Throughout the history of Buddhism, the Abhidharma has
  been held in high esteem. In the books of the Pali canon, for example, the Abhidharma is
  spoken of in terms of praise and special regard. There the Abhidharma is the special
  domain of the elder monks; novices are even asked not to interrupt the Elders when they
  are engaged in a discussion of the Abhidharma. We also find the Abhidharma recommended
  only for those who sincerely strive to realize the goal of Buddhist practice, and that a
  knowledge of it is recommended for teachers of the Dharma.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This traditional regard for the Abhidharma is found not
  only in the Theravada tradition but in other major Buddhist traditions as well. For
  instance, Kumarajiva, the great Central Asian translator renowned for his translation of
  Madhyamaka works into Chinese, is said to have firmly believed that he must introduce the
  Abhidharma to the Chinese if he wished to teach them Buddhist philosophy. In the Tibetan
  tradition, also, the Abhidharma is an important part of monastic training.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why is the Abhidharma held in such high esteem? The basic
  reason is that a knowledge of the Abhidharma, in the general sense of understanding the
  ultimate teaching, is absolutely necessary to achieve wisdom, which is in turn necessary
  to achieve freedom. No matter how long one meditates or how virtuous a life one leads,
  without insight into the real nature of things, one cannot achieve freedom.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A knowledge of the Abhidharma is necessary in order to
  apply the insight into impermanence, impersonality, and insubstantiality that we gain from
  a reading of the Sutra Pitaka to every experience of daily life. All of us may glimpse
  impermanence, impersonality, and insubstantiality through reading the Sutra Pitaka, but
  how often can we apply that momentary intellectual truth to our daily existence? The
  system in the Abhidharma teaching provides a mechanism for doing so. A study of the
  Abhidharma is therefore extremely useful for our practice.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us consider the origin and authenticity of the
  Abhidharma. The Theravada school holds that the Buddha is the source of the Abhidharma
  philosophy and was himself the first master of the Abhidharma because, on the night of his
  enlightenment, he penetrated the essence of the Abhidharma. According to a traditional
  account, the Buddha also spent the fourth week after his enlightenment in meditation on
  the Abhidharma. This is the week known as 'the House of Gems.' Later in his career, it is
  said that the Buddha visited the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, where his mother was, and
  taught the Abhidharma to her and the gods. It is said that when he returned to earth, he
  passed on the essentials of what he had taught to Sariputta--hardly a coincidence, since
  Sariputta was his foremost disciple, renowned for his wisdom.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus it is claimed in general that it is the Buddha to
  whom we owe the inspiration of the Abhidharma teaching. This inspiration was passed on to
  his disciples who were philosophically gifted, like Sariputta, and by the effort of these
  gifted disciples the general outline and contents of Abhidharma philosophy were
  established.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us go on to consider the meaning of the term
  abhidharma. If we look carefully at the Sutra Pitaka, we find this term occurring
  frequently, usually in the general sense of 'meditation about Dharma,' 'instruction about
  Dharma,' or 'discussion about Dharma.' In a more specific sense, abhidharma means 'special
  Dharma,' 'higher Dharma,' or 'further Dharma.' Here, of course, we are using Dharma in the
  sense of doctrine or teaching, not in the sense of phenomenon or factor of experience (in
  which case it would not be capitalized).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is an even more technical sense in which the term
  abhidharma is used in the Sutra Pitaka, and in this context dharma no longer means
  doctrine in general but, rather, phenomenon. This technical use is associated with another
  function, that is to make distinctions. This most technical use of the term abhidharma has
  five aspects, or meanings: (a) to define dharmas; (b) to ascertain the relationship
  between dharmas; (c) to analyze dharmas; (d) to classify dharmas, and (e) to arrange
  dharmas in numerical order.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist canon is divided into three collections
  (literally, 'baskets'): the Sutra Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidharma Pitaka.
  The Sutra Pitaka is ordinarily termed the basket of the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka
  contains the rules covering the monastic community, and the Abhidharma Pitaka is normally
  referred to as the books of Buddhist philosophy and psychology. Here I would like to look
  at the relationship between the Abhidharma Pitaka and the Sutra Pitaka. There is a great
  deal of Abhidharmic material in the Sutra Pitaka. Remember the technical definition of
  abhidharma that we considered a moment ago. Keeping that in mind, we find in the Sutra
  Pitaka a number of discourses that are Abhidharmic in character: the Anguttara Nikaya,
  which presents an exposition of teachings arranged in numerical order; the Sangiti Sutta
  and Dasuttara Sutta, in which Sariputta expounds on items of the teachings arranged in
  numerical order; and the Anupada Sutta, a discourse in which Sariputta analyzes his
  meditative experience in Abhidharmic terms.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">How, then, can we arrive at a distinction between the
  Abhidharma and the sutras? To do this we need to look at the second meaning of the term
  abhidharma, namely, its use in the sense of 'higher doctrine.' In the sutras the Buddha
  speaks from two points of view. First he speaks of beings, objects, the qualities and
  possessions of beings, the world, and the like, and he is often found making statements
  such as 'I myself will go to Uruvela.' Second, the Buddha proclaims in no uncertain terms
  that there is no 'I' and that all things are devoid of personality, substance, and so
  forth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Obviously, the two standpoints in operation here are the
  conventional (vohara) and the ultimate (paramattha). We have everyday language like 'you'
  and 'I,' and we also have technical philosophical language that does not assume
  personality, objects, and so forth. This is the difference between the Sutric contents and
  the Abhidharmic contents of the teachings of the Buddha. By and large, the sutras use the
  conventional standpoint while the Abhidharma uses the ultimate standpoint. Yet there are
  passages in the sutras that describe impermanence, impersonality or insubstantiality,
  elements, and aggregates, and hence reflect the ultimate standpoint. In this context there
  is also a division of texts into those whose meaning is explicit and direct, and those
  whose meaning is implicit and indirect.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why did the Buddha resort to these two standpoints, the
  conventional and the ultimate? For the answer we need to look at his excellence as a
  teacher and skill in choosing methods of teaching. If the Buddha had spoken to all his
  audiences only in terms of impermanence, insubstantiality, elements, and aggregates, I do
  not think the Buddhist community would have grown as quickly as it did during the sixth
  century B.C.E. At the same time, the Buddha knew that the ultimate standpoint is
  indispensable for a profound understanding of the Dharma, so his teachings do contain
  specific language for expressing the ultimate standpoint.</font></p>
