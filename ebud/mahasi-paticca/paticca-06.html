    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Vipassana Practice And Upadana</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The practice of vipassana, too, is to be attributed to
    kamupadana of a person who seeks permanent deliverance from evils of existence. Ordinary
    people have to contemplate to be free from the four upadanas while the Ariyas have to
    contemplate to overcome kamupadana. Thus, vipassana practice stands for the conquest of
    upadana. According to Visuddhimagga and another commentary, viz., Sammohavinodani, avijja
    is indirectly the cause of good acts in that one has to do good for liberation from avijja
    and it is also said that bhavana or vipassana practice is one of the good acts in the
    sensual world which one has to do for such liberation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The question then arises as to whether vipassana practice
    can lead to rebirth. The commentaries on Anguttara Nikaya and Patthana point to such a
    possibility. According to the commentary on Anguttara Nikaya, the first three right views
    lead to good rebirth, the last two right views, viz., the view that is born of fruition on
    the path (phala-sammaditthi) and the view that results from vipassana practice tend to
    liberate the yogi from life-cycle (samsara). It says, however, on the authority of a
    learned thera (Culabhaya) that the yogi is subject to rebirth for seven times before he
    attains Arahatship. According to Patthana, contemplation of appamana (conditions of
    existence) leads to rebirth in sensual sphere, and the commentary defines appamana-cetana
    as maturity (gotrabhu cetana). Hence, it is reasonable to assume that vipassana practice
    can give rise to rebirth before Arahatship is won.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But vipassana can ensure freedom from samsara through
    insight into anicca, dukkha and anatta of all sense-objects - an insight that keeps off
    the defilement of craving for them. This non-arising of craving means non-arising of kamma
    and rebirth. Thus, vipassana insight helps to offset kamma and its samsaric consequences
    by tadangapahana (overcoming by opposite).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, through inductive generalization, the yogi
    realizes the anicca, dukkha and anatta of other phenomena that he has contemplated. Thus,
    he keeps off the defilements and their kammic potentials by repression (vikkhambhana
    pahana). Then, there follows the Ariyan insight on the path that helps to root out the
    defilements. The emergence of this insight may be likened to the signing of an official
    letter by the head of a government department. The act of the officer-in-charge is, in
    fact, to give the finishing touch to the lot of work done by his subordinates. We cannot
    ignore the major contribution of vipassana practice in the pursuit of spiritual
    enlightenment any more than we can ignore the work of office staff or the cumulative
    effect of repeated use of a saw that makes it finally possible for the woodcutter to
    exterminate the tree once and forever. As the sub-commentary on Visuddhimagga says:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Transcendent insight on the path helps to stamp out,
    root and branch only the defilements which the yogi has done his utmost to overcome
    through mundane vipassana insight.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who do not contemplate, labour under the illusion of
    bliss and ego-entity. The illusion leads to craving, kammic efforts, rebirth and all the
    sufferings that are inherent in life-cycle.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Life-Cycle And Three Time Dimensions</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The doctrine of Paticcasamuppada describes twelve causes
    and effects viz., (1) ignorance, (2) kamma formations, (3) consciousness, (4) mind and
    body, (5) six senses, (6) sense-contact, (7) feeling, (8) craving, (9) clinging, (10)
    becoming (bhava), (11) birth (jati), (12) old age and death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the doctrine, ignorance and craving are the
    two main sources of suffering. There are two life-cycles, the anterior life-cycle and the
    posterior life-cycle. The anterior life-cycle begins with ignorance as its main source and
    ends with feeling, while the posterior life-cycle begins with craving and ends with death.
    In the former life-cycle, ignorance (avijja) and kamma formations (sankhara) in the past
    life leads to rebirth, while in the latter life-cycle, craving (tanha) and clinging
    (upadana) cause rebirth in future. The two life-cycles show how a man's lifetimes are
    linked with one another through cause and effect.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again, if the doctrine of dependent origination is to be
    described on time-scale, avijja and sankhara are two links in the past life, the links
    from vinnana to kammabhava concern the present life, while birth, old age and death are
    the links that future has in store for us. Thus, the doctrine refers to three time
    dimensions.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Five Causes In The Past</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The doctrine describes the past cause only in terms of
    avijja and sankhara but in point of fact avijja is invariably followed by tanha and
    upadana and sankhara too always lead to kammabhava. So Patisambhidamagga comments on the
    doctrine as follows.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Avijja is ignorance that dominates us while doing a
    kammic deed. Sankhara means collection and exertion of effort. Tanha is the craving for
    the results of an action in the present life and hereafter. Upadana is obsession with
    action and its result. Kammabhava is volition. These five factors in the past constitute
    the cause of present rebirth.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, we have to consider all these five links viz.,
    avijja, tanha, upadana, sankhara and kammabhava if we are to describe the past cause
    fully. Of these, avijja, tanha and upadana are labelled kilesavatta (cycle or round of
    defilements). Sankhara and kammabhava are called kammavatta (cycle of actions). The
    commentary makes a distinction between sankhara and kammabhava, describing the prior
    effort, planning, etc., preparatory to an act as sankhara and the volition at the moment
    of doing the act as kammabhava. Thus, seeking money, buying things, etc., prior to an act
    of dana comprise sankhara while the state of consciousness at the time of offering is
    kammabhava. Preliminary activities leading to an act of murder are sankhara while cetana
    or volition at the time of killing is kammabhava.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Distinction Between Sankhara And Kammabhava</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The other kind of distinction between sankhara and
    kammabhava is based on impulse-moments. It is said that an act of murder or alms-giving
    involves seven impulse-moments. The first six impulse-moments are called sankhara while
    the last is termed kammabhava.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third way of making the distinction is to describe
    volition (cetana) as kammabhava and other mental states associated with volition as
    sankhara.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last method of classification is helpful when we speak
    of good deeds in rupa and arupa spheres. All the three methods apply in the case of good
    or bad acts in sensual world, but the first method is most illuminating for those who are
    not well informed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Alternatively, Visuddhimagga attributes rebirth to
    flash-backs, visions and hallucinations that hold a dying person's attention at the last
    moment of his life. So according to this commentary, kammabhava may be defined as the
    volition (cetana) that motivated his good or bad acts in the past and the sankhara as the
    mental state conditioned by his death-bed experiences.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Present Effect Due To Past Cause</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, owing to the rounds of defilements and kamma
    comprising the five causes in the past, there arises rebirth-consciousness together with
    mind-body, six bases, impressions and feeling. These five effects are collectively called
    vipaka vatta (round of effects). Because of their ignorance, common people have the
    illusion of pleasantness about every sense-object and mind-object. They develop craving,
    thereby starting again the vicious cycle of causes and effects that represent their rounds
    of suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consciousness, the six sense bases, etc., arise as the
    kammic result of past kammas. It is a matter of cause-and-effect relationship just like
    all other phenomena. This leaves no room for ego, God or Prime Mover. The only difference
    is the moral law governing this relationship, the nature of feeling, whether pleasant or
    unpleasant, being dependent on the good or bad sankhara in the past. In reality there is
    no person who has pleasant or unpleasant feeling nor any being who causes him to have such
    an experience. Life is only the continuum of consciousness, impression, etc., as
    conditioned by five factors, viz., ignorance, craving, etc.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Knowledge For Vipassana Practice</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who have a smattering of Paticcasamuppada or
    Abhidhamma say that it is impossible to practise meditation without a knowledge of these
    teachings. But, in fact the yogi who practises under the guidance of a learned teacher
    need not bother about higher Buddhist philosophy for he can follow the teacher's
    instructions if he knows only that life is a mental and physical process characterized by
    impermanence, suffering and insubstantiality. The adequacy of this simple knowledge to
    meet the intellectual need of the yogi who is bent on Arahatship is borne out by the
    Buddha in Culatanha-sankhaya sutta. There the Lord goes on to talk about vipassana
    practice. In the sutta, the yogi's understanding of nama-rupa is termed
    &quot;abhijanati&quot; which, says the commentary, means full comprehension and refers to
    nama-rupa paricchedanana and paccayapariggahanana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through contemplation, the yogi knows all phenomena
    analytically as anicca, dukkha and anatta (parijanati). Here, the Pali terms refer to
    sammasananana and other vipassana insights.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards Paticcasamuppada, a knowledge of the
    conditionality and cause-effect relationship in life that rules out a being ego or self is
    sufficient. It is not necessary to know the twelve links or the twenty main points of the
    doctrine thoroughly. If the practice of vipassana presupposes such a comprehensive
    knowledge, it would be unthinkable for a man of low intelligence like, say, thera
    Culapanna. The thera's memory was so poor that he could not remember a few gathas that he
    had learnt for four months. Nevertheless, he attained Arahatship in a few hours when he
    practised contemplation as instructed by the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another laywoman, Matikamata by name, attained the third
    stage (anagami) on the holy path in advance of some bhikkhus who were her meditation
    teachers. She did not know much about Abhidhamma and Paticcasamuppada. There were many
    other yogis like this woman and Culapanna thera. So it is possible for a yogi to attain
    the holy path if he contemplates even though he may not have thoroughly learnt the higher
    teachings of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not to know the real nature of pleasant or unpleasant
    feeling is avijja (ignorance). It is tanha to like a sense-object and it is upadana to
    have craving for it. To seek the object of one's desire, to do good or evil for one's
    happiness or welfare in the present life or hereafter means sankhara and kammabhava. These
    five factors are the present causes and they give rise to rebirth after death. The
    doctrine of Paticcasamuppada mentions only three causes, viz., vedana, tanha and upadana
    but in reality these three factors imply two other causes, viz., avijja and sankhara since
    these two are the mainsprings of tanha and kammabhava respectively. So Patisambhidamagga
    describes all these five factors as causes of rebirth in future.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Removing The Present Causes</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every good or evil act means the complete conjunction of
    these five present causes and occasions for such a conjunction in a single lifetime may
    number by thousands. Under certain circumstances these causes may lead to rebirth after
    death or two or three rebirths successively. Every existence is bound up with old age,
    grief, death, etc., and if we wish to avoid these sufferings, we will have to remove the
    present causes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To this end we should note all physical phenomena,
    &quot;seeing&quot;, &quot;hearing&quot;, etc., at the moment of their arising. With the
    development of concentration, we note their instant passing away and become aware of their
    impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and unreliability. This awareness helps us to overcome
    ignorance and illusion that fuel craving, attachment and kammic effort: we thus keep the
    five present causes inoperative and inactive, thereby forestalling rebirth and consequent
    suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This method of removing the causes is labelled
    //tadangapahana// - overcoming some defilements through contemplation. By this method, the
    yogi attains //tadanganibbuti// - partial extinction of defilements through contemplation.
    Later on, there arises the insight on the Ariyan path which means the extinction of all
    sankhara and the realization of Nibbana (//samucchedapahana//).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The defilements and kammas are then done away with, once
    and forever. The yogis who attain sotapatti stage overcome the defilements and kammas that
    lead to the lower worlds, and those that may cause good rebirth for more than seven
    lifetimes, the yogis at the sakadagami stage overcome those that may cause more than two
    rebirths while the yogis at the anagami stage remove those that lead to rebirth in sensual
    worlds. Finally, the yogi who attains arahatta stage eradicates the remaining defilements
    and kamma. In other words, he becomes an Arahat, the Noble one who is worthy of honour
    because he is wholly free from defilements.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Arahat's Outlook On Life</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The arahat has no illusion about the nature of
    sense-objects. He is aware of their unwholesomeness and this means he realizes the truth
    of dukkha because he is free from ignorance (avijja). So he has no craving for anything.
    Inevitably, he has to fill the biological needs of his physical body such as eating,
    sleeping, etc., but he regards them as conditioned (sankhara) dukkha and finds nothing
    that is pleasant to him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The question arises as to whether he should long for
    speedy death to end such suffering. But the desire for early death or dissolution of the
    physical body too is a destructive desire and the Arahat is free from it. So there is an
    Arahat's saying in the Theragatha that he has neither the wish to die nor the wish to
    live.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Arahat does not wish to live a long life for life
    means largely the burden of suffering inherent in khandha. Although the burden of khandha
    needs constant care and attention, it is not in the least reliable. To many middle-aged or
    old people, life offers little more than frustration, disappointment and bitterness.
    Living conditions go from bad to worse, physical health declines and there is nothing but
    complete disintegration and death that await us. Yet, because of ignorance and attachment
    many people take delight in existence. On the other hand, the Arahat is disillusioned and
    he finds life dreary and monotonous. Hence, his distaste for life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the Arahat does not prefer death either. For
    death-wish is an aggressive instinct which he has also conquered. What he wants is to
    attain Nibbana, a longing that is somewhat analogous to that of a worker who wishes to get
    his daily or monthly wage.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The worker does not like to face hardship and privations
    for he has to work inevitably just to make his living but he does not want to lose his job
    either. He wants only money and looks forward to pay-day. Likewise, the Arahat waits for
    the moment when he should attain Nibbana without anything left of his body-mind complex.
    So when they think of their life-span, the Arahats wonder how long they will have to bear
    the burden of nama-rupa khandha. Because of his disillusionment, the Arahat's life-stream
    is completely cut off after Nibbana, hence it is called //anupadisesanibbana//.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Not Annihilation But Extinction Of Suffering</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who believe in ego or soul deprecate Nibbana as
    eternal death of a living being. In reality, it is the total extinction of suffering that
    results from the non-recurrence of psycho-physical phenomena together with their causes
    viz., kamma and defilements. So the Buddha points out the cessation of upadana arising
    from the complete cessation of craving, the process of becoming (bhava) ceasing to arise
    due to cessation of upadana and so on. With the non-arising of rebirth, there is the
    complete cessation of old age, death and other kinds of suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, the popular view is that birth, old age and death
    are evils that afflict living beings but, in point of fact, these evils characterize only
    the psycho-physical process and have nothing to do with a living entity. Since there is no
    ego or soul, it makes no sense to speak of the annihilation of a living being with the
    cessation of rebirth and suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So those who regard Nibbana as annihilation are not free
    from the illusion of ego-entity. To the intelligent Buddhist, Nibbana means only cessation
    of suffering. This is evident in the story of bhikkhu Yamaka in the time of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Story Of Yamaka</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yamaka believed that the Arahat was annihilated after his
    death. He clung to his view although other bhikkhus pointed out its falsity. Then,
    Sariputta summoned him. Questioned by the elder thera, Yamaka admitted that all the five
    khandhas are impermanent and suffering, that it would be a mistake to regard them as one's
    possession or self. Sariputta told him to see the five khandhas as they really are. He
    would then become disillusioned, detached and liberated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While hearing the sermon, Yamaka attained the sotapanna
    stage. He was now free from false beliefs. Sariputta then questioned him again. In
    response to the thera's questions, Yamaka said that he did not identify the Arahat with
    the physical body, the perception, the feeling, conformations (sankhara) or the
    consciousness. Nor did he believe that the Arahat existed elsewhere without the rupa,
    vedana or any other khandha. Therefore, since the Arahat or a living entity is not to be
    found in the five khandhas even before death, it makes no sense to speak of the Arahat's
    annihilation after his parinibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yamaka confessed his mistaken view. He was now free from
    it and he knew what to say about the destiny of the Arahat. If someone were to ask him,
    &quot;What happens when the Arahat passes away?&quot;, he would answer, &quot;The death of
    the Arahat means the complete cessation of suffering inherent in the impermanent five
    khandhas.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This statement about the Arahat was confirmed by
    Sariputta. The thera likened the khandhas to the murderer who poses as a friend and said
    that identifying the khandhas with atta is like welcoming the murderer, etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, the thera Yamaka at first believed that the Arahat
    was annihilated after death, that there was nothing left. This belief presupposes the
    illusion of ego-entity and so the annihilation view of Nibbana is called ucchedaditthi,
    the view that Nibbana means the negation of atta after death. When he realized the truth
    and attained sotapanna, Yamaka said that the death of the Arahat means the complete
    extinction of suffering inherent in the impermanent five khandhas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To sum up the way to the cessation of suffering, failure
    to note seeing, hearing and other psycho-physical phenomena leads to the arising of
    avijja, tanha, upadana, kamma, and sankhara that in turn cause birth, old age and death in
    future. Mindfulness of all phenomena forestalls the five present causes viz., avijja,
    etc., and the five consequences that involve suffering.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Bhikkhuni Vajira On The Nature Of Khandhas</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, it is the extinction of suffering that is
    underscored in the famous saying of bhikkhuni Vajira. While she was sitting under a tree
    near Jetavana monastery, Mara appeared and in order to scare and discomfit her, asked
    her,&quot;Hey, bhikkhuni! Who created a living being? Where is the creator? How did a
    living being originate and how would he come to an end?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bhikkhuni Vajira replied, &quot;O, Mara! What do you think
    is a living being? Is not your belief in a living being an illusion? What you regard as a
    living being is nothing but a heap of sankhara. No being is to be found in this heap, a
    living being (sattava) is merely a term for the collection of five khandhas viz., rupa,
    vedana, etc., just as &quot;chariot&quot; is the term for the combination of wheel, axle,
    etc.; there is no being but only the group of five khandhas: That cause suffering - in
    fact, it is only suffering (dukkha) that arises, exists and ends. There is no arising and
    extinction of anything other than dukkha.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, a living being is to be understood only in the
    popular acceptation of the term. It does not exist in the absolute sense; there is only
    the psycho-physical process which comprises ignorance, craving, attachment, kamma and
    kammic effort as causes and consciousness, body-mind, sense bases, impression and feeling
    as effects. These effects in turn become causes that give rise to rebirth and suffering.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Four Layers, Three Links And Twenty Factors</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Paticcasamuppada refers to four groups of factors involved
    in the chain of causation viz., the first group of causes in the past, the second group of
    effects in the present life, the third group of causes in the present and the last group
    of effects in the future. The groups are labelled //sangaha// or //sankhepa// in Pali.
    They may also be translated as layers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are three links for the four layers - the link
    between the past and the present involving sankhara as cause and vinnana as effect, the
    link between the present effect and present cause with vedana and tanha as cause and
    effect, and the third link between present cause and future with bhava as cause and jati
    (birth) as effect.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, there are twenty factors (akara) involved in the
    psycho-physical process viz., five causes in the past, five effects in the present, five
    causes in the present and five effects in the future.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Three Cycles</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again the doctrine of Paticcasamuppada deals with three
    cycles or rounds (vattas) viz., the cycles of defilements, kamma and fruits. The first
    cycle comprises ignorance, desire and attachment (upadana), the second (kamma cycle)
    comprises kammic effort and kammic existence (bhava), and the third vipaka cycle involves
    consciousness, mind-body, sense bases, impression and feeling.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third vipaka cycle again leads to the cycle of
    defilement, the cycle of defilement again gives rise to kamma cycle and so on, each of the
    three cycles occurring one after another ceaselessly in a vicious circle. The three cycles
    form the samsaric round of suffering. Samsara means continuum of nama-rupa
    (psycho-physical) process occurring in terms of cause-effect relationship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to liberate ourselves from the samsaric cycle of
    suffering, we do good deeds. We become familiar with the Buddha's teaching about the Four
    Noble Truths. We practise contemplation at the moment of seeing, hearing, etc. We realize
    the ceaseless arising and dissolution of psycho-physical phenomena. This vipassana insight
    forestalls illusion and frees us from craving and attachment that leads to rebirth and
    suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visuddhimagga describes the contribution of kamma to the
    cycle of defilement. A certain yogi sees how mind-body complex is born of kammic cycle and
    vipaka (kammic fruits) cycle. He realizes that there are only kamma and its fruits: As a
    result of kamma in the past, there arise nama-rupa in the present life; nama-rupa is the
    cause of present kamma; it gives rise to kammic deeds in present life. These kammic deeds
    lead to rebirth. In this way there is the arising (becoming) of nama-rupa (being) without
    cessation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, the arising or becoming of nama-rupa means the
    arising of phenomena from the senses e.g. seeing, hearing, etc. These lead to defilement,
    kamma, and rebirth successively. Thus, the nama-rupa process is conditioned by the cycle
    of kamma and its fruit. According to Visuddhimagga, this insight-knowledge means
    paccayapariggahanana and kankhavitarana visuddhi (Purity of Escape from all Doubt).</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Four Aspects Of Paticcasamuppada</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are four aspects of the doctrine of Paticcasamuppada
    that we should bear in mind. The first is the individual character of the psycho-physical
    process that comprises the three successive existences. Although the doctrine stresses the
    conditionality of all phenomena, it is a mistake to believe that avijja, tanha and other
    causes concern one person, while vinnana, nama-rupa and other causes concern one person,
    and while vinnana, nama-rupa and other effects concern another person for this belief
    implies the total extinction of a living being after death, the annihilation - view which
    Buddhism rejects. In reality, the nama-rupa process is analogous to, say, the evolution of
    a mango tree. The mango seed becomes a seedling, the seedling turns into a young plant and
    the plant grows into a tree. Here the seed, the young plant and the tree form a
    continuous, unbroken line of cause and effect relationship so that strictly speaking, it
    is impossible to distinguish between the tree and the plant.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Likewise, avijja, sankhara, vinnana, etc., occur in
    unbroken succession in terms of cause and effect and so it is reasonable to speak of a
    particular person involved in the process. It was Devadatta, for example, who committed
    schism and it is Devadatta who is now suffering in hell. The merchant Anathapindika did
    good deeds and it was he himself who landed in the deva-world after his death.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">The False View Of Sati</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This identification of the doer of kammic deed with the
    bearer of its fruit makes it possible for us to avoid the annihilation-view. On the other
    hand, some people believe in the transmigration of a living being as a whole from one life
    to another. This mistaken view called sassataditthi (eternity-belief) was held by bhikkhu
    Sati in the time of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was the Jatakas that led bhikkhu Sati to this view. He
    learnt how the Buddha identified himself with the leading characters in these birth
    stories. So he reasoned thus: the physical body of the bodhisatta disintegrated after his
    death and there was nothing of it that passed on to his last existence. It was only the
    consciousness that survived physical dissolution and that formed the hard core of the
    bodhisatta's personality in each of his existence. The same may be said of every other
    living being. Unlike the physical body, consciousness is not subject to disintegration. It
    passes on from one body to another and exists forever.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the Jatakas underscore only the continuity of the
    cause and effect relationship in terms or the doer of kamma and the bearer of kammic
    fruit. They do not imply the transfer of vinnana or any other attribute intact from one
    life to another. Everything passes away but because of the causal connection, we have to
    assume that the hero of a Jataka story finally became Prince Siddhattha. So after
    questioning Sati, the Buddha says that vinnana is conditioned, that it cannot arise in the
    absence of its relevant cause.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha cites the simile of a fire which is designated
    according to its origin. The fire that originates with wood is called wood-fire, that
    which starts with grass is called grass-fire and so on. Likewise, consciousness is
    conditioned by something and it is labelled according to that which conditions it. Thus,
    the consciousness that arises from eye and visual form is called visual consciousness
    (cakkhu-vinnana), that which stems from ear and sound is called auditory consciousness
    (sota-vinnana) and so forth. In short, the consciousness is specified according to the
    sense-object and the sense-organ which together give rise to it. When the cause of a fire
    changes so does its designation. A grass-fire becomes a bush-fire when the fire spreads to
    the bush. In the same way, consciousness changes its label according to the sense-object
    and the sense-organ on which it is dependent. In the case of the same sense-object and the
    same sense-organ, too, it is the new consciousness that occurs at every moment in the
    mental process. Thus, to realize the truth about mental process is to be free from
    annihilation-belief whereas a false view of it leads to eternity-belief.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Distinctive Character Of Each Phenomenon</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another aspect of the doctrine is the distinction between
    the different phenomena constituting the chain of causation. Thus avijja is a distinct
    phenomenon that conditions sankhara; sankhara is another different phenomenon that leads
    to rebirth and so on. To differentiate these phenomena is to realize their
    cause-and-effect relationship and this realization makes us free from eternity-belief. It
    helps us to do away with the illusion of a permanent, unchanging self that survives death
    and passes on to another existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In fact the eternity-belief or the annihilation-belief
    stems from the fact that people tend to over-emphasize either the connection between the
    mental states in two successive lives or the distinction between them. If we
    unintelligently identify ourselves with the nama-rupa in the present life and that in the
    previous life, we will be inclined to the belief in immortality. On the other hand, if we
    overstress the dichotomy of the nama-rupas, we are likely to fall into the trap of
    annihilation-view. The right attitude is to recognize the unbroken stream of nama-rupa
    that flows from one life to another in terms of cause and effect. This point of view gives
    us the impression of the individual character of nama-rupa and, as such, it clarifies the
    working out of kamma. It does not, however, imply the transfer of old nama-rupa or ego. It
    assumes the cessation of old nama-rupa and the arising of new nama-rupa in the present
    life on the basis of past kamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This view is crucial in vipassana practice. To the yogi
    who contemplates nama-rupa at every moment of their arising, these two aspects of the
    doctrine are apparent. He becomes aware of the stream of cause and effect comprising
    avijja, tanha, upadana and so forth. He is aware of the continuity, and the uninterrupted
    flow of nama-rupa process and, therefore, he rejects the annihilation view completely.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, being aware of the new phenomenon that arises
    whenever he contemplates, he discriminates between the sense-object and his consciousness.
    Contemplation brings to light feeling, craving, clinging, effort, consciousness, etc., as
    distinct phases of the mental process. And because he is well aware of the arising of new
    phenomena, he frees himself from eternity-belief.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Absence Of Effort (Avyapara)</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another aspect of Paticcasamuppada is the absence of
    effort (avyapara). Avijja causes sankhara without striving and sankhara does not strive to
    create rebirth. Knowledge of this fact means insight into the non-existence of any agent
    or being (karaka-puggala) who hears, sees, etc., and as such it makes us free from
    ego-belief. But as Visuddhimagga says, it lends itself to misinterpretation and turns one
    into a moral sceptic who accepts determinism and denies moral freedom.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The non-volitional nature of conditioned psycho-physical
    phenomena is apparent to the yogi who contemplates their ceaseless arising and dissolution
    for he realizes clearly that since nama-rupa is conditioned, his mind and body do not
    always act according to his desire.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Relevancy Of Cause To Effect</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last aspect of Paticcasamuppada is the one-to-one
    correspondence between cause and effect (evam dhammata). Every cause leads only to the
    relevant effect; it has nothing to do with the irrelevant effect. In other words, every
    cause is the sufficient and necessary condition for the corresponding effect. This fact
    leaves no room for belief in chance or moral impotency (akiriyaditthi) but, as
    Visuddhimagga says, for those who misunderstand it, it provides the basis for rigid
    determinism (niyatavada). As for the contemplating yogi, he clearly sees the relevancy of
    each effect to its cause and so he has no doubt about their one-to-one correspondence and
    the reality of moral freedom.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have dwelt at length on noteworthy facts about
    Paticcasamuppada. These will be clear to the yogis who consider them on the basis of their
    experience but as the doctrine is profound, they will not be able to grasp some facts that
    are beyond their intellectual level. It is of course only the omniscient Buddha who knew
    everything thoroughly. The yogi should make it a point to know fully as far as possible
    within the scope of his intellect. To this end, he should learn from the discourses of
    bhikkhus, reflect over what he has learnt and enrich his understanding through the
    practice of mindfulness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the three methods of study, the third method
    (bhavanamaya) is the most important for the yogi who gains insight-knowledge by this
    method, attains the holy path and is liberated from the dangers of the lower worlds.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Conclusion</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now we will conclude the discourse on Paticcasamuppada
    with a commentary on Arahant, the chief attribute of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The formula about the dependent origination consists of
    twelve links beginning with ignorance and ending in death. It has ignorance and craving as
    two root-causes and two life-cycles. The anterior cycle begins with ignorance and ends in
    feeling, while the posterior cycle begins with craving and ends in death and old age.
    Since anxiety, grief and the like do not occur in the Brahma world, they do not
    necessarily stem from birth (jati) and, as such, are not counted among the links of the
    dependent origination.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, the anterior life-cycle explicitly shows only
    avijja and sankhara; but avijja implies tanha-upadana and sankhara implies kammabhava. So
    all these five links form the past causes, while vinnana, nama-rupa, ayatana, phassa and
    vedana form the present effects. These vinnana, etc., are the wholesome or unwholesome
    kammic fruits that are clearly experienced at the moment of seeing, etc. The posterior
    life-cycle directly concerns tanha, upadana and kammabhava but these three causes imply
    avijja and sankhara, and so as in the past avijja, tanha, upadana, sankhara and kammabhava
    represent the five present causes that lead to birth, old age and death in future. These
    effects are the same as those of vinnana, nama-rupa, etc. Thus, like the present effects,
    the future effects are also five in number.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So there are altogether four groups of layers of five past
    causes, five present effects, five present causes and five effects in the future. The
    layers represent three causal relations viz., the relation between the past causes and the
    present effects; the relation between the present effects and present causes; and the
    conditionality of phenomenal existence is evident in these layers or the twenty links of
    cause and effect which are termed //akara//. These links may be grouped in terms of vatta
    or cycles or rounds of defilements, viz., the cycle of defilements, the cycle of kamma and
    the cycle of kammic fruits which we have already explained before.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who have done good kammas pass through human, deva
    or Brahma worlds while those who have done evil are doomed to rebirth in the lower worlds.
    Living beings confined to life-cycle (samsara) get the chance to do good only when they
    have a good teacher. A good teacher is hard to come by and so many people are largely
    prone to evil deeds and subject to their kammic effects in terms of suffering. It is then
    said that they are overtaken by Nemesis, that they have to pay for their round of kamma.
    Once established on the Ariyan path, they cannot land in hell but as for the cycle of
    kammic fruits, even the Buddhas and Arahats are not spared kammic retribution.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Cutting Off The Cycle Of Defilements</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we wish to end the threefold cycle, we will have to
    remove its cause viz., the cycle of defilements. Defilements originate with seeing,
    hearing, etc., and so we must practise mindfulness to prevent their arising when we see,
    hear, etc. The practice of concentration and mindfulness makes the yogi aware of the
    impermanence and insubstantiality of all phenomena. This means he has no more illusion and
    is free from the cycle of defilements, kammas and kammic fruits.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, to sum up the way to the total conquest of the
    threefold cycle of defilement, kammas and kammic results with reference to the attributes
    of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Arahan And The Attributes Of The Buddha</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's special designation is Arahan and this word
    points to the following attributes of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) The Buddha was free from defilements. So were the
    Arahats but they were not free from the habits that continued to dominate them even after
    the attainment of their spiritual goal. This is evident in the story of thera
    Pilindavaccha. Pilinda was an Arahat, beloved of the devas and extolled by the Buddha. Yet
    he was in the habit of addressing his fellow bhikkhus or laymen rather rudely. Some
    bhikkhus complained to the Buddha about the thera's rudeness. The Buddha attributed this
    unpleasant habit to his having spent several lifetimes in the Brahmin families but said
    that being an Arahat, the thera was pure and good at heart.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for the Buddha, from the time of his attainment of
    supreme enlightenment, he became free from all the habits or hangovers of defilements that
    were carried over from past lives. This distinctive mark of the Buddha's Arahatship should
    be borne in mind when we contemplate the Lord's attributes. The complete extinction of
    cycles means total liberation from the three cycles of defilements, kamma and kammic
    fruits.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) The Buddha was called Arahan because of his conquest
    of defilements. People fear only the external enemy such as robbers, snakes, etc. They do
    not bother about the internal enemy, that is, defilements that are more terrible. In point
    of fact, they have to suffer because of their mind-body complex and defilements. The
    root-cause is the defilements that give rise to repeated rebirths and sufferings. The
    defilements are ten in number viz., craving, hatred, ignorance, pride, illusion, doubt,
    lassitude, restlessness, shamelessness and lack of conscience.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) By virtue of his outstanding moral integrity, wisdom
    and enlightenment, the Buddha was worthy of reverence and offerings. People who revered or
    made offerings to the Buddha have their wishes fulfilled.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(4) Since he had conquered the defilements completely, the
    Buddha was pure at heart whether in public or solitude. Many people play the hypocrite,
    posing as good men or women in public but doing evil when there is no-one to see or hear
    them. In reality, there is no place where one can do evil secretly. Even though the
    evil-doer is not seen by men and gods, he cannot help having qualms of conscience. His
    conscience is the most infallible witness to his misdeeds and it forms the basis for
    death-bed visions that point to unpleasant life that future has in store for him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for the Buddha, having wholly conquered all the
    defilements, his mind was always pure and he had absolutely no desire or intention to do
    evil either publicly or secretly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(5) The Buddha had destroyed the spokes of the wheel with
    the sword of the Arahatship. Here, the wheel means the cycle of life as described in the
    doctrine of Paticcasamuppada and the sword means the insight-knowledge of the Arahat. The
    axle of the wheel represents avijja, the root-cause; the fringe of the wheel stands for
    old age and death, while the spokes stand for the middle links, viz., sankhara, etc. Just
    as the removal of spokes makes it impossible for the wheel to move, so also the
    destruction of the middle links in the chain of conditioned phenomena means the end of the
    cycle of life.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Story Of Baka Brahma</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first thing to do to end the life-cycle is to remove
    its root-cause viz., ignorance, for ignorance is invariably followed by sankhara, vinnana,
    etc., down to jaramarana (old age and death). This is true in the sensual worlds as well
    as in the material world of Brahmas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once there was a great Brahma called Baka. He outlived
    many world-systems (kappa); indeed he lived so long that at last he forgot his previous
    existences and became convinced of his immortality without old age or death. The Buddha
    went to his abode to remove his illusion. The Brahma welcomed the Lord and bragged about
    his eternal life. The Buddha said that his ignorance was appalling in that he denied
    impermanence, old age and death. He revealed the good deeds that had led to the Brahma's
    longevity and it was this fabulous longevity that had made him oblivious of his previous
    lives and created the illusion of his immortality. On hearing this, Baka Brahma had second
    thoughts about his omnipotence. Still, he was conceited and in order to show his power, he
    tried to vanish out of sight of the Buddha and other Brahmas but it was in vain. Because
    of the power of the Lord, he remained visible.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Buddha uttered the following verse:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bhavevaham bhayam disva bhavan ja vibhavesinam bhavam
    nabhivadim kinci nandincana upadiyim:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I do not extol any existence because I see danger in it. I
    have renounced the craving for existence because I am aware of its evil.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Baka Brahma and other Brahmas had lived so long that they
    considered their existence and their abode eternal. Likewise, the evils of life escape the
    notice of those who have the blessings of a good life such as health, wealth, prestige,
    success and so forth. But life is subject to suffering on all its three planes: sensual
    plane, material plane and immaterial plane. A Brahma or a rishi on the material or
    immaterial planes of existence may live for aeons but they too have to die eventually.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Sammasambuddha</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is insight knowledge that leads to the destruction of
    ignorance which is the root-cause of suffering. For the Buddha, this means the attribute
    of sammasambuddha. Sammasambuddha is one who knows the Four Noble Truths rightly,
    thoroughly and independently. Here the twelve links of Paticcasamuppada may be
    differentiated in terms of the Four Noble Truths.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, old age and death together means the first truth of
    suffering and rebirth means the truth about the cause of suffering. The cessation of this
    cause and this effect means the truth about the cessation (nirodha) and, knowledge of this
    cessation means the truth about the path to it (magga).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same may be said of rebirth and kammic cause, kammic
    cause and clinging, clinging and craving, craving and feeling, feeling and contact,
    contact and six senses, the senses and nama-rupa, nama-rupa and consciousness,
    consciousness and sankhara, and sankhara and ignorance. In short, what immediately
    precedes a link is termed its cause (samudaya) and what immediately follows is called its
    effect (dukkha sacca). We can even make ignorance (avijja), the origin of life-cycle,
    synonymous with truth about suffering (dukkha sacca); if we regard it as an effect of the
    attachment (asava) viz., attachment to sensual pleasure, existence, belief and ignorance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, the identification of tanha with dukkha may not be
    acceptable to some people. But it is reasonable if we remember the fact that all nama-rupa
    including tanha means dukkha since it is subject to impermanence. The commentary does not
    describe avijja as dukkha, but we can say it is dukkha arising from asava (biases). There
    are four asavas that have their sources in sensual craving, attachment to life, false
    belief and ignorance. It is a matter of ignorance in the past again giving rise to
    ignorance in the present. Hence, the asavas may be regarded as the cause of avijja.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So having realized the Four Noble Truths and attained
    Nibbana, through his own enlightenment, the Buddha earned the unique and glorious title of
    Sammasambuddha. He knew that all the phenomena covered by the doctrine of Paticcasamuppada
    are the real dukkha and the causes of dukkha. He was disenchanted, had no attachment and
    achieved liberation from all fetters. So according to Visuddhimagga, he was called Arahan
    because he managed to destroy completely all the supports of the wheel of life.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">The Fame Of The Buddha</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fame of the Buddha pervaded the whole universe. It
    spread to all parts of the universe through the inhabitants of some realms who came to
    hear the Buddha's sermons or through the sermons which the Buddha himself gave in some
    realms or through the former disciples who had landed in some higher realms after hearing
    the sermons.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We need not dwell on the first way in which the fame of
    the Buddha spread. As regards the other two ways, in the course of his long wanderings in
    samsara, the bodhisatta had been to all the realms except the five suddhavasa realms which
    are meant only for those who have attained anagami stage. The bodhisatta usually attains
    all the four stages on the path only in his last existence. So the Buddha had never been
    to suddhavasa realm before and on one occasion he paid a visit to it by means of his
    psychic powers. On arriving there, he received the homage of millions of brahmas, who told
    him about the former Buddhas and their landing in suddhavasa realm as the result of their
    attainment of anagami stage. Among these brahmas, there were also those who had practised
    the dhamma as disciples of Gotama Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha visited all the five suddhavasa realms. It is
    easy to see how he became famous in the realms that were the abodes of his former
    disciples. But the question arises as to how his fame spread to the formless (arupa)
    realms. It was not possible for the formless brahmas to come to the Buddha or for the
    Buddha to go to them. Those who practised the Buddha-dhamma in the sensual or the material
    world, attaining the first three stages on the path and dying with arupa (formless) jhana
    might land in the formless worlds if they so desired. These noble ones were aware of the
    sublime attributes of the Buddha and the possibility of attaining new insights through the
    practice of mindfulness. So through mindfulness of all mental events, they finally became
    Arahats and passed away in vinnanancayatana realm or akincannayatana realm or the highest
    realm called Nevasannanasannayatana. In this way, the fame of the Buddha spread throughout
    the whole universe.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">The Four Noble Truths In Brief</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have dealt in detail with the Buddha's knowledge of the
    Four Noble Truths vis-a-vis his attribute of Sammasambuddha. We will now repeat the four
    truths briefly. According to the scriptures, all the nama-rupa in the sensual, material
    and immaterial worlds, exclusive of tanha, constitute dukkha. This is the first truth.
    Tanha as the cause of dukkha is the second truth. Nibbana as the cessation of dukkha is
    the third truth, and the Ariyan path as the way to cessation is the fourth truth. These
    Four Noble Truths are realized experientially by the yogi through the practice of
    vipassana. From experience he knows that all that is arising and passing away mean dukkha,
    attachment to them is the cause, that cessation of both the dukkha and its cause is
    Nibbana, and that its attainment is the path.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Sammasambuddha And Buddhahood</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Both of the two Pali terms viz., Buddha and Sammasambuddha
    mean omniscience or knowledge of all the dhammas. This raises the question of how to make
    a distinction between the two attributes connected by the two terms. By the attribute of
    sammasambuddha, we are to understand that the bodhisatta attained Buddhahood on the basis
    of independent reflection, and effort and the realization of the Four Noble Truths through
    insight on the path of Arahatship. Buddhahood means the thorough and exhaustive knowledge
    of all the conditioned and the unconditioned dhammas on the basis of the unique attributes
    possessed by the Buddha such as omniscience (sabbannutanana), etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These unique attributes of the Buddha consist in knowledge
    of the Four Noble Truths, four kinds of analytical knowledge and six kinds of knowledge
    that are not to be found among disciples (asadharananana). The six asadharananana are: (1)
    knowledge of the different moral and spiritual levels of living beings, (2) knowledge of
    the desires, inclinations and latent tendencies (anusaya) of living beings, (3) the power
    to create super-miracles (yamakapatihariyanana), (4) infinite compassion for all living
    beings, (5) omniscience, and (6) knowledge without any hindrance or obstruction of
    anything which the Buddha wants to know and which he brings into the focus of his
    attention.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now a few words about the conditioned (sankhara) and
    unconditioned (asankhara) dhammas. The sankharas are the nama-rupa or the five aggregates
    of khandhas that arise owing to the harmonious combination of relevant factors. In other
    words, they are the phenomena conditioned by favourable circumstances. Thus, sound is
    produced when there is friction between two hard objects such as sticks or iron bars. Here
    sound is sankhara. As opposed to sankhara is asankhara which has nothing to do with
    causes. The only ultimate reality (paramattha) in the category of asankhara dhammas is
    Nibbana. Of the non-paramattha asankharas there are many kinds of names such as names of
    shapes, figures and so forth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's sabbannutanana is so called because it
    encompasses the whole range of conditioned and unconditioned dhammas. It is also described
    in terms of the five neyyadhamma viz., the sankhara, the distinctive qualities of certain
    rupas (nipphanna), the conditioned characteristics of nama-rupa, Nibbana and names.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first two attributes of the Buddha forming the
    knowledge of the different spiritual levels, inclinations and latent tendencies of living
    beings are labelled Buddha-eye (Buddha-cakkhu). With this all-seeing eye, the Buddha chose
    the living beings who ought to be enlightened, and preached to them the appropriate dhamma
    at the appropriate moment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We conclude the discourse on the Paticcasamuppada with the
    commentary on the attributes of the Buddha (Arahan) because we wish to inspire the readers
    with faith in the Blessed One. We hope that they will find the source of inspiration too,
    in the Arahats who also possess the Arahan attribute. The Arahat is wholly free from
    defilements, he has destroyed the framework of life-cycle; there is no secret place where
    he will do evil and so he is worthy of honour. These are the qualities that make up his
    Arahan attribute although this attribute as possessed by the ordinary Arahat is below the
    superlative Arahan attribute of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So you should try to overcome defilements through
    mindfulness of the nama-rupa processes that arise at the six sense-doors, destroy the
    supports of the wheel of life and keep your mind pure all the time in order that you may
    eventually become Arahats and earn the glorious title of Arahan.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">SUMMARY</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the two root-causes referred to in the two noble
    truths there arise four layers, three cycles, three connections, twelve links, three
    time-dimensions, twenty phenomena and five nama-rupa processes. One who watches these
    present resultant processes effectively does not have craving that is rooted in feeling
    and so he will put an end to life-cycle completely.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In other words, the yogi watches every psycho-physical
    event that occurs at the six senses clearly in terms of its impermanence,
    unsatisfactoriness and egolessness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through such effective practice of mindfulness, the yogi
    gains insight into the nature of the sense-object such as sound, visual form, etc., and
    overcomes the attachment to it by the opposite (tadanga), that is, he overcomes it by
    opposing it with the knowledge that undercuts it. The cessation of attachment rules out
    the arising of the other phenomena e.g. clinging, process of becoming, rebirth, etc. After
    this cessation through vipassana insight, the yogi overcomes the latent attachment
    completely through destruction (samuccheda) when he attains the insight knowledge on the
    Ariyan path. At this moment the other phenomena e.g. clinging, etc., also become totally
    extinct.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no teaching which says that with the extinction
    of feeling, craving too ceases to exist. This is no wonder for even the Arahats do not
    have any control over their feelings that arise from contact with the six senses.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are certain psycho-physical phenomena that have to
    be watched and noted as they really are i.e. in terms of anicca, dukkha and anatta if the
    yogi wants to remove the present causes such as tanha etc., the future results and end the
    cycle of suffering. These phenomena with their Pali terms are explained below.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) Vinnana: consciousness, which is of six kinds viz.,
    eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness,
    body-consciousness and mind-consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) Nama: mental factors (cetasikas) that arise together
    with consciousness. Rupa: the physical phenomena that arises together with that
    consciousness. Nama-rupa may be translated as mind and matter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) Salayatana: the six bases of mental activity, that is,
    the six internal bases comprising the consciousness and the five physical sense-organs
    viz., eye, ear, nose, tongue and body and the six external bases viz., visible object,
    sound, odour, sap or gustative object, body-impression and mind-object.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(4) Phassa: contact or impression, which is of six kinds
    viz., visual impression, impression of hearing, of smelling, of tasting, bodily impression
    and mental impression.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(5) Vedana: feelings which is of three kinds viz.,
    pleasant feeling, unpleasant feeling and indifferent feeling. We may also distinguish six
    kinds of feelings: feelings associated with seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting,
    body-impression and mental impression.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Two root-causes:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ignorance (avijja) and craving (tanha).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Two truths:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Truth about the cause (craving) and truth about suffering
      (dukkha).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Four layers:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) The layer of the past cause - ignorance, kamma
      formations (sankhara), craving, clinging and becoming.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) The layer of present result - consciousness, mind-body
      complex, six bases of mental activity, impression, feeling.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) The layer of present cause - craving, clinging, kamma,
      becoming, ignorance, kamma formations (sankhara).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(4) Future result - birth, old age, death, consciousness,
      etc.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Three cycles:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) The cycle of defilements - ignorance, craving,
      clinging.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) The cycle of kamma - kamma formations (sankhara),
      kamma and becoming.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) The cycle of kammic results - consciousness, mind-body
      complex, six bases of mental activity, impression, feeling, birth, old age and death.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. Three connections:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) The connection between the past kamma formations
      (sankhara) as the past cause and consciousness as the present result.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) The connection between feeling as the present result
      and craving as the present cause.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) The connection between becoming as the present cause
      and birth as the future result.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. Twelve links:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) ignorance (2) kamma formations (3) consciousness (4)
      mental and physical phenomena (5) six bases (6) impression (7) feeling (8) craving (9)
      clinging (10) becoming (11) rebirth (12) old age and death</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. Three time-dimensions:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) The infinite past - ignorance and kamma formations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) The infinite present - consciousness, mind-body
      complex, six bases, impression, feeling, craving, clinging, kamma-process.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) The infinite future - rebirth, old age and death.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. Twenty elements:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) Five elements of the causative process in the past
      existence.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) Five elements of the resultant process in the present
      existence.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) Five elements of the causative process in the present
      existence.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(4) Five elements of the resultant process in the future
      existence.</font></p>
