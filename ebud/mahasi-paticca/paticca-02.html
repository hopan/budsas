    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Vinnana And Nama-Rupa</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The doctrine says that vinnana gives rise to nama-rupa.
    This means that with the arising of rebirth consciousness there also arise mind and body.
    Rebirth consciousness is invariably coupled with feeling (vedana), perception (sanna),
    contact (phassa), volition (cetana), mental advertance (manasikara) and other elements of
    mind relating to the objects of death-bed visions of a person. Every citta is bound up
    with these mental elements. The high (tihetu) rebirth of some Brahmas, devas and human
    beings also, involve the three noble predispositions of alobha, adosa and amoha; some
    devas and human beings have only alobha and adosa while the earth-bound devas and human
    beings with defective organs are totally devoid of noble predispositions. Their rebirth is
    a good ahetu-birth as distinct from the evil ahetu-rebirth of the denizens of the lower
    worlds who are also devoid of good inborn tendencies.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rebirth may assume one of the three forms: rebirth in the
    mother's womb, rebirth generated in putridity (samsedaja) and rebirth as sudden and
    spontaneous emergence of the full-fledged physical body (opapatika). Rebirth in the
    mother's womb is of two kinds, viz., viviparous as in the case of human beings and
    quadrupeds emerging from the wombs with umbilical cords and oviparous as in the case of
    birds coming out of eggs. These living beings may differ in origin as they do in size and
    gestation or incubation period. We will leave it at that and now go on with the human
    rebirth as described in the commentaries.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With the arising of rebirth consciousness there occur
    simultaneously three kammaja-rupakalapa or thirty rupas. These are rupas that have their
    origin in kamma, viz., ten kaya-rupas, ten bhava-rupas and ten vatthu-rupas. The nine
    rupas, to wit, the solid, fluid, heat, motion, colour, smell, taste, nutriment and life
    together with the kayapasada (body-essence), rupa form the ten kaya-rupas; bhava-rupa and
    the solid, etc., form the group of ten bhava-rupas. Bhava-rupa means two germinal rupas,
    one of manhood and the other for womanhood. With the maturation of these rupas the mental
    and physical characteristics of man and woman become differentiated, as is evident in the
    case of those who have undergone sex changes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the time of the Buddha Soreyya, the son of a merchant,
    instantly turned into a woman for having wronged Mahakaccayana thera. All masculine
    features disappeared and gave way to those of the fair sex. He even gave birth to two
    children. It was only when he begged for forgiveness that he again became a man. Later on,
    he joined the holy order and died as an Arahat. It is somewhat like the case of a man who
    develops canine mentality after having been bitten by a rabid dog. The sex freak who is
    neither a male nor a female has no bhava-rupa. He has only ten kaya-rupas and ten
    vatthu-rupas. Vatthu-rupas are the physical bases of rebirth, subconscious, death and
    other cittas. So at the moment of conception there is already the physical basis for
    rebirth consciousness. The three kalapas or thirty rupas form the kalala which, according
    to ancient Buddhist books, mark the beginning of life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This embryonic rupa has the size of a little drop of
    butter-oil scum on a fine woollen thread. It is so small that it is invisible to the naked
    eye. It does not exist by itself. We should assume that it arises from the fusion of the
    semen (sukka) and blood (sanita) of the parents. If we reject this view, it will be hard
    to explain the child's resemblance to his parents in physical appearance. It is also said
    in the suttas that the physical body is the product of the four primary elements and the
    parent's semen. Moreover, the pitaka specifies three conditions necessary for conception,
    viz., the parents' intercourse, the menstrual discharge of the mother and the presence of
    something qualified to become an embryo. Thus, it is clear that according to the
    scriptures, the embryonic kalala has its origin in the fusion of parents' semen and blood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The semen and blood dissociated from the parents are utuja
    (temperature-based) rupa but it is quite possible for utuja-rupa to assimilate kammaja
    (kamma-based) rupa. Modern doctors excise a lump of unhealthy tissue from the human body
    and replace it with healthy tissue. The graft is utuja-rupa when cut out from the body
    but, as it becomes one whole with the natural tissues there appears kayapasada or
    kammaja-rupa. There are also cases of transplanting a goat's intestine or a human eye in
    place of diseased organs. No doubt these transplants develop kammaja-rupas in the form of
    kayapasada and cakkhupasada. Likewise, we should assume that the three kammajakalapas are
    fused with utuja-rupas of semen and blood detached from parents.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Western biologists, it is the fusion of the
    mother's ovum and the father's spermatoza that gradually develops and becomes a child. The
    original embryo is so small that it cannot be seen with the naked eye. The findings of
    these scientists fairly agree with what the Buddhist books say about conception. Without
    the help of microscope or other instruments, but purely by means of his intellect, the
    Buddha knew how life begins with three kalapas or thirty rupas as kalala on the basis of
    parents' semen and blood. This was the Buddha's teaching 2500 years ago and it was only
    during the last 300 years that Western scientists discovered the facts about conception
    after long investigation with microscopes. Their discoveries bear testimony to the
    Buddha's infinite intelligence. However, they are as yet unable to reveal the genesis of
    thirty rupas probably because the extremely subtle kammaja-rupas defy microscopic
    investigation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, the cetasika and kammaja-rupa are the nama-rupas
    born of rebirth consciousness. The kammaja-rupas are renewed at every thought-moment as
    are the utuja-rupas due to heat. From the arising of the first bhavanga-citta there also
    occur cittaja-rupa (consciousness-based) rupas at the moment of the arising of citta. But,
    cittas which make us barely aware of seeing, etc., cannot cause rupa. So cittaja-rupas do
    not arise at the moment of the arising of the bare cittas. Thus, with the arising of the
    rebirth citta, there develop in due course all other kinds of citta, that is, cetasikas,
    e.g., feeling, etc., as well as all kinds of rupa, to wit, kammaja, utuja and
    cittaja-rupas. After a week, the kalala becomes turbid froth (abbuda) which turns into a
    lump of flesh after a week. This hardens into //ghana// in another week and in the fifth
    week there develops //pasakha// with four knobs for hands and legs and one big knob for
    head.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist books do not describe in detail the
    development after the fifth week, but say that after 77 days the four pasada-rupas for
    seeing, hearing, smelling, and tasting appear as do the ahara-rupas, the product of the
    nutriment in the mother's body. It is also said that the embryo has toe-nails,
    finger-nails, etc. The books do not go into further details as it is not necessary for the
    yogis to know them. Such knowledge is beneficial only to doctors.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>//Upapata// Rebirth</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For heavenly beings like catumaharaja and others, as soon
    as the rebirth-citta arises, there also arise 70 rupas or seven different kalapas, viz.,
    cakkhu, sota, ghana, jiva, kayabhava and vatthudasaka. Kalapas of the same kind are
    innumerable according to the size of the deva's eyes, ears, etc. There are no
    dasaka-kalapas, that is, ghana, jiva, kaya and bhava in the three first jhanic abodes, the
    three second jhanic abodes, the three third jhanic abodes, the vehapphala and suddhavasa
    abodes. The three dasakarupa-kalapas (cakkhu, sota and vatthu-dasaka) and one
    navaka-kalapa or a total of four different kalapas or 39 rupas arise simultaneously with
    rebirth-citta. Of these four kalapas, jivitanavaka-kalapa takes on the nature of
    kayadasaka. The body of the Brahma is pervaded by jivita and nine rupas as is the deva's
    body by kayadasaka-kalapa. Asannasatta Brahmas have no citta from the moment of rebirth.
    They have only jivitanavaka-kalapa which assume Brahmanic form. Being devoid of citta and
    cittaja-rupa, such a Brahma knows nothing and makes no movement. He is like a wooden
    statue. More wonderful than these Brahmas are arupa Brahmas who having no rupa live in
    arupa (immaterial) worlds for thousands of world-systems through the successive renewal of
    mind and its elements. These accounts do not admit of scientific investigation and they
    concern only the Buddha and holy men with psychic powers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The denizens of hell and the petas who are forever burning
    and starving cannot be conceived in wombs nor can they arise from putrid matter. Because
    of their evil kamma they come into being by materialization. Like the aforementioned devas
    they develop seven kalapas or 70 rupas simultaneously. They usually do not have defective
    vision, hearing, etc., since they are doomed to suffering through sense-contact with evil
    objects.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sansedaja Beings</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the sansedaja beings are said to have their origin in
    putrid matter, they are likely to develop gradually. But, the Buddhist books refer to
    their full-fledged materialization if they do not have defective visions, etc. We cannot
    say which is true, development or materialization, as the kammaja-rupas cannot be
    subjected to scientific inquiry and so for the time being it is better to accept the view
    as stated in the scriptures. The development of kammaja and other rupas in sansedaja and
    upapata rebirths are generally like that in gabbhaseyyaka (womb) rebirth. The only
    difference is that in the case of the former beings, aharaja-rupas arise from the time
    they eat food or swallow their saliva.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Vithi-Cittas</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vithi-cittas differ in kind from bhavanga-cittas.
    Bhavanga-citta resembles rebirth-citta in respect of objects and process. It is the stream
    of consciousness that follows rebirth-citta, having its root in kamma. It is focused on
    one of the three objects viz., kamma, kammanimitta or gatinimitta of the previous
    existence. It is not concerned with the objects in present life. It is the kind of mental
    state that we have when sound asleep. But there occur certain changes when we see, hear,
    smell, eat, have bodily contact or think and these changes in mental phenomena are called
    six vithi-cittas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose the visual form is reflected on the sensitive rupa
    of the eye (cakkhupasada), these rupas, each lasting only 17 thought-moments, are renewed
    ceaselessly together with the visual objects and their mental images. A group of eye-rupas
    and a group of visual objects occur simultaneously. But, a rupa is not powerful at the
    moment of arising and so there is no contact between the eye and its object during the
    moment of bhavanga-citta. In other words, there is no reflection of the visual object on
    the eye. The bhavanga that passes away before such reflection is called atitabhavanga.
    Then another bhavanga-citta arises and reflection occurs. As a result, the bhavanga-citta
    is disrupted. Its attentiveness to its accustomed object wanes and it begins to consider
    the visual object. This is termed bhavangacalana or bhavanga in motion. Then another
    bhavanga takes its place but, it is so weak that with its cessation, the bhavanga stream
    is cut off. The mind becomes curious about the visual form that the eye sees. This
    inquiring mind is called avajjana-citta and there are five kinds of such cittas
    corresponding to five sense-organs. There follows the eye consciousness, and after its
    cessation, there arises the citta which receives and attends to the visual object.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bhavanga is the resultant citta that stems from sankhara,
    as are eye-citta and the receiving citta. They are called vipaka (resultant) cittas. There
    are two kinds of vipaka-cittas, viz., good and bad according to good and bad sankhara. On
    the other hand avajjana-citta (mental advertance) is ethically neither good nor bad; it is
    not a vipaka-citta either. It is termed kiriya-citta which means mere action without any
    kammic effect, the kind of citta that is usually attributed to Arahats.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the mind has received the visual object, it inquires
    about its quality, whether it is good, bad, etc., (santirana-citta). Then, there follows
    decision (vutthocitta), that it is good, etc. This leads to javana which means seven
    impulse moments flashing seven times in succession. Javana occurs very quickly. It has
    speed and impetus that are absent in other factors of the consciousness process. It is
    associated with powerful mental factors which may be good or bad such as lobha or alobha.
    No wonder that evil minds rush towards their objects speedily. Thus, greed makes us
    inclined to scramble for the desired object and seize it by force, and anger arouses in us
    the desire to rush and destroy its object blindly. Doubt, restlessness and ignorance, too,
    speedily associate themselves with their respective objects. The same may be said of good
    mental factors. Because of their frantic and impulsive nature, the sensual desires are
    also called kamajavana. After the seven impulse moments, there follow two
    tadarammana-citta moments. This citta is concerned with the object of javana and thus its
    function is to fulfil the lingering desire of its predecessor.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the consciousness process the eye-vinnana is dependent
    on eye organ (cakkhu-pasada) that arises together with atitabhavanga. Other vinnanas are
    dependent on the heart (hadaya-vatthu) rupa that arises along with other cittas. The 14
    cittas from avajjana to the second tadarammana are focused only on present objects. So
    these 14 cittas are vithi-cittas that differ in kind from bhavanga-cittas. In other words,
    they are active cittas. After the cessation of second tadarammana-citta that marks the end
    of the consciousness process, the mental life reverts to the subconsciousness (bhavanga)
    state that is something like sleep.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">An analogy may throw some light on the process (vithi) of
    consciousness. A man is sleeping under a mango tree. A mango falls and he wakes up.
    Picking up the fruit, the man examines it. He smells it and knowing that it is ripe, he
    eats it. Then he thinks over its taste and falls asleep again. Here the bhavanga state
    with kamma, kamma-nimitta and gatinimitta as its objects is like the state of being
    asleep. Waking up with a start due to the fall of the mango may be like the rising and
    passing away of bhavanga-citta. Reflection after awaking is avajjana. Seeing the visual
    object is seeing the fruit. Santirana-citta is involved when the man examines the fruit.
    To conclude that it is ripe is vuttho-citta. Javana is like eating the fruit and
    tadarammana is like thinking over its taste. Reverting to bhavanga state is like falling
    asleep again.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the visible object is not very clear, it appears on the
    eye-organ after the arising of atitabhavanga twice or thrice. In case of such objects the
    vithi process does not last till the emergence of tadarammana but ends in javana and sinks
    into bhavanga state.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the visible object is still weaker, it is reflected
    only after the arising of atitabhavanga from five to nine times. The vithi process does
    not reach javana, but ends after vuttho arises twice or thrice. The vithi that thus ends
    in vuttho is of great importance in the practice of vipassana. For the yogi who practises
    constant mindfulness does not seek or attend to defiling sense-objects. So reflection is
    slow, avajjana is weak, eye-consciousness is not clear, reception is not proper, inquiry
    is not effective and decision is indefinite. So after reflecting twice or thrice the mind
    relapses into bhavanga state. The object is not clear enough to defile the mind and the
    yogi becomes aware of anicca, dukkha and anatta of the phenomena. There is only bare
    awareness of seeing and the vithi process is wholly free from defilements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The vithi process that we have outlined above for the eye
    equally applies to the ear, nose, tongue and body.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Manodvara Vithi</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mind vithi is of three kinds according to the javana
    involved, viz., kammajavana, jhanajavana and maggaphalajavana. Here, what matters is vithi
    with kammajavana. While the bhavanga stream is flowing, there appear mental images of the
    sense-objects that one has experienced or, sometimes, those which one has not experienced.
    Then bhavanga is disturbed and next time it is cut off. This is followed by reflection
    which is somewhat like vuttho (decision) in the five sense-organs. Like vuttho, reflection
    (avajjana) leads to javana, giving rise to agreeable or disagreeable emotions such as
    fear, anger, confusion, devotion, awe, pity and so forth. The impulses arising at the five
    sense-organs are weak and they neither lead to good or bad rebirth nor produce much other
    effects. But the impulses in the mind are potent enough to determine the quality of
    rebirth and all other kammic results. So it is necessary to guard and control these
    impulses. After seven impulse-moments followed by two tadarammana-moments the mind sinks
    into bhavanga state.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, the vithi process at manodvara involves one
    avajjana-moment, seven javana-moments and two tadarammana-moments. In the case of dim and
    indistinct objects, the mind skips tadarammana, passes through javana and reverts to
    bhavanga. If the object is very weak, the mind does not attain even javana but has two or
    three avajjana-moments. This is natural if we bear in mind the way we have to focus on
    mind-objects in vipassana practice. The only resultant citta in this mano-vithi is
    tadarammana, the other two being kiriya-citta, the citta that does not stem from sankhara.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Follow-Up Vithi</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mind vithi may involve the review of the sense-objects
    after rising from bhavanga state in the wake of the vithi rooted in the respective
    sense-organs. Up to this vithi the mind has, as its object, only rupa in its ultimate
    sense (paramattharupa). It is not concerned with the conventional modes of usage, e.g.
    man, woman, etc. So at this moment the yogi is not misled by appearances for he is aware
    of ultimate reality. He should try to contemplate immediately after seeing, etc. We,
    therefore, stress the importance of immediate and present moment as the yogi's focus of
    attention.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If after this kind of manovithi the yogi is unmindful,
    there arises another manovithi in connection with the visual object, etc. Then the
    sense-object becomes a specific object of attention in terms of conventional shape and
    form. This vithi is open to strong but unwholesome impulses. It gives way to another
    manovithi where the attention is focused on conventional designations such as man, woman,
    etc., thereby making it more susceptible to stronger evil impulses.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the face of a strange, unfamiliar object, the
    vithi-process involves three stages, viz., seeing, reflection and cognizance of the form
    and substance in conventional terms. The vithi stops short of cognizing the conventional
    names. In the case of vithi that arises in connection with a conventional term, it
    involves hearing, reflection and cognizance of the conventional term, and awareness of the
    relevant form and substance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>From Vinnana Arises Nama-Rupa</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of rebirth consciousness there arise mental
    phenomena associated with it such as feeling, remembering, perception, reflection, etc.,
    together with the three kalapas or thirty rupas. After the cessation of rebirth
    consciousness, cetasikas (mental factors) arise in the wake of every activity of vinnana
    and so do rupas conditioned by citta, kamma, utu (heat) and ahara (nutriment).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no doubt, about the close connection between
    citta and cetasika. When citta is active we feel, we remember, we think, there arise
    greed, anger, faith and so forth. Equally obvious are the physical phenomena that stem
    from cittas. We stand, sit, go or do anything that we wish to do. According to the
    commentary, this obvious fact gives ground for our knowledge that the rebirth
    consciousness at the moment of conception leads to three kalapas or thirty rupas. In fact,
    the arising of rebirth consciousness and rupa at the moment of conception takes place in a
    split second and as such it is invisible even to the divine eye. The divine eye may see
    what happens shortly before death and after rebirth, but it is only the Buddha's
    omniscience that sees death-citta and rebirth-citta directly. But, from what we know about
    the cause of physical phenomena, we can infer the arising of rupa from the rebirth-citta
    at the moment of conception.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some physical phenomena have their origin not in citta but
    in kamma, utu (heat) and material food, but without citta they will have no life. A corpse
    is lifeless although it is composed of utuja-rupas. It is because of the contribution of
    citta that the rupas based on kamma, utu and nutriment exist and form a continuous stream
    of life. Once death supervenes, cutting off the stream of consciousness, the cetasikas and
    living rupas cease to exist. Hence, the teaching that nama-rupa is conditioned of vinnana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of sankhara (good or bad kamma) there is an
    uninterrupted flow of vinnana in the new existence. Coupled with every citta is nama-rupa
    which arises ceaselessly. The duration of nama-rupa depends on citta. If citta lasts an
    hour, so does nama-rupa. If the stream of citta, flows for 100 years, we say that the life
    of nama-rupa is 100 years. In short, we should understand that life is only the continuum
    of ceaseless causal relationships between nama-rupa and vinnana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To sum up what we have said so far. Avijja causes
    sankhara. Because of the ignorance of the four noble truths people exert effort (sankhara)
    to be happy. They think that they will be happy if they get what they want. But, the
    objects of their desire are impermanent and so they lead to suffering. Not knowing the
    truth about dukkha, they think, speak and do things for their welfare in the present life
    and hereafter. These kammic actions lead to rebirth consciousness in the lower or the
    higher worlds. Beginning with this rebirth consciousness, there is a stream of citta that
    flows continuously until death, and the nature of this mental life is determined by kamma.
    The physical body too is conditioned by kamma as well as by citta, utu (heat) and
    nutriment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The physical phenomena as conditioned by citta are obvious
    for all our bodily and verbal actions such as moving, speaking, etc., are rooted in citta.
    The yogi has to practise mindfulness on the basis of these cittajarupas and it is
    important to know them empirically for himself. Hence, the Buddha's teaching in
    Mahasatipatthana sutta: &quot;The bhikkhu knows that he walks when he walks and that he
    stands when he stands.&quot; According to the commentary, if we know experientially the
    dependence of cittajarupa on citta, we can know by inference the contribution of vinnana
    to kammajarupa, cittajarupa, utujarupa and aharajarupa. Hence, the teaching of
    Paticcasamuppada: Conditioned by vinnana, there arises nama-rupa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The yogi cannot know empirically the rebirth-citta or for
    that matter any other citta in the past in its ultimate sense. All that he can know is the
    reality about consciousness as it is functioning at present and he can know this only if
    he is always mindful. If he focuses on present vinnana, he comes to know nama-rupa fairly
    well. For, if he notes &quot;seeing, seeing&quot; and knows the eye-consciousness, he also
    knows the nama-rupa that is bound up with it. Here, by eye-consciousness we mean not only
    the eye-vinnana but the whole mental process of seeing (cakkhudvara-vithi). The yogi notes
    it as a whole and not by piecemeal. Moreover, the vithi appears to the yogi as a single
    unit of consciousness. This way of introspection is in accord with Patisambhidamagga which
    says: &quot;The citta that focuses on rupa arises and passes away. The yogi then
    contemplates the dissolution of the citta that has watched the dissolution of the
    rupa.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In other words, when the rupa is manifest, the citta
    watches it; but since the citta has attained bhanga insight, it too sees impermanence in
    the rupa and dissolves away. The dissolving vipassana citta itself becomes the object of
    contemplation. This vipassana citta is not a simple citta; it is composed of at least
    avajjana and seven impulse moments. But, these eight cittas cannot be watched one by one;
    the whole vithi is to be the object of attention.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, the eye-consciousness means the whole mental process
    (vithi) of seeing and it includes good or bad kamma and impulses. So attentiveness to it
    leads to awareness of vedana (feeling), sanna (perception), phassa (contact), manasikara
    (reflection), cetana (volition) and so forth. But, cetana is more apparent in connection
    with thinking. Thus, it comes into full play when at night we think of what we have to do
    the next day. It urges and agitates us and its function is unmistakable. The yogi who
    constantly watches his nama-rupa is aware of cetana in action whenever he speaks or moves
    any part of his body. For example, if while practising mindfulness, you feel an itch you
    wish to get rid of, you note the desire and you feel as if you are being urged to remove
    the itch. It is cetana which urges you to do and so it is manifest in your everyday
    action, speech and thinking.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short, if you know the eye-consciousness through
    contemplation, you know the nama (mental) khandhas that are born of it as well as the
    rupas of the whole body that form its basis. This is in accordance with the teaching:
    &quot;From vinnana there arises nama-rupa.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same may be said of the consciousness in connection
    with hearing, etc., awareness of vinnana means awareness of all the nama-rupa that are
    bound up with it. The awareness of contact is based on pleasant and unpleasant sensations
    when these sensations are manifest; it is based on contact when motion and rigidity are
    manifest; when you note the desire to bend the arm, you know the volition (cetana) behind
    it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you contemplate the vinnana which thinks, you know
    the nama-rupa that is coupled with it. When you find yourself committing something to
    memory, you know sanna; when you note your intention to do or speak something, you become
    aware of cetana; when you note your desire for something, you know that it is your lobha.
    When you note your irritation, you know that it is dosa; you know moha when you note your
    view of a being in terms of a permanent and happy individual. You know alobha when you
    know the lack of desire in you. Moreover, your intention to do or say something is
    followed by bodily behaviour or verbal expression and so through contemplation, you become
    aware of vinnana-citta as the cause of rupas in the body.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vinnana and nama-rupa are interdependent. Just as vinnana
    gives rise to nama-rupa, so also nama-rupa leads to vinnana. Nama-rupa contributes to
    vinnana by way of simultaneous arising (sahajatapaccaya) foundation (nissayapaccaya) and
    so forth. It is only through the contribution of all cetasikas collectively or the body
    (rupa) as the physical basis, etc., that vinnana comes into being.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mahapadana sutta tells us how the bodhisatta reflected on
    dependent origination just before he attained enlightenment. He found nama-rupa, six bases
    of mental activity, impression, feeling, craving, clinging and becoming (bhava) to be the
    links in the chain of causation leading to old age and death. Then it occurs to him that
    nama-rupa is conditioned by vinnana and vice-versa. The sutta ascribes this statement
    about the correlation between vinnana and nama-rupa to Vipassi bodhisatta, but we should
    understand that it is a fact discovered by all bodhisattas before they attained supreme
    enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although vinnana and nama-rupa are interdependent, the
    former is the determining factor and, hence, it is described as the cause of nama-rupa. In
    fact, when vinnana arises because of sankhara, its concomitant cetasikas as well as the
    rupas resulting from sankhara come into being at the same time. So vinnanas and nama-rupas
    arise together from the moment of rebirth. Moreover, vinnana and nama-rupa include the six
    ayatana (the six bases or sense-organs) as well as phassa (sense-contact) and vedana
    (feeling). But since vinnana is the cause of nama-rupa and nama-rupa the cause of
    salayatana and so forth, the Buddha says: Vinnana paccaya nama-rupa, etc., to distinguish
    between cause and effect. Likewise a verse in the Dhammapada describes the mind (mano or
    vinnana) as leading the cetasikas: manopubbangama dhamma; if a person acts or speaks with
    an evil mind, suffering follows him as a result, just as the wheels of a cart follow the
    ox which draws it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In point of fact citta and cetasikas arise together but,
    because of its predominant role, citta is described as leading the latter. If a man's mind
    is evil, he does evil deeds, utters evil words and harbours evil thoughts. These three
    kinds of kammas are sankharas born of ignorance. They become potential for evil kammic
    effect. Every deed, speech or thought is accompanied by seven impulse-moments that flash
    forth several times. If the first impulse-moments are favourable, the kamma is productive
    in the present life; otherwise it becomes sterile. If one of the seven impulse-moments is
    favourable, it gives rise to kammic images or visions of afterlife on death-bed and
    produces kammic effect in the next life. Otherwise, it is sterile. As for the other five
    impulse-moments, they produce kammic effect from the third existence till the last
    existence (the existence when Nibbana is to be attained) under favourable circumstances.
    It becomes sterile only after the attainment of Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before the attainment of Nibbana its potential remains
    intact for innumerable lifetimes, ready to bear fruit when circumstances permit. It bears
    fruit in terms of suffering, both mental and physical, in the lower worlds. If by virtue
    of good kamma the person is reborn in the human world, he will be dogged by evil kamma and
    suffer regardless of his station in life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Story Of Cakkhupala Thera</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhammapada verse that we have referred to was uttered
    by the Buddha in connection with the story of Cakkhupala thera. The thera was a physician
    in one of his previous lives. He cured a blind woman and restored her sight. The woman had
    promised to serve him as his slave should she recover her sight. But, she did not keep her
    promise and lied that she was worse off than before. Seeing her trick, the physician gave
    her an eye-lotion that destroyed her eyes completely. For his evil kamma the man suffered
    in many lives and in his last existence he became Cakkhupala thera. He practised
    meditation as instructed by the Buddha with 60 other monks at a forest retreat. He never
    lay down while meditating and soon he had an eye-infection. He refused to lie down to
    apply the eye-lotion and so the doctor gave up the attempt to cure him. Reminding himself
    of certain death, the thera redoubled his effort and at midnight he became blind and
    attained Arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To an ordinary observer, the thera's blindness may appear
    to be the price that he had to pay for the over-exertion of his energy. But the main cause
    was the evil deed he had committed in his previous life as a doctor. Even if he had not
    practised meditation, he might have become blind somehow or other. But the attainment of
    Arahatship was an immense benefit that accrued to him from his overzealous and strenuous
    exertion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two lessons that we can learn from the story of
    Cakkhupala thera. As an energetic monk, he continued to practise vipassana after he became
    an Arahat. As he paced on the ground while meditating, the insects that lay in his path
    were trampled to death. When the matter was brought to the notice of the Buddha, the Lord
    said that since the thera had no intention to kill the insects, he was free from any moral
    responsibility for their destruction.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we should note that causing death without cetana or
    volition is not a kammic act and that the body of an Arahat has weight if he has no
    psychic power or, if despite his iddhi he walks without exercising it to control his
    weight. Some Buddhists have doubt about their moral purity when they cook vegetables or
    drink water that harbours microbes. They should, of course, remove living beings that they
    can see. But, they need not have qualms about the destruction of creatures that may be
    accidentally connected with their actions. Some Jains are said to feel guilty over the
    death of insects that rush against a burning lamp. Theirs is an extreme view and cetana
    (volition) as the keystone of moral problems in the context of kammic law is borne out by
    Moggaliputtatissa thera's verdict in his reply to king Asoka.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Thera's Verdict</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When king Asoka supported the Buddhadhamma lavishly, some
    heretics joined the Buddhist sangha for material benefits. The true bhikkhus refused to
    have anything to do with the bogus monks and for seven years the uposatha service fell
    into abeyance at the Asokarama monastery in Pataliputta city. So king Asoka sent a
    minister to see to it that the bhikkhus perform the uposatha service. But the bhikkhus
    refused to comply with the king's wish. They said that the uposatha service was to be
    performed only by the assembly of true bhikkhus. If there happened to be a morally impure
    monk in the assembly, he had to be admonished and penalized for any infraction of Vinaya
    rules. The Sangha held the service only when there was reason to believe in the purity of
    every member; and they did not meet for the service together with non-bhikkhus. If they
    did so, they would be guilty of a serious offence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The minister regarded this reply as defiance of the king's
    order and put the good monks to the sword. The king's younger brother, Tissa thera,
    escaped death because the minister recognized him just in time. On hearing the news the
    king was greatly shocked and he asked Moggaliputtatissa thera whether he was kammically
    responsible for the death of the bhikkhus. The thera asked him whether he had intended to
    have the monks killed. When the king replied that he had no such intention, the thera said
    that he was free from kammic responsibility. The thera gave this verdict on the basis of
    the Buddha's saying, &quot;Cetana (volitional act) is that which I call kamma.&quot; He
    also cited Titthira jataka in which the bodhisatta, who was then a rishi, emphasized the
    primacy of cetana in the operation of the kammic law.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The story of Cakkhupala thera also shows that an Arahat
    who has no psychic power has body-weight like ordinary people. This is evident in the
    death of insects that were trampled by the thera. During the last 15 years Burma has
    produced some holy men who are reputed to be Arahats. Some women have reportedly tested
    their holiness by having flowers on their hands trodden by the holy men's feet. It is said
    that the flowers were not crushed and the hands not hurt. But an Arahat who has no psychic
    power or who does not use it cannot avoid crushing a thing if he treads directly on it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The reliable test of arahatship is to see whether or not a
    person who claims or is credited with it has craving, love of pleasure, attachment, anger,
    depression, fear, anxiety, restlessness, the tendency to speak ill of others, the habit of
    laughing loudly, irreverence to the memory of the Buddha and so forth. If he has these
    moral weaknesses, he is certainly not free from greed, anger and ignorance. If a thorough
    inquiry does not reveal any sign of these weaknesses, we may assume that he possesses the
    admirable attributes of an Arahat or at least the qualities of a holy man who is close to
    arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Pure Thought And Happiness</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as an evil thought is followed by suffering, so also
    pure thought is followed by happiness. Those who think, speak and act with pure thought
    build up good kamma sankhara. Good kammas invariably lead to happiness in the present life
    and hereafter. This was emphasized by the Buddha in the story of Matthakundali.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Matthakundali was the son of a brahmin who never gave
    alms. When he became severely ill, his father left him to his fate as he did not want to
    spend any money for his cure. He removed his dying son outside the house to prevent those
    who came to inquire after the patient from seeing his possessions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On that very day at dawn the Buddha saw the dying boy with
    his divine eye. He knew how it would benefit many people spiritually if the boy saw him
    before his death. So, while going round for the collection of food with other bhikkhus,
    the Lord passed by the brahmin's house. At the sight of the Lord, the boy was filled with
    deep devotion and shortly after the Lord's departure he died and landed in Tavatimsa
    heaven.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Reviewing his past, he saw how devotion to the Buddha had
    led him to the deva-world and he saw too, his father mourning at the cemetery. As he
    wished to teach his father a lesson, he came to the cemetery and posing as a boy who
    resembled Matthakundali, he started crying. Questioned by the old brahmin, he said that he
    needed a pair of wheels for his golden chariot and that he wanted the wheels to be made of
    the sun and the moon. The brahmin pointed out the futility of his desire but the boy said
    that the objects of his desire were visible whereas the brahmin was mourning for his dead
    son who could be seen no longer. He asked who was more foolish, he or the brahmin. This
    brought the brahmin to his senses. The deva revealed his identity and told him how
    adoration of the Buddha on his death-bed had benefited him. He urged his father to seek
    refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha and observe the five precepts.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The brahmin invited the Buddha and the bhikkhus to morning
    meal at his house. There were present believers and non-believers alike at the feast.
    After the feast, the brahmin asked the Lord whether there was anybody who had never heard
    the Dhamma, never offered food to the bhikkhus and never kept sabbath and yet attained the
    deva-world through his devotion to the Buddha. The Lord replied that there were many such
    people. At that moment Matthakundali deva arrived with his mansion. He told the Lord how
    his devotion on his death-bed had landed him in heaven. All the people were much impressed
    by the power of faith in the Buddha that had so immensely benefited the young man who did
    not care much for deeds before his death. Then the Buddha uttered the verse:
    &quot;Manopubbangama dhamma...&quot; that we have explained before.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Dhammapada commentary, the brahmin and
    the deva attained the first stage on the holy path after hearing the verse. It is worthy
    of note that it was just the mere thought about the Buddha that led to the young man's
    rebirth in the deva-world. He did not seem to have any hope or desire for Nibbana. His
    rebirth as a deva was indeed devoid of intelligence but hearing a verse made him a
    sotapanna. These two verses from Dhammapada echo the Paticcasamuppada teaching that
    vinnana is conditioned by sankhara. For the verses say that happiness or misery arises
    from kamma sankhara, and in fact sukha or dukkha occurs together with vinnana. Again,
    vinnana implies the associated mental factors and its physical basis viz., rupa. Hence,
    the teaching that vinnana conditions nama-rupa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Nama-Rupa and Salayatana</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nama-rupa conditions salayatana. This is very profound and
    hard to understand. Here nama-rupa means the three cetasika khandhas while rupa refers to
    the four primary elements, the six physical rupas, jivita (life), rupa and nutriment
    (ahara-rupa).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nama-rupa leads to salayatana or five physical
    sense-organs, viz., eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and consciousness. These ayatanas are the
    doors (avara) that lead to vithi process. In the immaterial world every citta-unit
    throughout the whole life is born of associated cetasika, but for ordinary persons this
    will remain bookish knowledge as it is to be understood only by Ariyas in the immaterial
    world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Further, in any existence like human life that has both
    nama and rupa, every vipaka-citta that arises from the time of conception is also due to
    associated cetasika. Vipaka-citta means the kind of citta that barely sees, barely hears,
    etc., the pleasant or unpleasant objects. Here, the seeing citta cannot arise by itself
    for it pre-supposes manasikara that considers the visual object, phassa that contacts the
    object and cetana that strives to see it. The seeing citta can arise only when these
    concomitant cetasikas arise, collectively at the same time. This is conascence condition
    called sahajata accaya in Pali. Thus, a load that can be raised only by four men working
    together will not move up if the team leader tries to move it alone. Likewise, although
    vinnana is the mainspring of mental life it counts for little by itself. It can function
    only together with other mental factors.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, these associate cetasikas contribute to the five
    physical ayatanas, viz., eye, ear, etc., by conascence at the moment of rebirth. Of course
    at the time of conception there is only kaya or rupa. But in other kinds of rebirth that
    do not involve the mother's womb, there may be all the five ayatanas at the beginning. The
    conditioning of the ayatanas by vinnana and cetasikas at the moment of conception is hard
    to understand but we have to accept on the authority of the Buddha. At other times, vipaka
    as well as the non-vipaka cittas help to maintain the ayatanas. This is understandable
    since it is impossible for matter to exist without mind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Rupa And Ayatana</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The rebirth consciousness arises on the basis of the heart
    (hadaya-vatthu). The mind ayatana has its basis in the eye, ear, etc. Thought and
    consciousness too have heart as their physical basis. All the secondary physical phenomena
    such as the eye, visual object, etc., depend on the four primary elements, viz., pathavi,
    apo (solidity, motion), etc. The five pasada-rupa, i.e. eye, ear, etc., are rooted in the
    primary elements and their kamma-based rupas in jivita (life-force) rupa. The five
    ayatana-rupas too depend on nutriment (ahara-rupa).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To sum up, citta-vinnana is conditioned by at least three
    mental factors, viz., manasikara, phassa and cetana. Sometimes there arise repeatedly
    greed, craving, anger, illusion, pride, doubt, restlessness, worry, envy, ill-will,
    anxiety, fear and so forth. All these mental states arise because of unwholesome
    cetasikas. Similarly, there often occur faith, piety, moral sense, non-attachment,
    compassion, sympathetic joy (mudita), appreciation of the law of kamma, reflection on
    anicca, dukkha, anatta, and so forth. These mental states arise from wholesome cetasikas.
    Thus, the yogi realizes the dependence of vinnana on wholesome or unwholesome cetasikas,
    the eye-consciousness on the eye. So it is clear that the manayatana is dependent on
    nama-rupa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mind is also vital to the existence of living matter.
    So the five ayatanas that produce sense-organs are dependent on the mind. The sensitive
    sense-organs (pasada) cannot exist without their gross physical bases just as the
    reflecting mirror cannot exist without the gross matter of glass. So the eye presupposes
    the gross matter of solidity (pathavi), cohesion (apo), heat (tejo) and tenseness (vayo);
    in short, the ability to see depends on the gross physical body of the eye. The same may
    be said of the ability to hear, the ability to smell, etc. Further, we can maintain life
    uninterrupted only because of life-force (jivita-rupa) and nutriment. All these facts show
    how the five ayatana-rupas originate with nama-rupa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sixth ayatana viz., manayatana comprising thought,
    reflection, intention, etc., depends on wholesome or unwholesome mental states such as
    greed, faith and mental factors such as phassa (contact) as well as on its physical bases.
    It arises from its root viz., bhavanga which in turn forms the basis for the mind-process
    (manodvara-vithi).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To recapitulate: Seeing involves sensitive eye-organ and
    consciousness. The eye-organ depends on consciousness, life-force, nutriment and physical
    base. The eye-consciousness depends on the eye-organ and the three mental factors of
    reflection, striving and contact. In short, the eye as well as the eye-consciousness
    depend on nama-rupa and the same may be said of other five ayatanas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A thorough knowledge of the origin of the six ayatanas on
    the basis of nama-rupa is possible only for bodhisattas. Among the Buddha's disciples,
    even Sariputta and Moggallana did not seem to understand it comprehensively before they
    attained sotapanna. For, it is said that the ascetic Upatissa who was later to become
    Sariputta thera attained the first stage on the holy path on hearing the verse uttered by
    Assaji thera.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The verse, ascribed to the Buddha, says that all phenomena
    (dhammas) are the effects of certain other phenomena which are the causes. The Buddha
    points out these causes and there is the cessation of the effects together with the
    causes. Upatissa and his friend Kolita are said to have attained sotapanna after hearing
    this verse, but they could not have reflected deeply on the dependent origination in such
    a short space of time. One may fairly understand the Buddha's teaching on the doctrine
    according to one's intellectual capacity but, it is impossible to grasp all of it fully.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The commentary explains the verse in the context of the
    four noble truths, &quot;All the dhammas is the effect&quot; refers to the truth of
    suffering as having its origin in craving. The cause in the gatha means craving as the
    cause of dukkha. So the gatha epitomises the truth about suffering and its cause.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In those days there were many views about the soul (atta)
    viz., that the soul was immortal and passed onto another abode after death, that it was
    annihilated after the final dissolution of the body, that it was created by God, that it
    was infinite and so forth. The gatha recognizes only the existence of the cause and effect
    and denied the immortality or annihilation of the soul and this teaching afforded the two
    ascetics a special insight into the nature of life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visuddhimagga Mahatika identifies this gatha with the
    teaching on Paticcasamuppada. It refers to a sutta in Samyuttanikaya which says, &quot;If
    this cause arises, then that effect follows. If this cause ceases, then that effect is
    also ended. So avijja causes sankhara, etc., so there is suffering. With the cessation of
    avijja there follows the cessation of sankhara and so on until suffering becomes
    extinct.&quot; According to the Mahatika, the substance of this teaching is implicit in
    the aforementioned gatha, in regard to both the arising (anuloma) and cessation (patiloma)
    of dukkha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mahayana pitaka describes this gatha as a sutta that sums
    up the doctrine of Paticcasamuppada. Any writing of the gatha is said to be beneficial if
    it is enshrined in a cetiya (pagoda). No wonder that many of these writings are found in
    very ancient pagodas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Both views in the commentary and Mahatika are plausible.
    For the first two noble truths imply Paticcasamuppada in respect of the arising of dukkha
    and its cause while the other two noble truths imply the doctrine in respect of the
    cessation of dukkha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To sum up the causes and effects in the chain of
    causation: In the past life of a person, ignorance leads to acts, speech and thoughts and
    these sankharas give rise to vinnana. Then there are five effects in the present life,
    viz., vinnana, nama-rupa, ayatana, phassa and vedana These effects in turn become causes
    or in other words, they sow the seeds for future life, viz., craving, clinging and
    becoming (tanha, upadana and jati). As a result there are old age, death, grief and
    suffering in store for the future life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Paticcasamuppada is profound and this is borne out by the
    Buddha's saying to Ananda. Ananda reflected on the doctrine from the beginning to the end
    and vice versa. To him it was very clear and it presented no difficulty. He approached the
    Buddha and said, &quot;Lord, this Paticcasamuppada is indeed very profound. But, for me it
    seems so easy to understand.&quot; The Buddha chided him, saying, &quot;You should not say
    like that, Ananda.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the commentary, the Buddha's words imply a
    compliment as well as a reproach to Ananda. The Buddha meant to say in effect,
    &quot;Ananda, you are highly intelligent and so it is easy for you to understand the
    doctrine, but do not think that it may be equally easy for other people to understand
    it.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda's ability to understand the doctrine was due to
    four factors, viz., the parami (perfections) which he had acquired in his previous lives,
    the instructions of his teachers, his wide knowledge and his attainment of the first stage
    on the holy path.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Long, long ago, Ananda was prince Sumana, the brother of
    Padumuttara Buddha. As a provincial governor, he subdued an uprising successfully. The
    king was much pleased and told him to ask for any boon he desired. The prince asked for
    permission to serve the Buddha for three months during the lent. The king did not wish to
    grant this boon and so he said evasively that it was indeed hard to know the Buddha's
    mind, that he could do nothing if the Lord was reluctant to go to the prince's abode.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the advice of the bhikkhus, the prince requested a
    thera named Sumana to arrange for an interview with the Buddha. When he met the Buddha, he
    told the Lord how Sumana thera had done a thing that was beyond the power of other
    bhikkhus. He asked what kind of good deeds a man should do to be so intimate with the
    Lord. The Buddha said that he could become like Sumana by practising dana and sila. The
    prince requested the Lord to spend the lent in his city as he wished to do good deeds so
    that he might become a specially privileged thera like Sumana in the holy order of a
    future Buddha. Seeing that his visit there might benefit all and sundry, the Buddha said,
    &quot;Sumana, the Buddha loves solitude,&quot; a saying that meant tacit acceptance of the
    invitation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The prince then ordered over one hundred monasteries to be
    built along the route where the Buddha and the Sangha might rest comfortably at night. He
    bought a park and turned it into a magnificent monastery as well as other dwellings for
    the Buddha and numerous monks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then when all was ready, he sent word to his father and
    invited the Buddha to come to his city. The prince and his people welcomed the Buddha and
    his followers, and honouring them with flowers and scents, led them to the monastery.
    There the prince formally donated the monastery and the park to the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After performing this act of dana the prince summoned his
    wives and ministers and said, &quot;The Buddha has come here out of compassion for us. The
    Buddhas do not care for material welfare. They care only for the practice of the Dhamma. I
    wish to honour the Buddha with practice so that he may be well pleased. I will observe the
    ten precepts and stay at the residence of the Buddha. You must feed and serve all the
    Arahats every day during the rains-retreat as I have done today.&quot;</font></p>
