    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Buddha's Emphasis On Practice</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Incidentally there is a story illustrative of the
    importance the Buddha attached to the practice of the Dhamma. One day, the Buddha came out
    of the Jetavana monastery with the bhikkhus to go on tour. King Kosala, the merchant
    Anathapindika and other lay disciples requested the Buddha not to go on tour, but it was
    in vain. The merchant was unhappy because he would not be able to hear the Buddha's
    teaching or to make offerings to the Lord and the bhikkhus. His slave girl, Punna by name,
    said that she would ask the Buddha to come back. The merchant promised to free her from
    bondage if she could make the Buddha return to the monastery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Punna followed the Buddha quickly and implored the
    Lord to come back. The Buddha asked her what she could do for him. She replied that she
    had nothing to offer, but that she would take refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
    Sangha and observe the five precepts if the Lord spent the lent in Savatthi city. Saying,
    &quot;Sadhu - well said&quot;, the Buddha blessed her and returned to Jetavana monastery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The news spread and the merchant set Punna free and
    adopted her as his daughter. She was now free to do what she liked, free to shape her own
    destiny. For this reason and by virtue of her parami (kammic potential) in her previous
    lives, she joined the holy order. She practised vipassana and when she developed insight
    into the impermanence of nama-rupa, the Buddha exhorted her thus: &quot;My daughter, just
    as the moon is full and complete on the fifteenth day, so also you should practise
    vipassana to the end. When your vipassana insight is complete, you will attain the end of
    suffering.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After hearing this exhortation, Punna theri attained the
    last stage on the holy path and became an Arahat. The Buddha had of course foreseen
    Punna's destiny and it was his concern for her spiritual welfare that prompted him to
    cancel the projected tour and turn back in response to her appeal. This is an example of
    the high regard for the practice of dhamma that Gotama Buddha had in common with other
    Buddhas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the prince observed the ten precepts and dwelt at the
    residence of the Buddha. He spent his time near Sumana thera, the special attendant and
    watched him serve the needs of the Buddha in a very intimate manner. Shortly before the
    end of the lent, he returned home, donated lavishly to the Sangha and, in his prayer to
    the Buddha, he affirmed his desire to become an intimate attendant of a future Buddha. The
    Buddha blessed him and the prince developed paramis tor innumerable lifetimes. The jatakas
    refer to many lives which he devoted to perfecting himself in collaboration with
    bodhisatta Gotama. Sometimes the bodhisatta was king and he was the king's minister or the
    bodhisatta was a human being and he happened to be a deva or Sakka. But their positions
    were often reversed. In some jatakas they were brothers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus they developed paramis close together through their
    long samsaric journey and in his last existence Ananda was the nephew of king Suddhodana.
    After spending the first lent near Benares, the Buddha went to Rajagaha and from there he
    proceeded to Kapilavatthu at the invitation of his father. When he left his native place,
    Ananda and some Sakyan princes followed the Buddha and joined the holy order.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The parami (perfections) which Ananda had acquired through
    many lifetimes made it possible for him to understand easily Paticcasamuppada that has
    baffled so many people. Moreover, Ananda had received instructions from teachers. He had
    not only lived with his teachers but also learned and inquired about the meanings of the
    doctrine and memorized them. This kind of learning helped him to understand
    Paticcasamuppada. In fact, he attained the first stage of the holy path after having heard
    the sermon of the noted preacher, Punna thera. Ananda paid a high tribute to Punna for his
    illuminating discourse. The substance of the discourse is as follows.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Self-conceit arises from attachment to the body,
    feeling, memory, kamma-formations (sankhara) and consciousness. It cannot arise without
    the five khandhas any more than the reflection of a man's face can appear in the absence
    of a mirror. The body, feeling, etc., are not permanent. Since they are not permanent, you
    should contemplate and realize that none of the five khandhas, whether in the past,
    present or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, good or bad, distant or near is
    yours, is you or is your ego.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The well-informed disciple of the Buddha who thus
    contemplates and realizes truth is disillusioned with the five khandhas. He becomes
    detached and free. He knows that his mind is free, that he has done what is to be done,
    that he has nothing else to do for his freedom.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This was what Punna preached to Ananda. As sotapanna,
    Ananda realized the cause-and-effect relationships of Paticcasamuppada. He had this
    insight when he practised vipassana. He knew that illusion, attachment, obsession, effort,
    rebirth, consciousness, etc., form the links in the chain of causation. Here, illusion or
    ignorance is avijja, attachment is tanha, obsession is upadana, effort is kamma. So when
    it is said that kamma leads to rebirth, we should understand that rebirth is also
    conditioned by upadana, etc. So the past involves avijja, tanha, upadana and kamma as
    causes. The yogi who realizes this through contemplation of nama-rupa is free from all
    doubts which we cannot remove merely through learning and reflection.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the best-informed disciple of the Buddha, Ananda also
    gained recognition of the Teacher in matters of knowledge. He usually accompanied the
    Buddha on preaching tour and memorized all the discourses. He could repeat a discourse
    verbatim after he had once heard it. As for the Buddha's talks given in his absence, he
    learnt from others and memorized them. The dhammas which he had thus learnt by heart are
    said to number eighty four thousand.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda was well-known for his retentive memory and the
    commentary on Mahavedalla sutta says that he could memorize hundreds of gathas in a short
    space of time. What with his wide knowledge of the teachings of the Buddha and his chief
    disciples, it is no wonder that the doctrine of Paticcasamuppada did not present much
    difficulty to him. Even today, given a thorough knowledge of the Pitaka, a man may
    understand the cause-and-effect relationship in the doctrine.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Abstruseness Of The Doctrine</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nevertheless, the doctrine is abstruse in terms of
    effects, causes, teaching, and empirical knowledge (pativedha).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the first place it is very hard to understand sankhara,
    etc., as the results of avijja and other causes for most people mistake the suffering of
    nama-rupa for happiness. This is avijja and they do not know it as an illusion. They
    believe that it is their ego-entities that think, they do not know sankhara (effort) as an
    effect of avijja, but they think it is they themselves who make the effort. So it is hard
    to see good or bad deeds (kamma) as the effects of ignorance. More difficult to understand
    is the causal relation between this sankhara of the previous life and the rebirth
    consciousness of the present existence. Likewise, it is hard to understand that nama-rupa,
    salayatana, etc., are conditioned by vinnana, etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Equally incomprehensible are the causes involved in
    dependent origination for people believe that they shape their own destiny. Some say that
    they are created by God or Brahma while some insist that everything happens by chance.
    Most of them do not see avijja, etc., as the mainspring of their existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again, some teachings of the Buddha on the doctrine begin
    with avijja and end with death. Some are set forth in reverse order. Some begin with the
    middle links in the chain and proceed to the beginning or to the end. These various
    versions of the doctrine add to the difficulty of understanding it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to gain an insight into the doctrine, one has to
    practise vipassana and realize the facts of causal relationship empirically. This
    vipassana approach to the study of Paticcasamuppada is by no means easy for the method
    must be right and one will have to practise it steadily and thoroughly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In spite of these difficulties, the doctrine seemed clear
    to Ananda because of his unusual qualifications, So the Buddha's words &quot;Do not say
    like this, Ananda&quot; may be an implicit compliment to him, but according to the
    commentary, the Buddha's saying may be an indirect reproach to him. It may mean in effect,
    &quot;Ananda, you say that Paticcasamuppada is easy to understand. Then why did you become
    a sotapanna only after hearing my teaching? Why have you not attained any stage higher
    than the first stage on the path? You should think of your shortcomings. You are my
    disciple with average, limited intelligence and what you say does not agree with my words.
    It is a saying that should not have been uttered by a close disciple like you. I have had
    to develop intelligence for aeons to know this doctrine and so you should not speak
    lightly of it.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, after chiding Ananda implicity by a few words, the
    Buddha stressed the profundity of Paticcasamuppada. &quot;Profound, Ananda, is this
    dependent origination and profound does it appear. It is through not understanding and not
    penetrating this law that this world of living beings resemble a tangled ball of thread, a
    bird's thicket of sedge or reed, and that man does not escape from the lower states of
    existence, from the course of suffering, from the round of rebirths.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In other words, this law concerning the conditioning of
    vinnana, nama-rupa, etc., by avijja, sankhara, etc., is very profound. So people do not
    know that there are only cause-and-effect relationships and that there is no permanent
    being. They believe that a living being exists in a permanent form from the time of
    inception; that there is a permanent entity behind the being that develops and grows up.
    Some hold that this core or soul of the being has many previous lives. All these illusions
    are due to ignorance of the reality underlying the dependent origination.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A living being's acts, words and thoughts are clearly due
    to ignorance of the four noble truths and dependent origination. Undeniably, good acts
    bear good fruits, bad acts bear bad fruits and everyone fares according to his deeds. So
    ignorance leads to kammas or sankharas which in turn give rise to rebirth, consciousness,
    etc. This fact is clear to an intelligent person.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of their inability to understand dependent
    origination, living beings remain mired in the round of rebirths, wandering ceaselessly
    from one existence to another. By and large, they land in the lower worlds and pass on to
    the deva-realms only occasionally by virtue of their good kamma. When the good kammic
    effects run out, they revert to the lower worlds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is hard for the denizens of the lower worlds to pass on
    to the human or deva worlds for attainment of the higher planes of existence is possible
    only when a dying person has memories or visions of his good deeds and a good act is
    simply unthinkable among the lower forms of life. Animals kill one another and the law of
    the jungle prevails in their world, leaving no room for love, pity and other spiritual
    values. They usually die stricken with pain and fear. So a lower being is very likely to
    be reborn in the lower worlds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of the ignorance of dependent origination a living
    being is unable to free himself from the round of rebirth. He is like an ox yoked to the
    mortar. No matter how long it goes round and round, the animal cannot leave the strictly
    limited area of its mobility. Likewise, the ignorant person is mired in the life-cycle
    (samsara) which largely means confinement in the nether worlds and for aeons he remains
    subject to rebirth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Understanding of Paticcasamuppada is as vital to spiritual
    liberation as the understanding of the four noble truths. In fact, the four noble truths
    are synonymous with the dependent origination. The object of vipassana practice is to gain
    insight both intellectually and empirically into these teachings, but these teachings are
    deep and hard to understand. Even in vipassana practice it is not easy to have clear ideas
    about avijja, sankhara, etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha reflected on Paticcasamuppada before and
    shortly after his attainment of supreme enlightenment. For seven days the Buddha was
    absorbed in the peace of liberation (vimuttisukha) and on the seventh day at night, he
    contemplated Paticcasamuppada in terms of conditioning (paccaya) or cause-and-effect
    relationship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having dealt with the first links in the chain of causal
    sequence, we will now proceed to phassa that is conditioned by salayatana. Salayatana
    means the six sense-organs and the six sense-objects, viz., visual form, sound, smell,
    taste, tactile object and mind-object. The contact between a sense organ and the
    corresponding sense-object is called phassa. It is an intangible phenomenon of mental life
    but it shows itself clearly when the object has an unmistakable impact on the mind. For
    example, we are shocked when we see someone being ill-treated. It makes us tremble when we
    see a man whose life is hanging by a thread on the top of a tree. Seeing a ghost will send
    the shivers, down the spine. Hearing or reading an interesting story often leaves some
    impressions that may remain indelible for a long time. All these show what it means when
    there is phassa or the impact of a sense-object on the mind of a person.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The impact is occasionally very violent and gives rise to
    violent emotions and outbursts of passion, anger, etc. According to the commentary on
    Anguttara Nikaya, in the time of the ancient Sinhalese King Dutthagamani, a young monk
    happened to see a girl. The girl looked at him too and both of them were so much consumed
    with a burning desire that they died. Again an elderly monk became insane after looking
    unmindfully at the queen of King Mahanaga.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Mudulakkhana jataka, the bodhisatta was a rishi
    (recluse) who went to the king's palace to have his meal. He went there by air as he had
    psychic powers. When the rishi appeared suddenly, the queen rose to her feet in a hurry
    and her garment slipped. The queen's seductive pose instantly aroused the long-dormant
    sexual desire of the rishi. He could not eat any food. His psychic powers having vanished,
    he walked back to his abode and there he lay, afflicted with the fires of lust and
    passion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On learning what had happened, the king offered the queen
    to the rishi as he was confident of the holy man's ability to recover his higher self
    eventually. He secretly instructed the queen to do her best for the welfare of the rishi.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Taking the queen, the rishi left the king's palace. Once
    outside the gate the queen told him to go back and ask the king for a house. He was
    offered an old house but there he had to fetch a hatchet and a basket for the disposal of
    excreta and filth. Again and again, he had to go and ask the king for other things that he
    needed. Going to and fro and doing all household chores at the bidding of the queen, the
    rishi was dead tired but he did not come to his senses as he was still dominated by lust
    and passion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After having done everything that he was told to do, he
    sat down near the queen to take a rest. Then she pulled his moustache with a jerk and
    said, &quot;Are you not aware of your being a samana (ascetic) whose object is to do away
    with passions and desires? Are you so much out of your senses?&quot; This awakened the
    rishi to a sense of his blind folly and ignorance. After handing back the queen to the
    king, he went to the Himalayan forest, practised vipassana and recovered his psychic
    power. On his death he attained the Brahma world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The moral is that even a person of spiritual calibre like
    a bodhisatta could not escape the fires of defilements. The rishi might have casually seen
    the queen before but the impact was not violent enough to jolt his emotional life. It was
    the clear, vivid impressions of the queen's physical appearance that harassed and engulfed
    him with the fires of lust and passion for many days.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Ummadanti jataka, King Sivi became almost crazy after
    seeing Ummadanti, the wife of his commander-in-chief. The woman was so famous for her
    beauty that the king sent his brahmin advisers to see whether she had the qualities of a
    noble lady. But at the sight of the woman they were so much bewitched by her beauty that
    they lost self-control and made a mess of the feast given by their host. Disgusted by
    their disorderly behaviour, Ummadanti had them hustled out of the house. Thereupon, the
    disgruntled brahmins reported to the king that she was not qualified to be a queen. The
    king lost interest in her and she became the wife of the supreme commander. She was,
    however, determined to make things even with the king and so when he went round the city
    during a festival she showed her beauty and charms to the best of her ability.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king was half beside himself with infatuation for the
    woman. Unable to sleep, he raved about her and gave vent to his blind passion in a gatha
    which says that if he were granted a boon by the king of devas, he would ask for an
    opportunity to sleep one or two nights with Ummadanti. The impact of a sense-object
    depends largely on the nature of the impression conveyed by the object. If the impression
    is vague and dim, it produces only mild feeling and craving, but much vedana, tanha, etc.,
    follow in the wake of clear and vivid impressions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The impact may also lead to outburst of temper. We show
    anger at the sight of an offensive object, and we fear a frightful object. Unpleasant
    words are irritating to us. Pride wells up in us when we think of something that boosts
    our ego. We hold wrong views when we toy with the idea of soul or with a teaching that
    makes a farce of kamma and its fruit. Objects of envy make us envious, and objects which
    we wish to possess exclusively make us miserly. These are instances of phassa that fuel
    unwholesome kammas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wholesome kammas too arise from phassa. Objects of
    devotion arouse faith, those whom we should forgive or tolerate help to foster
    forbearance, and contemplation of the Buddha and the Arahats make us mindful, kindly and
    so forth. So Patisambhidamagga says: &quot;Conditioned by phassa, there arise fifty
    cetasikas (mental factors).&quot; It attributes feeling, perception and kamma-formations
    to phassa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We see because of phassa and this phassa occurs because of
    the eye, the visual object and the visual consciousness. The Buddha's teaching makes a
    distinction between the visual consciousness and the visual object. Ordinary people tend
    to confuse the former with the latter, but the Buddha stated clearly that visual
    consciousness arises from the eye and the visual object, and that phassa means the
    conjunction of the eye, the visual object and the visual consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the impact of seeing for which the three ayatanas,
    viz., the eye, etc., form the three necessary and sufficient conditions. The nature of
    impact is realized empirically by the yogi who practises mindfulness. The yogi notes,
    &quot;seeing, seeing&quot; at every moment of seeing and as concentration develops, he
    comes to realize that seeing is not uncaused, that it is not made or created by a person;
    that it is a psycho-physical phenomenon, having the eye and the visual object as its cause
    and the visual consciousness as its effect.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The impact on the sense-organ leads to feelings that may
    be pleasant, unpleasant or indifferent according to the nature of the sense-object. If the
    object is beautiful, there arises pleasant feeling; if it is ugly, we have unpleasant
    feeling. If the object is neither ugly nor lovely, the feeling is indifferent. This
    feeling (upekkha vedana) does not give rise to any comment, whether favourable or
    unfavourable; indeed it is not even recognized as a feeling but it is accepted by the ego.
    In fact, these three kinds of feelings have nothing to do with the ego or self but are
    aspects of the mental process stemming from sense-contact.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To understand Paticcasamuppada means to be free from
    scepticism and illusion. Since this freedom is the essential attribute of the yogi at the
    first stage on the holy path, it is important to understand the doctrine. Ignorance of it
    tends to cause doubts about the Buddha, the Dhamma and so forth. There are eight kinds of
    doubts.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) Doubt about the Buddha. This leads the sceptic to
    raise questions such as &quot;Was the Buddha really a being who was free from all
    defilements? Or was he an ordinary man who commanded the blind faith of his
    followers?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) Doubt about the Teaching. &quot;Are there the Path and
    Nibbana that really ensure the extinction of craving, hatred and ignorance?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) Doubt about the Sangha. &quot;Are there Ariyas, the
    Noble ones who are really free from defilements? Sotapannas who, having overcome illusion
    and doubt, will never be reborn in the lower worlds? Sakadagamis, who do not have much
    sensual desire and anger? Anagamis, who are wholly free from sensual desire and anger? Or
    the Arahats who have freed themselves from all defilements?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(4) Doubt about the practice. &quot;Is the practice of
    morality or contemplation beneficial and helpful to the higher spiritual progress?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(5) Doubt about the past. &quot;Did I exist in the past?
    Why and how did I exist in the past? What kind of person was I in my previous life? Did I
    originate with the moss or did I come into being spontaneously?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(6) Doubt about the future. &quot;Will I exist after my
    death? What kind of person will I become in my next life?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(7) Doubt about both the past and the future. According to
    the sub-commentaries, this doubt refers to the present life that is between the past and
    the future of a man's life-cycle. This interpretation agrees with the Pali text of Sutta
    pitaka which says: &quot;Now there arises doubt as regards one's self in the
    present.&quot; Such doubt may raise questions such as, &quot;Am I really myself? Does the
    ego exist or does it not exist? If the ego exists, what kind of being is it? Is it big or
    small? Why or how does the ego exist? Was it created or did it come into being
    spontaneously? From where did the ego come and where will it go after the final
    dissolution of the body?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These questions show that there are five doubts about the
    past, five doubts about the future and six doubts about the present. The yogi overcomes
    all these doubts when he is free from all illusions about the self or ego
    (kankhavitarana-visuddhi).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(8) The last subject that raises much doubt is the
    doctrine of Paticcasamuppada that emphasizes the primacy of cause-and-effect relationship
    in the world of living beings. Is effort really due to ignorance of the true dhamma? Is
    rebirth really conditioned by kamma? Is it a fact that bad kamma is harmful and good kamma
    beneficial to a future life? Is there really a cause for every phenomenon? Is everything
    the outcome of the combination of atoms and electrons by chance? These doubts centre on
    causal links, e.g. avijja, sankhara, etc., and resultant links, e.g. vinnana, rebirth,
    etc., in the chain of causal sequence as enunciated in the doctrine of Paticcasamuppada.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These doubts give rise to wrong views in the long run. The
    false beliefs that conflict with the dependent origination are rooted in these doubts.
    Speculations on the nature of life that are above one's intellectual level produce doubts
    in the beginning but eventually turn the sceptic into one who clings to illusions. Such
    scepticism and false views are due to ignorance of Paticcasamuppada. One who understands
    the teaching clearly harbours no doubt, let alone illusions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the final analysis, a living being is a compound of
    causes and effects as are non-living things like the earth, the sun, tree, etc. The law of
    causation governs the universe leaving no room for creation or spontaneous occurrence.
    Modern science provides overwhelming evidence for the absolute dependence of the
    non-living material world on the interplay of cause and effect. It tends to bear out the
    truth of the Buddha's teaching about the conditionality of everything in the world,
    whether it be life, mind or matter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha laid emphasis on the conditioned nature of
    man's internal life. The teaching leaves out of account the external world of inanimate
    matter because the material world has no life-cycle and is not subject to rebirth and
    suffering. What matters most from the Buddhist point of view is the living being. If left
    to itself, the nama-rupa comprising the living being passes through innumerable lives and,
    for the most part, the individual suffers on the lower planes of existence, but if we
    understand the nama-rupa process and act wisely, we can make progress gradually on the way
    to liberation. Even if we are not yet liberated, we can achieve a better life and fare
    fairly well in the round of rebirths. A clear understanding of Paticcasamuppada is vital
    for it ensures complete extinction of defilements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have described ignorance as the cause of effort
    (sankhara) and kammic effort as the cause of rebirth. It is necessary to say something
    more about the origin of rebirth consciousness. In a sutta of Anguttara Nikaya, the Buddha
    likens the wholesome or unwholesome volitional (cetana) action (kamma) to a thriving
    field, consciousness (vinnana) to seeds, and craving (tanha) to water for irrigating the
    field. The planting of trees requires fields and nurseries. Likewise, rebirth
    consciousness presupposes arable land in the form of kamma, kamma gives rise to the
    potential for rebirth and although the former states of consciousness disappear, the
    rebirth potential remains bound up with the psyche. Like a budding plant, it does not
    materialize as yet but it is bound to become actual under favourable circumstances, just
    as a man who has committed a crime is a potential prisoner or a worker who has
    distinguished himself in a state factory is a potential winner of government reward for
    good service.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, rebirth depends on wholesome or unwholesome
    consciousness no less than does a plant depend on seeds for its germination. The good or
    bad vinnanas arise and pass away, but they touch off a ceaseless flow of similar states of
    consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These states are the outcome of former kammic vinnanas
    just like the transformation of a snake's skin. The most vital of them is the death-bed
    consciousness centering on one's kamma or objects associated with it (kammanimitta) or
    visions of future life (gatinimitta). This encounter of a dying person with signs and
    visions is called upatthanasamangita which means the foreshadowing of the future life as
    conditioned by sankhara-kamma. In a sense, it marks the transition from dying
    consciousness to rebirth consciousness somewhat similar to the development of a plant from
    a seed to a sprout.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A seed needs water to turn into a plant. Without water or
    at least moisture from the air, it will remain sterile. In the same way, although kamma
    forms the basis for a future life, there is no rebirth in the absence of craving (tanha).
    So in the case of Arahats, although there are conditions for rebirth in terms of vinnana
    and the kamma that they have done as ordinary persons, the rebirth consciousness cannot
    arise because of the extinction of craving.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tanha is inherent in non-Arahats and it is most powerful
    in common people. It makes the sense-objects pleasant, attractive and desirable. It
    creates the illusion of pleasure, happiness and hope. It likes what is good and makes
    happiness and prosperity the main object of life for mankind. Tanha motivates the kammic
    consciousness which leads to other mental states. On the approach of death, these mental
    states give rise to signs and visions. The dying person delights in pleasant visions and
    he becomes lively and cheerful. This shows that his kammic seeds are beginning to sprout.
    He does not welcome unpleasant visions, but still these visions have something to do with
    himself and this self-attachment, too, leads to the germination of the kammic seed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore in the case of common people rebirth is
    conditioned by three factors, viz., kamma (action), cittavinnana that is linked to kammic
    consciousness and tanha. Kamma as the fertile soil for rebirth is evident in death-bed
    visions and signs, the germination of the seed is shown by the dying person's interest in
    these signs and visions and one's self. So after death there arises rebirth consciousness
    as conditioned by the mental state at the last moment of the previous life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rebirth consciousness brings into play nama-rupa, ayatana,
    phassa, vedana and their interrelations that concern the whole life. So in a sense, we may
    regard it as the seed of present existence. It is inextricably bound up with nama-rupa.
    All nama-rupa, whether in or out of the body, is suffering as they are subject to constant
    arising and passing away, but ignorance makes us blind to dukkha, creates illusion and
    attachment and keeps us engaged in the pursuit of sense-objects. This preoccupation leads
    to the renewal of existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With rebirth consciousness as the basis of a new
    existence, there arise the physical body as its basis and the concomitant mental factors
    such as phassa, vedana, etc. When rebirth consciousness ceases, there follow other mental
    states in succession which may touch off good or bad kammas such as greed, anger,
    contentment, forbearance, etc. These mental states in turn lead to physical actions such
    as sitting, standing, and so forth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hence the Buddha's teaching: &quot;Cittena niyate
    loko...&quot; a Pali verse which may be freely translated as: &quot;The mind (thought,
    will, etc.) leads the world. It draws the world wherever it pleases. The whole world
    follows the mind.&quot; Here the world (//loka//) refers to the world of living beings.
    The mind leads the living beings rightfully or wrongfully. The mind of a good man who
    develops faith, morality, etc., will lead him to do good deeds. It will make him hear the
    dhamma and practise vipassana. It will land him on the higher planes of existence or bring
    him to the goal of Nibbana. On the other hand, the mind of an evil man will lead him to
    seek sensual objects and do evil deeds. After death, it takes him to the lower worlds and
    makes him subject to much suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This verse shows that all nama-rupas are dominated by the
    mind. It accords with the teaching of Paticcasamuppada that because of vinnana there arise
    psycho-physical phenomena such as phassa, etc. We have already given an account of phassa
    arising from the eye and now a few words about the phassa of hearing. As in the case of
    seeing, hearing also involves three factors, viz., the ear, the sound and the
    ear-consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hearing is impossible without the ear-organ and the sound.
    Scientists say that sound-waves travel at the rate of 1,100 feet per second. This is the
    natural speed of sound; the radio broadcast can carry it all over the world in a moment.
    When it comes into contact with the ear it is like the reflection in the mirror and the
    hearing occurs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But, it is a mistake to believe that it is the original
    owner of the ear who hears. The sensitive organs of the ear are in a ceaseless flux, the
    rupas involved are forever arising and passing away. They are like the ever-changing
    waters of a flowing stream. It is the contact of sound-waves with the stream of rupas that
    sparks the ear-consciousness. The consciousness occurs only for an instant and vanishes.
    This is followed by the citta that continues to focus on the sound, inquire it and decide.
    Each of these cittas occurs for a moment and vanishes. Then, there flash forth
    successively with much speed seven impulse-moments, after which there occur two
    thought-moments that focus on the sound.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such is then the consciousness-process involved in
    hearing. Whenever we hear a sound, the ear-vinnana is renewed on the basis of the ear and
    the sound. So the yogi who practises mindfulness realizes that hearing is conditioned by
    the ear and the sound, that there is no person or being who hears. In fact the yogi is
    more aware of the causal relation in hearing than in seeing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, hearing means the conjunction of the ear, the sound
    and the ear-consciousness. The impact of the sound is phassa and it is quite clear to the
    meditating yogi. Some are so sensitive that when they hear a harsh sound, they feel like
    being attacked by a tremendous onrush of it towards the ear. Some may even be startled by
    the dropping of a leaf. The impact is evident when out of a variety of sounds that reach
    our ears we select and attend to the sound that we wish to hear. As for loud, harsh and
    piercing sounds, we cannot avoid hearing them. We may not look at an unpleasant object,
    but the sound cannot be so ignored.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have pleasant or unpleasant feelings according to the
    pleasant or unpleasant sounds that we hear. Songs and sweet voices are welcome to the ear
    while harsh sounds and abusive words are odious to us. When we hear ordinary sounds, we
    have feelings that are neither pleasant nor unpleasant. In such cases we may not even be
    aware of our feeling, the upekkhavedana that is so subtle that it escapes our notice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">True, the Abhidhamma books deny that we have pleasant or
    unpleasant feeling when we have consciousness in connection with the eye, the ear, the
    nose or the tongue and describe it only as upekkhavedana. But for the contemplating yogi,
    it is not advisable to focus on eye-consciousness, etc. He should contemplate the whole
    process of consciousness (vithi) which involves pleasant feeling along with some
    thought-moments, e.g. santirana, javana and tadarammana and unpleasant feelings along with
    javana or impulse-moments.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, even though the eye-consciousness, etc., may be
    upekkhavedana at the moment of their arising, they will be accompanied by unpleasant
    feeling if they happen to be the effects of unwholesome kamma as is evident in our contact
    with unpleasant sense-objects that cause painful emotions such as fear. Loud noise may
    make us deaf, evil smells may cause headache while unwholesome food may do harm to our
    health. Likewise, the upekkhavedana that is conditioned by the four kinds of pleasant
    sense-objects implies pleasant feelings. We enjoy seeing beautiful objects, hearing
    pleasant sounds, etc. This shows the pleasant character of upekkhavedana because of its
    being the product of wholesome kammas. In this connection the sub-commentary on
    Visuddhimagga says:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;'The upekkhavedana which, being the full-blown
    product of low kamma, is painful and as such, it is of low character.&quot; In other
    words, the upekkhavedana that is based on unwholesome kamma may be indifferent and neutral
    but, since it stems from evil kamma, it is low just like the flower that blooms in a heap
    of excreta. Moreover, although it is not as worse as dukkhavedana, it is unbearable and so
    it is low. In fact, the kammic effect of a bad deed is never good or free from pain and
    suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, elaborating the function of vedana in the chain of
    causation, the sub-commentary says: &quot;The upekkhavedana that results from unwholesome
    kamma should be described as dukkha since it is undesirable. The upekkhavedana that has
    its origin in wholesome kamma should be described as sukha since it is desirable.&quot; It
    is evident in the pleasant feeling that we have when we hear a pleasant sound. Sweet words
    are welcome to the ear while harsh words jar on it. The nature of some feelings caused by
    ordinary sounds is not obvious and such feelings are termed upekkhavedana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The three kinds of vedana due to hearing is distinctly
    familiar to the ever-mindful yogi. He knows that the dukkha or sukhavedana arises from
    contact between the sound and the ear; that there is no soul or atta to be affected by it;
    that the vedana arises and vanishes instantly, and that everything is impermanent. As his
    concentration develops, he becomes aware of the ceaseless arising and vanishing of all the
    three kinds of vedana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Like hearing, smelling is also conditioned. The smelling
    consciousness arises from the contact between the nose and the odour. It is impossible to
    smell without the odour or the sensitive part of the nose (ghanapasada). People without
    sensitive nose are rare. Once I met a monk who said that he had practically no scent even
    when he smelled a handkerchief moistened with perfume. Even when the nose is sensitive you
    cannot have any scent if you plug it or if there is nothing to be scented. The scent is
    detected only when it is wafted in the air and comes into contact with the sensitive part
    of the nose. Ordinary people labour under the delusion that it is the person or the living
    being who smells. In fact it is the contact between the airborne scent and the rupas of
    the nose in continual flux that causes smelling consciousness. As in the case of seeing
    and hearing this ghana-vinnana is a process that involves advertence (avajjana), impulsion
    (javana), investigation and other stages. The crux of the matter is of course the smelling
    consciousness which ceaselessly arises and vanishes, depending on the nose and the smell.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We are all familiar with the offensive smell of something
    rotten or the fragrance of a flower. Common people believe that it is they who smell
    whereas the yogi knows that it is only a phenomenon arising from the conjunction of the
    nose, the odour and consciousness and he comes to realize the ceaseless influx and
    impermanence of everything. That is the difference between the yogi and the common people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vedana (feeling) may be agreeable or disagreeable
    according to the nature of impact (phassa). Scents of flowers and perfumes cause pleasant
    feelings whereas the stench of the decomposing matter is offensive to the nose. The
    ordinary smells cause neither pleasant nor unpleasant feelings and this is upekkhavedana;
    a feeling that is so subtle that we do not notice it. The yogi notes the smelling
    consciousness and becomes aware of the three kinds of feelings, and their arising and
    dissolution</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consciousness in eating (jivha-vinnana) arises from
    contact between the tongue and the food. Without the tongue or the flavour of food, there
    can be no consciousness of taste but, if the tongue is so unhealthy as to lack
    sensitivity, the food will be tasteless. Common people believe that it is a living being
    who eats and enjoys the flavour. In fact, the rupas forming the sensitive part of the
    tongue are forever in a flux and it is from the contact of these rupas and the flavour of
    food that there arises consciousness which involves the thought-moments that we have
    mentioned before. The events at this stage are so rapid that they seem to form a single
    thought moment. This consciousness (jivha-vinnana) changes at every moment, depending on
    the tongue and the flavour. It is this citta that knows sweetness, sourness, bitterness
    and so forth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The conjunction of the tongue, the flavour and
    consciousness means what in Pali is called phassa. This is familiar to everybody, but
    common people think that it is they as living beings who experience the flavour. Only the
    yogi who notes all the psycho-physical events that occur while he is eating knows it as a
    phenomenon dependent on the tongue, the flavour and consciousness. Later on, he gains a
    clear insight into its ceaseless flux and impermanence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Contact with flavour is followed by sensations (vedana)
    that may be good or bad according to the flavour. Eating good food gives us pleasure, we
    like it, whereas we complain of bad food or the bitter taste of some medicine. The feeling
    that we have when we eat some food is indifferent. Although this is upekkhavedana, the
    opportunity to eat is the outcome of good kamma. Hence, eating such food also has a
    pleasant aspect and leads to attachment, but as for the yogi with developed samadhi who
    notes the nama-rupa at every moment, he becomes empirically aware of the arising of all
    sensations (pleasant, unpleasant or indifferent) and their passing away.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another source of contact, feeling, etc., is the sensitive
    part of the body (kayadvara). It is said: &quot;Body consciousness arises from the body or
    tactile organ and the tactile object. Body-impression (phassa) arises from the conjunction
    of the body, the tactile object and tactile consciousness, and the tactile impression
    conditions the (tactile) sensations (vedana).&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This needs some elaboration. Seeing, hearing, smelling and
    eating - each of these physical events concerns only its respective organ, viz., the eyes,
    etc. Consciousness in connection with them also arises only in a certain part of the head.
    These psycho-physical events are restricted in terms of locality and duration. You are
    conscious of eating only when you are eating, conscious of hearing only when there is
    something to be heard. As for the body-consciousness, it is present in regard to every
    part of the body. You have tactile impression somewhere on your body at any time whenever
    you think of it. So its sphere is extensive and its duration is long. For the beginner in
    vipassana practice, contemplation of tactile impression is most important and so the yogi
    should know something about it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fine, sensitive matter (rupa) that can receive the
    tactile impression pervades the whole body. It exists in every healthy part of the body
    and so it can give rise to tactile consciousness everywhere through contact with an
    external or internal rupa in the body. These rupas are impermanent and are in a flux from
    moment to moment. They are like the electric energy that passes into the bulb and gives
    light.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this state of ceaseless flux the sensitive body rupa
    that has not yet passed away collides with an external or internal rupa, thereby giving
    rise to body-consciousness. As in the case of seeing, etc., this consciousness involves a
    series of thought-moments, viz., citta that inquires the tactile object, citta that knows,
    citta that registers etc., but these cittas arise and vanish so rapidly that the tactile
    consciousness appears to involve only a single thought-moment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Body-consciousness is always present. It is not apparent
    when the mind is absorbed in any object other than the body but, if the attention is
    directed to the body, there is no doubt about the tactile impression somewhere as, for
    example, the contact between the body and the floor, the body and the clothes, and so
    forth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the yogi who practises mindfulness in regard to
    physical contact of his body is aware of its conditionality. He knows that it is neither
    uncaused nor created, that it in fact depends on the conjunction of tactile object and the
    sensitive rupa in healthy condition. The object of contact is called photthappha in Pali
    and it is of three kinds, viz., pathavi, tejo and vayo.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pathavi element has the attribute of hardness and
    coarseness and this attribute is to be found if one examines or focuses on a part of the
    body that gives a clear impression of contact. Softness too is to be regarded as pathavi
    for softness and coarseness do not differ essentially. We call velvet a smooth object in
    comparison with many things that are coarser than it but it appears to be rough when it
    hits the soft part of the human eye. So softness and roughness are relative terms that
    differ only in degree, not in kind. Softness and smoothness represent solidity that is a
    mark of pathavi element.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to commentaries, solidity as the essence of
    pathavi element serves as the abode of other elements that have to depend on it just as
    all objects have to depend on earth. For example, rice-powder when mixed with water turns
    into a lump in which it may be termed pathavi because of its solidity or its predominantly
    solid character. The particles of powder are combined and held together by the water (apo)
    element. The lump also contains tejo element that is concerned with heat or cold, as well
    as the wind (vayo) element that supports stiffness and expansion. So this lump of rice
    powder contains all the four elements, and of these the element of solidity (pathavi) is
    the basis of other elements. All the other three elements are also inherent in the rice
    powder. Thus, just as rice powder is the support of water element, etc., so also the earth
    element is the support of its associated rupas. This is the function of the earth element.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, to the yogi, the earth-element appears to be the
    basis for its co-elements. This is its paccupatthana and so is of heaviness and lightness.
    In Dhammasangani, one of the books of Abhidhamma pitaka and its commentary, the pathavi
    element is described as heavy and light. So when you move a thing and feel that it is
    heavy or light, that feeling or idea is to be included in the paccupatthana of the pathavi
    element. The yogi is aware of the characteristics of pathavi element through its
    roughness, softness or smoothness. He is aware of its function when he realizes that it
    serves as the basis of other rupas. He is aware of its paccupatthana when he knows that
    other rupas lie in the pathavi element, that it bears other rupas, that it is heavy or
    light. Such awareness of pathavi element in terms of characteristics (lakkhana), function
    (rasa) and paccupatthana means realization of truth and discriminative insight into the
    nature of nama-rupa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for the common people, contact with pathavi element is
    usually understood in terms of hands, legs, clothes, man and so forth. This way of
    thinking is wrong, but the yogi knows the truth through the practice of mindfulness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tejo element means heat. It is evident when we change the
    position of the body, because we feel heated and pressed in some part of the body.
    Coldness too is a kind of weak tejo element. A thing is hot or cold relative to other
    things. The shade of a tree may be cool in comparison with the heat of the sun, but it is
    hot relative to the interior of a cave or house. The water in the pot is cool relative to
    that in the open air but hot when compared to iced water. Hot, warm and cool are relative
    terms that mean essentially tejo dhatu (element).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tejo or heat is essential to maturation and development.
    The function of heat is to make organisms mature and ripe. Old age and decay of trees,
    buildings, the earth, rocks, etc., are due to heat of the sun and it is the heat of the
    physical body that gives rise to grey hair, decaying teeth, wrinkled skin and other signs
    of senility. The greater the heat, the more rapid is the process of maturation. Tejo
    element makes the rupas soft and pliant. So as the yogi notes, &quot;hot&quot;,
    &quot;hot&quot;, he realizes its function, viz., to soften and loosen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When heat or cold is manifest in the body, the mindful
    yogi is aware of tejo element in terms of its characteristics. He knows its function
    (rasa) when he knows that it makes things soft and pliant. Thus, the yogi has
    discriminative insight into the nature of nama-rupa. He is free from the illusion that
    common people have when they think of tejo element in terms of substance and entity such
    as hand, man, woman and so forth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vayo element has the characteristics of stiffness and
    rigidity. If you sit erect and stretch your back and introspect yourself, you will find
    rigidity. Again, stretch your arm and fix your mind inside the hand. You will find
    stiffness there. So if you sit and note mentally, &quot;sitting&quot;, you become aware of
    vayo element in terms of its characteristics. You know it not as ego, as atman, etc., but
    as stiffness and this insight into the real nature of vayo is important.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But initially the yogi's insight will not be necessarily
    confined to the reality of stiffness. Ideas of substance, self, and so forth, continue to
    obtrude upon his mind. For in the beginning, the average person's concentration is weak
    and he tends to let his mind wander freely. His mind is usually dominated by sensual
    desire and other hindrances (nivarana) that conflict with tranquillity and
    insight-knowledge and impede their progress. As a result, the mind is not confined to the
    reality of elements. Some teachers would have us believe that all conventional notions go
    by the board at the outset, but this is impossible. It is indeed hard for any beginner to
    be free from hindrances and pure in mind and belief. Exceptions may be made in the case of
    those who heard the Dhamma right from the Buddha and attained the holy path, but such kind
    of attainment is unthinkable for other people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vipassana practice does not help to develop insight in the
    beginning. While contemplating nama-rupa, the yogi develops concentration strongly,
    thereby leaving almost no room for stray thoughts and keeps himself constantly mindful. It
    is only at this stage of mental purity that there arises the insight into the real nature
    of nama-rupa. Even so, conventional notions linger before the attainment of insight into
    the dissolution of all forms of existence (bhanganana). So it is said in Visuddhimagga
    that at the earlier stage of insight (udayabbayanana), the yogi tends to see &quot;the
    lights, flowers on the pagoda platform or fishes and turtles in the sea.&quot; But later
    on, both the nama-rupa objects of contemplation and the contemplating mind are found to
    pass away one after another. Conventional ideas of shape, figure, etc., do not arise any
    longer. As Visuddhimagga says, &quot;attention is fixed on cessation, disappearance and
    dissolution.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, initially the yogi knows only the object that
    he contemplates in the right way. Rigidity (vayo) is evident at the moment of lifting the
    foot, etc. To make us aware of this, the Buddha says, &quot;When he (the yogi) walks, he
    knows that he is walking.&quot; Here, the yogi is instructed to be aware only of the fact
    that he is walking; he is not told to reflect on the vayo or rigidity. This means that
    names are not relevant, that what matters most is to see things as they really are, that
    the yogi can note them in terms of popular usage. Again, vayo element is manifest in the
    movement of any part of the body. Awareness of rigidity in such movement or in the
    abdominal rising and falling means awareness of the real marks of vayo element. Looseness
    too is a mark of vayo for we speak comparatively when we refer to tightness or looseness
    of anything.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is also the function of vayo element to move, incline,
    tilt or displace. The yogi notes the motion of his hands when he bends them and becomes
    aware of the true nature of vayo element. He knows it also when he focuses on walking,
    etc. At such moments, he does not think of the object as man, woman, body and so forth. He
    is aware only of the gradual movement which means the real nature of vayo element. He is
    also aware of something pushing or leading another from one place to the other. Thus, he
    knows vayo by means of the phenomenon that appears on his mental horizon. This is
    awareness by paccupatthana which the scriptures describe as &quot;Abhinihara
    paccupatthana&quot; - the phenomena which appears as leading.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the three primary elements - pathavi, tejo and vayo
    are to be known only by experience. You cannot know them by hearing, etc. You can hear the
    sound of something, but you cannot say whether it is coarse or soft, hot or cold, rigid,
    stable or moving. Neither will its smell, taste or visual form tell you anything about its
    primary quality. Yet, it is a popular belief that we can identify the primary elements by
    seeing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">No doubt a rock or a block of iron apparently gives us the
    impression of hardness, but this is not due to seeing. It is merely an inductive
    generalization based on past experience. What we know by seeing is only the visual form
    which sometimes gives a false impression as is evident when we tread on what we believe to
    be solid ground and stumble into a quagmire, or when we get burnt by handling a heated
    iron bar unknowingly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nor can we know vayo element by seeing for it is an
    element that we can know only empirically. We see that an object is moving because we see
    it here and there, and the idea of its motion is only an inference from our observation of
    its displacements. Yet, when one of the two trains at rest starts moving, the other train
    appears to be in motion and to a traveller in a fast moving train, the trees appear to be
    running in the opposite direction. These optical illusions bear out the fact that we
    cannot rely on our eyes for the truth about motion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, an elderly layman who was interested in meditation
    told us about his dialogue with a monk-teacher. Taking a pillow and shaking it, he asked
    the monk, &quot;Now, Sir, what dhammas do you see passing away?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, I see the vayo element passing away.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sir, you are wrong. What you see with your eyes is
    only the visual form. If you are mindful at the moment of seeing, you know only what
    happens to the visual form. You cannot know empirically anything about vayo element at the
    moment of seeing. Vipassana is a practice that gives priority to what is to be known
    actually by introspection. It is only afterwards that other facts are to be noted and
    realized by reasoning. It is natural to contemplate each sense-object only through its
    respective sense-organ. Vayo is an object that is known only through body-contact. We can
    know the motion of vayo if we introspect while walking, bending, etc. Now without being in
    contact with vayo, you say that you know its dissolution. What you say is unnatural and
    wrong.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is much truth in my informant's criticism. Instead
    of relying on Satipatthana and other suttas for information, some teachers give purely
    speculative instructions on the basis of Abhidhamma books that deal with natural phenomena
    exclusively. There are yogis who practise according to these instructions. The practice
    may benefit them spiritually but they cannot rely on it for the attainment of real insight
    and stages on the holy path. The only exceptions are a few gifted yogis who gain insights
    through speculative introspection.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The best thing to do is to follow the Buddha's instruction
    in Satipatthana sutta and contemplate the psycho-physical phenomena that arise from the
    six senses. This is, as the Buddha says, //eka yano maggo//: &quot;the only way&quot;. In
    the case of body-sense corresponding to body-consciousness we should note and recognize
    the body-impression when we are aware of any body-contact internally or externally.
    Otherwise the impression tends to dominate us in conjunction with avijja and other
    defilements. We tend to harbour illusions of permanence, happiness and ego-belief. Thus,
    through contact, we become attached to certain parts of the body, we consider them
    permanent and make distinctions according to our preferences. If we note every contact and
    realize their sensory, impermanent, unsatisfactory and insubstantial nature, there is no
    attachment and we are on the right path of vipassana that will certainly lead to
    enlightenment and Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Body-sensitivity (kayapasada) is a quality that pervades
    the whole body when it is in a healthy condition. There are many things such as clothes,
    air and others that can give the body tactile impressions. The body, too, possesses many
    things, e.g. hair, skin, that lend themselves to contact. Thus, there are always both
    external and internal objects of contact for the body-sensitivity. Reflection will point
    clearly to the possibility of contact in every part of the body and there is no place,
    however small, that does not admit of contact, and this contact gives rise to
    body-consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the conjunction of the body-sensitivity, object of
    contact and body-consciousness, there arises impression (phassa) that is very obvious.
    Pleasant impression of contact gives rise to pleasant feeling while unpleasant impression
    results in painful feeling. The deeper the impression the more intense is the feeling.</font></p>
