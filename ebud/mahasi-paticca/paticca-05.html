    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Clinging Leads To Becoming</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Upadana leads to bhava (becoming). There are two kinds of
    bhava, viz., kammabhava and upapattibhava.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">(1) Kammabhava</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kammabhava means the kamma that leads to rebirth. The
    Buddha describes it as the punnabhi, apunnabhi and anenjabhi sankharas that lead to lower
    sensual world or the higher material and immaterial worlds. He also identifies kammabhava
    with all kammas that give rise to new existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the three sankharas, punnabhi sankhara comprises the
    eight wholesome volitions (cetana) in sensual sphere and five wholesome volitions in the
    material (rupa) sphere. Apunnabhi sankhara is the group of twelve unwholesome volitions.
    Anenjabhi sankhara means the four wholesome volitions in immaterial sphere. Also leading
    to rebirth are the kammas that arise together with the wholesome volitions in sensual
    sphere, viz., having no covetous thoughts or designs about another's possessions, having
    no design against another person's life and holding right views. These kammas are implicit
    in punnabhi sankhara. In short, kammabhava is the good or bad volition that leads to
    rebirth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(<strong>2) Upapattibhava</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Upapattibhava is of nine kinds. (1) kammabhava means the
    nama-rupas of living beings in the sensual world. In other words, kammabhava refers to
    existences in the hell and the worlds of devas, mankind, animals and petas. (2) rupabhava
    - the khandhas of brahmas with rupas. (3) arupabhava - namakhandhas of brahmas with no
    rupas. (4) sannibhava - nama-rupas of beings with gross perceptions, that is beings in 29
    abodes other than asanni nevasanni abodes. (5) asanaribhava - nama-rupa of asanni-brahmas.
    (6) Nevasanninasanni - namakhandhas of higher brahmas. (7) ekavokarabhava - the bhava with
    only rupakkhandha. (8) catuvokarabhava - the bhava with four namakhandhas. (9)
    pancavokarabhava - of bhava with five nama-rupakkhandhas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short, upapattibhava means the nama-rupas of the new
    existence that results from kamma. It comprises the vinnana, nama-rupa, salayatana, phassa
    and vedana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhava that arises from upadana is basically
    kammabhava, the other upapattibhava being merely its by-product.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From contact with six pleasant or unpleasant sense-objects
    there arise six pleasant or unpleasant feelings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Feelings lead to craving and craving develops into
    clinging; clinging to sensual objects may become excessive to the point of craving for
    union with one's family in a future life or attainment of Nibbana hand in hand with one's
    beloved. The excessive degree of a man's upadana is evident in the story of the merchant
    Mendaka.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Story Of Mendaka</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mendaka was a rich merchant in a previous life. In the
    face of a famine, his stock of provisions gradually ran out and at last he had to send
    away his attendants and was left with his wife, a son, his daughter-in-law and a slave.
    His wife had cooked rice that was barely enough for their consumption, and they were about
    to eat it when a paccekabuddha appeared to receive food.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the sight of the paccekabuddha, the merchant thought of
    his bad kamma, that is, lack of dana in a previous life that had now brought about his
    starvation. He then offered his share of rice to the paccekabuddha and prayed for abundant
    supply of food and reunion with the members of his household in his future lives. His wife
    too donated her share of rice and expressed a similar wish in her prayer. The son and his
    wife followed suit and prayed in the same vein, that is, for unlimited supply of food and
    money as well as reunion with the same wife, husband, parents and slaves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The prayers of the merchant and his family clearly point
    to the powerful influence of upadana in the sensual sphere and most people today are no
    less subject to the same kind of attachment. But more appalling is the upadana of the
    slave Punna. After offering his share of rice, he prayed for abundance of food and rebirth
    as the slave of the same family! It never occurred to him to pray for rebirth as a king or
    a merchant; his attachment to his masters and mistresses was so strong that he wanted only
    to be their slave hereafter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once there was a village headman who stood well with
    Government officials. Those were the days when under British rule most of the high ranking
    officials were Englishmen. The headman took much delight in paying respect to them. He
    said that he enjoyed saying, Phaya, &quot;Yes, my Lord,&quot; when he was called by an
    officer. His attachment was essentially the same as that of Punna.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The paccekabuddha blessed them and departed. By means of
    his psychic power they saw him fly back to the Himalayas and share the food with five
    hundred other fellow buddhas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On that very day, the merchant and his family found their
    acts of dana bearing fruit wonderfully. They found the rice pot full of rice. They ate to
    their hearts' content, but the pot was always full of rice. They found their granaries,
    too, overflowing with grains.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Their prayers were fulfilled in the lifetime of the
    Buddha-Gotama for they became members of the same household in Baddiya, a city of the
    Magadha country. The news of the fulfilment of their prayers was so unusual and amazing
    that the king made an inquiry through a minister and found that it was indeed true. This
    story is mentioned in Vinaya pitaka.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Upadana And Kammabhava</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the sensual desire for an object develops into an
    intense craving, a person becomes desperate and tries to secure it by fair means or foul.
    Thefts, robberies, frauds, murders and so forth that are rampant nowadays stem from
    upadana. Some crimes are rooted in sensual upadana while others arise from one of the
    three kinds of illusion based on upadana. People commit crimes not only because of their
    unwholesome desire but also because of their blind attachment to wives, husbands, etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The following is a story illustrative of the evil
    kammabhava resulting from sensual upadana.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Puppharatta Jataka</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Long ago, there was a poor man in Benares. He had only a
    suit of thick clothes. He washed it to wear during the Tazaungdine festival, but his wife
    disliked the white clothes and craved for a garment of pink colour. All his efforts to
    reason with her being in vain, the man at last sneaked into the royal garden at night to
    steal the flower that was to be used for dyeing his wife's garment. He fell into the hands
    of the guards and was ordered by the king to be impaled. He suffered terribly with the
    crows pecking at his eyes. Yet he murmured that his physical pain was nothing when
    compared to the mental suffering that overwhelmed him when he thought of the
    non-fulfilment of his wife's desire and his inability to enjoy the festival together with
    her. So crying over his ill-luck, he died and landed in hell.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today, there may be many people who do evil due to the
    pressure of those whom they love. All these evil deeds comprise kammas stemming from
    upadana and leading to the lower worlds. So Visuddhimagga says: &quot;Under the influence
    of sensual upadana, people do evil in deeds, words and thought because of their craving
    for sensual objects in the present life and their desire to preserve the objects in their
    possession. Such evil deeds usually lead to the lower worlds.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Right And Wrong Good Kamma</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some good deeds are right but some are wrong. The
    so-called good deeds that some people do are harmful and as such they are evil kammas. For
    example, some people believe that it is a good deed to put an end to the suffering of some
    animals by cutting short their span of life. Every living being is afraid to die or suffer
    pain and it is certainly wrong to cause pain and death to animals.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people also consider it a good deed to bring about
    the speedy death of a person who is suffering from an incurable, painful disease. But the
    patient does not want to die although he wants to be free from pain. Even if he expresses
    the desire to die, it is wrong from the Buddhist point of view to cause the death of a
    living being and if one directly or indirectly causes the premature death of a parent by
    &quot;mercy killing&quot;, it is a grave kammic offence that leads to hell.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Craving for the sensual pleasures of the human and
    deva-worlds, and misled by false teachings, etc., some people do misdeeds such as killing
    for the attainment of their object. But as a result of their evil kamma, they land in the
    lower worlds after death.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the commentary, misconceptions of those
    people arise from false teachers, lack of good kamma in the past and the failure to guard
    oneself. Reliance on evil teachers leads to evil kamma, much evil kamma in the previous
    life makes it easy to acquire evil views and evil habits, and lack of self-vigilance makes
    one an easy prey to temptation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">True religion is called saddhamma &quot;the religion of
    the good man&quot;. Those who follow the true religion hear good teachings, avoid evil
    deeds, evil words and evil thoughts, hold right views about the future life, kamma and its
    fruits, etc., cultivate good thoughts and practise dana, sila and bhavana for their
    welfare.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The practice of alms-giving, morality and mental
    development is true and good dhamma because it is harmless and acceptable to everybody.
    Nobody will blame a man who avoids killing, stealing, abusing and other misdeeds. The good
    deeds which we do for our welfare here and now or hereafter are wholesome kammas that stem
    from upadana in the sensual sphere. These kammas lead to rebirth in the human or deva
    worlds. So the Visuddhimagga says: &quot;Those who hear the true teaching believe in kamma
    and the efficacy of good deeds as passport to better life in the sensual worlds of rich
    men, aristocrats or divine beings. So they do good deeds under the influence of kamupadana
    and are reborn in the human and deva worlds.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma and Rebirth</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As it is said, &quot;Bhava paccaya jati,&quot; rebirth
    occurs in the human and deva worlds or in the lower worlds because of good or evil
    kamma-process. So rebirth stems from kammas which result from clinging (upadana) and
    craving that is rooted in the contact between the six sense-objects and the corresponding
    sense-organs (ayatana).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In other words, there arise vinnana, nama-rupa,
    salayatana, phassa and vedana in the present life as the avijja sankhara, etc., in a
    previous existence and now on top of that, tanha and upadana give rise to new kamma,
    thereby providing the ground for new rebirth. The situation is like that of a man who has
    committed a crime while he is in prison for a previous conviction, or that of a man who
    has incurred new debt before he has fully settled his old debt.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such new kammas accumulate by the thousands in a single
    lifetime. Under certain conditions one of these kammas becomes a death-bed vision and
    leads to rebirth while other kammas will create rebirth at other times in the life-cycle.
    If there are residual kammas from the previous lives that possess great force, they take
    precedence over present kamma, appear as death-bed visions and create rebirth in the lower
    or higher worlds. The post-mortem destiny of the person in such cases is determined by the
    nature of kamma.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Four Kinds Of Kamma</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma is of four kinds, according to the way in which it
    bears fruit. (1) //garukamma// - weighty kamma, (2) //bahula or acinnaka kamma// -
    habitual kamma, (3) //asanna kamma// - death proximate kamma and (4) //katatta// kamma -
    stored-up kamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">//Garukamma// is killing parents or an Arahat or causing
    injury to a Buddha or causing a schism in the Sangha. As for the good //garukammas//,
    there are the good kammas of the material and non-material worlds. The //garukammas// head
    off the fruition of other kammas and lead to rebirth, rupa and arupa jhanas among them
    leading to rupa and arupa rebirth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The evil garukammas lead direct to hell after death;
    hence, the term //pancanantriyakammas// - the five great evil kammas leading invariably to
    hell. The man who kills his father or mother unknowingly or knowingly can never attain
    jhana or the path and fruition (maggaphala) in the present life; he is bound to land in
    hell after his death. He cannot attain jhana or the path nor can any good kamma save him
    from hell. This is evident in the story of Ajatasattu.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Story Of Ajatasattu</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ajatasattu was the son of Bimbisara, the king of Magadha
    state, a devoted follower of the Buddha. Prior to the birth of the prince, the queen had
    the desire to drink the blood from the right arm of the king. When the king learnt this,
    he had the blood taken out and fulfilled her desire. The soothsayers then predicted that
    the child in the queen's womb would become the king's enemy. Hence the name Ajatasattu -
    the potential enemy of the father while still in the mother's womb.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The queen tried to abort the child but as the king's kamma
    and the child's kamma would have it otherwise, she did not succeed in her attempt. The
    king had her pregnancy well protected and the child was born. When he came of age, he was
    appointed heir-apparent.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the young prince fell into the clutches of the
    evil-minded Devadatta who misused his psychic power for his selfish ends. Turning himself
    into a boy with a snake coiled around his waist, he appeared before Ajatasattu and then
    showed himself as a bhikkhu. The prince was deeply impressed, and no wonder for people are
    very much interested in miracles and they have blind faith in anyone who can perform them.
    The prince held Devadatta in high esteem and became his devoted follower.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Devadatta made another move for the success of his
    evil design. He told the prince that since people did not live long, he (the prince)
    should kill his father and become king while still in the prime of his life; and that he
    (Devadatta) on his part would kill the Buddha. The prince failed in his attempt on the
    life of the king but when the latter learnt of his desire, he handed over his kingship to
    his son.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The transfer of power nonetheless came short of
    Devadatta's scheme. On his advice, Ajatasattu imprisoned his father and starved him. The
    queen was the only person who was permitted to visit the prison and see the king. She
    secretly brought food for the king by various means and at last she was forbidden to visit
    the prison. From that day, the king got nothing to eat but still he managed to keep
    himself in good physical condition by pacing on the floor. Then by the king's order, the
    barbers caused such injury to the feet of his father as to make it impossible for him to
    walk. According to the commentary, he was thus injured because in a previous life he
    walked with footwear on the platform of a pagoda and trod with unwashed feet on a mat
    meant for the bhikkhus.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Bimbisara died probably at the age of 67. His son
    Ajatasattu was not evil-minded at heart. His good nature was evident in his devotion to
    the Buddha after he had wronged his father, his adoration and enshrinement of the Buddha
    relics and whole-hearted support which he gave to the First Council. It was his
    association with the evil teacher that led him astray to the point of patricide. His life
    affords us a lesson that we should specially bear in mind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the very day of his father's death, his wife gave birth
    to a son. On hearing the news, he became excited and overwhelmed with great affection for
    his child. This reminded him of his father and he ordered the release of the imprisoned
    king, but it was too late. When later on he learnt from his mother how much he was loved
    and cared for by his father in his childhood, he was seized with remorse. His life became
    wretched and miserable. He could not sleep at night, haunted by the visions of hell and
    smitten by conscience for his crime against his father, a devout lay disciple of the
    Buddha at that.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So led by the physician Jivaka, he went to see the Buddha.
    At that time the Lord was surrounded by over a thousand bhikkhus. But as they were in a
    contemplative mood, all was quiet with none speaking or making any movement of their hands
    or feet. Being deeply impressed, the king said, &quot;May my son Udayabaddha be blessed
    with the kind of serenity which these bhikkhus possess!&quot; Perhaps he feared lest his
    son should come to know how he seized power and try to follow in his father's footsteps.
    But later his fear did become a reality for down to his great grandson, the sons ascended
    the throne after killing their fathers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Ajatasattu asked the Buddha about the immediate
    benefits of the life in the holy order. The Lord enlarged on the benefits accruing from
    the holy life - the lay follower's reverence for the bhikkhu, moral purity, the first
    jhana and other higher states of consciousness in the mundane sphere, psychic powers,
    extinction of defilements and the attainments of the holy path.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After hearing the sermon, Ajatasattu formally declared
    himself a disciple of the Buddha. He would have attained the first stage on the path but
    for his patricide. Nevertheless, from that time he had peace of mind and after his death,
    he was spared the terrors of Avici hell that would have been in store for him had he not
    met the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Habitual And Death-Bed Kammas</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The other three weighty kammas, viz., killing an Arahat,
    causing injury to the Buddha and wilfully causing a schism in the Sangha are also bound to
    drag the offender to hell.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The other type of kamma that bears fruit is habitual
    kamma, called //bahula or acinna kamma//. Failure to lead a good moral life may become
    habitual if no step is taken to remove it, and it will have evil kammic effect in a future
    life. So laymen should live up to the five precepts and in case of any breach verbally
    affirm the will to guard one's moral life more vigilantly. Moral purity is equally vital
    to the life of a bhikkhu. Failure to make amends for any deliberate or unintentional
    violation of a vinaya rule will create habitual kamma and so the bhikkhu should seek to
    regain moral purity through confession and reaffirmation of his will to preserve it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Alms-giving, reverence for parents and teachers,
    contemplation of the Buddha, practice of meditation and so forth, which one does daily are
    also habitual kammas that tend to bear immediate fruits.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the absence of habitual kamma, what we do at the last
    moment of our life (//asanna kamma//: death-bed kamma) produces kammic results. In one
    Abhidhamma book, it is described as being more potent than habitual kamma but perhaps this
    is true only in exceptional cases. As the commentaries say, the habitual kammas probably
    take precedence and bear fruits.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nevertheless, in the light of stories in ancient Buddhist
    literature we can certainly rely on death-bed kamma. A dying man who had killed people for
    over 50 years attained the deva-world after offering food to Sariputta and hearing his
    discourse. This story finds an echo in the experience of a. Sinhalese fisherman who landed
    in the deva world after his encounter with a thera just before his death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As productive as the positive death-bed kamma is its
    negative counterpart. A Sinhalese layman who practised meditation for many years was
    disappointed as he had never seen even the light. He then concluded that the Buddha's
    teaching was not the way to liberation and because of this false view he landed in the
    peta world after his death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Failure to encounter the light, etc., in the practice of
    meditation may be due to wrong method, wrong effort or lack of basic potential (parami).
    In the time of the Buddha, a monk called Sunakkhatta attained divine eye but not the
    divine-ear because he did not have the potential for it and, besides, there was his bad
    kamma as a hindrance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the yogi need not be disheartened if his practice does
    not produce the desired effect. By and large, practice along the right path leads to
    unusual experiences.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With tranquillity and purity of mind, the material object
    of contemplation and the contemplating consciousness become clearly distinct as do their
    causal relation and their ceaseless, rapid arising and dissolution. At that time, the yogi
    sees the light but even if he does not see it clearly he experiences joy, ecstasy, etc.,
    for joy, ecstasy, tranquillity, equanimity, etc., form the links of enlightenment
    (//bojjhanga//) that are so vital to the development of vipassana insight. Reflection on
    namarupa by itself does not lead to these higher states of consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the absence of habitual or death-bed kamma, there is
    kattata kamma which means the kamma that one has done once in a lifetime.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Birth And Suffering</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The role of kamma in the chain of causation is underscored
    in the teaching sankhara paccaya vinnanani - &quot;From sankhara there arises rebirth
    consciousness&quot;, which we have already explained in detail. The dying person is
    attached to the signs and visions relating to his kamma and so on his death there follow
    kamma-based rupas together with rebirth-consciousness conditioned by his death-bed
    attachment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Contact with the sense-objects gives rise to feeling which
    in turn produces desire. It does not matter whether the feeling is pleasant or unpleasant.
    Pleasant feeling creates attachment to pleasant objects while unpleasant feeling makes us
    crave for pleasant objects. When the desire becomes strong and develops into frantic
    craving (upadana), it results in activity or effort for its fulfilment. People do good or
    bad deeds which they hope will help to satisfy their needs and desires. It is this
    kammabhava rooted in craving that gives rise to rebirth. Rebirth is bound up with
    suffering regardless of the world in which it takes place.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no need to dwell on the sufferings in the animal
    and other lower worlds. Among human beings, too, suffering is an inescapable fact of life.
    A man's suffering begins while he is in the mother's womb. He has to work hard for his
    living, he is harassed by bullies and tyrants. Even if he escapes from the dukkha inherent
    in the struggle for survival, he will finally have to face old age, sickness and death.
    From the time of his conception, man is headed towards these inevitable evils of life. He
    is approaching them at every moment. He may live an apparently care-free, happy life but
    his namarupas are forever in the process of ageing and disintegration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is an Indian story which stresses the inevitability
    of old age, sickness and death. A man being afraid of old age rose into the air with the
    elixir of life in his mouth and hid in the sky. Another man hid under the sea to escape
    sickness and still another hid in a cave in Himalayas to avoid death. When their sons
    searched for them they found that the first man had become old with all the ugly signs of
    decrepitude, the second man was sick unto death and the third man was dead.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Everyone is subject to old age, sickness and death. Once a
    man is reborn, there is nothing that will protect him from these evils of existence.
    Hence, the Buddha's saying in the Dhammapada that there is no place in the sky, on land or
    in the sea, where one can escape death.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Grief And Lamentation</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Death and the other two evils of life are inevitable so
    long as rebirth takes place within the framework of disintegrating nama-rupa. Rebirth
    leads also to grief, anxiety, lamentations and anguish.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We grieve when a member of the family dies. The grief is
    overwhelming when we lose someone, e.g. parents or a husband on whom we have to depend or
    someone, e.g. a son or a daughter whom we love dearly. Another cause for grief is the loss
    of material possessions through evil-minded officials, robbers, thieves, destructive
    fires, floods, cyclones, and hated heirs. Grief is also caused by the affliction of
    disease and decline of health. Some sick persons are so much depressed that their mental
    states become a hindrance to their recovery. In the case of morally scrupulous monks and
    laymen, any damage to moral life gives rise to anxiety. Thus, the rishi Isisinga suffered
    terrible anguish when his moral integrity was undermined by the seduction of a goddess.
    Anxiety and repentance also torment those who realize their mistakes after having rejected
    the right view in favour of a wrong one under the guidance of a false teacher.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Besides, there are many other misfortunes in life, e.g.
    accidents, viz., victimization by robbers, etc., hardship in earning one's living and,
    securing the necessities of life and so forth that occasion grief, anguish and
    lamentation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no need to dwell on the physical sufferings in
    hell and the animal and peta-worlds. Because of his consciousness, man also suffers
    anguish whenever he is in contact with unpleasant sense-objects. As he has thus to suffer
    mentally into the bargain, it is for him something like adding insult to injury. This does
    not apply to the Arahat or the noble one at the anagami stage, for being free from
    irritation (dosa) he remains unperturbed in the face of physical suffering and so does the
    mindful yogi who is free from ego-illusion that tends to add to the sense of self-pity.
    Hence, the importance of the Buddha's teaching that we should be aware of unpleasant
    feeling when we suffer from it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People are unhappy when they think of the frustrations and
    misfortunes that beset them in the past or at present or that may beset them in future.
    They feel bitter and upset when they find themselves in distress and burdened with
    misfortunes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All these sufferings are rooted in rebirth. Life is all
    suffering without the ego and without anything good even if there were such ego to enjoy
    it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the doctrine of Paticcasamuppada, the only
    thing that links one existence with another is the cause-and-effect relationship. From
    craving, kammic effort, etc., based on ignorance in one existence, there arise five
    effects, viz., consciousness, body and mind, sense-organs, contact, and feeling. These
    effects begin with rebirth and end in death with old age, anxiety and other sufferings in
    between them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This teaching of the Buddha will not appeal to common
    people who harbour illusions of happiness and ego-entity. But impersonality and suffering
    are the unmistakable facts of existence and life in the deva-world is no exception. Some
    earth-bound devas have to struggle hard for survival and are more miserable than human
    beings. They are called //vinipatika// devas and they comprise ghosts, devils, etc., that
    belong to lower order of devas. Some devas in heavens are not happy because they do not
    have good abodes and enough attendants. Even Sakka, the king of devas, admitted to the
    elderly thera Mahakassapa that he was not very much luminous as his attainment of
    deva-world was due to the good kamma which he did long before the proclamation of
    Buddha-dhamma and that he had to hide himself when he saw the devas who outshone him as
    they had done good kamma in the time of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, Sakka was not always happy and so were his female
    attendants who told Mahakassapa that they were wretched and miserable since they counted
    for little among the high-ranking queen-goddesses. Some devas become unhappy on the
    approach of death that is heralded by the withering of their bedecked flowers, the
    sweating from their armpits and other signs of senility. Some devas die suddenly while
    indulging in celestial pleasure just like a man whose life is cut off by stroke. Death may
    be a matter of seconds like the extinction of the flame of a candle. This is borne out by
    the story of Subrahma deva.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Story Of Subrahma Deva</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Subrahma deva was having a good time when his attendants,
    the goddesses who were singing and plucking flowers on the tree died suddenly and landed
    in hell. Subrahma deva saw them suffering in hell and at the same time he foresaw that he
    too would die in a few days and share the fate of his attendants. Being much frightened,
    he came to the Buddha and asked the Lord to show him the place where he could live without
    fear. The Lord then says that he sees no way to salvation for every living being other
    than the practice of //bojjhanga// dhamma (links of enlightenment such as mindfulness),
    the //dhutanga// (ascetic practices) and //sammappadhana// (right exertion), that serve to
    put an end to defilements, the control of senses (indriyasamvarasile), the control that
    helps to keep off the defilements and Nibbana which means renunciation of everything.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On hearing this, the deva and his attendants attained the
    first stage on the holy path. What we should note here is the sudden death of the
    goddesses. The fate of those who thus die suddenly while engaged in the pursuit of
    pleasure is indeed terrible for they are likely to land in hell as a result of unwholesome
    kammic impulses. If there is any sign that heralds the approach of death, it creates fear
    and adds to their suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suffering that stems from attachment to pleasure is not
    confined to the sensual sphere. For it is the lot, too, of the Brahmas in their immaterial
    or formless (arupa) world. In the Brahma world there is no pleasure of sex or any other
    sensual pleasure. The Brahmas only see, hear or think and the objects of their seeing,
    etc., have no sexual overtones. But as Visuddhimagga says, some people develop a craving
    for the sensual pleasures of the Brahma world because they believe either through hearsay
    or speculation that such pleasures are superior to those of the human and deva-worlds. It
    is no other than their sensual craving that leads to the attainment of rupajhana,
    arupajhana, samapatti and finally lands them in the rupa or arupa brahma worlds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is not surprising that some people think or speak of
    the sensual pleasure in the Brahma world. Those who are well aware of the true teachings
    of the Buddha will reject the idea but it probably appeals to ignorant people. The Indian
    religious books portray Brahma with his wife and some regard even Nibbana as a heavenly
    abode with celestial mansions where we can dwell with our families and attendants.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Kamaupadana Means All Kinds Of Excessive Craving</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamaupadana here means not only the excessive craving for
    sensual pleasure. It means also the developed forms of craving for the material and
    immaterial (rupa and arupa) worlds. Hence, according to Visuddhimagga, the yogi can do
    away with this inordinate craving only at the last stage of the holy path and it is this
    craving that lies at the root of every effort to attain rupa or arupa jhana. For ordinary
    people such jhana means rupa or arupa kammic effort based on sensual craving and this
    leads to rebirth in rupa or arupa world of Brahmas. From the time of rebirth there arises
    the ceaseless ageing (jara) of nama-rupa or either of the two phenomena of life. The
    senility of the Brahma is not apparent like that of a human being but still it leads to
    decay, and when his course is run, he cannot avoid death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Being free from hatred, the life of a Brahma is not
    subject to grief, worry, anxiety and so forth; and the lack of physical sensitivity makes
    him free from physical suffering. He cannot, however, escape birth, old age and death that
    are inherent in every kind of existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So escape from old age and death presupposes the effort to
    rule out the possibility of rebirth. In order to avoid rebirth, we must seek to avoid
    wholesome or unwholesome kamma and negation of kammic existence calls for negation of
    attachment and craving. For this purpose, the mental process must end in feeling and stop
    short of developing the desire for anything. This denial of desire through the
    contemplations, anicca, dukkha and anatta of everything arising from the senses is the
    only way to avoid craving, rebirth and other links in the causal sequence that leads to
    old age and death. This means the temporary extinction of suffering which the yogi can
    overcome once and forever when he develops vipassana insight on the holy path.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Attachment To Belief As The Cause Of Rebirth</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ditthupadana means the attachment to the view which
    rejects future life and kamma. Hence, ucchedaditthi which insists on annihilation after
    death is a kind of ditthupadana. A person who holds such a belief will have no need to do
    good or avoid evil. He will do nothing for other-worldly welfare and seek to enjoy life as
    much as possible by fair means or foul. As he has no moral scruples, most of his acts are
    unwholesome kammas that create death-bed visions and lead him to the lower worlds. This is
    evident in the story of Nandaka peta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nandaka was a general in the time of king Pingala who
    ruled Surattha country that lay north of the present province of Bombay in West India. He
    clung to false views e.g. that it was useless to give alms and so forth. After his death
    he became a peta on a banyan tree, but when his daughter offered food to a monk and shared
    her merit with him, he had an unlimited supply of celestial drinks and food. He then
    realized the truth of the kammic law and repented of his adherence of false views in his
    previous life. One day, he led king Pingala to his abode and entertained the king and his
    followers to a celestial feast. The king was much surprised and in response to his
    inquiry, the peta gave an account of his rebirth in the lower worlds as a kammic result of
    his false views, immorality and vehement opposition to alms-giving; and the sudden change
    of his fortune following his sharing of merit acquired by his daughter. He also described
    the suffering that he would have to undergo after his death, the terrible suffering in
    hell that he was to share with those who held wrong views and vilified the holy men during
    their earthly existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The moral of the story is that attachment to wrong views
    (e.g. that an act has no kammic result, etc.) leads to unwholesome acts and rebirth in the
    lower worlds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The commentary also says that clinging to uccheda
    (annihilation) belief leads to deva or Brahma worlds if annihilation is supposed to follow
    demise on those higher planes of existence, but devas and Brahmas apparently do not
    believe in their annihilation after death. By and large, the belief in annihilation makes
    people prone to misdeeds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kammic deeds may also be motivated by eternity belief
    (sassataditthi). The belief creates the illusion of personal identity, the illusion which
    makes a man believe that it is his permanent self that will have to bear the consequences
    of his good or bad deeds in a future life. So he devotes himself to what he regards as
    good deeds. Some of his deeds may be bad in fact, but in any case his deeds, whether good
    or bad, that arise from eternity belief lead to rebirth and suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Still, another mainspring of kammic deed is superstitious
    belief. There are many superstitions, for example, that seeing a man of low class brings
    about misfortune, that the beehive or a guana in a house is a sure omen of poverty. Under
    the influence of such beliefs, a person may do evil, such as treating an outcaste cruelly
    or killing the bees. This is borne out by the Cittasambhuta jataka.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the jataka the bodhisatta was a man of low chandala
    class called Citta. Ananda was then his cousin named Sambhuta. They made their living by
    dancing with bamboos. One day, the daughter of a merchant and the daughter of a high-caste
    brahmin who were very superstitious went for a picnic with their attendants. At the sight
    of the two dancers, they considered it an ill omen and returned home. Their irate
    followers then beat the two men for denying them the pleasure of the picnic.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The two dancers then went to Taxila and disguised as
    brahmins, they devoted themselves to learning. Citta became a student leader by virtue of
    his intelligence. One day, their teacher sent them to a place where they were required to
    recite the brahmanical parittas. There having got his mouth burnt by drinking hot milk
    unmindfully, Sambhuta uttered, &quot;Khalu, Khalu&quot; in his dialect and Citta was so
    absent-minded as to say, &quot;niggala, niggala&quot; (&quot;spit out, spit out&quot;);
    these slips of the tongue led to their undoing for their high caste brahmin students found
    out their secret. They were beaten and expelled from school.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the advice of their teacher they became rishis (forest
    ascetics or hermits). After their death they passed on to the animal world, first as two
    deers and as two eagles in their next existence. Then Citta became the son of the chief
    Brahmin and remembered his three previous lives. He led the life of a hermit and attained
    jhana and psychic powers. Sambhuta became a king, he remembered his low caste life as a
    chandala and spent his time in the pursuit of sensual pleasure.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By means of his psychic power, Citta knew his brother's
    spiritual immaturity and after waiting for 50 years he came to the king's garden. The king
    recognized the hermit as his brother in a previous life and was prepared to share royal
    pleasures with him. But being aware of the kammic effects of good and bad deeds, the
    bodhisatta had pledged himself to a life of self-restraint, renunciation and detachment.
    He reminded the king of their close associations in their previous lives, to wit, as
    low-caste chandalas, as deers and as birds. His object was to point out the erratic course
    of kammic life and to urge the king to become an ascetic for further spiritual progress.
    But it was hard for Sambhuta to give up his worldly pleasures. So the bodhisatta returned
    to the Himalayas. Then the king became disenchanted with his worldly pleasures and went to
    the Himalayas where he was welcomed by the hermit. There, as a hermit he devoted himself
    to spiritual exercises and attained jhana and psychic powers.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Superstition And Evil Rebirth</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What we wish to emphasize in this story is the evil kammas
    that arise from superstitions. The role of superstition as the cause of evil deeds is also
    evident in the story of Koka, the hunter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the time of the Buddha, there was a hunter called Koka
    in a certain village. One day he set out with his dogs to hunt in the forest. On the way
    he met a monk who was out on his begging round. The hunter considered this encounter an
    omen that boded no good. As luck would have it, he did not get any animal for food on that
    day. On his return he again met the monk. Now blind with fury and ill-will, he set his
    dogs on the monk. The monk had to run and climb up a tree.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He sat on a branch that was not very high. The hunter
    poked at the feet of the monk with the sharp end of an arrow. The latter had to lift his
    feet one after the other and at last his robe got loose and slipped down. It fell upon the
    hunter and seeing him thus wrapped up in the robe, the dogs mistook him for the monk and
    attacked him. Thus, he was killed by his own dogs. Then realizing that they had killed
    their master, the dogs ran away.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The monk got down from the tree and reported the matter to
    the Buddha. Thereupon, the Lord says, &quot;The foolish man wrongs a person who has never
    wronged another. He wrongs a person who is free from defilements, but his evil deed
    boomerangs on him just like the particle of dust that returns to us when we throw it
    against the wind.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, the hunter's terrible death, his rebirth in the
    lower worlds and suffering arise from an evil deed that in turn is rooted in his
    superstition. Some people get alarmed when an astrologer says that the position of planets
    bodes no good for them. So they offer flowers and candles to the Buddha image, give dana
    to the monks, hear the sermons and practise meditation. Some have the parittas recited by
    monks to stave off the impending evil that they associate with their unpleasant dreams.
    Their good deeds lead to good rebirth, but like the other rebirths that stem from evil
    deeds, it too is fraught with suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some ignorant people do evil to keep off the misfortunes
    that might befall them. The jatakas mention the animal sacrifice of some kings that
    involves the killing of four goats, four horses, four men and so forth as propitiatory
    offerings to gods. On one occasion, this kind of rite was planned by king Kosala in the
    time of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king had taken a fancy to a married woman and so one
    day he sent her husband on an errand to a distant place. Should he fail to accomplish the
    task entrusted to him and return to the capital on the same day, he was to be punished.
    The man carried out the king's order and returned before sunset, but the city gate was
    closed and so being unable to enter the city, he spent the night at Jetavana monastery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Overwhelmed with lust and evil desire, the king could
    hardly sleep in his palace. He heard the voices of the four men who were suffering in hell
    for having committed adultery in their previous lives. It was perhaps by virtue of the
    Buddha's will and psychic power that the king heard these voices from hell. The king was
    frightened and in the morning, he sought the advice of the Brahmin counsellor. The Brahmin
    said that the voices portended imminent misfortune and that in order to stave it off, the
    king should sacrifice elephants, horses, etc., each kind of animals numbering a hundred.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king made preparations for the animal sacrifice. How
    cruel is human nature that dictates the sacrifice of thousands of lives to save one's own
    life. Among the potential victims there were human beings, and hearing their cries, queen
    Mallika approached the king and asked him to seek the advice of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha assured the king that the voices had nothing to
    do with him. They were the voices of four young men who, having seduced married women in
    the time of Kassapa Buddha, were now suffering in Lohakumbhi hell. They were now repentent
    and belatedly trying to express their desire to do good after their release from hell. The
    king was very much frightened and vowed never to lust for another man's wife. He told the
    Buddha how the previous night had seemed very long because he could not sleep. The man who
    had fetched what the king wanted said too that he had travelled one yojana the previous
    day. Thereupon, the Buddha uttered the verse: &quot;To one who cannot sleep, the night
    seems long; to the weary traveller, a yojana is a long distance. Similarly, for the
    foolish man who does not know the true dhamma, the life-cycle is long.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After hearing this gatha, many people attained sotapanna
    and other stages on the holy path. The king ordered the release of all living beings that
    were to be sacrificed. But for the Buddha's words, he would have done unwholesome kammas,
    and this story shows how superstitious beliefs lead to evil deeds.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Fanaticism Or Religious Upadana</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Good or evil kammas are also born of religious
    attachments. By and large, people believe that theirs is the only true religion, that all
    other religions are false. So they try to spread their religion, convert other people by
    force or otherwise persecute the non-believers. All these evils had their origin in
    religious upadana or fanaticism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again kammic deeds may stem from attachment to ideology or
    views on worldly matters. Some people seek to impose their creed on other people by every
    means in their power; they propagate it in various ways and they discredit or slander or
    undermine the unity of those who do not agree with them. All these efforts and activities
    form the kammabhava due to upadana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short, all obsessions with practices, and beliefs other
    than the ego-belief mean excessive attachment to views that leads to kammic deeds.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Silabbatupadana - Attachment To Wrong Practices</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people believe that they can attain salvation through
    certain practices that have nothing to do with the Four Noble Truths. Such a belief is
    called silabbatupadana. It is silabbatupadana, too, to worship animals, to adopt the
    animal way of life, to perform certain rites and ceremonies in the hope of attaining
    salvation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Visuddhimagga, some people rely on these
    practices as the way to salvation and do kammic deeds that lead to rebirth in the human
    world, the deva world and the material (rupa) and immaterial (arupa) worlds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Visuddhimagga refers only to kammas leading to the
    human and other higher worlds. It makes no mention of the kammas leading to the lower
    worlds. It does not follow, however, that silabbatupadana does not give rise to bad
    kammas. The commentary does not mention the evil kamma arising from silabbatupadana only
    because it is too obvious to need allusion. It is said in the Kukkuravatika and other
    suttas that a man is reborn as an ox or a dog if he lives to the letter like those animals
    in deed, word or thought or he is reborn in hell or animal world if he accepts the false
    belief but does not practise it fully. Needless to say, the killing of animals as a
    sacrifice to gods that arises from this upadana leads to the lower worlds, and so do other
    misdeeds resulting from the upadana that is bound up with certain forms of worship, rites
    and ceremonies.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short, every belief in the efficacy of a practice as an
    antidote to evil is silabbatupadana. According to the commentaries on Visuddhimagga it is
    silabbatupadana even to rely entirely on conventional morality and mundane jhana as the
    way to liberation. The arupa jhanas attained by Alara and Udaka originated in this upadana
    and so do the deeds of many people that are based on faith in God. All these upadanas
    leads to rebirth and suffering.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Attavadupadana - Attachment To Ego-Belief</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last upadana (attavadupadana) is attachment to
    ego-belief. It is the strong conviction about the ego entity, the firm belief that the ego
    exists permanently, that it is the agent of every deed, speech and thought.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Few people are free from this upadana. The average man
    believes that it is &quot;I&quot; who sees, hears, moves, etc. This illusion of ego-entity
    is the mainspring of self-love and concern about the welfare of one's self. The
    universality and omnipotence of self-love are underscored in Queen Mallika's reply to king
    Kosala.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mallika was originally the daughter of a flower vendor.
    One day she met the Buddha on the way and offered her food. After eating the food, the
    Lord told Ananda that the girl would become the queen of king Kosala. On that very day,
    king Kosala who was defeated in the battle, fled on horseback. Utterly exhausted and
    forlorn, the king rested in the flower-garden where he was tenderly attended on by
    Mallika. Being much pleased, the king took her to the palace and made her his chief queen.
    The Buddha's prophecy came true because of her recent good kamma and her good deed in the
    past existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But Mallika was not as good looking as other lesser
    queens. Moreover, as a woman born of a poor family, she felt ill at ease among the
    courtiers. So in order to cheer her the king one day asked her whom she loved most. The
    answer which he expected was &quot;Your Majesty, I love you most.&quot; He would then tell
    her that he too, loved her more than anyone else and this demonstration of his love would,
    so he thought, increase their intimacy and make her more at home in the palace.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nevertheless, as an intelligent woman who had the courage
    of conviction, Mallika replied frankly that there was no one whom she loved more than
    herself. She asked the king whom he loved most. The king had to admit that he too loved
    himself more than anyone else. He reported this dialogue to the Buddha. Then the Lord
    said, &quot;There is no one in this world who loves another person more than himself.
    Everyone loves himself or herself most. So everyone should have sympathy and avoid
    ill-treating another person.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this saying of the Buddha, the word &quot;self&quot; or
    in Pali, atta, does not mean the atta or atman of the ego-belief. It refers only to self
    in its conventional sense or the self that a man speaks of to distinguish his own person
    from other living beings. But the ego-belief is also a source of self-love. The more
    powerful the belief is, the greater is the love of oneself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We do not love anyone more than our own selves. One loves
    one's wife or husband or child only as a helpmate, an attendant or a support. Marital or
    parental love is no more real than love of precious jewellery. So if a person says that
    his love of someone is greater than his love of himself, his words must be taken with a
    large grain of salt. In cases of life-and-death crisis, even a mother will not care for
    her child.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once a woman travelling with a caravan across the desert
    was left behind with her child as she was asleep when the caravan departed. As the sun
    rose higher in the sky, the sands became hotter and she had to place her basket and then
    her clothes under her feet. Still the heat became more unbearable till at last she was
    forced to put down her child under her body. Hence, the saying that even a mother will
    sacrifice her child for self-preservation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of this self-love based on ego-belief, man seeks
    his welfare or the welfare of his family by fair means or foul. He does not hesitate to do
    evil that serves his interests. But the belief in a permanent self also leads to good
    kammas. Some people are motivated by the belief and so they practise sila, dana, jhana,
    etc., for their welfare in afterlife. As a result they land in deva and Brahma worlds, but
    there they have to face again old age, death, and other evils of existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short, every effort to seek one's welfare in the
    present life or hereafter is rooted in ego-belief. Such kammic effort differs from that
    arising from kamupadana only in that its mainspring is obsession with personal identity
    whereas in the case of the latter the driving-force is craving for sensual pleasure.
    Nevertheless, for those who are strongly attached to ego-belief, egoism is closely bound
    up with sensual desire.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for the Ariyas who are wholly free from ego-belief,
    they are motivated only by kamupadana when they do good. Thus, the dana, sila and bhavana
    of Anathapindika, Visakha, Mahanama and others on the holy path may stem from their desire
    for better life in the human and deva-worlds or for the attainment of higher stages on the
    path.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Story Of Ugga</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The anagami Ariyas do good presumably because of their
    desire for the bliss in material and immaterial spheres and arahatship. It is, of course,
    arahatship that can help remove sensual craving. The desire for arahatship as the
    motivation for doing good in the case of anagami yogi is evident in the story of Ugga.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ugga was a householder in Vesali city. The Buddha spoke of
    the eight wonderful attributes possessed by Ugga. In response to the inquiry by a monk
    about the Lord's reference to his attributes, Ugga said that he knew nothing about it but
    that he had eight distinctive qualities which were as follows.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">l. When he saw the Buddha for the first time, he concluded
    decisively that Gotama was the real, all-Enlightened Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. He attained anagami insight into the Four Noble Truths
    when he heard the Buddha's discourse. He observed the five precepts that included
    abstinence from sexual intercourse.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. He had four young wives. He told them about his sexual
    abstinence and permitted them to return to their parents' homes or to marry the men of
    their own choice. At the request of his eldest wife, he willingly performed the wedding
    ceremony before giving her away to the man she loved.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. He had resolved to spend all his wealth on giving alms
    to holy men of high moral character.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. He approached the bhikkhus respectfully.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. He heard the bhikkhus' sermon respectfully. He preached
    if the bhikkhus did not give a sermon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. The devas came to him and said, &quot;The doctrine of
    the Buddha is very good.&quot; He replied that the Dhamma was a good doctrine whether or
    not they said so about it. He did not feel conceited for his dialogue with the devas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. He found himself free from the first five attachments
    that lead to the lower, sensual worlds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day Ugga, the householder who possessed these eight
    qualities and had attained the anagami stage on the path, offered food and robes which he
    liked very much to the Buddha. The Lord commented on the nature of alms-giving as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;One who offers anything that pleases him or that he
    prizes highly gets something which he adores. One who offers to the Ariyan Noble who is of
    high moral character is doing an act of dana that it is hard for ordinary people to do and
    therefore he gets what he wants very much.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some years later, Ugga died and passed on to the
    Suddhavasa brahma-world. Before long he came and paid respect to the Buddha. He said that
    he had attained Arahatship that was indeed the object of his aspiration when he offered
    his much beloved food to the Lord in his previous existence. The Buddha again commented on
    the nature of kammic benefits of alms-giving - how the giver got what he prized most if he
    offered his much-prized object, how he attained a rare object if he offered rare things,
    how he attained to a much extolled stage if he offered much-extolled objects.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The moral of this story is that one may even attain
    Arahatship, the summum bonum of the holy life as the kammic result of giving away one's
    much prized and precious objects. Ugga's alms-giving was motivated by the desire for
    Arahatship and it is this desire, or kamupadana that formed his driving force. Some people
    may object to making the term kamupadana synonymous with the desire for Arahatship and
    label it rather kusalachanda (wholesome desire) but then they will have to explain what
    kind of upadana it is that gives rise to good acts of Ariya such as dana, sila, etc.</font></p>
