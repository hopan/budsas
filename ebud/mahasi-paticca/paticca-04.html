    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Relation between Manodvara And Vinnana, Etc.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Manovinnana that thinks, conceives and cognizes has its
    origin in the mind and mind-objects. The mind which forms its basis is the bhavanga-citta
    that we have from the moment of conception. It occurs ceaselessly according to kamma. It
    is the basis for perception and cognition. When we sleep or when the mind is otherwise
    occupied, our mental life is all bhavanga-citta. It becomes active in the face of
    mind-objects and there arise intention and cognition. So we can think and know only on the
    basis of bhavanga. True, this citta is always present in the absence of intention and
    cognition but bhavanga can lead to mental events only when it is strong.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At times we cannot think because we are drowsy or our
    thinking may be futile, in spite of our effort, and this is due to weakness of bhavanga.
    Thus, bhavanga by itself serves little purpose. It becomes active only when it is in
    contact with a new sense-object. Hence, it is called bhavangacalana, active bhavanga or
    bhavanga-paccheda, bhavanga with its stream cut off. This last bhavanga gives rise to
    intention and cognition. According to the commentaries, avajjana (advertence of the mind
    towards the object) is also to be considered the basis for mental activity. Avajjana forms
    the first stage in the consciousness-process. It arises as the inquiring state of mind in
    regard to the object. If it is alert and sharp, it is mindful of all the essential facts
    and objects.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The good writer considers the important facts for his book
    and the good speaker chooses appropriate words for his speech, thereby making their
    writings and speeches perfect. Further, this avajjana leads to good or bad kammic
    consciousness accordingly as it is bent on good or bad objectives. It is open to
    introspection and cognition since we can know actually that intention and awareness arise
    from avajjana. So the words: &quot;mananja - mind as the basis&quot; should be understood
    as reference also to avajjana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Equally vital to mental activity is the mind-object. The
    object always arises when we reflect. In the absence of mind-objects mental activity is
    impossible. Thus, sometimes we wish to think but have to give up thinking because we
    cannot recall the essential facts or objects.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hence, mental activity depends on the conjunction of the
    mind (bhavanga), inquiring mind (avajjana) and the mind-objects.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the commentaries, the heart forms the
    physical basis of all mental events. But today Western doctors have removed the diseased
    heart of a patient and replaced it with a good substitute. The experiment was not a
    complete success but the press reports say that the transplanted heart functioned for a
    few days. This news may raise doubts about the role of the heart in the mental life of
    mankind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This question admits of two explanations. Although the
    heart is removed, its potency may not become extinct and bhavanga-citta may still linger
    in its place just like the tail of a house-lizard that moves after it has been cut off.
    Moreover, the bhavanga-citta may become active again when the transplant gets a new lease
    of life from the blood of the body, just as the new tissue or new eye ball that is
    engrafted has new sensitivity. Or, we can dispose of the question on the basis of
    Abhidhamma pitaka, for Patthana, one of the Abhidhamma books, describes the physical basis
    of manovinnana (mind) simply as &quot;that physical organ which conditions the mind as its
    basis.&quot; It does not specifically mention any organ or part of the body. Thus,
    according to this canonical book, we may assume that a certain part of the body is the
    seat of the mind, perhaps it is a certain part of the heart or the head. Those who do not
    wish to locate the mind in the heart may regard the head as its physical basis.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, we must mention the analogy of the spider and the
    evolution of mind as set forth in the commentary on Abhidhamma pitaka. The spider builds a
    web which is a kind of net for catching flies. It can do so instinctively in a matter of
    days after its birth whereas by contrast even a year-old child can do nothing for himself.
    The spider waits in the center of its web, eats up any creature that gets entangled there
    and returns to its abode. In the same way, the bhavanga or mano-vinnana has the heart as
    its abode and like the threads of the spider's web connecting its abode and its
    surroundings, the blood pumped by the heart flows through the blood-vessels and spreads
    all over the body. So the visual image in the eye stirs the bhavanga-citta in the heart
    and turns it into eye-consciousness and so on through its process (vithi). It (bhavanga)
    then turns back to its original seat. The same may be said of sound, smell, etc., with
    their respective sense-organs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is now clear that bhavanga, together with its original
    activity, that is, thinking and knowing, forms the mainspring of our mental life. When
    there is a visual object, the eye-consciousness arises with the eye as its basis and then
    the manovinnana reflects on it. The same is true of the ear-consciousness, etc., with the
    ear, the nose and the tongue as their bases. As for the body-consciousness, its sphere is
    extensive as it depends on the size of the body.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the sense-objects are not apparent, the mano-vinnana
    or the mind that comprises thinking and knowing holds sway over the mental life. Sometimes
    we are so much absorbed in thought that we remain unmindful of all sense-objects.
    Preoccupation with an important matter may even make us sleepless. We are then dominated
    by thoughts that arise ceaselessly one after another on the basis of mental activity as
    conditioned by bhavanga, avajjana and mind-objects. To the yogi who notes every thought as
    it arises, these thoughts will appear to arise and vanish separately in fragments.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every mental event depends on the conjunction of mind,
    mind-object and cognition. This is followed by contact with mental images. These images,
    which may be real or unreal, existent or non-existent, are present in imagination whenever
    we think or intend to do something. This is familiar to those who have read, for example,
    the jataka stories. Reading these stories give rise to mental images of cities and kings
    that are coloured by Burmese beliefs and traditions. They are far from historical truth
    for since the stories have their origin in India, people and places described in the
    jatakas must have conformed to the Indian culture and way of life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Modern novels evoke images of towns, villages, men, women,
    criminals and so forth. The reader knows that all these are purely fictitious and
    imaginary and yet while he is reading, they appear as real and, hence, the delight, sorrow
    and other emotions that a good story arouses in him. All this is due to contact with
    mental images.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the Buddha says in Brahmajala sutta, &quot;these
    teachings and beliefs stem from vivid imagination that makes them clear and real.&quot; In
    short, vivid imagination is necessary when we speak, write, hold a belief or think or just
    let the mind wander freely.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Imagination leads to feeling. Pleasant images cause
    pleasant feeling as do, for example, images related to our past affluence or the prospect
    of becoming affluent in future. On the other hand, unpleasant images make us unhappy. To
    think of the past suffering is to revive unpleasant memories and equally unpleasant is the
    anticipation of the troubles and arisings that might beset us in future. The cause of such
    unpleasantness may be purely imaginary as in the case of the people who grieved over the
    reported death of a relative only to learn later that he was still alive.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The image that is neither pleasant nor unpleasant will
    give rise to neutral (upekkha) feeling. We are then neither happy nor unhappy. Indeed we
    have the impression of having no feeling at all, but this indicates simply the subtle
    nature of upekkhavedana which, according to the commentaries., is to be known by the
    analogy of the tracks of the deer.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When a deer runs across a large rock, the track is lost
    since the animal leaves no footprints on it, but if the footprints are to be found on both
    sides of the rock, we conclude that the deer has run across the rock. Likewise, the yogi
    is well aware of the pleasant or unpleasant feelings. When he has upekkhavedana he does
    not notice it and is mindful only of seeing, hearing and so forth. But after that, he has
    again pleasant or unpleasant feeling and so he concludes that he has had neutral (upekkha)
    feeling while being mindful of ordinary mental events.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the Buddha says: &quot;Conditioned by the mind and
    mind-object manovinnana arises; the conjunction of mind, mind-object and manovinnana leads
    to sense-contact and, because of sense-contact, there is feeling.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is purely a process of cause-and-effect relationship
    that has nothing to do with a being, ego, creator or any happening by chance. By the Pali
    word &quot;dhamma&quot;, the teaching refers to the five sense-objects as well as the
    imagined objects. The five sense-objects again become the focus of mental activity. So
    manovinnana involves all the six sense-objects, that is, what one has seen, heard, etc.,
    and what one has not seen, not heard, etc. Every sense-object leads to sense-contact which
    in turn gives rise to feeling.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For common people, these mental events are bound up with
    the idea of ego, self or atta. Such an idea is an illusion irrelevant to the chain of
    causation. This is empirically realized by the mindful yogi. He notes every mental event,
    traces its cause and becomes aware of the bhavanga and avajjana as well as the
    mind-object. So he knows empirically that every mental event means only the interrelation
    of cause and effect, leaving no room for ego, creator or chance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He knows too that mental activity leads to sense-contact
    which in turn gives rise to feeling. His knowledge is not bookish but empirical. He
    follows and notes every mental event. If his mind wanders to his home while he is
    meditating at a retreat, he directs his attention to it and there is the contact between
    his mind and its object, viz., the image of the house. In the same way, contacts with
    Shwedagon pagoda or a foreign country occur when he notes and follows the corresponding
    thoughts that distract his mind. This contact with mind-objects is phassa. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Equally clear to the yogi is the feeling that results from
    sense-contact. While practising meditation, he feels delighted when he happens to think of
    something that pleases him; sorry when the thought about a sad event occurs to him;
    inclined to laugh when he thinks of something ludicrous. So he knows that feeling is
    merely the outcome of sense-contact. But the insight of the yogi who notes nama-rupa at
    every moment of their arising is deeper than this knowledge of the origin of feeling. For
    as he develops concentration and tranquillity (samadhi), he finds that every object of his
    introspection as well as its subject, that is, consciousness, passes away. So he gains a
    clear insight into the impermanence of all mental events, viz., thinking, feeling, etc.,
    their unsatisfactoriness and unreliability and their impersonal and insubstantial
    character. Such insight means the empirical realization and appreciation of the
    Paticcasamuppada or dependent origination.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Recapitulation</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the first part of the discourse we have explained the
    links in the chain of causation up to the vedana (feeling) which arises from phassa
    (sense-contact). To sum up what we have said so far.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Avijja is ignorance of the four noble truths. It makes
    ordinary people blind to the impermanence and insubstantiality of sense-objects. So they
    think, speak and act in the hope of securing happiness in the present life or hereafter.
    These deeds in thought, word or bodily actions are either wholesome or unwholesome and
    they are also called sankharas (kamma-formation).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sankharas give rise to new existence. The dying person
    has flashbacks of his kammic deeds and visions of future life that impress him and
    condition his new consciousness in a new life. In the absence of any special object that
    concerns the new consciousness, the latter occurs repeatedly with the death-bed impression
    of his previous life as its object.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This bhavanga-citta becomes active at the moment of
    seeing, etc. Then, there arises eye-consciousness that is dependent on the eye and visual
    form. It is part of the state of consciousness, that is, the whole mental life as
    conditioned by sankhara. What we see, hear, etc., may be pleasant or unpleasant and the
    corresponding nature of eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, etc., is due to the ethical
    character of our past deeds, that is the wholesomeness or unwholesomeness of the kammas in
    the past existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This applies to all of the six types of consciousness that
    arise from six sense-objects. The last type of consciousness, implicit in mental activity
    comprising thinking, imagining, willing, etc., is dependent on bhavanga-citta,
    avajjana-citta (mental advertence), the physical basis and the mental image. This mental
    activity (manovinnana) involves seven thought-moments (javana) and two other
    thought-moments (tadarammana). Here tadarammana is the product of good or bad kamma.
    Javana is not such a product, but in Abhidhamma it is labelled sankhara-based vinnana in
    that it arises from bhavanga, the product of sankhara.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Together with the arising of vinnana, there also arises
    other concomitant psycho-physical phenomena (cetasika and rupas). Thus vinnana leads to
    nama-rupa, but vinnana is followed also by the six ayatana (sense-organs) and six phassa
    (sense-impressions). Phassa means the conjunction of the mind, the mind-object and the
    sense-organ. It gives rise to vedana (feeling) which may be pleasant or unpleasant or
    neither pleasant nor unpleasant. The last kind of feeling which is called upekkhavedana,
    gives us the impression of the absence of any feeling, but according to Abhidhamma, it is
    in fact a kind of subtle pleasure that implies only the absence of unbearable pain.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Vedana Leads To Tanha</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of pleasant or unpleasant feeling, there arises
    tanha. Tanha means perpetual craving or hunger. It craves for sensual objects that it does
    not have or it craves for more of the objects that it already has. It knows no satiety or
    satisfaction. For all the sensual objects to gratify it, its hunger is insatiable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So a deva said that devas are like petas in that just as
    the petas are very hungry because of lack of anything to eat or drink in their realm, so
    also devas are always hungry although they indulge in all kinds of sensual pleasure. This
    sounds quite plausible. For the life-span of a Tavatimsa deva means millions of years on
    earth and the life is still longer in other higher deva-worlds such as Yama, Nimmanarati.
    Yet, in spite of their ceaseless and fabulously lifelong enjoyment of pleasure, the devas
    are never satisfied because their tanha is insatiable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same is true of human beings. Poor people seek sensual
    pleasure to the best of their ability. Of course, because of their poverty, they can never
    fulfil all their desires but equally insatiable is the craving of the rich, the high
    officials and the upper crust of society. This is due to the nature of tanha. The more it
    is fed, the more hungry it becomes and so it is worse among the rich than among the poor,
    more oppressive in wealthy countries than in poor countries.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Six Kinds Of Tanha</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tanha is never tired of seeing pleasant objects, man or
    woman whom it likes. It seeks sweet sounds. It hungers for good scent, good food and good
    drinks. It craves for tactile sensation and this is surely the worst craving for people
    who love sensual pleasure. Tanha also means liking for mind-objects that are impervious to
    the eye, the ear and other physical organs. It is the object that we can know only
    mentally. According to the scriptures it means the five sensitive (pasada) rupas, the four
    subtle elements such as apo, etc., the mental elements (cetasikas) concepts of forms,
    qualities, names, etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People crave for good pasada-rupas because they want to
    see clearly, to hear distinctly, or to have keen sense of touch. They seek apo elements as
    they wish to keep their mouth, throat and skin moist. They delight in the consciousness of
    their own sex and the opposite and hence their craving for manhood and womanhood. They
    want to live long and to move lightly, and this desire shows their hunger for the fine
    rupas of jivita and kayalahuta, etc. Their desire for happiness, good memory and good
    intelligence points to their craving for certain mental faculties. Love of one's own
    physical appearance and that of the opposite sex as well as the desire for praise and fame
    again shows the hunger for concepts.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For six sense-objects there are six kinds of craving.
    These six cravings may mean merely the love of sensual pleasure (kamatanha). This love may
    be combined with the illusion of permanence (bhavatanha), tanha that implies the
    eternity-belief. Craving is also bound up with the belief in annihilation which makes some
    people overly attached to sensual pleasure (vibhavatanha). So there are six cravings
    (corresponding to six sense-objects) for each of the three tanhas (kamatanha, bhavatanha
    and vibhavatanha) or 18 cravings. Each of these cravings may have internal objects or
    external objects and this leads to 36 kinds of craving. Since each craving may relate to
    the present, past or future, there are thus a total of 108 kinds of tanha. But all kinds
    of craving boil down to three kinds of tanha viz., kama-, bhava- and vibhava-tanhas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People who are in contact with unpleasant sense-objects
    long for pleasant objects. Those who suffer pain seek freedom from it. In short, according
    to the commentary, the suffering person longs for happiness. People seek freedom from
    pain, poverty and unpleasant objects and feelings. Absence of suffering means happiness
    (sukha). We seek freedom from preoccupation with unpleasant thoughts, from worry about
    food, clothing and shelter. But, once a man is well provided with the necessities of life,
    he tends to develop other cravings. Says the commentary, &quot;The wealthy man wants to
    increase his wealth.&quot; For it is in the nature of tanha to be insatiable. We wish to
    enjoy the good things of life repeatedly; we wish to increase our possessions. The more we
    have, the more we want, and the higher the quality of life is, the greater is the desire
    to enhance it. Tanha never comes to an end for it is fuelled and perpetuated by vedana or
    feeling.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards the tanha associated with upekkha (neutral)
    feeling, the commentary describes the concomitant feeling as pleasant (sukha) because of
    its poise and subtlety. In the case of our contact with ordinary sense-objects, neither
    the pleasant feeling nor unpleasant feeling is apparent; but since this upekkha feeling is
    fine and subtle, it is tinged with (sukha) pleasantness and hence it makes us crave for
    more definite pleasure. It leads to discontentment with the ordinary sense-objects and
    kindles the desire for better food, better clothes, better sense-contact and better living
    conditions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short, pleasant sense-objects create attachment and
    craving for better objects. Unpleasant objects create the desire to be rid of them. When
    the sense-objects produce neither pleasant nor unpleasant feelings, we are still
    discontented with our lot and crave for better things. All these show how vedana gives
    rise to tanha.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Tanha And Samsara</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Simultaneously with the arising of consciousness at the
    moment of seeing, etc., there arise nama-rupa, ayatana, phassa and vedana. For every
    ordinary person who is not yet free from defilements, vedana (feeling) leads to tanha.
    Tanha in turn causes upadana (clinging) that makes him do a good or a bad deed
    (kammabhava). Under certain conditions, kammabhava gives rise to rebirth that makes living
    beings subject to old age, sickness, death, grief and all other mental and physical
    sufferings. This is how feelings lead to samsaric dukkha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nobody can prevent the arising of nama-rupa, ayatana,
    phassa and vedana as concomitants of vinnana. The Buddha and the Arahats, too, have
    pleasant, unpleasant or neutral (upekkha) feelings as a result of contact with
    sense-objects. They feel pain that arises from physical affliction but they do not suffer
    mentally; nor do they take delight in pleasant sensations. So they are free from craving
    and attachment. They do not strive for pleasure and happiness and because of their
    non-kammic way of life, they do away with rebirth, nama-rupa and other causes of
    suffering. This is the extinction of dukkha for the Arahat who is completely free from
    defilements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it is said, &quot;Due to the complete extinction of
    tanha that is rooted in pleasant or unpleasant feeling on the Ariyan path, there arises
    the extinction of upadana (clinging).&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Experience of the pleasant or unpleasant feelings make the
    non-Arahats crave for the good things of life but it has no effect on the person who has
    attained Arahatship after passing through the successive stages on the holy path. This may
    sound incredible to the common people but in fact the most alluring sense-object has no
    appeal for the Arahat and he takes no interest in his welfare. He is, therefore, wholly
    free from craving and attachment and this means complete extinction of kammic effort,
    rebirth and its attendant suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it is said, &quot;The extinction of upadana leads to
    the extinction of the cause of rebirth (kammic effort). The extinction of kammic effort
    leads to extinction of rebirth. Extinction of rebirth leads to extinction of old age,
    death, grief, etc.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Extinction Of Craving</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short, with the complete extinction of tanha due to
    Arahatship, there is the complete extinction of all its consequences and this means the
    extinction of suffering. It does not imply the disappearance of happiness or a living
    being. It is simply the cessation of the nama-rupa process that is the source of dukkha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as Arahatship means complete extinction of craving,
    the attainment of anagami stage on the path means extinction of sensuous craving together
    with rebirth in the sensual world, old age, death, etc. At the sotapatti stage, the yogi
    is assured of extinction of all craving that may lead to the lower worlds or more than
    seven existences. So he is free from all suffering of the lower worlds and the suffering
    for more than seven lifetimes in the sensual world. Thus implicit in the Paticcasamuppada
    is the lessening of dukkha with the weakening of tanha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Likewise, the vipassana insight ensures the momentary
    extinction of tanha. The arising of six sense-objects leads to pleasant or unpleasant
    feeling and in the absence of vipassana insight, it finally ends in tanha and its
    attendant suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But as for the yogi who practises constant mindfulness and
    has developed vipassana insight, he finds only the arising and passing away of all
    phenomena, their impermanence, suffering and impersonality. He also finds that the
    pleasant or unpleasant feeling arises and passes away instantly. So he does not delight in
    the feeling that arises, he does not crave for another feeling; he is free from all
    craving.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Extinction of craving on the Ariyan holy path differs from
    extinction by vipassana in that in the former case, the extinction is permanent and it
    concerns every sense-object whereas in the latter case extinction is neither permanent nor
    universal. Tanha is extinct only at the moment of contemplation and only in respect of the
    object contemplated. Hence, it is called &quot;tadanga nibbuti&quot;, momentary or partial
    extinction of defilements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The yogi who practises meditation is barely aware of
    seeing, hearing, etc. This state of bare awareness leaves no room for tanha and as a
    result upadana (clinging), kamma, rebirth, etc., cease to occur. In other words, with the
    cessation of tanha, the samsaric cycle is partly cut off and this is called tadanga
    nibbuti.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">The Story Of Mahatissa Thera </font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is the story of Mahatissa thera in Sri Lanka who
    overcame tanha through the practice of both samatha and vipassana. One day he left his
    forest retreat early in the morning and on the way to Anuradha city for his begging round,
    he met a woman who had left her home after quarrelling with her husband. At the sight of
    the thera, there arose in her a lustful desire and she laughed aloud seductively. On
    looking at her the thera noticed her teeth. Since he had been contemplating the skeleton,
    the whole body of the woman appeared as a heap of bones. He concentrated on this mental
    image and attained jhana. Then, after contemplating the image of the skeleton in his
    jhanic state of mind, he attained Arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The thera continued his journey and on the way met the
    woman's husband. The man asked him whether he had seen a woman. The thera replied that he
    did see something but that he did not know whether it was a man or a woman. All that he
    noticed was a skeleton that passed him on the way.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What he actually saw was the woman's teeth, but his
    practice of contemplation had turned his impression of her body into the image of a
    skeleton. Hence, in his mind there was no room for lust or any other defilement arising
    from his sense-contact with the woman. Then practising vipassana on the basis of his
    jhanic consciousness, he became free from defilements and attained Arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This story might raise doubts among non-meditating people
    as regards the arising of the image of a skeleton at the sight of a person's teeth, but
    without practice one cannot have any clear idea of what mind training (bhavana) can
    accomplish. The mere exercise of concentration without any training cannot help to create
    mental images for these depend on steadfast and prolonged practice of contemplation.
    Imagination is the power of perception. Repeated contemplation strengthens perception
    which then helps create any kind of image of oneself or other people. This faculty of mind
    is possible even for a parrot as is borne out by a story in the commentary on Satipatthana
    sutta.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Story Of A Parrot</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A dancer put up for the night at the residence of
    bhikkhunis and when she went away, she left an intelligent parrot. The bird was cared for
    by the novitiates and it was called Buddha-rakkhita. The abbess of the nunnery thought
    that it would be good if there was something to contemplate for the bird living among the
    spiritual aspirants. So she taught her to contemplate &quot;atthi: skeleton&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One morning the parrot was swooped up by an eagle. In the
    wake of the hue and cry raised by the young nuns, the eagle became frightened and dropped
    the parrot. The Abbess asked it what it contemplated when it was seized by the eagle. The
    bird replied, &quot;I thought of a skeleton being carried off and I wondered where it
    would be scattered.&quot; The Abbess said &quot;Well done! This contemplation will
    contribute to your liberation from samsaric existence.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A thing that is repeatedly contemplated will become fixed
    in the long run. Since even a parrot can imagine a skeleton, there is no reason why a
    human being cannot do likewise. The parrot imagined itself as well as others to be
    skeletons. Because of this contemplation, it had no fear, anger or worry when it was taken
    away by the eagle.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So Satipatthana bhavana is extolled as a practice that
    helps to overcome grief and anxiety and to bring about the extinction of mental and
    physical suffering. But there may be many people who are not as wise as the parrot in the
    story since they never take interest in the dhamma and contemplate it. The yogi should
    resolve to surpass the parrot in the practice of vipassana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If Mahatissa thera had failed to regard the laughing woman
    as a skeleton, he might have become lustful and fallen a victim to temptation in the
    solitude of the forest. Even if he had no sexual desire at that time, any impression of
    the woman would have laid him open to temptation at other times. But thanks to his
    contemplation of the skeleton in the practice of vipassana, he overcame defilements and
    achieved final liberation from samsaric existence. Here, the extinction of tanha through
    vipassana practice is called tadanga nibbuti, partial extinction, while extinction through
    arahatship is called &quot;total extinction&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Contemplation And Extinction</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So with the total extinction of tanha that results from
    vedana, there is the extinction of upadana which means the extinction of all the
    consequences of craving. Contemplation of anicca, dukkha and anatta ensures the partial
    extinction of tanha, upadana, kamma, rebirth, etc. The object of vipassana practice is to
    put an end to defilements and samsaric suffering. So it is a matter of paramount
    importance that deserves the attention of everyone who seeks total liberation. Without
    this practice, pleasant or unpleasant feeling at every moment of seeing, etc., is bound to
    lead to craving, kamma and rebirth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The consciousness involved in every moment of seeing is
    due to avijja and sankhara in the previous existence. Seeing occurs together with vinnana,
    nama-rupa, ayatana, phassa and vedana. The scriptures treat each of these dhammas
    separately in terms of their causal relations, but in fact they do not arise separately
    one after another. If vinnana arises from sankhara, it arises together with its respective
    nama-rupa, ayatana, phassa and vedana. All of these dhammas are the results of the past
    kamma sankhara. They are termed vipaka-vatta which means round or cycle of resultants. The
    round of defilements viz., ignorance, craving and clinging produce round of kamma viz.,
    kamma and sankhara which leads to round of resultants viz., consciousness, nama-rupa,
    sense-organs, contact, feeling which again give rise to the round of defilements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The arising of these five resultants at the moment of
    seeing means to most people simply just seeing. In fact, seeing is the product of vinnana,
    nama-rupa, ayatana, phassa and vedana as are other psycho-physical events such as hearing,
    smelling and so forth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing involves consciousness together with mental
    advertence (manasikara), volition (cetana), etc., plus the eye-organ which comprises the
    nama-rupa. It also involves four ayatanas viz., eye sensitivity, visual object, eye
    consciousness and mental advertence (dhammayatana). Contact with the visual object is
    phassa and the pleasantness or unpleasantness that the object causes is vedana. Hence all
    the five resultants are bound up with every moment of seeing. The same may be said of
    other phenomena that arise from hearing, smelling and so forth.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Cutting Off At The Foundation</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These five psycho-physical resultants or phenomena occur
    ceaselessly one after another and comprise what we call man, deva or living being. These
    are conventional terms that refer in fact to the collection of the five nama-rupa
    elements. There is no solid, monolithic and permanent being. The only reality is the
    arising and passing away of nama-rupa and for the mindful yogi, this insight means the
    extinction of craving, clinging, kamma, rebirth, suffering - a chain of consequences that
    might result from feeling in the case of common people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the way to the cessation of the wheel of life
    (Paticcasamuppada) through the elimination of its key link viz., tanha as conditioned by
    feeling. In order to prevent tanha from arising as the result of vedana, at every moment
    of seeing the yogi should focus on every phenomenon that arises from six senses. Here, the
    most obvious of these sense contacts is the tactile sensation that concerns gross primary
    elements (Mahabhuta) and it is necessary for the beginner to start contemplation with it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This way is in accord with the Buddha's teaching in
    Satipatthana sutta, &quot;Gacchanto va gacchamiti pajanati: (the yogi) knows that he is
    walking when he walks.&quot; How does he know it? He knows it as he notes mentally
    &quot;walking, walking&quot;. He practises mindfulness, too, when he stands, lies, bends
    his arms, or does anything else. When there is no bodily action or movement to be noted,
    he should direct his attention to the abdominal rising and falling. He should also note
    any thought, or mental activity and any feeling that may arise in him. In short, he must
    be mindful of all the psycho-physical phenomena that arise from the six senses. As
    concentration develops, such mindfulness leads to insight into anicca, dukkha and anatta,
    an insight that leaves no room for craving. With the extinction of craving, there is also
    an end to clinging, and rebirth with all its attendant suffering. This is the way to the
    cessation of samsaric existence or life-cycle through the elimination of its root cause,
    namely, craving.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today, science and technology have created machines which
    we cannot run or stop running without a knowledge of their modus operandi. Those who know
    the secret can operate them by manipulating their key plugs. In the same way, the keynote
    of the life-cycle as described by the doctrine of Paticcasamuppada is that tanha is caused
    by vedana, but this is true only if vedana is coupled with two kinds of latent tendencies
    (anusaya) viz., Santananusaya and arammananusaya. The Arahats are free from these
    tendencies and so, although they have feelings, their craving is extinct. This extinction
    of craving leaves no room for new kamma, neutralizes old kamma, and there is no more
    rebirth after their parinibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But ordinary people have potential defilements which means
    not the existence of evil desires lying latent somewhere but only the possibility of their
    arising under certain circumstances. Hence, the Pali term santananusaya kilesa for this
    tendency. This potential kilesa may become greed, hatred, ignorance and other evils in the
    case of those who fail to contemplate the nama-rupas and so become subject to the
    illusions of permanency, happiness and ego-entity. This kilesa which may arise from
    sense-objects in the absence of vipassana insight is called arammananusaya kilesa.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Kilesa And Unmindfulness</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Greed and anger that arise in connection with what one has
    seen or heard are the manifestations of the second kind of latent tendency. The
    impressions that we retain are those of permanent, lovely or repulsive beings or things.
    So recall of those images gives rise to attachment (lobha), anger (dosa) or illusion of
    permanency (moha).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lobha is another synonym for tanha. It is due to pleasant
    feeling but it may also arise when unpleasant feeling makes us crave for pleasant
    sensations. Ignorance, too, leads to complacency, attachment and craving. Thus lobha, dosa
    and moha give rise to feeling which in turn causes craving with its attendant sufferings
    of samsaric existence. It is only the practice in bare awareness of seeing, hearing, etc.,
    that rules out the possibility of craving and nostalgia for the pleasant sensations from
    the senses. Without this practice, craving dominates us and leads to suffering in
    afterlife as well as here and now.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Mora jataka, the bodhisatta who was then a peacock
    used to utter a gatha when he arose in the morning and when he went to sleep in the
    evening. So for 700 years he escaped the trap set by a hunter. Then the hunter employed a
    peahen as a decoy and enticed by her, the peacock forgot to recite the gatha and fell into
    the trap. In Benares, there was a harpist called Guttila. He made love to a girl but he
    was ridiculed and rejected. So at night he sang a very sweet song and played his harp in
    front of the girl's house. Fascinated by the music, the girl rushed out blindly, stumbled
    and fell to her death. In the Mora jataka it was the female voice, and here it was the
    male voice that brought about suffering and death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">No one can deny that what we hear is impermanent.
    Everything that we hear vanishes instantly, yet we enjoy songs and music because of their
    apparent continuity. If we note every sound, &quot;hearing, hearing&quot; mentally, our
    realization of their impermanence makes it impossible for our pleasant feelings to become
    cravings. This means non-arising of upadana and all its resultant suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Smell is seldom experienced by the yogi. He must, of
    course, note it and see that it does not give rise to craving. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness is especially important in eating. The
    unmindful person delights in eating good food. He is fond of such pleasure; he craves for
    it in future and hereafter. This craving for good food and drinks is powerful. It may lead
    to an existence that makes a person subsist on bad food. Thus, according to the
    Balapandita sutta, those who do misdeeds for the pleasure of good food are reborn as
    animals that eat grass, leaves or human excreta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Eating bad food also tends to create the desire for good
    food. Therefore, it is necessary for the yogi to note everything, every movement of his
    hand and mouth and every sensation when he is eating. Through this practice of mindfulness
    he becomes aware of the vanishing of his actions, sensations and feeling. In this way he
    gains an insight into impermanence of everything, an insight that leads to the extinction
    of craving and its attendant suffering.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Thoughts And Tactile Impressions </font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tactile impression is always present all over the physical
    body. Thinking, too, is also present all the time except when the yogi goes to sleep. So
    thoughts and tactile impressions form the objects of vipassana practice for most of the
    time. The yogi contemplates the tactile impressions when he has nothing else to engage his
    attention.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He notes his thoughts even though they happen to be
    unpleasant and undesirable. The beginner in meditation is often subject to such
    distractions, but they usually disappear as he gains practice and develops concentration.
    Thoughts about the Dhamma occur to some yogis from time to time and these should be noted.
    Introspection of these thoughts also ensures insight into impermanence and the extinction
    of suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, some may wonder what this description of vipassana
    practice has to do with the discourse on Paticcasamuppada. The doctrine points out the
    chain of consequences as conditioned by their respective causes and our object is to show
    the way to the end of samsaric suffering that finally results from the interplay of their
    causes and consequences. So we have to describe the practice wherever it is relevant.
    Thus, when it is said that &quot;avijja leads to sankhara and sankhara to rebirth&quot;,
    we have to show the way to remove avijja. So also in connection with vinnana, etc., that
    finally bring about dukkha, it is necessary to stress the need for removing the link
    between vedana and tanha, that is the main cause of dukkha.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Three Kinds Of Craving (Tanha)</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If feeling (vedana) that arises from contact with
    sense-objects is not rightly contemplated, it leads to one of the three kinds of craving
    viz., craving for sensual pleasure, craving for existence and craving for non-existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first kind of craving (kamatanha) is focused on
    sensual objects and it is most prevalent among the living beings of the sensual world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The craving for existence (bhavatanha) is bound up with
    the eternity-belief (sassata-ditthi). It presupposes the permanence of a living being and
    the indestructibility of the ego despite the dissolution of the physical body. The belief
    is not deep-rooted among the Buddhists, but non-Buddhists hold it so firmly that it is a
    major impediment to their spiritual liberation. Their craving for existence is evident in
    their illusion of permanent self and their love of sensual pleasure.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The craving for non-existence (vibhavatanha) is born of
    the annihilation belief (uccheda-ditthi). The belief is not found among Buddhists and no
    one is a true Buddhist if he or she holds the belief. The craving for non-existence means
    the desire for the automatic cessation of the life-stream after death as well as the love
    of pleasure rooted in the materialistic view of life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each of these three cravings stems from the failure to
    realize anicca, dukkha and anatta through the introspection of feelings. So in order to
    forestall craving and its consequences, namely, rebirth and suffering, the yogi should
    contemplate every phenomenon, and try to see everything as it really is.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Tanha Causes Upadana</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From craving there arises clinging (upadana). The Pali
    term upadana is a compound of //upa// - intense, extreme, and //adana// - grasp, take, and
    so it means to grasp firmly, or intense, obsessive craving. Clinging is of four kinds: (1)
    clinging to sensuous objects, (2) clinging to false views, (3) clinging to irrelevant,
    non-Ariyan practices as the way to salvation, and (4) clinging to atta or ego-belief.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) Clinging to sensual objects:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sensual objects excite the desire of all living beings who
    are not free from the craving for sensual pleasure. These objects are five in number viz.,
    visual form, sound, odour, taste and contact.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visual form is the object that is pleasant and attractive
    to the eye. It may possess natural beauty or it may appear to be beautiful in the eyes of
    the viewer. Pleasant visual form, whether real or apparent, is to be found in men, women
    and consumer goods. It is the physical appearance of females that attracts the males and
    vice-versa. The things that both men and women desire are clothes, jewellery, cars, etc.
    It is not merely the form or colour that excites desire. Man and woman are drawn towards
    each other not only by the complexion but by the whole body of the opposite sex, and the
    same may be said of consumer goods that make people greedy. Form or colour only serves to
    introduce or identify the object of desire just as the cry of an animal helps the hunter
    to track and find it out.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sound as the object of sensual pleasure is represented by
    the voices of men and women, songs or music. Some sounds and voices are really sweet while
    some only appear to be sweet in our ears. Again, it is not the mere sound that attracts us
    for when we delight in hearing a sound or a voice, the whole thing or the being that
    produces it forms the focus of our attachment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Odour as the source of sensual pleasure comprises all
    kinds of scents: scent of flavours, powder, fragrant essence. Men and women apply these
    odoriferous substances to their bodies and delight in these scents, and it is not the
    scents alone but the whole physical body giving out the scent that attracts people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sensual pleasure that we have by eating or drinking is
    rooted in food and drinks. The good or pleasant taste may be real or apparent. For pigs,
    dogs and other animals, garbage, refuse and filth may be a source of sensual pleasure.
    Some people are very fond of bitter or spicy food. Some like intoxicants. Their pleasure
    is more apparent than real since normal ordinary people do not share their tastes. The
    pleasure of eating is not confined to food; it centres also on the preparation of food and
    the man or woman who prepares it. This is evident in the pleasure of a man who enjoys
    eating the food prepared by his wife although her culinary skill may not impress other
    people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another source of sensual pleasure is the body or tactile
    impression. Soft and smooth beds, comfortable clothing, something warm in cold season and
    something cold in hot season, the body of the opposite sex - all these form the objects of
    contact that create not only the craving for the tactile impression but also the craving
    for the whole body of the living or non-living object. The tactile impression only serves
    to pave the way for attachment to the whole body.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Bases Of Sensual Pleasure</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then there are living and non-living objects that form the
    sources of sensual pleasure. There are gold, silver, jewellery, rice, cattle, poultry,
    vehicles, houses, land, attendants. Men work daily to secure these sources of pleasure.
    They seek these things to have good food, good clothes and good houses, to see movies and
    so forth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sensual desire (tanha) usually leads to intense craving
    for sensual objects (kamapadana). When a man starts smoking, he delights in his new habit
    but as the habit grows upon him he becomes addicted to it. Thus, we become excessively
    fond of certain objects and we feel restless and discomfited if we do not get them. In
    this way tanha develops into upadana (clinging, grasping or infatuation).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Upadana cannot come into being without tanha. The music
    and songs of foreigners do not appeal to Burmese ears and so there is no craze for them
    among the people. Burmese people do not eat dogs. Dog's flesh is abhorrent to them and so
    there can be no upadana in regard to it.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">(2) Ditthupadana (Bigotry)</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another kind of upadana is ditthupadana which means
    clinging to false views. It covers all the false views, exclusive of those in the
    categories of the third and fourth upadana. So every false belief is to be regarded as
    upadana. Here we will describe at length ten false views that have a firm grip on the
    people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first view is that alms-giving is not a good kammic
    act, that it means only a waste of money. This view rejects the sense of values and the
    fruits of a good act. It has, however, no basis in fact. The act of dana makes the donor
    joyful. It benefits the recipient physically and mentally and it may even help to save the
    life of a starving man. The donor is popular and highly esteemed. After his death, he
    attains the deva-world. It is hard to convince the sceptic of this post-mortem reward, but
    these other-worldly results of kamma come within the purview of Arahats and other holy men
    with psychic powers. One of these powers is the ability to see with the divine eye
    (dibbacakkhu). This psychic power enables one to see donors prospering in deva-worlds or
    evil-doing non-donors suffering in the lower worlds. Such vision can be had even by some
    yogis who have not acquired psychic powers but developed much samadhi. Again some may
    dismiss these visions as figments of imagination but the agreement of these accounts about
    the other worlds lends weight to their credibility.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second false view is also a negation of the kammic
    benefits for alms-giving on a grand scale.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third false view rejects the kammic benefits of
    feeding guests, giving gifts on new year day and so forth. This view is essentially the
    same as the third view. It refers to small acts of dana that were in vogue in ancient
    India but were dismissed as futile by heretics.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth view denies the kammic result of any morally
    good or evil act. There is a lot of evidence for the kammic effects of a man's acts in
    this life, and, as for the other-worldly result of an act, those with psychic power can
    testify to it. But people who are excessively fond of sensual pleasure like to give free
    rein to their desires. They frown on moral values and ideas which they regard as a
    hindrance to their material progress. So they put forward many arguments to justify their
    rejection of the kammic law. In the final analysis all this is due to their excessive love
    of sensual pleasure.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fifth and sixth view deny any respect, honour or
    support that we owe to our parents for all their loving care in our childhood. It is said
    that a man and his wife get children through sexual intercourse by accident, that they
    bring up the children from a sense of responsibility, and so there is no reason why
    children should be grateful to their parents. So it is not a good deed on the part of a
    man to look after his parents nor is it an evil to wrong them. It is a terrible view;
    those who hold it will not be respected by their children.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The seventh view denies the existence of any world other
    than the human and the animal worlds. It also rejects the belief that an animal may be
    reborn as a human being.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The eighth view denies rebirth of a human being in deva or
    animal worlds or in hell. It preaches annihilation of life after death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ninth view denies rebirth by //opapatika// or
    spontaneous generation. In other words, it denies the existence of devas, brahmas, petas,
    asuras, etc., who appear with their full-fledged bodies without being conceived in the
    womb. This view is untenable since encounters with good or evil spirits are reported from
    all over the world; there are mediums and witch-doctors who can invoke spirits; and devas,
    Brahmas, etc., are sometimes visible to the yogis who practise vipassana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last view is that there is no ascetic or Brahman who
    speaks of this world and the other invisible world and who conforms to his teaching. The
    view implies that there is no person who can speak independently of this world and the
    other world on the basis of his actual extraordinary experience, that all their teaching
    is guesswork and speculation, and so false and evil.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today this view is echoed by those who scoff at religion.
    They reject the existence of Buddhas and Arahats who know the world as it really is
    through their own effort. But the logic underlying this view is self-defeating for by the
    same kind of reasoning, one can reject the view since those who hold it also do not know
    anything about this or the other world really.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for the Buddha-dhamma, it rests on extraordinary
    insight (Sayain abhinna desita). As such it leads itself to empirical investigation and
    there is much scientific evidence for it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The man who preached the Indian brand of agnosticism in
    the time of the Buddha was Ajita. He attacked all religious teaching without qualification
    and so it is to be assumed that the arahats and the Buddha, too, were the targets of his
    denunciation.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Right Views</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All these ten wrong views boil down to the denial of the
    law of kamma for the rejection of kamma means rejection of any benefit accruing from the
    acts of dana and reference to parents, and other good deeds, as well as the kammic
    potential for arahatship or Buddhahood. Likewise, the ten right views mentioned below are
    based on the belief in kamma, or moral retribution.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) The first view is that dana is beneficial. One who
    gives alms is admired at least by the recipients. They will respect him, praise him and
    help him when he is in trouble. He dies calmly with good death-bed visions and after his
    death he attains good rebirth in deva-worlds or in human society. His good rebirth may
    finally lead to the Ariyan path and Nibbana. It was usually with an act of dana that the
    bodhisatta, and others embarked on their long spiritual journey leading to the goal of
    Buddhahood, paccekabuddhahood or arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The kammic effect of alms-giving is also evident in the
    material prosperity of some people. Some people do the same job such as business, farming,
    etc., but differ in their accomplishments. Some become prosperous while others make no
    progress materially. Some meet with success without working hard while others fail to
    prosper despite their hard work. Other things being equal, this disparity in the fortunes
    of some persons is no doubt due to dana or lack of dana in a previous life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) and (3) The man who believes in the law of kamma will
    have no doubt about the kammic potency of giving alms lavishly or the small acts of dana
    such as feeding the guests, giving presents and so forth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(4) These three right views are implicit in the law of
    kamma or moral retribution. That a man fares according to his good or bad deeds is an
    undeniable fact of life. A man who leads a good life in accordance with the instruction of
    his parents and teachers is popular, gets help from others and achieves success, and when
    he grows up he becomes a prosperous gentleman. Similarly, because of good kamma in a
    previous life a man may be born of a good family and blessed with health, wealth, physical
    beauty and sincere friends. The bad effect of evil kamma such as ill-health, poverty,
    ugliness, etc., are equally well-known to everybody.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(5) and (6) The belief in kamma also implies a recognition
    of our deep gratitude to parents. Parents take care of their children from the time of
    their conception. The mother is especially careful about her health, her food, and
    movements for the sake of the child in her womb. If she is a good Buddhist, she keeps
    sabbath and contemplates the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha in the hope of influencing her
    child spiritually. After the birth of the child, the parents have to attend to his
    physical needs and educate him, and when he comes of age they have to give him financial
    support for a start in life. For these reasons, it is our bounden duty to revere and care
    for our parents; and this is a kammic act that benefits us immensely. At the very least, a
    man who respects his parents will be respected by his children while a man who wrongs his
    parents is very likely to be disdained by his children.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing The World Beyond</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(7), (8) and (9) The right views about the existence of
    this world, the invisible world and the living beings such as the devas who come into
    existence by spontaneous materialization. These right views are also implicit in the
    belief in the law of kamma for the law of kamma makes it possible for a living being from
    the animal or deva world to pass on to human world or vice-versa according to his kamma
    after death. This can be demonstrated to a certain extent but the observer will have to
    possess psychic powers, vipassana insight or the ability to think rationally.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through the practice of samathajhana, a yogi can acquire
    the power of recalling the past lives; he can have the divine-eye (dibbacakkhu) that
    affords him a glimpse into the physical appearance, etc., of a person who has passed on to
    a new existence. This psychic power is also accessible to those who practise vipassana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who cannot practise samatha or vipassana will have
    to depend on their power of reasoning. There are certain persons here and there who can
    recall their previous lives, people who are credited with jatissaranana in Buddhist
    literature. They describe their past lives as human beings, animals, spirits or ghosts. To
    the rational mind, these accounts clearly point to the post-mortem transition from this
    world to the other world and vice-versa as well as to the instant materialization of
    certain beings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here we wish to mention the way of thinking on the issue
    of a future life suggested by wise men. Suppose a man accepts the belief in kamma and life
    after death while another man rejects the belief. The second man will not do good deeds
    such as dana, sila and he will not avoid doing evil. He will give free rein to his
    desires. Therefore, he has no virtue that is worthy of respect and admiration by other
    people. If contrary to his belief, the law of kamma and a future life are real, he is
    bound to land in the lower worlds immediately after his death and suffer for many
    lifetimes throughout his samsaric existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, the man who believes in kamma and
    after-life will avoid evil, do good and so, even if there is no kamma or a future life, he
    will be extolled and well-known for his good character. He will rejoice at the
    contemplation of his good deeds. As a good citizen, he will lead a peaceful life. These
    are the benefits that will certainly accrue to him from his belief in kamma in the present
    life. And if life after death is indeed a fact, he is assured of happiness hereafter. So
    it is reasonable to accept the belief in after-life since it serves our interests now or
    in future in any event. This is the infallible way of thinking that the Buddha recommends
    in Apannaka sutta of Majjhima nikaya.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Parami And Kamma</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(10) Faith in the Buddha, the Arahats or holy men who can
    claim transcendent knowledge about this and the other worlds and who possess a noble
    character that lends credence to their teachings - such faith also presupposes the belief
    in kamma, for the spiritual attainment of Arahats and the Buddha rests in part on their
    parami (perfection) which does not differ essentially from kamma. Development of parami is
    a kind of learning. Just as a child has to learn many things in order to become
    well-educated, so also a bodhisatta has to seek knowledge and train himself for the
    attainment of his goal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some parents and elders take their children to movies and
    theatres while others take theirs to pagodas and monasteries. In this way the children
    acquire good or bad habits and develop a craving for sensual pleasure or a taste for the
    higher things of life. Good habits and good training may be called a kind of parami. Some
    children are spontaneously inclined to religious life, some men and women have immense
    zeal and energy for the practice of vipassana. Such a child's unusual interest in religion
    or a man's unusual love of spiritual life is born of the parami in a previous life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Prince Siddhattha became the Buddha through the gradual
    development and perfection of parami such as dana, sila, nekkhama (renunciation) and so
    forth over aeons spanning innumerable lifetimes. It was not a matter of easy
    accomplishment in a single existence. It was this cumulative kammic potential or parami
    that helped to strengthen his will when he left his family and the luxuries of his royal
    palace in search of enlightenment. Today, some people speak of their disillusionment with
    life but it is hard for a man to renounce all his wealth and become a monk, let alone to
    think of the kind of renunciation that distinguished the bodhisatta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bodhisatta cultivated other paramis, too, for the sake
    of wisdom, at energy fortitude and so forth in way of his previous lives. As a result in
    his last existence he reflected and realized independently the nature of life, its
    dependent origination, etc. It was his kammic potential (parami) that finally led to his
    supreme enlightenment and likewise it was the parami that contributed to the spiritual
    attainments of Paccekabuddhas and Arahats. Hence, the belief in kamma makes it possible
    for the spiritual aspirant to become the arahat, Paccekabuddha or the Buddha and one who
    accepts the belief has no doubt about the transcendent knowledge of the Buddha and other
    holy men.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short, ditthupadana is generally synonymous with
    rejection of the law of kamma. It was not widespread in the time of the Buddha or even
    about a hundred years ago but now it is gaining ground, thanks to the books that have
    criticized the doctrine of kamma in the name of scientific knowledge. As the scriptures
    say, false beliefs are usually rooted in craving and with man's increasing hunger for
    material goods, scepticism about kamma is likely to become dominant and it is up to good
    people to guard themselves against it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Apart from the rejection of kamma, ditthupadana also means
    strong attachment to all false beliefs e.g. ego-belief, annihilation-belief, etc. The
    exceptions are the two false beliefs covered by silabbatupadana and attavadupadana.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">(3) Silabbatupadana (Clinging To False Practices)</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Silabbatupadana is clinging to wrong practices that do not
    lead to cessation of suffering. It is the view which identifies the habits of cows, dogs
    and other animals with the way to the end of dukkha. It found expression among some
    ascetics in the time of the Buddha. Like animals, they lived naked, ate, defecated and
    went about on all fours, and slept on the ground. They believed that such a way of life
    served to purge them of all evil kamma and forestall new kammic action, thereby assuring
    them of an end to suffering and eternal bliss after death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To a Buddhist, this kind of belief may sound incredible
    but some people's preferences are very odd and they differ in their views and
    inclinations. So there came to the Buddha two ascetics, one Punna who lived like an ox and
    another Seniya who lived like a dog. They asked the Lord about the benefits of their
    practice. The Lord was reluctant to answer but when pressed for his view, he replied that
    an ascetic who committed himself wholly to the habits of an ox or a dog would be reborn as
    an ox or a dog after death; that it was wrong to believe that such practices led to the
    deva-world; and that one who held a wrong belief was likely to land in hell or in the
    animal world. Then the Buddha went on to describe (1) the evil practices that bear evil
    fruits, (2) the good practices that bear good fruits, (3) the evil practices mixed with
    good practices and (4) the practice of the Ariyan path that leads to the total extinction
    of good and bad kammas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On hearing this sermon Punna became the disciple of the
    Buddha. Seniya joined the order and attained Arahatship through the practice of the
    Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">The Story Of Korakhattiya</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the time of the Buddha there was a man named
    Korakhattiya who lived like a dog. One day the Buddha passed by him, accompanied by a
    Licchavi bhikkhu, Sunakkhatta by name.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sunakkhatta saw the ascetic moving on all fours and eating
    the food on the ground without the help of his hands. The ascetic's way of life gave the
    monk the impression of a holy man, nay, an Arahat who had few desires. In point of fact,
    the ascetic's mode of life was a kind of silabbatupadana that would lead him to one of the
    four lower worlds. It was abhorrent to those who had high ideals and aspirations. It had
    appeal for Sunakkhatta only because of his low tastes and desires. The Licchavi monk was
    exceptional in this respect. There were then not as now many people who preferred false
    views and false practices that did not accord with the Buddha's teaching. This was
    probably a hangover from wrong attachments in their previous lives.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha divined Sunakkhatta's thoughts and said,
    &quot;So you regard that ascetic as an Arahat! I wonder why you do not feel ashamed of
    being called the disciple of the Buddha.&quot; The monk then accused the Lord of envying
    the ascetic's Arahatship. This is of course the kind of retort that is to be expected from
    an ignorant man when someone speaks the truth about his false teacher. The Buddha
    explained that his object was to remove the monk's illusions that would do him no good.
    Then he went on to predict that after seven days the ascetic would die of indigestion and
    land in the lowest Asura world; that his body would be dumped in a certain cemetery; that
    if the monk went there and asked about his present abode, the dead body would reveal it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha made this prophecy in order to restore
    Sunakkhatta's faith in him. Through the practice of samatha Sunakkhatta had attained jhana
    and divine eye. With his divine eye he had seen the gods and goddesses and as he wished to
    hear their voices he asked the Buddha about the way to the attainment of divine ear. But
    the Lord declined to fulfil his desire because his bad kamma stood in the way and he would
    blame the Lord for the non-attainment of divine ear. Nevertheless, he lost his faith in
    the Lord because he thought that it was envy that motivated the Lord to refuse his
    request. So the Buddha predicted the ascetic's fate to impress Sunakkhatta and salvage his
    faith.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sunakkhatta informed the ascetic of the Lord's prediction
    and warned him against overeating. The ascetic fasted for six days but on the seventh day
    he could not resist the temptation any longer. He wolfed down the food provided by a lay
    follower and died of indigestion that very night.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His fellow ascetics dragged his dead body to dump it in
    any place other than the cemetery specified in the Buddha's prediction. They got to a
    cemetery but found it to be the very place they wished to avoid for it had the kind of
    grass predicted by the Buddha. They tried to drag the body away but the creeper-rope
    snapped and all their efforts to remove it were in vain. So they had to abandon the corpse
    there.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sunakkhatta heard the news but still he hoped to prove the
    falsity of the latter part of the Lord's prediction. He went to the cemetery and rapping
    the dead man asked about his abode. The corpse arose and after saying that he was in
    Kalakamjika asura abode fell back on the ground. Kalakamjika is the lowest asura abode.
    Asura is a kind of peta with a monstrous body and a mouth which is so small that it cannot
    drink and eat well.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the commentary, it was the Buddha's psychic
    power that made the dead body possessed by the asura peta. Given the ability of some
    sorcerers to raise the dead, there is no need to have any doubt about the resurrection of
    the dead ascetic through the psychic power (iddhi) of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sunakkhatta came back crestfallen and had to admit that
    the Lord's prophecy had come wholly true. Even so, he did not have complete faith in the
    Buddha. Later on he left the holy order and disparaged the Lord.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Other Silabbata Practices</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Besides the mode of life of cows and dogs there are other
    practices that can be described as silabbata. Some people emulate the elephants, horses,
    and so forth. In other words, they worship animals. The commentary refers to
    king-worshippers which may mean in Burma people who worship various nats. Nat-worship
    among Burmese people is not motivated by the desire for liberation from samsara (life
    cycle). It stems from the hope for material benefits here and now and as such it does not
    fall within the scope of silabbatupadana, but it is upadana over the belief that leads
    some people to make animal sacrifice in their worship of the nats.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are also fire-worship, naga-worship, moon-worship,
    sun-worship, spirit-worship and so forth. If the object in any kind of worship is to have
    happiness or spiritual liberation after death, it is silabbatupadana. In short, all
    practices divorced from the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path are labelled
    silabbata and attachment to them as the way to salvation is silabbatupadana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The yogi who has attained at least the sotapanna stage
    through the contemplation of nama-rupa is well aware of the right path to Nibbana and so
    he has freed himself from the belief in silabbata. He knows empirically that the way to
    the end of suffering is only through the introspection of nama-rupa and the practice of
    the Noble Eightfold Path.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, if you know from experience how to go from
    this meditation centre to Shwedagon pagoda, you will not be misled by anyone who points
    out the wrong way. Likewise, the yogi at the sotapanna stage knows the right way to
    Nibbana and so he has no illusion about the beliefs and practices such as belief in God,
    nat worship or asceticism that pass for the way to salvation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who do not know the right path are not free from
    such illusion. They may have acquired it from their ignorant parents, teachers or friends;
    or because of their poor basic knowledge, they might have been misguided by books that
    advocate false beliefs and practices. The ordinary man (puthujjana) is ignorant of the
    right path to Nibbana and so he will have to reckon with many teachers and practices
    through his samsaric existence. If he falls for a false teacher or a false practice, he is
    in for a lot of suffering. Thus the practice of austerities will only cause hardships and
    pain and the performance of animal sacrifice will certainly lead to the lower worlds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is also upadana over silabbata to believe that
    rupajhana or arupajhana means complete salvation. In short, even the moral perfection or
    jhanic attainment in the mundane sphere, though commendable, may lead to silabbatupadana
    if it is divorced from the holy path of vipassana and regarded as the total liberation.
    Udaka sutta of Samyutta nikaya refers to the rishi Udaka, who having attained the arupa
    world through his arupajhana declared that he had uprooted the cause of dukkha and made an
    end of it. This was also the illusion of another rishi called Alara. This illusion or
    upadana led to their good kamma which in turn led to their rebirth in the arupa worlds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So in his discourse to Baka brahma, the Buddha says:
    &quot;I see the dangers of birth, old age, death, etc., inherent in the three worlds of
    sensuality, rupa and arupa. I see those who seek Nibbana still bound to existence. So I do
    not approve of any kind of existence. I have repudiated all attachment to existence.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Like the two rishis, those who do not know the Buddha's
    teaching never attain their goal. Although they seek permanent happiness, they follow the
    wrong path of silabbata and remain entangled in the samsaric existence of dukkha. So we
    can hardly over-emphasize the importance of right effort on the right path as pointed out
    by the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">(4) Attavadupadana (Clinging To Belief In Soul)</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Attavadupadana is a compound of attavada and upadana.
    Attavada means belief in soul entity and attavadupadana is attachment to the view that
    every person is a living soul.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Attachment to the ego-belief is of two kinds, viz.,
    ordinary attachment and deep-rooted attachment. Ordinary attachment that prevails among
    ignorant Buddhists is not harmful to progress on the holy path. The belief is not deeply
    entrenched because Buddhists accept the Buddha's teaching which denies the permanent soul
    and recognizes nama-rupa as the only reality behind a living being. Intelligent Buddhists
    are still less vulnerable to the belief. For they know that seeing, hearing, etc., involve
    only the sense-organs (eye, ear, etc.), the corresponding sense-objects (visual form,
    sound, etc.) and the corresponding states of consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But most people are not wholly free from the ego-belief.
    Even the yogi who practises vipassana may at times fall for it and it is likely to attract
    every man who has not attained the holy path.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In fact those who taught ego-belief described the ego as
    the owner of the five khandhas, as an independent entity, possessing free-will and
    self-determination. It was this view of atta (soul) that the Buddha questioned in his
    dialogue with the wandering ascetic Saccaka. Said the Buddha, &quot;You say that this
    physical body is your atta. Then can you always keep it well, free from anything
    unpleasant?&quot; Saccaka had to answer in the negative. Further questioning by the Lord
    elicited from him the reply that he had in fact no control over any of the five khandhas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the ancient Buddhist teachers translate &quot;rupam
    anatta&quot; as &quot;the physical body is subject to no control&quot;, etc. In fact it is
    the denial of the &quot;samiatta&quot; or the false view of atta as a controlling entity.
    Every ordinary person holds this view and believes in free-will. He can overcome it
    completely only through vipassana contemplation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The attavada teachers also say that atta exists
    permanently in the physical body. In other words, it means the personal identity that is
    said to persist through the whole existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again, they say that atta is the subject of all actions,
    thus identifying it with sankharakkhandha. It is the illusion that creates the belief:
    &quot;It is I that see, hear, etc.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">They also say that atta is the living entity that feels;
    that it is atta that is happy or unhappy. In other words, they describe atta or soul in
    terms of vedana or feeling.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, although the Atmanists (attavadi) insist that atta
    has nothing to do with the five khandhas, they credit it with ownership of the body, etc.,
    permanent residence in the body, subjectivity and feeling: and, hence, in effect they
    identify it with the five khandhas. The ego-illusion is rooted in the khandhas and a man
    can free himself completely from it only when he becomes aware of the real nature of
    khandhas through contemplation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the four upadana, the first upadana (clinging to
    sensuality) is the developed form of craving (tanha). The other three upadanas differ only
    as regards their objects; basically they all relate to beliefs, viz., belief in ego,
    belief in the efficacy of practices other than those of the Eightfold Path, and any false
    belief other than those in the category of the other two upadana. All false beliefs arise
    in connection with craving. Men cling to a belief because they like it. Thus there is no
    doubt that all the four upadanas stem from craving and hence the Buddha's teaching:
    &quot;From tanha there arises upadana.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In point of fact, craving is the cause and clinging is the
    effect. Craving for sensual pleasure, ego-belief, or practices irrelevant to the holy path
    or other false beliefs is the cause, and this craving develops into clinging to
    sensuality, ego-belief, etc., and thus becomes effects.</font></p>
