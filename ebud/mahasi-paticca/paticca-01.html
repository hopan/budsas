    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Importance Of The Doctrine</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The doctrine of Paticcasamuppada or Dependent Origination
    is very important in Buddhism. The bodhisatta began with dependent origination when he
    reflected deeply on the nature of existence and attained Enlightenment. He first pondered
    old age and death as did every other bodhisatta when he was about to become the Buddha in
    his last existence. For it was only after seeing the old, the sick and the dead that the
    bodhisatta saw the ascetic (//samana//) and renounced the world in search of the ageless
    and the deathless Dhamma. He had seen the evils of life in old age, sickness and death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every living being wants to avoid these evils of life but
    there is no end to these evils which follow him in one existence after another. In view of
    this endless process of life, all living beings appear to be in bondage and subject to
    suffering. Life is in fact an infinite process of births and deaths. The fate of fowls and
    ducks is terrible indeed. Some are eaten up while still in the eggs. If they emerge from
    the eggs they do not live long but are killed when they grow up a little. They are born
    only to be killed for human consumption. If the fate of a living being is thus to be
    repeatedly killed it is gloomy and frightful indeed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the fowls and ducks appear to be well content with
    their lot in life. They apparently enjoy life, quacking, crowing, eating and fighting with
    one another. They may think that they have a lot of time to live although in fact they
    have little time to be happy, their life being a matter of days or months, with each of
    them coming into existence and then dying after a short time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The span of human life, too, is not very long for the man
    in his fifties or sixties the past seems in retrospect as recent as yesterday. Sixty or
    seventy years on earth is a day in the life of a deva which is, however, very short in the
    eyes of a Brahma who may live as long as the duration of the worlds (//kappa//). But even
    the Brahma who outlives hundreds of worlds is insignificant and his life is short in the
    context of samsaric eternity. Devas and Brahmas, too, have to age and die eventually.
    Although they are not subject to sickness and marked dotage, age tells on them invisibly
    in due course of time. So every living being has to face old age and death and nobody can
    escape from these evils of life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Reflection Of The Bodhisatta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Reflecting on the origin of old age, the bodhisatta traced
    back the chain of dependent origination from the end to the beginning. Old age and death
    have their origin in rebirth which in turn is due to //kammabhava// (condition or kamma
    for renewed existence). Kammabhava stems from grasping or attachment (upadana) which is
    caused by craving (tanha). Craving arises from feeling (vedana) which is produced by
    sense-bases (ayatana) such as eye, visual form, etc. Sense-bases are the product of
    nama-rupa (consciousness and corporeality) which results from //vinnana// (consciousness)
    which is again caused by //nama-rupa//.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The full Pali texts about Paticcasamuppada attribute
    vinnana to sankhara (kamma-formations) and sankhara to avijja (ignorance). But the
    bodhisatta's reflection is confined to the interdependence of //nama-rupa// and vinnana in
    the present life. In other words, he reflected on the correlation between vinnana and
    nama-rupa, leaving out of account the former's relation to past existence. We may assume,
    therefore, that for the yogis, reflection on the present life will suffice to ensure the
    successful practice of vipassana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Anuloma Reasoning</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bodhisatta reasoned about the correlation between
    vinnana and nama-rupa thus: This vinnana has no cause other than nama-rupa. From nama-rupa
    there results vinnana; from vinnana there arises nama-rupa. Hence, from the correlation
    between vinnana and nama-rupa there arises birth, old age and death; there may be
    successive births or successive deaths.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover vinnana causes nama-rupa; nama-rupa causes
    sense-bases (ayatana). From sense-bases there arises contact; contact leads to feeling;
    feeling gives rise to craving; craving to grasping; and grasping results in rebirth which
    in turn leads to old age, death, anxiety, grief and other kinds of mental and physical
    sufferings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the bodhisatta reflected on dependent origination
    negatively. If there were no vinnana there could be no nama-rupa; if no nama-rupa, then no
    ayatana and so on. The negation of the first link in the chain of causation leads to the
    extinction of suffering that has beset us</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">ceaselessly in the infinite series of samsaric existences.
    After this reflection on dependent origination in its positive and negative aspects, the
    bodhisatta contemplated the nature of the aggregates of grasping. Then he attained the
    successive insights and fruitions (magga-phala) on the Ariyan holy path and finally became
    the all-Enlightened Buddha. Every bodhisatta attained supreme Enlightenment after such
    contemplation. They did not learn what and how to contemplate from others but owing to
    cumulative potential (parami) that they had acquired through innumerable lifetimes, they
    contemplated as mentioned before and attained Enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Beyond Reasoning And Speculation</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then when it was time to preach, the Buddha thought thus:
    This dhamma which I know is very profound. It is hard to understand; it is so sublime and
    so conducive to inner peace. It is not accessible to intellect and logic (atakkavacaro).
    It is subtle and it is to be realized only by the wise.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All over the world, philosophers have racked their brains
    about freedom from old age, sickness and death. But freedom from these evils means Nibbana
    and Nibbana is beyond the reach of reason and intellect. It is to be realized only through
    the practice of the middle way and vipassana. Most philosophers rely on intellect and
    logic, and there are various doctrines which they have conceived for the welfare of all
    living beings. But these doctrines are based on speculations that do not help anyone to
    attain vipassana insight, let alone the supreme goal of Nibbana. Even the lowest stage of
    vipassana insight, viz., insight into the distinction between nama and rupa does not admit
    any intellectual approach. The insight dawns on the yogi only when, with the development
    of concentration, and in accordance with Satipatthana method he watches the nama-rupa
    process and distinguishes between consciousness and corporeality, e.g. the desire to bend
    the hand and bent hand, the ear and the sound on the one hand and the consciousness of
    hearing on the other and so forth. Such knowledge is not vague and speculative; it is
    vivid and empirical.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is said on the authority of scriptures that nama-rupas
    are in a constant flux and that we should watch their arising and passing away. But for
    the beginner this is easier said than done. The beginner has to exert strenuous effort to
    overcome hindrances (nivarana). Even freedom from nivarana helps him only to distinguish
    between nama and rupa. It does not ensure insight into their arising and passing away.
    This insight is attained only after concentration has been developed and perception has
    become keen with the practice of mindfulness. Constant mindfulness of arising and
    vanishing leads to insight into anicca, dukkha and anatta of all phenomena. But as merely
    the beginning of lower vipassana, this insight is a far cry from the path and its
    fruition. Hence the description of the dhamma as something beyond logic and speculation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Dhamma Is Only For The Wise</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The dhamma is subtle (nipuno); it is to be realized only
    by the wise (panditavedaniyo). Here the wise means only those who have wisdom (panna)
    relating to vipassana and the path and its goal. The dhamma has nothing to do with the
    secular knowledge //per se// possessed by world philosophers, religious founders, writers
    or great scientists who can split atoms. But it can be realized by any one irrespective of
    sex, age or education; anyone who contemplates nama-rupa at the moment of their arising,
    passes through vipassana insights progressively and attains the Ariyan path and its goal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Taking stock of the nature of all living beings, the
    Buddha found that most of them were mired in sensual pleasure. There were of course a few
    exceptions like the five companions of Siddhattha in the forest retreat or the two
    brahmins who were later to become the two chief disciples of the Buddha. But the majority
    of mankind regard the enjoyment of pleasure as the summum bonum of life. They are like
    children who delight in playing with their toys the whole day. The child's toys and games
    make no sense to adults but grown-up people too derive pleasure from the toys of the
    sensual world, that is, from the company of their children and grand-children. Such
    sensual pleasure has no appeal for Buddhas and Arahats. It is highly esteemed by ordinary
    men and devas because they have no sense of higher values such as jhana, vipassana and
    Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A person who is thus fond of sensual pleasure may be
    likened to a peasant living in out-of-the-way rural areas. To the urbanites those places
    are wholly devoid of the amenities of life, what with poor food, poor clothes, dirty
    dwellings, muddy footpaths and so forth. But the villagers are happy and they never think
    of leaving their native place. Likewise, common people and devas delight in their sensual
    objects. Whatever the teaching of the Buddha and the Arahats, they love pleasure and spend
    all their time indulging in it. They feel ill at ease in the absence of sensual objects.
    They are so much pleased with their families, attendants and possessions that they cannot
    think of anything higher than sensual pleasure. Because of their deep rooted love of
    pleasure, it is hard for them to understand or appreciate the subtle, profound
    Paticcasamuppada and Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Difficulty Of Understanding</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha-dhamma makes little appeal to the masses since
    it is diametrically opposed to their sensual desire. People do not like even an ordinary
    sermon, let alone a discourse on Nibbana, if it has no sensual touch. They do not seem
    interested in our teaching and no wonder, since it is devoid of melodious recitation,
    sentimental stories, hilarious jokes and other attractions. It is acceptable only to those
    who have practised //vipassana// or who seek the dhamma on which they can rely for methods
    of meditation and extinction of defilements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But it is a mistake to deprecate, as some do, the sermons
    containing stories, jokes, etc., as sutta sermons. Suttas differ basically from popular
    sermons in that they are profound, as witness Anattalakkhana sutta, Satipatthana sutta and
    so forth. The doctrine of Dependent Origination too belongs to Sutta Pitaka. It is to be
    labelled Abhidhamma only because it is preached in the fashion of Abhidhamma Pitaka.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since our teaching is unadulterated dhamma, some people
    confuse it with Abhidhamma and cannot follow it, much less grasp the Path and Nibbana
    which it emphasizes. Paticcasamuppada is hard to understand because it concerns the
    correlations between causes and effects. There is no ego entity that exists independently
    of the law of causation. It was hard to accept this fact before the Buddha proclaimed the
    dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The commentaries also point out the abstruse character of
    the doctrine. According to them there are four dhammas which defy understanding, viz., the
    four noble truths, the nature of a living being, the nature of rebirth and dependent
    origination.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is hard to understand and accept the truth of
    suffering, the truth about its cause, the truth about its cessation and the truth about
    the way to its extinction. It is hard to appreciate these truths, still harder to teach
    them to other people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Secondly, it is hard to understand that a living being is
    a nama-rupa process without any separate self, that the nama-rupa complex is subject to
    the law of kamma that determines a man's future life according to his good or bad deeds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the third place, it is hard to see how rebirth takes
    place as a result of defilement and kamma without the transfer of nama-rupa from a
    previous life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lastly, it is equally hard to understand Paticcasamuppada.
    It involves the above three abstruse dhammas. Its negative aspect concerns the first two
    noble truths as well as the nature of a living being and rebirth while its positive aspect
    involves the other two truths. Hence, it is most difficult to grasp or teach the doctrine.
    It may be easy to explain it to one who has attained the path and Nibbana or one who has
    studied the Pitaka but it will mean little to one who has neither the illumination nor
    scriptural knowledge.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The writer of the commentary on the doctrine was qualified
    to explain it because he might have attained the lower stages of the path or he might have
    a thorough knowledge of the Pitaka. He refers to its difficulty probably in order that its
    exposition might be seriously studied by posterity. He likens the difficulty to the plight
    of a man who has jumped into the sea and cannot get to the bottom. He admits that he has
    written the exegesis on the basis of the Pitaka and the old commentaries handed down by
    oral tradition. The same may be said of our teaching. Since it is hard to explain the
    doctrine, the yogi should pay special attention to it. If he follows the teaching
    superficially, he will understand nothing and without a fair knowledge of the doctrine, he
    is bound to suffer in the wilderness of samsaric existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The substance of the Paticcasamuppada teaching is as
    follows.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From ignorance there arises sankhara (effort or
    kamma-formation). From kamma-formation there arises consciousness of the new existence.
    Consciousness gives rise to psycho-physical phenomena or nama-rupa. Nama-rupa leads to
    ayatana (six bases). From ayatana arises the phassa (impression). Phassa causes feeling;
    feeling leads to craving. From craving there results clinging (upadana). Because of
    clinging there is the process of becoming (kamma-bhava), from the process of becoming
    there arises rebirth (jati) and rebirth leads to old age, death, sorrow, grief and
    lamentation. Thus arises the whole mass of suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>What is Avijja (Ignorance)?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Buddha, avijja is ignorance of the four
    Noble Truths, viz., the truths about suffering, its cause, its cessation and the way to
    its cessation. In a positive sense avijja implies misconception or illusion. It makes us
    mistake what is false and illusory for truth and reality. It leads us astray and so it is
    labelled //miccha-patipatti-avijja//.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Avijja, therefore, differs from ordinary ignorance.
    Ignorance of the name of a man or a village does not necessarily mean misinformation
    whereas the avijja of Paticcasamuppada means something more than ignorance. It is
    misleading like the ignorance of a man who has lost all sense of direction and who,
    therefore, thinks that the east is west or that the north is south. The man who does not
    know the truth of suffering has an optimistic view of life that is full of dukkha (pain
    and evil).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is a mistake to seek the truth of dukkha in the book
    for it is to be found in one's own body. Seeing, hearing, in short, all nama-rupa arising
    from the six senses are dukkha. For this phenomenal existence is impermanent, undesirable
    and unpleasant. It may end at any time and so all is pain and suffering. But this dukkha
    is not realized by living beings who look upon their existence as blissful and good.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So they seek pleasant sense-objects, good sights, good
    sounds, good food, etc. Their effort to secure what they believe to be the good things of
    life is due to their illusion (avijja) about their existence. Avijja is here like the
    green eye-glass that makes a horse eat the dry grass which it mistakes for green grass.
    Living beings are mired in sensual pleasure because they see every thing through
    rose-coloured glasses. They harbour illusions about the nature of sense-objects and
    nama-rupa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A blind man may be easily deceived by another man who
    offers him a worthless longyi, saying that it is an expensive, high quality longyi. The
    blind man will believe him and he will like the longyi very much. He will be disillusioned
    only when he recovers his sight and then he will throw it away at once. Likewise, as a
    victim of avijja, a man enjoys life, being blind to its anicca, dukkha and anatta. He
    becomes disenchanted when introspection of nama-rupa makes him aware of the unwholesome
    nature of his existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Introspection of nama-rupa or vipassana contemplation has
    nothing to do with bookish knowledge. It means thorough watching and ceaseless
    contemplation of all psycho-physical phenomena that comprise both the sense-objects and
    the corresponding consciousness. The practice leads to full awareness of their nature. As
    concentration develops, the yogi realizes their arising and instant vanishing, thereby
    gaining an insight into their anicca, dukkha and anatta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Avijja makes us blind to reality because we are unmindful.
    Unmindfulness give rise to the illusion of man, woman, hand, leg, etc., in the
    conventional sense of the terms. We do not know that seeing, for instance, is merely the
    nama-rupa or psycho-physical process, that the phenomenon arises and vanishes, that it is
    impermanent, unsatisfactory and unsubstantial.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people who never contemplate die without knowing
    anything about nama-rupa. The real nature of nama-rupa process is realized by the mindful
    person. But the insight does not occur in the beginning when concentration is not yet
    developed. Illusion or the natural way of consciousness precedes contemplation and so the
    beginner does not gain a clear insight into the nature of nama-rupa. It is only through
    steadfast practice that concentration and perception develop and lead to
    insight-knowledge.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If, for example, while practising mindfulness, the yogi
    feels itchy, he is barely aware of being itchy. He does not think of the hand, the leg, or
    any other part of the body that is itchy nor does the idea of self as the subject of
    itchiness, &quot;I feel itchy&quot; occur to him. There arises only the continuous
    sensation of itchiness. The sensation does not remain permanent but passes away as he
    notes it. The watching consciousness promptly notes every psycho-physical phenomenon,
    leaving no room for the illusion of hand, leg and so on.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Illusion dominates the unmindful person and makes him
    blind to the unsatisfactory nature (dukkha) of all sense-objects. It replaces dukkha with
    sukha. Indeed avijja means both ignorance of what is real and mis-conception that distorts
    reality.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because he does not know the truth of dukkha, man seeks
    pleasant sense-objects. Thus ignorance leads to effort and activity (sankhara). According
    to the scriptures, because of avijja there arises sankhara but, there are two links, viz.,
    tanha and upadana between them. Ignorance gives rise to craving (tanha) which later on
    develops into attachment (upadana). Craving and attachment stem from the desire for
    pleasure and are explicitly mentioned in the middle part of the doctrine of
    Paticcasamuppada. When the past is fully described, reference is made to avijja, tanha,
    upadana, kamma and sankhara.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Ignorance Of The Origin Of Dukkha</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People do not know that craving is the origin (samudaya)
    of suffering. On the contrary they believe that it is attachment that makes them happy,
    that without attachment life would be dreary. So they ceaselessly seek pleasant
    sense-objects, food, clothing, companions and so forth. In the absence of these objects of
    attachment they usually feel ill at ease and find life monotonous.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For common people life without attachment would be indeed
    wholly devoid of pleasure. It is tanha that hides the unpleasantness of life and makes it
    pleasant. But for the Arahat who has done away with tanha, it is impossible to enjoy life.
    He is always bent on Nibbana, the cessation of conditioned suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tanha cannot exert much pressure even on the yogis
    (meditators) when they become absorbed in the practice of vipassana. So some yogis do not
    enjoy life as much as they did before. On their return from meditation retreat they get
    bored at home and feel ill at ease in the company of their families. To other people the
    yogi may appear to be conceited but in fact his behaviour is a sign of loss of interest in
    the workaday world. But if he cannot as yet overcome the sensual desire, his boredom is
    temporary and he usually gets re-adjusted to his home life in due course. His family need
    not worry over his mood or behaviour for it is not easy for a man to become thoroughly
    sick of his home life. So the yogi should examine himself and see how much he is really
    disenchanted with life. If his desire for pleasure lingers, he must consider himself still
    in the grip of tanha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Without tanha we would feel discomfited. In conjunction
    with avijja, tanha makes us blind to dukkha and creates the illusion of sukha. So we
    frantically seek sources of pleasure. Consider, for example, men's fondness for movies and
    dramatic performances. These entertainments cost time and money but tanha makes them
    irresistible although to the person who has no craving for them they are sources of
    suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A more obvious example is smoking. The smoker delights in
    inhaling the tobacco smoke but to the non-smoker it is a kind of self-inflicted suffering.
    The non-smoker is free from all the troubles that beset the smoker. He leads a relatively
    care-free and happy life because he has no craving for tobacco. Tanha as the source of
    dukkha is also evident in the habit of betel-chewing. Many people enjoy it although in
    fact it is a troublesome habit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Like the smoker and the betel-chewer, people seek to
    gratify their craving and this tanha-inspired effort is the mainspring of rebirth that
    leads to old age, sickness and death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suffering and desire as its cause are evident in everyday
    life but it is hard to see these truths for they are profound and one can realize them not
    through reflection but only through the practice of vipassana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Ignorance Of The Third And Fourth Noble Truths</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Avijja also means ignorance of the cessation of dukkha and
    the way to it. These two truths are also profound and hard to understand for the truth
    about cessation of dukkha concerns Nibbana which is to be realized only on the Ariyan holy
    path, and the truth about the way is certainly known only to the yogi who has attained the
    path. No wonder that many people are ignorant of these truths.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ignorance of the end of suffering is widespread and so
    world religions describe the supreme goal in many ways. Some say that suffering will come
    to an end automatically in due course of time. Some regard sensual pleasure as the highest
    good and reject the idea of a future life. This variety of beliefs is due to ignorance of
    the real Nibbana. Even among Buddhists some hold that Nibbana is an abode or a sort of
    paradise and there are many arguments about it. All these show how hard it is to
    understand Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In reality Nibbana is the total extinction of the
    nama-rupa process that occurs ceaselessly on the basis of causal relationship. Thus
    according to the doctrine of Paticcasamuppada, avijja, sankhara etc., give rise to
    nama-rupa, etc., and this causal process involves old age, death and the other evils of
    life. If avijja, etc., becomes extinct on the Ariyan path, so do their effects and all
    kinds of dukkha and this complete end to dukkha is Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, a lamp that is refuelled will keep on
    burning, but if it is not refuelled there will be a complete extinction of flame. Likewise
    for the yogi on the Ariyan path who has attained Nibbana, all the causes such as avijja,
    etc., have become extinct and so do all the effects such as rebirth, etc. This means total
    extinction of suffering, that is, Nibbana which the yogi must understand and appreciate
    before he actually realizes it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This concept of Nibbana does not appeal to those who have
    a strong craving for life. To them the cessation of nama-rupa process would mean nothing
    more than eternal death. Nevertheless, intellectual acceptance of Nibbana is necessary
    because on it depends the yogi's whole-hearted and persistent effort to attain the supreme
    goal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Knowledge of the fourth truth, viz., truth about the way
    to the end of dukkha is also of vital importance. Only the Buddhas can proclaim the right
    path; it is impossible for anyone else, be he a deva, a Brahma or a human being, to do so.
    But there are various speculations and teachings about the path. Some advocate ordinary
    morality such as love, altruism, patience, alms-giving, etc., while others stress the
    practice of mundane jhana. All these practices are commendable. According to the Buddhist
    teaching, they lead to relative welfare in the deva-Brahma worlds but do not ensure
    freedom from samsaric dukkha such as old age, etc. So they do not form the right path to
    Nibbana although they are helpful in the effort to attain it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some resort to self-mortification such as fasting, living
    in a state of nature and so forth. Some worship devas or animals. Some live like animals.
    From the Buddhist point of view all these represent what is termed //silabbataparamasa//
    which means any practice that has nothing to do with the Eightfold Path.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Noble Eightfold Path comprises right view, right
    intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness
    and right contemplation. The path is of three kinds, viz., the basic path, the preliminary
    path and the Ariyan path. Of these the most vital is the Ariyan path but this path should
    not be the primary objective of the yogi nor does it require him to spend much time and
    energy on it. For, as the vipassana practice on the preliminary path develops, the insight
    on the Ariyan level occurs for a thought-moment. For example, it requires much time and
    effort to produce fire by friction but ignition is a matter of a moment's duration.
    Similarly, the insight on the Ariyan path is instantaneous but it pre-supposes much
    practice of vipassana on the preliminary path.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Right View, Etc.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vipassana insight is the insight that occurs at every
    moment of contemplation. The yogi who notes every psycho-physical phenomenon becomes aware
    of its real nature. Thus he focuses his attention on the bending of his arms or legs and
    he realizes the elements of rigidity and motion. This means right view in connection with
    //vayodhatu//. Without mindfulness there will arise illusion of &quot;It is the
    hand&quot;, &quot;It is a man&quot;, and so forth. Only the mindful yogi sees things as
    they really are.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same may be said of right view in regard to sensation
    in the body, e.g. imagination, intention. When the mind becomes fixed and calm, the yogi
    finds the nama-rupa phenomena arising and vanishing and so he gains insight into their
    anicca, dukkha and anatta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right belief implies right intention and other associative
    dhamma on the path. Insight on the path occurs at every moment of contemplation. With the
    attainment of perfect insight into the three characteristics of existence, the yogi sees
    Nibbana. Hence, if Nibbana is to be realized here and now, the practice of vipassana is
    essential. The yogi who cannot as yet practise vipassana should focus on the path that is
    the basis of vipassana practice. This basic path means doing good deeds motivated by the
    belief in Kamma. In other words, it is the practice of dana, sila etc., in the hope of
    attaining Nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the paths (magga) - the basic, the preliminary and the
    Ariyan, form the three-fold path leading to Nibbana. In particular, the yogi must
    recognize the Ariyan path as the dhamma that is to be desired, cherished and adored. Such
    a recognition is essential to strenuous effort in the practice of vipassana. The yogi must
    also accept the vipassana magga as a noble dhamma and know how to practise it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people are ignorant of the way to Nibbana. On top of
    that they belittle the Nibbana-oriented good deeds of other people. Some deprecate the
    teaching and practice of other people although they have never practised vipassana
    effectively. Some criticize the right method because they are attached to their wrong
    method. All these people have avijja which means ignorance of and misconception about the
    right path. It is avijja not to know that dana, sila and bhavana lead to Nibbana and it is
    avijja too to regard dana, etc. as harmful to one's interest. The more destructive avijja
    is ignorance of and illusion about the right method of contemplation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ignorance of the right path is the most terrible form of
    avijja. For it makes its victims blind to good deeds and creates illusions, thereby
    preventing them from attaining human happiness or divine bliss, let alone the Ariyan path
    and Nibbana. Yet most people remain steeped in ignorance, unmindful of the need to devote
    themselves to dana, sila and bhavana.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Avijja Leads To Sankhara</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To them sensual pleasure is the source of happiness,
    Nibbana as the extinction of nama-rupa is undesirable and the way to it is arduous and
    painful. So they seek to gratify their desire through three kinds of action (kamma) viz.,
    bodily action, verbal action and mental action. Some of these actions may be ethically
    good and some may be ethically bad. Some people will practise dana, etc. for their welfare
    hereafter, while some will resort to deceit or robbery to become rich.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A Pali synonym for kamma (action) is sankhara. Sankhara is
    also of three kinds, viz., sankhara by thought, sankhara by speech and sankhara by body.
    Sankhara pre-supposes cetana (volition). The function of cetana is to conceive, to urge or
    to incite and as such it is the mainspring of all actions. It is involved in killing,
    alms-giving, etc. The yogi knows its nature empirically through contemplation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In another sense there are three kinds of sankharas, viz.,
    punnabhi (wholesome) sankhara, with its good kammic result, apunnabhi (unwholesome)
    sankhara, with its bad kammic result and anenjabhi-sankhara that leads to wholesome
    arupajhana which literally means immobile jhana. Rupajhana and all the good actions having
    the kammic results in the sensual world are to be classified as punnabhi-sankhara. Punna
    literally means something that cleanses or purifies. Just as a man washes the dirt off his
    body with soap, so also we have to rid ourselves of kammic impurities through dana, sila
    and bhavana. These good deeds are conducive to welfare and prosperity in the present life
    and hereafter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another meaning of punna is the tendency to fulfil the
    desire of the doer of the good deed. Good deeds help to fulfil various human desires, e.g.
    the desire for health, longevity, wealth and so forth. If a good deed is motivated by the
    hope for Nibbana, it leads to a life that makes it possible to attain his goal or it may
    ensure his happiness and welfare till the end of his last existence. Abhisankhara is the
    effort to do something for one's own welfare. It tends to have good or evil kammic
    results. So punnabhi-sankhara is good deed with good kammic result. There are eight types
    of good deed in sensual sphere (kamavacarakusala) and five types in fine-material sphere
    (rupavacara). All these may be summed up as of three kinds, viz., dana, sila and bhavana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Giving dana gladly means wholesome consciousness which is
    kammically very fruitful. So the donor should rejoice before, during and after the act of
    alms-giving. In the scriptures, this kind of dana is credited with great kammic
    productivity. The attitude of the donor may also be one of indifference (upekkha) but, if
    the mind is clear, his act of dana too has high kammic potential Any act of alms-giving
    that is based on the belief in kamma is rational and it may bear fruit in the form of
    rebirth with no predisposition to greed, ill-will and ignorance. An act of dana that has
    nothing to do with a sense of its moral value or the belief in kammic result is good but
    unintelligent and it will lead to rebirth with no great intelligence. It may bear such
    kammic fruit in everyday life but it does not make the donor intelligent enough to attain
    the path in his next life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again one may do a good deed spontaneously without being
    urged by others (asankharika-kusala); some do good deeds at the instigation of others
    (sasankharika-kusala). Of these two kinds of good deeds, the former is kammically more
    fruitful than the latter. When we consider the four kinds of good deeds mentioned earlier
    in terms of these last two attributes, we have a total of eight types of wholesome
    consciousness in the sensual sphere. Whenever we do a good deed, we are prompted to do so
    by one of these kusala dhammas; when we practise concentration and meditation, we have to
    begin with these eight types of wholesome dhammas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If it is bhavana that can lead to jhana, the yogi attains
    rupavacara jhana when his samadhi is well-developed. Jhana means total concentration of
    mind on an object of mental training. Samatha jhana is concentration for bare
    tranquillity. Jhana samadhi is like the flame burning in still air. According to the
    Suttas, the rupavacara jhana has four levels; in Abhidhamma it has five levels.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Unwholesome Kammas</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Opposed to punnabhisankhara is apunnabhisankhara or
    unwholesome kamma formations. These immoral deeds lead to lower worlds and evils in human
    life such as ugliness, infirmities and so forth. They number twelve in terms of
    consciousness, viz., eight rooted in greed (lobha), two rooted in ill-will (dosa) and two
    rooted in ignorance (moha).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The lobha-based dhammas comprise four with wrong belief
    and four without it. Of the four dhammas with wrong belief, two are joyful, spontaneous
    (asankharika) dhamma and joyful but unspontaneous (sasankharika) dhamma. The neutral
    (upekkha) unwholesome dhammas may be classified in the same way. Likewise there are two
    joyful lobha-based dhammas without wrong belief and two lobha-based dhammas without joy or
    wrong belief. Every kamma is characterized by one of these eight lobha-based dhammas. The
    dosa-based dhammas are of two kinds, viz., spontaneous kamma and unspontaneous kamma. This
    dosa-based consciousness is the mainspring of anger, dejection, fear and revulsion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The two kinds of moha-based consciousness are doubt
    (vicikiccha) and restlessness (uddhacca). The former concerns doubts about the Buddha,
    Dhamma, Sangha, sila, samadhi, the idea of a future life and so forth. The latter refers
    to the person who is distracted and absent-minded. The mind is seldom calm and it usually
    goes wandering when it is not restrained through the practice of bhavana. It is said,
    however, that uddhacca does not lead to the lower worlds. The other eleven unwholesome
    dhammas do so under certain circumstances and even in case of a good rebirth, they usually
    have bad kammic effects such as sickliness. These twelve kinds of unwholesome volition
    (cetana) are called apunnabhisankhara.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All over the world people wish to be happy and so they
    strive for their material welfare in the present life and hereafter. But it is greed and
    ill-will that largely characterize their activities. Wholesome consciousness is confined
    to those who have good friends, who have heard their dhamma and who think rationally.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some go morally astray, being misled by their selfish
    teacher. In the lifetime of the Buddha, a lay Buddhist abused good monks and so on his
    death he became a peta in the latrine of the monastery he had donated to the Sangha. He
    told the elder thera Moggallana about his misdeed when the latter saw him with his divine
    eye. What a terrible fate for a man who had materially supported the Sangha for his
    welfare in after-life, but was misguided to the lower world by his teacher. This shows
    that the person whose company we seek should possess not only deep knowledge but also good
    character.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mark of a good man is abstinence from any act, speech
    or thought that is harmful to other people. Those who keep company with good men or good
    bhikkhus have the opportunity to hear the good dhamma and if he thinks wisely, his
    thoughts will lead to wholesome kammas. On the other hand evil teachers or friends, false
    teachings and improper thoughts may lead to moral disaster. Some who bore unblemished
    character in the beginning were ruined by corrupt thoughts. They were convicted of theft,
    robbery or misappropriation and their long-standing reputation was damaged once and
    forever. All their suffering had its origin in the illusion of happiness. Contrary to
    their expectations, they found themselves in trouble when it was too late. Some misdeeds
    do not produce immediate kammic results but they come to light in due course and lead to
    suffering. If retribution does not follow the evil-doer here and now, it overtakes him in
    afterlife as in the case of the donor of the monastery who became a peta for his evil
    words.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His teacher who had misguided him fared worse after his
    death. For he occupied a place below his former pupil and had to live on his excreta. The
    kammic result of his misdeed was indeed frightful. He had committed it for his own end but
    it backfired and he had to suffer terribly for it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some jungle tribes make animal sacrifices to gods for good
    harvest, security, etc. These primitive beliefs still prevail among some urban people.
    Some worship the chief nat'as if he were the Buddha. Some kill animals to feed guests on
    the occasion of religious alms-giving. Even some ignorant Buddhists have misgivings about
    this practice. Whatever the object of the donor, killing has bad kammic result and it is
    not a good deed despite the belief of the killer to the contrary.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A good deed bears the mark of moral purity. Killing or
    hurting a living being cannot be morally pure in any sense if you identify yourself with
    the victim. He faces death or endures ill-treatment only because he cannot avoid it. He
    will surely retaliate if he is in a position to do so. Some people pray for vengeance and
    so the killer is killed in his next existence or he has suffer in hell for his misdeed.
    The Pitaka abounds in many instances of the kammic consequences of killing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some long for human or deva life and devote themselves to
    dana, sila and bhavana. Their good deeds serve to fulfil their wishes and lead to welfare
    in afterlife, but every life is subject to old age and death, and human life is
    inextricably bound up with ill-health, and mental suffering. Some crave for the
    Brahma-world and practise jhana. They may live happily for many kappas (world-systems) as
    Brahmas. But when life has run its course, they will be reborn as human beings or devas
    and any evil deed that they do may bring them to the lower worlds. After all, the
    glorification of the Brahma-life is an illusion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The illusion of happiness is not confined to common
    people. The illusion (vipallasa and avijja) that makes us regard dukkha as sukha lingers
    at the first two stages of the holy path, and even at the anagami stage the yogi still
    mistakes material life (rupa-bhava) and immaterial life (arupa-bhava) for a life of bliss.
    So the object of the Ariyas at the first three stages is to do good. As for the common
    people, they are mired in all the four illusions that make them regard the impermanent as
    permanent, the dukkha of nama-rupa as sukha, the impersonal as personality (atta) and the
    unpleasant as pleasant. Associated with these illusions are the four avijjas. Because of
    these misconceptions and ignorance, every bodily, verbal or mental action gives rise to
    good or bad kamma. A good kamma arises only from volitional effort coupled with faith,
    mindfulness and so forth. If the mind is left to itself, it is likely to produce bad
    kamma.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Rejection Of Good Kamma Means Bad Kamma</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people misinterpret the lack of good or bad kamma on
    the part of the Arahat and say that we should avoid doing good deeds. For an ordinary
    person the rejection of good kamma will mean the upsurge of bad kamma, just as the exodus
    of good people from a city leaves only fools and rogues, or the removal of useful trees is
    followed by the growth of useless grass and weeds. The man who rejects good deeds is bound
    to do bad deeds that will land him in the lower worlds. It will be hard for him to return
    to the human world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In point of fact, the Arahat's dissociation from good
    kamma means only that because of the extinction of avijja, his action is kammically
    unproductive. Indeed the Arahats do good deeds such as revering the elder theras,
    preaching, giving alms, helping living beings who are in trouble and so forth. But, with
    their total realization of the four noble truths and the elimination of avijja, their good
    actions do not have any kammic effect. So it is said that the Arahat does not have good
    kamma, not that he avoids doing good deeds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">An ordinary person who does not care for good deeds
    because of his avijja and mistaken view, will build up only bad kamma that are bound to
    lead to the lower worlds. In fact the lack of the desire to do good is a sign of abysmal
    ignorance that makes the holy path. and Nibbana remote. The mind becomes inclined to good
    deeds in so far as avijja loses its hold on it. A sotapanna yoga is more interested in
    doing good than when he was an ordinary man. The same may be said of those at the higher
    stages of the Ariyan path. The only difference is the increasing desire to give up doing
    things irrelevant to the path and devote more time to contemplation. So, good deeds should
    not be lumped together with bad deeds and purposely avoided. Every action that is bound up
    with avijja means either good kamma or bad kamma. In the absence of good kamma all will be
    bad kamma.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Ignorance and Illusion</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Truth and falsehood are mutually exclusive. If you do not
    know the truth, you accept falsehood and vice versa. Those who do not know the Four Noble
    Truths have misconceptions about dukkha which, posing as sukha, deceive and oppress them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Apart from tanha which, when gratified affords pleasure,
    everything in the sensual world is real dukkha. All sense-objects are subject to ceaseless
    flux and unreliable. Yet to the ignorant person they appear to be good and pleasant. They
    make him nostalgic about what they regard as their happy days in the past and optimistic
    about their future. Because of their misconception, they long for what they consider to be
    the good things in life. This is the cause of their dukkha but they do not realize it. On
    the contrary they think that their happiness depends on the fulfilment of their desires.
    So they see nothing wrong with their desire for sensual pleasure. In fact, the truths
    about the end of dukkha and the way to it are foreign to most people. Some who learn these
    truths from others or accept them intellectually do not appreciate them. They do not care
    for Nibbana or the way to it. They think that the way is beset with hardships and
    privations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The hope for happiness is the mainspring of human action.
    Actions in deed, speech or thought are called kamma or sankhara. We have referred to three
    kinds of sankhara, the two kinds of good kamma comprising the first sankhara, viz., the
    eight good kammas in the sensual world and the good kammas in the material world; we have
    also mentioned two kinds of good kamma or consciousness, viz., one associated with
    intelligence and the other divorced from intelligence. In the practice of vipassana the
    yogi's mind is intelligent if it becomes aware of the real nature of nama-rupa (anicca,
    dukkha, anatta), through contemplation. It is not intelligent if it means little more than
    the recitation of Pali words and superficial observation. In ordinary morality a sense of
    moral values is intelligent if it is associated with the belief in the law of kamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people say that an intelligent act of dana must
    involve the contemplation of the anicca, dukkha and anatta of the donor, the recipient and
    the offering. This view is based on Atthasalini (a commentary on Abhidhammapitaka) which
    mentions the contemplation on the impermanence of everything after giving alms. But the
    reference is to contemplation after the act of dana, not before or while doing it.
    Moreover, the object is not to make the act intelligent but to create wholesome kamma in
    vipassana practice. If by intelligent dana is meant only the dana that pre-supposes such
    contemplation, all the other dana of non-Buddhists would have to be dubbed unintelligent
    acts and it is of course absurd to do so.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The accounts of alms-giving by bodhisattas make no mention
    of contemplation nor did the Buddha insist on it as a pre-requisite to an act of dana. The
    scriptures say only that the kammic potential of dana depends on the spiritual level of
    the recipient and this is the only teaching that we should consider in alms-giving. If the
    donor and the recipient were to be regarded as mere nama-rupa subject to anicca, etc.,
    they would be on equal footing. The act of dana would then lack inspiration and much
    kammic potential.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In fact the object of alms-giving is not vipassana
    contemplation but the benefits accruing to the donor. So the Buddha points out the
    would-be recipients who can make dana immensely beneficial and the importance of right
    reflection (belief in kamma).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one occasion Visakha, the lay woman asked the Buddha
    for lifelong permission to make eight kinds of offering to the Sangha; these were (1)
    bathing garments for the bhikkhus, (2) food for guest-monks, (3) food for travelling
    monks, (4) food for sick monks, (5) food for the monk who attended on a sick monk, (6)
    medicine for the sick monk, (7) rice-gruel for the Sangha and (8) bathing garments for the
    bhikkhunis. The Buddha asked Visakha what benefits she hoped to have in offering such
    things and the substance of Visakha's reply is as follows.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;At the end of the lent, the bhikkhus from all parts
    of the country will come to see the Buddha. They will tell the Lord about the death of
    certain monks and ask him about their rebirth and stages on the holy path that they (the
    deceased monks) had attained. The Lord will reveal their spiritual attainments. I will
    then approach the visiting monks and ask them whether their late fellow-monks had ever
    visited Savatthi city. If they say yes, I will conclude that the Noble one who is now at
    the sotapanna or any other stage on the holy path must have certainly used one of my
    offerings. This remembrance of my good kamma will fill me with joy. It will be conducive
    to peace, tranquillity and self-development.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here it is worthy of note that the reference is not to the
    contemplation on the impermanence of the namarupa of the deceased monks but to the
    spiritual attainments that distinguished them in afterlife. Importance is attached to the
    contemplation that leads to ecstasy and training in self-development. Hence, the most
    appropriate object of contemplation in doing dana is the noble attributes of the recipient
    such as the noble character of the Buddha when laying flowers at the shrine, the holy life
    of the bhikkhu when offering food and so forth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Preaching or hearing the dhamma is a wholesome kamma and
    it is an intelligent act if the dhamma is understood. Every good deed based on the belief
    in kamma is an intelligent kamma. Without the belief, a good act is wholesome but
    unintelligent as are the good acts of some children who imitate the elders and worship the
    Buddha image and the good acts of some people who reject the belief in kamma but are
    helpful, polite and charitable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The five material wholesome dhammas (rupakusala-dhamma)
    are those associated with five jhanas. They are accessible only through the practice of
    samatha that leads to jhana. The eight wholesome dhammas and the five material wholesome
    dhammas form the punnabhisankhara. Apunnabhisankhara or unwholesome kammas number twelve
    in terms of consciousness. Here sankhara means volition (cetana). Of the twelve
    unwholesome sankharas eight are based on greed, two on anger and two on ignorance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The greed-based (lobha-mula) consciousness is of eight
    kinds viz., four with joy and attachment and four without joy, but with attachment
    (upekkha sahagutta). Of the first four kinds two are bound up with belief and, of the two
    with the belief or without the belief, one is non-spontaneous (sasankharika) and the other
    is spontaneous (asankharika). Belief is of three kinds, viz., belief in ego-entity, belief
    in immortality of ego, and belief in annihilation of the ego without there being any
    kammic effect of good or bad deeds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Few people are free from the belief in ego-entity. The
    belief dominates those who do not know that life is a nama-rupa process without a soul or
    a being. The belief is weak among those who have some knowledge of Buddhist scriptures but
    their bookish knowledge does not help them to overcome it completely. The yogis who have
    had a clear insight into the nature of nama-rupa through contemplation are usually free
    from the belief. Yet they may hark back to the belief if they stop contemplating before
    they attain the path. As for the common people, the ego-belief is deep-rooted, making them
    think that it is the self or the ego which is the agent of whatever they do or feel or
    think. Again those who believe in total extinction after death and reject the idea of
    future life and kamma have unwholesome consciousness that is bound up with nihilistic
    beliefs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hatred-based (dosa-mula) consciousness comprises doubt and
    restlessness. Doubts about the Buddha, Nibbana, anatta and so forth are labelled
    vicikiccha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hatred-based consciousness is of two kinds, viz.,
    voluntary consciousness and involuntary consciousness. But there are many kinds of hatred
    such as anger, envy, anxiety, grief, fear and so forth. Ignorance-based (moha-mula)
    consciousness comprises doubt and restlessness. Doubts about the Buddha, Nibbana, anatta
    and so forth are labelled vicikiccha. The mind is subject to doubt (uddhacca) when it
    wanders here and there restlessly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus apunnabhisankhara means the eight greed-based mental
    factors, two hatred-based mental factors and two ignorance-based mental factors. It is
    opposed to punnabhisankhara. It serves to purify nama-rupa, leads to good rebirth with
    good kammic results whereas the other defiles the nama-rupa process and leads to bad
    rebirth with bad kammic results.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People do evil deeds for their welfare. They kill, steal,
    rob or give false evidence at court for their wellbeing. Even those who kill their parents
    do so to achieve their own ends. For example, prince Ajatasattu killed his father to
    become king. Misguided by his teacher Devadatta, he had concluded that he would be able to
    enjoy life as a king for a longer period if he could do away with his father and take his
    place. For his great evil of patricide and the murder of a sotapanna at that, he was
    seized with remorse and anxiety that caused him physical suffering as well. Later on, he
    was killed by his son and reborn in hell where he is now suffering terribly for his
    misdeed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the time of Kakusandha Buddha the Mara called Susi did
    his utmost to harm the Buddha and the Sangha. Failing to achieve his object, he possessed
    a man and stoned to death the chief disciple Arahat behind the Buddha. For this horrible
    crime he instantly landed in Avici hell, the lowest of the thirty-one worlds of living
    beings. As a Mara he had lorded it over others but in Avici he lay prostrate under the
    heels of the guardians of hell. He had hoped to rejoice over the fulfilment of his evil
    desire, but now he had to suffer for his evil kamma. This is true of evil-doers all over
    the world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the hope for happiness also that forms the
    mainspring of other two types of action, viz., punnabhisankhara and anenjabhisankhara.
    Anenjabhisankhara means the four arupajhana-kusaladhammas. Anenja means equanimity or
    self-possession. A loud noise nearby may upset the equanimity (samapatti) of a yogi who is
    absorbed in rupa jhana. But arupa jhana is invulnerable to such distractions. Arupa jhana
    is of four kinds according as it relates to (1) sphere of unbounded space
    (akasanancayatana jhana), sphere of nothingness (akincannayatana jhana) and (4) sphere of
    neither perception-nor-non-perception (nevasannanasannayatana jhana). These four jhanas
    are the sankharas that lead to the four arupa worlds. Apunnabhisankhara leads to the four
    lower worlds and punnabhisankhara leads to human, deva and rupa-Brahma worlds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People do these three kinds of kammas or sankharas for
    their welfare and as a result there arises vinnana or consciousness. With vinnana there
    also come into being nama-rupa, salayatana, phassa, etc., of the new existence.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Sankhara Causes Vinnana</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of avijja there is sankhara which in turn causes
    vinnana. As a result of good or bad kammas in the previous life there arises the stream of
    consciousness beginning with rebirth consciousness in the new life. Evil deeds may, for
    example, lead to the four lower worlds. After that there arises the stream of vinnana
    called bhavanga-citta which functions ceaselessly when the six kinds of vithi
    consciousness do not occur at the moment of seeing, hearing, smelling, eating, touching
    and thinking. In other words, bhavanga is the kind of subconsciousness that we have when
    we are asleep. We die with this subconsciousness and it is then called cuticitta. So the
    rebirth-consciousness, the subconsciousness and the cuti or death-consciousness represent
    the mind which results from the kamma of previous life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The five kinds of consciousness associated with the five
    unpleasant sense-objects such as unpleasant eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, etc.,
    are due to unwholesome kamma as are (1) the consciousness that is focused on these five
    sense-objects and (2) the inquiring (santirana) consciousness. There are altogether seven
    types of consciousness that stem from bad kamma (apunnabhisankhara). As for
    anenjabhisankhara, because of the four arupakusala-dhammas there arises the resulting
    arupa-consciousness in the four immaterial worlds in the form of rebirth-consciousness in
    the beginning, the bhavanga citta in the middle, and the cuticitta as the end of
    existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Similarly, because of the five rupakusala-dhamma there
    arise five rupa vipakacittas in rupa-brahma worlds. Then there are eight mahavipakacittas
    corresponding to eight good kammas in the sensual sphere. They form the rebirth, bhavanga
    and cuticittas in the human world and six deva-worlds. They also register pleasant
    sense-objects (tadarammana) after seven impulse-moments (javana) that occur on seeing,
    hearing, etc. Also due to good consciousness associated with five pleasant sense-objects,
    the registering consciousness, the joyful, inquiring consciousness and the nonchalant,
    inquiring consciousness. Hence, the resulting (vipaka) consciousness is of thirty-two
    kinds, viz., four arupavipaka, five rupavipaka, seven akusala vipaka and sixteen kusala
    vipaka in sensual sphere. All these thirty-two vipaka are resultants of sankhara.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">How Sankhara Leads To New Vinnana</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is very important, but hard to understand how sankhara
    gives rise to rebirth-consciousness. Ledi Sayadaw points out that this part of the
    teaching on paticcasamuppada leaves much room for misunderstanding. It is necessary to
    understand the extinction of the last consciousness (cuticitta) together with all
    nama-rupa as well as the immediate arising of the rebirth-consciousness together with the
    new nama-rupa as a result of good or bad kammas in the case of living beings who are not
    yet free from defilements. Lack of this understanding usually leads to the belief in
    transmigration of souls (sassataditthi) or the belief in annihilation after death
    (ucchedaditthi) which is held by modern materialists.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The belief in annihilation is due to ignorance of the
    relation between cause and effect after death. It is easy to see how avijja leads to
    sankhara and how the sense-bases (ayatana), contact, sensation, craving, etc., form links
    in the chain of causation for these are evident in the facts of life. But the emergence of
    new existence following death is not apparent and, hence, the belief that there is nothing
    after death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Learned people who think on the basis of faith usually
    accept the teaching that sankhara gives rise to rebirth consciousness. But it does not
    lend itself to purely rational and empirical approach and today it is being challenged by
    the materialistic view of life. The way rebirth takes place is crystal clear to the yogi
    who has practised vipassana. He finds that the units of consciousness arise and pass away
    ceaselessly, that they appear and disappear one after another rapidly. This is what he
    discovers by experience, not what he learns from his teachers. Of course he does not know
    so much in the beginning. He discovers the fact only when he attains sammasana and
    udayabbaya insights. The general idea of death and rebirth mental units dawns on him with
    the development of paccayapariggaha insights but, it is sammasana and udayabbaya insights
    that leave no doubt about rebirth. On the basis of his insight, he realizes that death
    means the disappearance of the last unit of consciousness and that rebirth means the
    arising of the first unit of consciousness in the manner of the vanishing and arising of
    consciousness-units that he notes in the practice of vipassana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who do not have vipassana insight miss the point.
    They believe in a permanent ego and identify it with the mind. It is rejected by those who
    have a good knowledge of Abhidhamma but, it lingers in some people because of attachment
    to it in their previous lives. Even the contemplating yogi who is not yet intellectually
    mature sometimes feels tempted to accept it.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Sassata And Uccheda</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To the ordinary people who are wedded to the ego-belief,
    death means the extinction of individual entity or its displacement to another abode or
    existence. This is a misconception called ucchedaditthi if it is the belief in
    annihilation, or sassataditthi if it is belief in the transfer of the soul to another body
    or abode. Some believe that consciousness develops spontaneously with the growth and
    maturation of the body (ahetukaditthi).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some have misconceptions about samsara or nama-rupa
    process. They regard the body as the temporary abode of the life principle that passes on
    from one abode to another. The disintegration of the physical body is undeniable, but some
    people pin their faith to the resurrection of the body in due course of time and so they
    treat the dead body with respect. These views confirm the Ledi Sayadaw's statement that
    the causal links between sankhara and vinnana lends itself to misinterpretation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ordinary Buddhists are not wholly free from these
    misconceptions but, because of their belief in the Buddhist doctrine of anatta, they do
    not harbour the illusions so blindly as to harm their vipassana practice. So even without
    a thorough knowledge about the nature of death, rebirth and nama-rupa, they can enlighten
    themselves through contemplation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, shortly after the parinibbana of the Buddha,
    the thera Channa practised vipassana but made little progress because of his ego-belief.
    Then as he followed Ananda's discourse on Paticcasamuppada, he contemplated, overcame his
    illusion and attained Arahatship. Again, in the time of the Buddha, bhikkhu Yamaka
    believed that the Arahat was annihilated after his parinibbana. Sariputta summoned and
    preached to him. While following the sermon, Yamaka contemplated, and achieved liberation.
    So those who have faith in the Buddha need not be disheartened. If they practised
    vipassana zealously and whole-heartedly, they will become enlightened.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of their ignorance and doubts about the nature of
    death and conception or leaning to uccheda belief, some people ask whether there is a
    future life after death. The question by itself presupposes atta or soul or life-force in
    a living being. Materialism rejects the idea of soul but the ego-illusion is implicit in
    its differentiation of the living from the dead. The question of those who accept the ego
    explicitly or by implication are hard to answer from the Buddhist point of view. If we say
    that there is future life, they will conclude that we support the ego-belief. But Buddhism
    does not categorically deny the future life. Hence, the Buddha's refusal to answer this
    question. Moreover, it is hard to produce evidence for ordinary people. Psychic persons
    may be able to point out the hell or the deva-worlds but sceptics will dismiss such
    exhibition as black magic or chicanery. So the Buddha did not answer the question
    directly, but said that there is continuum of nama-rupa process in the wake of death
    without the extinction of defilements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The problem of future life does not admit any intellectual
    approach. It is to be settled only through certain Buddhist practices. These practices
    enable the yogi to acquire psychic powers by virtue of which he can see the dead, the good
    men who have attained the deva-worlds, as well as the evil persons who are suffering in
    the nether worlds. What he sees is as clear as what an observer who occupies a position
    directly opposite two houses sees - persons passing from one house to the other. Among the
    many devas, animals, etc., of the higher and lower realms, he (the yogi) can easily find
    the person whom he wants to see.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is possible for the yogis to attain jhana and psychic
    powers. There is no teaching which rules out this possibility. Some practising yogis have
    in fact had paranormal contact with the other world (paraloka). But paranormal gifts are
    hard to come by. Their emergence depends on intense concentration and so the easier way is
    to practise vipassana. The problem of life becomes fairly clear when the development of
    paccaya-pariggaha insight makes the yogi well aware of the nature of death and conception.
    It becomes clearer when he attains sammasana, udayabbaya and bhanga insights for then he
    sees clearly how the consciousness units arise and pass away ceaselessly one after another
    and how death means the passing away of the last unit to be followed by conception or the
    arising of the first consciousness-unit in a new existence. But this insight is still
    vulnerable and it is only when the yogi attains at least the sotapatti stage that he
    becomes wholly free of all doubts about future life. The trouble is that people wish to
    inquire about it instead of practising vipassana. Some seek the verdict of Western
    scientists and philosophers while others accept the teaching of those who are reputed to
    be Arahats with psychic powers. But, the best thing is to seek the answer through
    vipassana practice instead of relying on other people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the stage of udayabbaya insight the yogi can clearly
    see how in the wake of the consciousness-unit that has passed away, there follows a new
    unit attached to a sense-object. On the basis of this experience he realizes how the new
    existence begins with consciousness-unit that arises, conditioned by attachment to an
    object at the moment of dying in a previous life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before death the stream of consciousness depends on the
    physical body and is continuous with one unit following the other uninterruptedly. After
    death, the body disintegrates and the stream of consciousness shifts to the physical
    process in another abode. This may be likened to the continuous appearance of light in an
    electric bulb through the ceaseless generation of electricity. When the bulb is burnt up,
    the light goes out but the potential electric energy keeps on coming. Light reappears when
    the old bulb is replaced with a new one. Here, the bulb, energy and light are all changing
    physical processes and we should be mindful of their impermanent character.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The commentary cites the analogies of echo, flame,
    impression of a seal and reflection in the mirror. Echo is reflection or repetition of a
    sound produced by the impact of sound waves on walls, woods, etc. But it does not mean the
    transfer of the original sound to a distant place although we cannot deny the causal
    relation between the sound and the echo either. When you look at a mirror your face is
    reflected on it, but you must not confuse the reflection with your face although it is
    causally related to the latter. A lamp, which is burning, may be used to light up another
    lamp. The flame of the new lamp is obviously not the flame of. the old lamp since the
    latter is still burning but, neither is it causally unrelated to the flame of the old
    lamp. Lastly, the seal leaves an impression that is like its face, but it is not the face
    and it cannot occur in the absence of the seal either.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These analogies help to throw some light on the nature of
    rebirth process. When a person is dying, his kamma, the signs and visions related to it
    and visions of the future life appear. After his death, there arises the rebirth
    consciousness conditioned by one of these visions at the last moment of the previous
    existence. So rebirth does not mean the passage of the last unit of consciousness to
    another life but, since it is conditioned by the visions on death-bed, it is rooted in
    avijja, sankhara, etc., that form the links in the chain of causation leading to the
    visions of the dying person.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, rebirth consciousness is not the consciousness of
    the dying person but it is causally related to the previous life. Two consecutive units of
    consciousness are separate but, given the stream of consciousness, we speak of the same
    individual for the whole day, the whole year or the whole lifetime. Likewise, we speak of
    the last consciousness on death-bed together with rebirth consciousness as representing a
    single person. A man's attainment of deva or any other world is to be understood in the
    same sense. It does not mean the transfer of nama-rupa as a whole. We speak of a man or a
    person only because the rebirth concerns the stream of causally related mental units.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it is ucchedaditthi to believe that a person has
    nothing to do with a previous life since every person is annihilated on death. Most
    Buddhists are free from this belief. As the two consecutive lives are causally related, we
    speak of one person in conventional terms.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But we must guard ourselves against the sassata view that
    rebirth means the transfer of the ego to a new abode.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The yogi who has mature vipassana insight does not harbour
    the two beliefs because he is fully aware of the rising and passing away of mental units
    in the present life and their causal relations. This awareness leaves no room for the
    illusions of personal immortality or annihilation. The nature of consciousness is evident
    even to those who think objectively. Joy may be followed by dejection and vice versa or, a
    serene mind may give way to irritation and vice versa. These changing states of
    consciousness clearly shows its heterogeneous nature. Moreover, mental states may be
    associated through similarity, as for example, the intention to do a certain thing at
    night may occur again in the morning. The mental states do not differ, but are causally
    related to one another. Those who understand this relation between two consecutive states
    of consciousness can see that the same relation holds between the two mental elements that
    are separated only by death.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Death-Bed Visions</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consciousness in the new existence is of two kinds, viz.,
    rebirth consciousness and the consciousness that occurs during the whole life. There are
    altogether l9 kinds of rebirth consciousness, one in the lower worlds, nine in the sensual
    worlds of human beings and devas, five in rupa-brahma world and four in arupa-brahma
    worlds. As for the others that occur during the rest of life, they number thirty-two as
    resultant mental states (vipaka-vinnana). These enumerations will be intelligible only to
    those who have studied Abhidhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To a dying person, there appears the flashbacks of what he
    has done in life (kamma), the surrounding conditions associated with his kammic acts
    (kammanimitta) and the visions of his future life (gatinimitta). Kamma may assume the form
    of a flashback about the past or the hallucination about the present. A fisherman on his
    death-bed may talk as if he were catching fish or a man who has given much alms may think
    in his last hours that he is doing dana. Many years ago, I led a group of pilgrims from
    Shwebo to visit pagodas in Mandalay and Rangoon. An old man in the group died shortly
    after our return to Shwebo. He died muttering the words that were reminiscent of his
    experience during the pilgrimage.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The dying man also has visions of the environment in which
    kammic deeds were done such as robes, monasteries, bhikkhus, Buddha images, etc., in
    connection with his acts of dana or weapons, places, victims in case of the murder he has
    committed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then he sees visions of what he will find in his
    afterlife. For example, he will see hell-fire, hell-guards, etc., if he is bound to land
    in hell; devas, mansions, etc., if he is to pass on to deva-worlds and so forth. Once a
    dying brahmin was told by his friends that the vision of the flames which he saw indicated
    the brahma-world. He believed them and died only to find himself in hell. False beliefs
    are indeed dangerous. It is said that some people tell their dying friends to visualize
    their acts of killing a cow for dana, believing that such acts are beneficial.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">The Story Of Mahadhammika Upasaka</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the time of the Buddha, there were in Savatthi city
    five hundred upasakas each with 500 followers. They all practised the dhamma. The eldest
    of them, Mahadhammika, the head of all upasakas had seven sons and seven daughters who
    also lived up to the teaching of the Buddha. As he grew old, he became sick and weak. He
    invited the bhikkhus to his house and while attending their recitation of the dhamma, he
    saw the celestial chariot arriving to take him to the deva-world. He said to the devas,
    &quot;Please wait.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhus stopped reciting as they thought that the
    dying man had told them to do so. His sons and daughters cried, believing that he was
    babbling for fear of death. After the bhikkhus' departure, he came round, told the people
    around him to throw a garland of flowers up into the air. They did as they were told and
    lo! the garland remained hanging in the air. The upasaka said that the garland indicated
    the position of the chariot from Susita heaven, and after advising his daughters and sons
    to do good deeds like him for rebirth in the deva-world, he died and landed in Susita.
    This is how the vision of deva-world appears to the good man on his death-bed. A layman in
    Moulmein said that just before he died he saw a very good pucca building. This, too, may
    be a vision of the deva-world. Some dying persons who are to be reborn as human beings
    have visions of their would-be parents, residence and so forth. A Sayadaw in Moulmein was
    killed by robbers. Three years later a child from Mergui came to Moulmein and identified
    by name the Sayadaws with whom he said he had lived together in his previous life. He said
    that the robbers stabbed him when they did not get the money, that he ran away to the
    jetty where he got into a boat, reached Mergui and dwelt in the home of his parents. The
    flight, journey by boat, etc., were perhaps visions of the Sayadaw's afterlife.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Flashbacks of kammic acts and visions of a future life
    occur even in cases of instant death. According to the commentary, they occur even when a
    fly on a bar of iron is crushed to pieces with a hammer. Today, there arc nuclear weapons
    that can reduce a big city to ashes in a moment. From the Buddhist point of view, these
    weapons have appeared because of the evil kamma of their potential victims. Those who are
    killed by these bombs also see the flashbacks and visions. This may sound incredible to
    those who do not know the mechanism of the mind thoroughly but, it presents no difficulty
    to the yogi who contemplates the nama-rupa in action. For it is said in the scriptures
    that units of consciousness arise and pass away by the billions in the twinkling of an
    eye. The yogi who has attained udayabbaya insight knows empirically that hundreds of
    mental units arise and dissolve in a moment. So he has no doubt about the possibility of
    consciousness centering or flashbacks and visions in those who meet violent and instant
    death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consciousness is always focused on objects. We often
    recall what we have done and think of the deva-world or the human society. If a man who
    has done good deeds dies with these thoughts, he will be reborn as a deva or a human
    being. The objects of these thoughts on death-bed are called gatinimitta, visions of
    objects associated with kamma are called kammanimitta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">References to these death-bed phenomena are to be found
    not only in the commentaries, but also in the Pali pitaka. In the Balapandita and other
    suttas, the Buddha speaks of the death-bed memories of good or bad deeds and likens them
    to the shadows of a mountain dominating the plains in the evening. It is impossible to
    remove them. Once I saw a dying woman who showed great fear as if she were face to face
    with an enemy who was out to treat her cruelly. She was speechless and her relatives tried
    to comfort her but, it was in vain. Perhaps she was having a foretaste of her unhappy
    future as a result of evil kamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it is necessary to do good kamma that will produce
    mental images of objects and persons associated with it and visions of a good afterlife at
    the moment of dying. If the good deed is rational, strongly motivated and one of the eight
    kinds of good deeds in sensual sphere, the resultant consciousness is one of the four
    kinds of rational vinnana. Rebirth is then associated with amoha (non-ignorance) and as
    such it takes place with three root-conditions (hetu) viz., amoha, adosa
    (non-aggressiveness) and alobha (non-craving). A person reborn with these innate
    tendencies can attain jhana and psychic powers if he practises samatha and can attain the
    holy path and Nibbana if he devotes himself to vipassana. Good acts that are motivated by
    the desire for Nibbana lead to such good rebirth and finally to the path, and Nibbana
    through contemplation or hearing a sermon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the motivation is weak or if it is a good, but
    unenlightened deed, that is, a good deed divorced from the belief in kamma, the result is
    one of the four kinds of unenlightened (moha-vipaka) consciousness. The rebirth is then
    devoid of amoha (non-ignorance), there being only the other root-conditions, viz., alobha
    and adosa. It is termed //dvehetupatisandhika//. A man reborn in this way cannot attain
    jhanas or the Path as he lacks the innate intelligence for it. If the good deed is
    unenlightened and half-hearted, the result will be good rebirth consciousness without any
    good predispositions. The person concerned is likely to have defective eyes, ears, etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So when you do a good deed you should do it with zeal and
    with Nibbana as your objective. If you set your heart on Nibbana, the good deed will lead
    you to it and the zeal with which you do it will ensure rebirth with good predispositions.
    It is not necessary to pray for such noble rebirth because you are assured of it if you do
    good deeds intelligently and zealously. But, if you lack zeal in doing good, yours will be
    a rebirth with only alobha and adosa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people say that dana and sila mean good
    kamma-formations (punnabhisankhara) which, being rooted in ignorance, lead to rebirth and
    samsaric suffering. This is a mistaken view that stems from ignorance. If the practice of
    dana and sila is motivated by the desire for Nibbana, it will ensure the noblest rebirth
    and lead to the supreme goal. It was due to dana and sila that Sariputta and other
    disciples of the Buddha finally attained Nibbana. The same may be said of paccekabuddhas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bodhisatta, too, attained supreme enlightenment in the
    same way by praying that his good deeds contribute to the attainment of omniscience
    (sabbannutanana). Here rebirth with three good predispositions, viz., amoha, adosa and
    alobha involved in the genesis of Buddhahood is of two kinds, viz., consciousness
    associated with joy (somanassa) and consciousness associated with equanimity (upekkha).
    Again each of these two vinnanas is of two kinds, viz., asankharika (spontaneous) and
    sasankharika (non-spontaneous). The bodhisatta's rebirth consciousness was powerful,
    zealous asankharika.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to ancient commentaries, it was somanassa
    consciousness. For the bodhisatta wanted very much to promote the welfare of all living
    beings, he had infinite metta (good-will or loving-kindness) for them. A strong-willed
    metta is usually coupled with somanassa and, hence, the bodhisatta's rebirth consciousness
    was tinged with joy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But, Mahasiva thera suggested upekkha as its (bodhisatta's
    rebirth) concomitant. In his view, the bodhisatta's mind was firm and profound, thereby
    making equanimity rather than joy the characteristic of his rebirth consciousness. In any
    event, this rebirth-vinnana had its origin in his good deed that was motivated by the
    desire for supreme enlightenment. Thus, although the enlightened good kamma-formations
    (sankhara) lead to rebirth, it does not prolong samsaric existence; on the contrary it
    contributes to liberation from the life-cycle.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consciousness of any kind, whether it be rebirth
    consciousness or otherwise, is a matter of very short duration. It has only three points
    of time, viz., arising (//upada//), being (//thi//) and passing away (//bhanga//).
    According to the commentaries, these mental units arise and pass away by the millions in
    the twinkling of an eye. The moment of each unit is so short that it does not last even
    the millionth part of a second.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the cessation of rebirth-consciousness there follows
    the stream of subconsciousness (bhavanga) which flows ceaselessly unless it is interrupted
    by a different kind of consciousness called vithi, that is the kind of mental activity
    involved in seeing, hearing, and so forth. The stream of bhavanga lasts as long as there
    is life, its mainspring being sankhara as in the case of rebirth consciousness. Its
    duration, too, depends mainly on sankhara or kamma. It may be like a stone thrown into the
    air. The stone will travel a long way if the hand which throws it is strong, but it will
    not go very far if the hand is weak. The force of kamma may also be compared to the
    initial velocity of the bullet, rocket, and so forth. Death means the dissolution of the
    consciousness that is born of the same kammic force. Hence the initial rebirth
    consciousness, the stream of subconsciousness and the last dying (cuti) consciousness of
    an existence comprise the mental life that is wholly rooted in past kamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also due the kamma or sankhara are the five kinds of vithi
    consciousness, viz., those involved in seeing, hearing, smelling, eating and touching as
    well as the mental unit that focuses on the sense-objects, the consciousness that reflects
    (santirana-citta) and the consciousness that registers (tadarammana-citta) the objects of
    impulse-moments (javana). These have their roots in original kamma that leads to rebirth
    or other kinds of kamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Abhidhamma pitaka attributes all kinds of
    consciousness, including wholesome, unwholesome and non-kammic or kiriya-citta to
    sankhara. This view is reasonable since the kiriya-cittas, too, evolve from the
    bhavanga-citta that is rooted in sankhara. But the doctrine of Paticcasamuppada
    specifically describes the three rounds (vatta) of defilements, kamma, kammic results and
    their cause-and-effect relationships. So it ascribes to sankhara only the 32 types of
    mundane resultant cittas that stem from kamma vatta. Of these 32 cittas we have described
    19 cittas that comprise rebirth, subconscious state and death of the other cittas. Of the
    other cittas some are wholesome according to the sankhara.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the doctrine of Paticcasamuppada, the first two factors
    i.e., avijja and sankhara are described as the causes in the past life, vinnana,
    nama-rupa, phassa and vedana as the consequences in the present life; tanha, upadana and
    bhava as the causes in the present life and jati and jaramarana (old age and death) as the
    consequences that will occur in the future life.</font></p>
