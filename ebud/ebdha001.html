    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The following
    questions and answers have been especially formulated with
    the newcomer to Buddhism in mind.</i></font></p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: Who was the Buddha?<br>
    A:</b> The Buddha was a man who lived some 2,600 years ago
    and who revolutionised religious thought in India. This way
    of thought spread throughout the Eastern world and has now
    found its way to the West.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: What does the word 'Buddha'
    mean?</b> <b><br>
    A:</b> The word 'Buddha' stands for the Awakened State
    (literally it means awakened), so it is used in relation to
    waking up to truth, to becoming enlightened.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: What did the Buddha teach?</b>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> His teaching was
    extensive. However, it is commonly agreed among all
    traditions throughout the Buddhist world, that fundamentally
    the teaching of the Buddha is contained in just four truths -
    the Four Noble Truths.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: What are these truths?<br>
    A:</b> They are: the truth of suffering; the truth of
    regarding the cause of suffering; the truth regarding the
    cessation of suffering; and the path, the way leading to the
    cessation of that suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We suffer when life does not go our
    way, when our hopes are dashed, and when disappointment or
    tragedy strikes. We also suffered when life does go our way.
    Why? Becausewe fear loss - loss of pleasure, wealth, family
    or friends. This is the truth of suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wishing, wanting, and desiring are
    the cause of suffering. We produce our own suffering by the
    way we think and act. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because we produce our own
    suffering, it is within our power not to produce it, and not
    to suffer. This is the truth regarding the cessation of
    suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The way of life which does not
    cause suffering is the path; it is the way of harmlessness,
    wishlessness, selflessness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: Is there a God in Buddhism as
    in Christianity?</b> <b><br>
    A:</b> It is very difficult to compare Buddhism with
    Christianity. One would have to say, however, there is no God
    in Buddhism in the way that God in Christianity is commonly
    understood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: What do Buddhists believe?</b>
    <b><br>
    A:</b> Different Buddhists believe different things, but the
    nature of belief is itself an important issue in Buddhism.
    Belief is to be seen as belief, not as fact. When we see our
    beliefs as facts, then we are deluding ourselves. When we see
    our beliefs as beliefs, then we are not. Seeing things in
    their true light is the most important thing in Buddhism.
    Deluding ourselves is the cause of much suffering. So
    Buddhists try to see beliefs as beliefs. They may still
    believe in certain things - that is their prerogative - but
    they do not cling to those beliefs; they do not mind or worry
    about whether their beliefs are true or not, nor do they try
    to prove that which they know cannot be proved. Ideally
    though, a Buddhist does not indulge in any kind of belief.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: Does Buddhism teach
    reincarnation?</b> <b><br>
    A:</b> Reincarnation is not a teaching of the Buddha. In
    Buddhism the teaching is of rebirth, not of reincarnation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: What is the difference
    between reincarnation and rebirth?</b> <b><br>
    A:</b> The reincarnation idea is to believe in a soul or a
    being, separate from the body. At the death of the physical
    body, this soul is said to move into another state and then
    enter a womb to be born again. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rebirth is different and can be
    explained in this way. Take away the notion of a soul or a
    being living inside the body; take away all ideas of self
    existing either inside or outside the body. Also take away
    notions of past, present and future; in fact take away all
    notions of time. Now, without reference to time and self,
    there can be no before or after, no beginning or ending, no
    birth or death, no coming or going. Yet there is life!
    Rebirth is the experience of life in the moment, without
    birth, without death; it is the experience of life which is
    neither eternal nor subject to annihilation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: Does that mean there is no
    such thing as birth and death?</b> <br>
    <b>A:</b> That which is born, dies. Forms come and go. All
    that comes into existence is impermanent; it is born and it
    dies. But the very essence of what &quot;I&quot; am -- the
    Buddha-nature -- is unborn and undying. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: Is this just a Buddhist
    belief?</b> <b><br>
    A:</b> Buddhists are people and people do believe things, but
    Buddhism is concerned with truth, not with belief, and the
    teaching is to see things as they are. If we believe anything
    which has not been experienced, we should know what we are
    doing. When we do not understand something, then to maintain
    an open mind is the healthiest and wisest practice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: But what happens when we die?</b>
    <br>
    <b>A:</b> If we understand what the word &quot;I&quot; really
    represents, we can realise the answer to this question.
    Buddhism does not offer intellectual answers; it only gives
    directions for the experiencing of truth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: How is it possible to
    experience truth?</b> <br>
    <b>A:</b> By understanding that &quot;I&quot; and birth and
    death are notions, concepts, ideas, beliefs. It is the idea
    of a self living life through time, which produces the idea
    of birth and death. We have been conditioned into believing
    that we have come into existence and in due course will cease
    to exist. If we see through these ideas and realise that this
    moment neither begins nor ends, we shall realise
    deathlessness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: But how can getting rid of
    ideas enables us to see deathlessness?</b> <br>
    <b>A: </b>The deathless is here all the while, but ideas
    block it out. It is like the sun because of the clouds. But
    as soon as the clouds are cleared away, there is the sun.
    Likewise, as soon as ideas are cleared away from the mind,
    there is the true state of birthlessness and deathlessness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: How does one clear away
    ideas?</b> <br>
    <b>A: </b>By seeing ideas as ideas and not as truths; by
    being aware of mental formations through meditation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: Are there various kinds of
    Buddhist meditation?</b> <br>
    <b>A: </b>There are different exercises taught by teachers of
    different Buddhist traditions and schools. The main
    differences, however, are superficial ones, related to
    psychological or emotional problems. Many of these exercises
    can only be administered by experienced meditation teachers.
    For the average person, however, whose sole aim is to realise
    the deep clear teachings of the Buddha, meditation is a
    simple process of awareness and investigation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: How does one practise this
    kind of meditation?</b> <br>
    <b>A:</b> By being fully aware, as one thinks, speaks and
    acts.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: But what about sitting
    meditation?</b> <br>
    <b>A:</b> Sitting meditation is the same. It is just a
    question of being aware. Sitting meditation is an excellent
    thing to do, but some people are not able to find a quiet
    spot to sit in every day. If this is the case, one is not
    automatically debarred from the insights of meditation. To
    meditate properly is to do one's duty and to live without
    wishing life were different, or somehow better. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The opportunity for seeing truth is
    ever present, because truth is ever present. Just because the
    sun is covered by clouds does not mean the sun is not there.
    Conditions are always just right for being aware of the true
    situation. All one has to do is be conscious of what is
    taking place within one and around one, without making any
    judgements. If we &quot;see&quot; by being aware, then we
    shall see very deeply into everything.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: How does one practise sitting
    meditation?</b> <br>
    <b>A:</b> Sitting meditation is the shutting down of all
    sense stimuli in order to realise that awareness is not a
    function of the senses or of the thinking process. It is
    practised by sitting quite still with the eyes closed (or not
    focusing on anything), by letting life be, by breathing in
    and out (not changing the breath, not trying to breath
    deeply), by just breathing the way one always breathes, and
    by noticing the subtle changes in the mind and in the body.
    It is neither difficult nor complicated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: Does one need to have a
    meditation teacher?</b> <br>
    <b>A: </b>The Buddha's teaching can be the teacher and
    awareness can be the practice which will lead straight to
    liberation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: What is karma?</b> <br>
    <b>A:</b> It is cause and effect. When someone commits a
    crime, he suffers the consequences. That is karma. When
    someone does good, he enjoys the consequences. That is karma.
    But karma runs deep; its affects our hearts and minds. From
    the beginning, mind is absolutely pure. If we are unkind,
    deceitful, greedy or cruel, we defile that purity. Imagine a
    plain white cloth, beautiful, bright and clean. And then
    imagine someone splattering it with black ink. The cloth is
    then spoilt. The mind is like the white cloth. Like and
    dislike, greed and hatred, are like the ink splattered across
    it. When the mind is unmarked and unspoilt, suffering and
    enjoyment do not exist. This is happiness beyond pleasure,
    beyond karma. All karma is impermanent and runs out in due
    course. A Buddhist will learn how to get off the karmic
    see-saw of pleasure and pain. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: Can anyone see the Truth?</b>
    <br>
    <b>A:</b> The Buddha was compassionate. He did not teach an
    impossible teaching that ordinary people could not
    understand. On the contrary, his teaching was clear and
    simple. Anyone who makes the effort to be aware will realise
    his or her Buddha-nature and be freed from suffering.</font></p>
