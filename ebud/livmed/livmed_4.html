  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Concentration and Meditation</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For many people the act of concentration is synonymous
  with meditation. That is probably the reason why so many good Buddhists are more or less
  satisfied with the notion that when they are doing something in a concentrated fashion --
  such as reading, working, playing golf -- they are already meditating. They are partly
  right and partly wrong. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Actually, concentration is only a part of meditation. The
  essence of meditation is to reach a higher form of understanding, panna, to stretch the
  mind beyond the boundaries of the intellect into the realm of the intuitive, of
  insight-wisdom. In most cases, meditative disciplines require collecting the mind to a
  one-pointed state in the initial stages. The first method used is to train the mind to
  concentrate on one single object. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one considers the pure act of concentration one uses in
  one's work or hobby, one sees that the objective of such a feat is quite different from
  that of meditation. In our work or hobby we are merely concerned with accomplishing
  something that is outside of us generally, like job success, winning a game of golf,
  completing a scientific experiment, etc. In meditation, however, the achievement is
  inward, an achievement of self-understanding and spiritual insight. In the initial stages
  of meditation it may be necessary to concentrate on objects that are external to one's
  mind, like on the nostrils, or on the movement of the abdomen, until the mind is collected
  at one point. This type of one-pointed collectedness also occurs while we work or play,
  but that's where the similarity between concentration and meditation ends. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Concentration is pure and simple collectedness of the
  mind, whereas meditation is the collected mind moving further toward the development of
  insight-wisdom, or vipassana. In meditation, the awareness of the mind automatically
  shifts onto the mind itself and of its own accord focuses on its workings and processes,
  ultimately leading to true self-knowledge. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Though we may come to some form of understanding while
  concentrating on work and play, this type of knowledge or understanding is
  intellect-bound, whereas meditative knowledge is intuitive and spiritual. Therefore, the
  two kinds of understanding are entirely different in nature and serve completely different
  purposes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In pure concentration, there is always duality in the mind
  -- &quot;I&quot; and &quot;what I am doing.&quot; There is a subject, an object and the
  process of doing. In other words, there is the knower, the known and the knowing.
  Meditation also begins with these three. But eventually the mind transcends these
  divisions by turning inward toward itself. The ultimate enlightenment experience is the
  state where the differentiation of knower, the known and the knowing ceases. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To confuse concentration with meditation leads to the
  difficult-to-overcome states of apathy and self-satisfaction. Thus, the concept that
  concentration and meditation are the same is a misunderstanding that offers us no help on
  the path to liberation, and may even hamper aspirants in their inner progress. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>MS: You said that in the concentrated activities of
  daily life, such as reading or working, there is always a duality in the mind -- that is,
  there is the knower, the knowing and the known. It seems to me that there is a distinction
  between concentration in an ordinary activity and absorption in an actifity like painting
  or making music or some other artistic endeavor where the knower, the knowing and the
  known seem to disappear. This grey area comes up again and again in Dhamma talks and
  questions. Would you elaborate on this?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> Actually, during absorption in artistic
  activities like painting or making music, etc., the knower, the knowing and the known do
  not completely disappear. What happens is that, in these moments of heightened artistic
  activity, the person experiences a kind of rapture where the sense of &quot;I-ness&quot;
  fades away to a great extent but not completely. Also, the person is still conscious of
  the object, be it painting or making music or whatever. Therefore, the known also does not
  completely disappear. I call these kinds of experiences &quot;pseudo-spiritual
  incidences,&quot; because they come close to jhanic absorptions, but are not quite so. On
  the other hand, these raptures in artistic endeavors allow the artist to become more
  pliable and spiritual than most people. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness and Awareness</font></h3>
  <b><i><p><font face="Times New Roman">E: How we can practice mindfulness in daily life?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> Generally, our awareness is very much
  preoccupied with the external situation, with whatever we contact through our six senses.
  Invariably, we react to these sensations in a habitual way. We repeat our behavior again
  and again, without awareness of what is happening in our minds. In Buddhism this is known
  as avijja, or ignorance. This does not mean intellectual ignorance, but specifically lack
  of insight into oneself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: But we do seem to know our own minds, don't we?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In one sense we do, but only in a sluggish manner. For
  example, when we go through an emotional upheaval, we are aware of it only after the
  incident is over. At the time of the turmoil we are lost in our confusion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We generally focus on the external factors we think are
  affecting us. Take, for example, the case of eating. Our attention is focused on the food:
  its taste, its smell and appearance. If the food is not up to our expectations, we
  immediately react to it with annoyance -- or even anger, if we are already in a bad mood.
  Then we are apt to vent our anger on anyone or anything we come into contact with. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But if we look at the situation analytically, we will see
  that the problem does not begin outside of us. Another person who is not concerned with
  that food, or who even likes it, will enjoy it without making a fuss. So the root of the
  problem is not in the food but in our judgmental and discriminating mind. The moment we
  start thinking, &quot;I don't like it,&quot; we reject the existing situation as being
  unacceptable. This rejection always ends up in anger or tension in one form or another. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: Then how do we practice awareness?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Awareness cannot be practiced. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: Oh? But we hear and read so much about practicing
  awareness in Buddhism, don't we?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There has been some confusion between awareness and
  mindfulness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: But I always thought they were the same.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">They are related, but distinct. Sati, or mindfulness,
  implies there is action of the mind. We purposely set ourselves to pay attention to our
  minds. We exert effort. Awareness is different. <b>Awareness is devoid of any action.</b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mind simply &quot;awares.&quot; There is no action
  here, only a collected and spontaneous awareness that just &quot;sees.&quot; Here,
  mindfulness is the cause, and awareness is the effect. You cannot practice or train the
  effect. You can only practice something that will cause it. We have to start with
  mindfulness so that awareness may arise in us. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: How do we practice mindfulness?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Normally, our minds are in constant motion, thinking,
  feeling, endlessly flitting from one thing to another. Because of this perpetual motion,
  there is little room for awareness to arise. Awareness may peek through at times, but it
  is too timid. It is sluggish and dull. Most often our noisy thoughts and emotions dominate
  the scene. The mind must get out of this perpetual cycle for awareness to arise fully. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: How does this happen?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mind must readjust itself, redirecting its usually
  externally oriented attention onto mindfulness of itself. When we redirect ourselves in
  this way, we replace all other mental activities with mindfulness. Rather than getting
  caught in all the mental activities, we are left only with &quot;paying attention.&quot;
  At each single moment the mind can accommodate only one mind state. For example, we cannot
  be angry and be happy at the same time, can we? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: Goodness, no.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When there is anger in our minds, there is no room for
  happiness. When mindfulness occupies the whole of our minds, there is no room for any
  thought or emotion to arise at that specific mind-moment. There is pure attentiveness.
  When this attentiveness is total, the perpetual roller-coaster state of the mind is
  broken: the mind finds a balanced footing in itself. Then awareness can arise on its own
  accord. <b>When there is complete balance, there is awareness.</b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: Can you relate this to the incident of eating?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, suppose you are used to paying attention to your
  mind. As soon as you see the food, and thoughts of dislike enter your mind, you will be
  aware of what is happening in you. When you watch your feelings of like and dislike
  without judgment, you will be left only with the watching. There is no chance for
  subsequent thoughts to arise. In short, your emotions will be stopped in their tracks
  instead of building up. Maybe you cannot stop your dislike of the food, but that is not
  important. The crucial thing is that when you are stopped in your tracks, you begin to see
  the situation &quot;as it is&quot; and not &quot;as I want it.&quot; This
  &quot;seeing&quot; is the awareness we are talking about. Instead of reacting with anger,
  you can now relate to the situation in a relatively calm way and deal with it rationally,
  with harmony. The situation leads constructively to your own and others' satisfaction. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: You mean awareness dispels all the confusion in
  you?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, it does. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: But how?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You see, in awareness the mind becomes an
  &quot;all-seeing&quot; state -- which in Buddhism is called panna (insight wisdom).
  Although we say awareness, this awareness is not just &quot;being&quot; aware. It is not a
  passive state. It brings with it a dynamic perception which cuts through all confusions in
  the mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The total external situation is revealed in its entirety
  with transparent clarity. When we see the world through our own confusion, the scene is
  very much distorted. The more confused we are, the more distorted our view of the world
  is. Therefore, our reactions are also distorted, and we create confusion around us. It is
  only when confusion is transcended by panna that we have clarity in ourselves. With this
  clarity we can deal with the external situation in a wholesome and creative way. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">In the Moment</font></h3>
  <b><i><p><font face="Times New Roman">P: Why is it that we find it so refreshing to go to
  a place which is totally different from what we are used to? I always find it necessary to
  get away from my normal life and take a break, to find a change of scene and environment.
  Is that quite normal?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> I don't know whether you would call it
  normal or abnormal, but one can say that it is quite usual. It is quite usual for us to
  feel suffocated and hemmed in by our lives. One feels the need to get away from it all, to
  take a break, and to find new experiences to sustain oneself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But you must also understand that it is not mainly the
  suffocating life situation that is driving us to seek relief temporarily, though that does
  help to some extent. The main reason is that one is not free in the present moment. When
  one is not free, one cannot experience this very moment fully and completely. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>P: So one is actually seeking a diversion when one
  does not find satisfaction in the present. But even when one gets to a new place and finds
  the new experience to be exciting, the satisfaction does not last for long, because it
  only satisfies the senses and not the spirit.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, this is true. When you get back to your original
  situation, you find that you are on the old treadmill again. But, come to think of it,
  what is it that makes you feel contented and satisfied? You can be contented and satisfied
  only when the mind is free from desires and clinging, for only the free mind can
  experience each moment fully and completely. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To a mind free from desires, free from conflicts and
  frustrations, each moment is fresh and new. If your mind is always burdened with conflicts
  and frustrations, you cannot experience the moment fully. There is no clarity or room for
  experience. In this sort of situation you are either living in the past or in the future;
  the experience of the present is only partial. You are only partly aware of the present,
  so to say. You do not experience the freshness of the moment, the joy of everything you
  come into contact with. So you go out to seek freshness in other places, from other
  people, in new relationships and so on. However, the cycle continues, because the root of
  the problem is not in the environment but within yourself. Until that truth is properly
  understood and dealt with, you continue the search for satisfaction everywhere, and yet
  find it nowhere. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Meditation without Meditation</font></h3>
  <b><i><p><font face="Times New Roman">R: What is sitting meditation?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> You purposefully quiet your mind so that you
  can go deeper and deeper within yourself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: Then why don't you teach us sitting meditation?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist vipassana meditation (insight meditation)
  involves four methods. First, kaya-nupassana, meditation on the body. For example, the
  in-breath and out-breath, walking, sitting and standing. Second, vedana-nupassana,
  contemplation on sensations and feelings. Third, citta-nupassana, contemplation on the
  mind. And fourth, dhamma-nupassana, contemplation on mental and intellectual objects. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: You mean all this time I have been meditating on
  the last three?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What else? Yes, you have been meditating on the last
  three. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: You mean in all the struggling I have done
  watching my feelings and confusions, struggling with the discussions in the group and with
  my readings, I have been meditating all the time and never even knew I was meditating?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a good way of putting it. Yes, you have been
  meditating without knowing that you were meditating. This is called &quot;meditation
  without meditation.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: But why are we so stuck with the idea that to
  meditate we must sit in a certain way at a certain time?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You see, institutional forms of vipassana meditation have
  become extremely popular in Asian Buddhist countries and in the West. Whatever methods the
  teachers and founders of these institutions may use, there is one feature common to all of
  them: a structured system or form within which the student of meditation learns to
  meditate. So meditation has become synonymous with sitting meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: But how does meditation without meditation work?
  I mean, how does it achieve results without our having to go through rigorous discipline?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I think you mean the rigor of the sitting meditation as a
  discipline. You see, the sitting is only an aid to the more important discipline of the
  mind. The sitting is not to train the body per se, but to train the mind in the art of
  mindfulness and in going beyond. In formal meditation you concentrate on the body at one
  point -- either on the breath or on sensations -- in order to relinquish any thoughts,
  feelings or intellectual activities of the mind, to help it become collected at one point.
  In the process you learn to watch the mind without judgment and discrimination and also
  learn to let go. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: But you have been telling us the same thing: to
  watch the mind, to let go, etc.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Exactly. You can watch your mind while you quietly sit in
  the meditative posture, or you can do so while you function in your daily life. Either way
  is feasible, depending on your own disposition. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the unstructured approach, you have to face yourself
  very often. In trying to let go, you must first of all face your own ego and pride. Nobody
  wants to face his or her own ego. It is too painful. It takes great mental effort to do
  so. In this unstructured approach, facing your own ego is itself a meditative act of the
  mind. It requires sati (mindfulness), effort, samadhi (collectedness of mind) and
  equanimity. It may not require the rigorous disciplining of the body, but it definitely
  requires perseverance and rigorous disciplining of the mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: But what about our discussions and readings? How
  do they help develop insight?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In sitting meditation, you purposefully waive
  intellectualization by concentrating on one single point -- let us say, on the breathing.
  However, in this less formal approach I am teaching, you use the intellect as a tool to
  develop insight. Reading, discussing and contemplating the Dhamma sharpen your intellect
  and insight. But there is a very important point here. If your efforts are only at the
  intellectual level, then you will only collect intellectual knowledge. This is quite
  different from actual experiential insight. In our discussions we have always gone beyond
  intellectualization of the Dhamma. We have gone into personal experience, into the
  nitty-gritty of life as we live and struggle through. Do you remember many times you've
  said: &quot;It's impossible; I can't understand it. I can't let go of my opinions and
  clinging&quot;? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: Yes, that's right.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And many times you've said, &quot;if I understand, I'll
  let go.&quot; But you found that: <b>you can understand only when you let go of
  intellectualization</b>. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: That is correct.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You make use of your intellect only where it works. The
  intellect has a limit; it can only go so far. When it is exhausted, it just lets go. That
  is when you experience the &quot;seeing.&quot; Then the &quot;understanding&quot; just
  hits you. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: But there is a price for this. My goodness, I had
  to pay so much -- all my pride, my likes and dislikes, my clinging. How I loved my
  clinging! I had to learn to let go of all that. It was not an easy thing. In fact, it was
  an enormous struggle, mind you, and sometimes agonizing.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, one does not get something for nothing. But it
  depends on how we persevere, how willing we are to look within ourselves. We have to be
  brave enough to face ourselves. That is a great struggle and it takes great effort and
  courage to do so. But it is, in fact, an effortless effort. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: Oh?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, you are making an effort without really consciously
  &quot;trying&quot; to make an effort. In Buddhism that is called viriya. It can happen in
  daily life or in sitting meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: You mean we are transcending ourselves during all
  this struggling?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Exactly. You've been doing that without knowing you were
  transcending yourself. In sitting meditation, you are taught the &quot;how-to&quot; of
  letting go at each and every step of the way. The difference here is that you let go
  without knowing it. Your intellect just simply cannot go any further; it just lets itself
  go. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: Oh, that's why, when I try to think about the
  Dhamma and our discussions, I don't really understand. But later on when I stop thinking
  about them, the &quot;understanding&quot; just strikes me. It isn't my doing. It just
  comes like lightning out of the blue. At one point I thought your discussions were too
  intellectual, especially the Abhidhamma teachings.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, you can even make use of the dullest intellectual
  treatise in the Pali Canon to transcend yourself! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: Well, that's something new.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even that is not! Nothing is ever wasted, if you know how
  to make use of it. All of our sessions, even the Abhidhamma teachings, helped you stretch
  your mind. You were making your mind more and more elastic without knowing it. You went
  further than you had ever gone before. Your mind had to stretch beyond its previous rigid
  orbit. The more difficult the discussions, the more your mind was exercised. You may not
  have understood anything during those sessions, but they helped you acquire the plasticity
  of mind that is so essential to going beyond the mundane. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: Yes, many times I felt lost and confused.</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That was because your intellect was at work. But when the
  intellect reaches its limit, it just drops away. Many of you have been asking me: what is
  the method? What do we have to do to achieve understanding? You are so conditioned to
  systems and methods and to structured learning that you can't see that there is an
  approach without any form or structure. What have we been doing in all our sessions? All
  the struggling you had to do within yourselves is the means to self-understanding. Whether
  you call it method or non-method is irrelevant. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: I see now. We were left very much on our own to
  sort things out by ourselves. No methods and no gurus.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, that is the way it is. When you have a guru, you
  cling to your guru. When you are working with a method, you cling to your method. You
  become dependent on them. Then you lose the impetus to investigate freely and learn for
  yourself. Our approach has no strict form or structure in the practice, but all the
  qualities of the bojjhanga -- the seven factors of enlightenment -- are already integrated
  in the process we have been in. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: What are the seven factors of enlightenment?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">They are mindfulness, investigation, energy, joy,
  tranquillity, concentration and equanimity. You have been practicing mindfulness with
  perseverance within the context of daily life, which in fact has been slowly building up
  concentration or samadhi. Not only that -- the act of mindfulness in daily life is also an
  investigative process into the nature of your own mind with equanimity. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The investigation is also taking place while you are
  reading, studying or discussing with the group. Remember that our discussions were not
  just theoretical. They dealt with how to incorporate the teachings into our lives and to
  see through our problems of living by using the Dhamma. We have also seen how we need the
  right amount of effort and energy to observe our mind, to study and investigate it. And we
  have found that the pursuit itself, though difficult, brings peace and joy. In this
  manner, our way of life itself then becomes the Path to Enlightenment. This is the
  practice of dhamma-nupassana. </font></p>
