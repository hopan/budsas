    <i><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Path of Sukkhavipassaka</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Samatha practices such as anapanasati meditations on the
    breath are not particularly necessary on the Path of Sukkhavipassaka. Together with
    observance of the three sila (moral precepts), panna (wisdom) can be developed. When the
    two panna factors develop, the three samadhi factors are also developed concomitantly.
    This is known as pañcangika magga. Herein Five Path factors are together integratedly
    developed. In conjunction with the three sila factors, they make up the Noble Eightfold
    Path. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Practicing this Path will also relieve mental afflictions.
    To practice this path requires a high level of intelligence, effort and perseverance. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">What is it to be free?</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Buddhist sense, &quot;free&quot; means to be free
  from all suffering, to reach inner freedom where suffering ceases to be. This is, of
  course, an ideal state of mind -- but how do we reach it? To reach inner freedom we must
  search for freedom with a &quot;free mind.&quot; It is like the saying, &quot;to catch a
  thief one must think like a thief.&quot; The sort of freedom one is trying to find is an
  absolute state -- nothing less -- infinite, unbounded and limitless. We are starting out
  with a mind that is finite, intellect-bound and already limited in itself. If we crowd
  this with all sorts of ideals, concepts, doctrines and judgments, the mind -- which is
  already weighed down by its own burden -- can never be free enough to experience truth in
  its entirety. It can only accept the truth or experience within the limits of doctrines,
  beliefs and concepts, which are products of the intellect. The mind can never break out of
  the intellectual conditioning we are trying to transcend. By clinging to a specific system
  or format in the search for inner freedom, we will be able to experience only that which
  the system or format allows. But Truth is infinite, unpossessed, unbounded. It does not
  belong to any religion, sect or system. All religions, all methods, all systems improvised
  by humankind are attempts to guide us on the path to Truth. Often, though, the
  &quot;way&quot; is mistaken for the &quot;Truth.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mind in search of its own freedom must first of all
  assume an impersonal attitude, which leaves it free to explore, investigate, examine and,
  most important of all, to &quot;experience.&quot; Most of us start with a personal need to
  find an inner freedom. In this state it is rather difficult to assume an impersonal
  approach, but such is the paradox of the inner path. As soon as we become personal, we
  tend to be judgmental and opinionated. Judgments and discriminations arise out of an
  intellectual and conditioned mind. As soon as one makes a judgment and discriminates, the
  intellect is at work. So long as the intellect is at the forefront of one's mind, it will
  always obstruct one's ability to experience fully one's own inner depth and essence. This
  is the reason that all the ways and means to liberation -- the inner paths -- transcend
  the intellect and move into the realm of the intuitive or the spiritual, for only the
  intuitive aspect of our mind can experience and realize Truth or freedom in its entirety.
  Different religious systems have developed methods and styles particular to their own
  historical, cultural and emotional backgrounds. Each of us is left to find the right path
  for ourselves. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whichever path one may adopt, the greatest danger is the
  accumulation of emotional possessions. These are &quot;my&quot; guru, &quot;my&quot;
  beliefs, &quot;my&quot; progress, &quot;my&quot; experience. Here again, one faces a
  paradox. A teacher's guidance is invariably necessary for one to proceed properly on the
  path, but it presents a hindrance if one is not careful. The most common problem is
  personally clinging to gurus and teachers. In fact, this is one of the most difficult
  hindrances to overcome in all quests for inner freedom. Letting go of beliefs, doctrines,
  gurus, ideals and judgments is extremely difficult, because one holds them very dear to
  oneself. They become one's possessions, like material wealth and power, and then one is
  not free and does not proceed further. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So what should one do? The only appropriate way is to view
  everything with equanimity, be it gurus, doctrines, ideals, and even one's own practice
  and progress. Only then can one view everything with objectivity. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Freedom is not just an end result. It is not something
  that awaits us at the end of our endeavor. Freedom is instantaneous, right now, from the
  very beginning. We can be &quot;free&quot; in the very process of the search, in
  experiencing, in every step along the way. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>To achieve freedom requires only two things: a silent
  mind and an open heart. </b></font></p>
