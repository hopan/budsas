  </font></p>
  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Creative Living</font></h3>
  <b><i><p><font face="Times New Roman">H: I have the impression that Buddhism is very
  individualistic in its teachings.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> It would seem so, but we are not isolated
  beings. We live in society. Therefore, what affects an individual invariably affects all
  those around him or her. Buddhism focuses a great deal on each individual's enlightenment.
  Although it does not neglect the community, it has to start with the individual. When each
  individual is well centered and in perfect equilibrium within him or herself, he or she
  naturally draws others' centers into balance, and hence the community as well. In other
  words, a spontaneous equilibrium is created within any given situation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>H: How does this come about?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no magic formula for it, but two basic
  ingredients, patience and panna (wisdom), bring forth the harmony. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>H: Isn't patience also a form of passivity?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one is patient and tolerant but does not have panna,
  that patience and tolerance can take the form of passivity. In such a case, one can even
  allow oneself to be abused in many ways. This is not intelligent living. Intelligent
  living avoids both extremes -- passivity and impulsiveness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These days people are always in a hurry and tend to be
  afflicted with the disease of impatience. We are plagued with the urge to &quot;act&quot;
  instantly, to get &quot;going,&quot; to &quot;move,&quot; and to &quot;do&quot; something
  in haste. We leave no time to reflect, to stop, to absorb, and to let things evolve or
  emerge by themselves. One tends to react through one's conditioned chaotic mind -- rather
  than acting in a cool and collected way -- thus creating more chaos. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Any action without intelligence is destructive.
  Intelligent living means &quot;watching&quot; and &quot;seeing&quot; the right moment, the
  right opportunity, the appropriate situation, in which to act. In Buddhism this is known
  as samma kammanta (complete and skillful action). In short, intelligent living means
  skillful and creative living. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>H: Then, if intelligence and patience are both
  relevant to skillful living, how are they related? How do they come together?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Panna (wisdom) and patience are like two sides of a coin.
  If there is intelligence, then patience arises by itself. Patience without intelligence is
  just contrived benevolence; it doesn't last long. Sooner or later one runs out of
  patience. True tolerance arises only through panna. You see, panna brings with it the <b>four
  brahma viharas</b> or sublime states, namely,<b> metta</b> (unconditional love), <b>karuna</b>
  (compassion),<b> mudita</b> (sympathetic joy) and <b>upekkha</b> (equanimity). Only love,
  compassion and equanimity provide a person with true benevolence. Equanimity leaves the
  person concerned detached from clinging; love and compassion help the person to identify
  with others; and panna leads the person to take the right action. All these together lead
  to true benevolence. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>H: Well then, how does one live in harmony with
  others?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is an extremely important question. It is a matter of
  focusing on your own equilibrium. This is the most fundamental issue. Whatever situation
  you are facing -- whether it is personal, social, one's career, family, friends, etc. --
  equilibrium must start right there ... with you. If you are shaky, how can you bring
  others into balance? The equilibrium must start right here, within yourself. Otherwise,
  you will only sink the ship with your shakiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Only when you are completely stable and well-centered can
  you reach out to others' inner states. You cannot change others by purposeful and forceful
  means. The change, first of all, must come from within yourself. The equilibrium must
  start right there within you. When you have struck the right balance within yourself, this
  balance will pervade the whole situation and will, by itself, affect others' equilibrium.
  It is a spontaneous occurrence. Your own tranquillity will allow other people and
  situations to respond to you very naturally. We need to retain an open heart, so that
  whenever we do anything, our action will be out of love and compassion and nothing less.
  This kind of living and loving generates tremendous energy for harmonious, creative and
  joyful life. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Love and Hate</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">She was just out of college; to know her was like a breath
  of fresh air. She was full of life, intelligent and pleasant, with a youthful inquiring
  mind. She was becoming a spiritual friend. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">She told me about a person she had hated since college
  days. This troubled her so much that even in her dreams he was bothering her. That was why
  she wanted to know about love and hate. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>S: Can you explain to me about love and hate?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> Well, you see, love and hate are not so
  different. They are two aspects of our discriminating mind, like two sides of the same
  coin. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>S: But they feel so different.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, initially they are different, but they both arise out
  of our habit of discrimination, and they both lead to suffering. Whether we love or hate
  someone is based on our own likes and dislikes. We automatically categorize people
  according to our own preconceptions. When they meet our ideals and appear to be to our
  liking, immediately our mind starts to cling to them; and if they should fall into the
  category of dislike, our minds start to reject them. In this way we end up loving or
  hating. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>S: But how can we stop loving and hating? I find
  both situations equally frustrating.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's think about a situation where you love a person at
  one time and come to hate him at another. He is the same person, so why do your feelings
  about him change? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>S: Probably because that person and I have changed.</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">True. That means our love changes with each changing
  situation, and that means our feelings are not permanent, but relative to time and place. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>S: Our feelings are not permanent?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Exactly. This is what the Buddha called maya, the illusion
  of the mind. Our feelings are an illusion born of our conceptual mind; they arise from the
  ego- self. According to Buddhism, since ego is an illusion, anything that is born of the
  conceptual mind is also an illusion. It has no substance, permanence or peace. That is why
  mundane love is fickle. That is why it can change to hate. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">About a week later she came to see me again, and this
  time, in great excitement, she said to me: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>S: I fully understand now what you said about love
  and hate! I met that person the other day and, to my great surprise, I found myself going
  up to him and even greeting him without hesitation. I don't know why, but I don't feel any
  animosity toward him anymore. Before, I used to hate even the sight of him. It is really
  such a great relief to me. I feel free now!</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let me ask you one thing: before you met this person did
  you have this feeling of hate in you? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>S: Why, come to think of it, I didn't.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what about now; do you still have it? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>S: No.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, what is the difference, before and after? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">[Then she burst into laughter, saying:] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>S: Very true!</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, you were free of this hate or love before you met
  him, weren't you? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>S: Yes, that's right.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What did you have to do to be free like that? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>S: Well, I didn't have to do anything. I was free by
  myself.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's right. By ourselves we are free of either loving or
  hating. Only when we start to like or dislike do we become entangled in our own emotions.
  As soon as we come to realize that they are illusions of our own making, we become free.
  We are brought back to our original situation where there is neither love nor hate. Only
  when the mind starts to work on liking and disliking is the burden of love and hate built
  up and we lose that freedom temporarily. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a real-life example of how the cloud of <b>moha</b>
  (delusion), once lifted, leads to freedom and self-realization in the moment. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Happiness</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day a friend found me reading Buddhism and asked,
  &quot;Are you trying to find happiness?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> Yes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: Have you found it?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, I have. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: How?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By realizing that I cannot find it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: But how can that be?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no such thing as a feeling of happiness that is
  permanent and everlasting. Those feelings of elation and pleasure that arise whenever we
  come across things, people or events that satisfy and please us are but momentary. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We hanker after pleasurable feelings, thinking that if we
  get everything we want we will be happy. When we try to find satisfaction outside of
  ourselves, we end up running in circles. We can never get total satisfaction from others,
  just as we can never provide them with it. We simply forget that others are in the same
  position as we are! They expect the same kind of satisfaction from you and me. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As soon as we try to find happiness, we are already on the
  road to unhappiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: Is there no way out?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, there is a way out. We will find happiness only when
  we stop looking for it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: But that's difficult.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is the paradox. The moment we want happiness, we
  start to cling to it in our mind. First, we cling to our own idea of happiness. We relate
  to the outside world as a source of satisfaction and look outward for the things we
  normally associate with happiness -- accumulating wealth, success, fame or power. As soon
  as we become attached to any idea -- happiness, success or whatever -- there is already
  some stress. Clinging is itself a stressful state, and everything that derives from it is
  also stressful. For example, try to clench your hand to make a fist. As soon as you start
  to clench your hand, you have to use energy to keep your fingers clenched tightly. When
  you let go of the clenching, your hand is free again. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it is with the mind. When it is in such a state of
  clenching, it can never be free. It can never experience peace or happiness, even if one
  has all the wealth, fame and power in the world. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: So how do we get out of this?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The only way is to let go. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: Let go of what?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Your desire for happiness. </font></p>
  <hr width="30%">
  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Love and Compassion</font></h3>
  <b><i><p><font face="Times New Roman">A: What is true compassion?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> Compassion (karuna in Pali), as taught in
  Buddhism, is one of four sublime states (brahma vihara) that are inherent qualities of
  wisdom (panna). The other three are unconditional love (metta), sympathetic joy (mudita)
  and equanimity (upekkha). An act of compassion is not isolated, but is also an expression
  of these other qualities of wisdom. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>A: Suppose you have a friend who is an alcoholic,
  and you want to help her. What would be the right thing to do if she refuses to take your
  advice?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>B: Even if my own son happened to be a victim, I
  would suggest that he go to the hospital. I would help him all I could if he wanted to go.
  If not, that's it, and I would not feel angry or say anything.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, if what you are saying is that we can't help someone
  who is not ready to be helped, that is very true. But we have to be very careful here. We
  have to examine our own minds very carefully. There is a fine line between equanimity and
  indifference. If we try to perform an act of compassion in a detached way, with no wisdom
  governing the act, there is danger. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>B: Why is that so?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because, first of all, only wisdom can differentiate
  between equanimity and indifference. A person can be very proficient in dissociating
  herself or himself emotionally from any situation or from people. But that kind of
  detachment is not true equanimity; it is only a delusion, and the delusion itself can lead
  to indifference and negligence. You can be led to think that so long as your duty is done,
  that's it; the rest has nothing to do with you. You must also differentiate between
  fulfilling duty with indifference and acting with love and compassion. There is a very
  fine line between them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>B: Then what is upekkha or equanimity if it isn't
  detachment?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Detachment is the opposite of attachment. It means
  disengaging or dissociating from somebody or something. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Equanimity is that which transcends both attachment and
  detachment.</b> It means seeing things as they are, without clinging or rejecting. It goes
  beyond attachment and detachment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>B: What is the difference between equanimity and
  indifference?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Indifference is the result of a lack of concern, a lack of
  love. But<b> equanimity is born from wisdom and love</b>. It is not an isolated quality in
  itself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is part and parcel of wisdom, love, compassion and joy.
  Likewise, compassion is not an isolated feeling. If it were isolated, then it could
  probably be induced by a conditioned behavior based on the idea of compassion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>A: Then what is true compassion?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">True compassion and love are spontaneous manifestations of
  panna (wisdom). If there is panna, there is already love, compassion, joy and equanimity.
  They are all present in a single act of compassion. That act encompasses all these
  qualities. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, in the case of the alcoholic son, wisdom
  would give you the insight to look at the total situation -- what alcoholism is doing to
  your son and whether it is affecting others; what it is doing to the whole family; and the
  mental, social and economic misery and suffering resulting from alcoholism. You may be
  detached and not be affected by his refusal to take up your suggestion, but your
  equanimity should not turn into indifference. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a vast and very crucial difference between <b>detaching
  yourself from your emotions and detaching yourself from the situation</b>. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You can still be genuinely concerned and actively involved
  in any situation without expending your emotional resources. Your own insight into the
  total situation and your love for the whole family leads you to the right action in that
  particular situation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>B: So we could say that wisdom and love serve as
  checks and balances to equanimity.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, that's right. Love keeps you involved in the
  situation; compassion leads you to identify yourself with others; equanimity helps you to
  transcend emotional involvement and see things objectively; and wisdom helps you identify
  the right solution to the problem or situation for the benefit of yourself as well as of
  others. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>A: What about sympathetic joy? How would joy come
  into this integrated action?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">An act is joyless if it is done on the basis of pure duty.
  Joy is also lacking if you help someone out of pity. Duty and pity fall short of true
  compassion. Joy is present only when an act is born of wisdom, love, compassion and
  equanimity. Such action is joyful because it is not restrained by attachment nor burdened
  with worries and anxieties. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Love and joy bring perseverance to compassion. One does
  not give up easily until some good comes out of an adverse situation. An act of joy with
  no emotional attachment makes the involvement itself fulfilling. This is an act born of a
  free mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>B: What do you mean by a free mind?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A free mind is a mind free from fixation on anything, free
  even from a concept of compassion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>B: What do you mean by that?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A free mind is a mind that is purely in the present
  moment. Because it lacks any fixations, it can view the total situation and adapt to
  prevailing circumstances -- then you can act accordingly. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose the alcoholic is your friend. How you would act
  would be slightly different from your actions toward a son. For the latter, you have a far
  greater moral responsibility than for a friend. Furthermore, your behavior would change
  according to your standing and relationship with that friend, his attitude, receptivity,
  etc. Many factors would determine how much you could be involved. On the other hand, if
  you have a sick child, you would not hesitate to put the child in the hospital, whether
  the child appreciates your decision or not. Every situation is unique and no fixed rule
  can be applied to all situations. The only criterion that the Buddha set was that one
  should act on what would benefit oneself and the other person. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>B: So, there are no hard and fast rules for
  compassion?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The real reason we are having this discussion is that I am
  very concerned that any generalization I make might be taken as a guideline for action,
  even in the name of compassion. A fixed idea or guideline for action may not work for
  every situation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Fixation leads to conditioning; every time you meet with a
  similar situation, you react in the same conditioned way, even though there may be
  differences in the situation. The mind must be free from any fixation; only then can true
  compassion arise. Every situation we face is unique and different from any other. Each
  situation has to be dealt with differently according to the needs and benefits of that
  particular situation. Without clear insight, if your action proves disastrous, you and
  others may suffer needlessly. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Equanimity and Indifference</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One friend always drops in to visit me for a Dhamma
  discussion when he's in town. He is a devout Buddhist who has been studying and practicing
  the Dhamma in Sri Lanka with his Abbot teacher for many years. My friend had written me
  that he wanted to discuss my article on Love and Compassion. He launched into the subject
  as soon as he arrived. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>G: I was quite struck by the piece &quot;Love and
  Compassion&quot; and I am very glad you wrote about it, because it is one of the problems
  I am actually facing right now with my teenage son. It is very true that when you have
  studied the Dhamma, you learn to detach yourself from others, but it is, as you said, very
  difficult to differentiate between equanimity and indifference. And very often we confuse
  the two. I find that when I detach myself, I also withdraw from people.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> Yes, when we first study the Dhamma and
  learn to apply it to our own lives, we start by learning to detach ourselves, to let go.
  This is because we are so conditioned, mentally and emotionally, to cling to everything
  that relates to us. We learn to distance ourselves from the situation so that, instead of
  being absolutely immersed and caught up in it, we can look at it more objectively. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>G: Like becoming a witness?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, initially we must learn to be a witness and not be
  emotionally involved. We need to be objective, to see the situation as it is, without
  bias. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But in so doing -- unless we have very astute guidance --
  we may end up detaching ourselves all too thoroughly. The detachment may overtake other
  feelings, like concern for and interest in the welfare and benefits of others. This may
  lead to psychological dissociation from the person because we can falsify our satisfaction
  and assume that we have done our duty and that there is nothing further to be done. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>G: That is so true. I find it very difficult to
  impress on my son what I think is in his best interest. I have become somewhat detached
  now, since he does not really respond. I thought I had done my duty and it was up to him
  to take it from there. If he didn't, then what could I do? I used to think that way. Now,
  I see that this is not desirable.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, when we withdraw in one way we also tend to withdraw
  in other ways. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>G: Why does it happen like that?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This also is a kind of conditioning. Previously, we were
  conditioned to cling to everything. When we study the Dhamma, we are taught to
  &quot;uncling&quot; or let go; however, instead of clinging to all sorts of things, we now
  cling to the idea itself of letting go. So we become conditioned to the opposite extreme.
  We let go of virtually everything. Thus, when we are faced with a situation we tend to
  react by letting go of both the situation and the people. Even letting go can become a
  habit. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>G: A habit?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You see, the mind is a peculiar thing. It is used to being
  fixed on something -- past experiences and memories, past learning, ideas, etc. Because of
  this, we cannot experience each moment without attachment to anything. We even cling to
  the best of Dhamma ideas. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The idea of letting go is also a concept. This concept is
  useful when we begin to study the Dhamma, or when we practice meditation. But eventually
  we become so proficient at detachment that we don't realize we are clinging to yet another
  concept. From the concept of self we switch to the concept of non- self, the idea that
  &quot;it has nothing to do with me.&quot; This leads to disinterest and lack of concern
  for others. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a result, you may unconsciously close your mind as well
  as your heart even to those closest to you. This creates a barrier between you and those
  in your life. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>G: Is this what you mean by indifference?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, it is. From detachment, we unwittingly move on to
  indifference. Mind you, this is not purposeful indifference; there is no intention behind
  it. It's simple conditioning. So long as the mind responds to people and situations in any
  conditioned way, love and compassion have no space to evolve. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>G: How does love evolve then?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Love evolves only in a mind that is totally free, free
  from fixation on any idea -- even the idea of letting go. We have to learn to free
  ourselves from the idea of letting go. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>G: But how do we free ourselves from this concept?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By mindfulness of the moment. Let me stress this. As soon
  as you realize that you are clinging to the idea of letting go, you will drop the letting
  go. In that moment of &quot;dropping&quot; you are free. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a Zen parable about a student holding a pot in
  each hand. When the Master saw him, he shouted, &quot;Drop it!&quot;, and the student
  dropped one pot. Again the Master commanded, &quot;Drop it!&quot;, and the student dropped
  the other pot. Again the Master shouted, &quot;Drop it!&quot;, and the student became
  enlightened. Everything dropped from his mind. He became absolutely free. At that moment
  of absolute freedom the pupil experienced Truth. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we realize that we are conditioned to letting go, we
  spontaneously transcend the conditioning. We stop clinging to the idea of letting go of
  our concern for and interest in others. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Only in moments of complete freedom from either
  attachment or detachment can upekkha (equanimity) transcend both states of mind.</b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Only then can insight arise spontaneously as to what is
  the best approach to the situation. If the situation needs our concern, we give it; if it
  needs our interest, we give it; if our action or intervention is necessary, we do not
  hesitate. We let go and pick up at the same time. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>G: Could you explain a little more?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is important to let go of clinging to your fixed ideas
  -- to self, or to the desire to change others, for example. But at the same time, you need
  to pick up the threads of life. In short, make your actions into pure acts -- straight
  from the heart. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, in the case of a child who has not come of
  age, indifference on the part of parents is very undesirable -- even dangerous. Children
  do not have sufficient knowledge and maturity to decide many things on their own. They
  require our continued concern and interest. So long as our acts do not arise out of
  egoism, and we have enough insight into the needs of our children, we can reach out to
  them. But if the idea of &quot;letting go&quot; creates a barrier within ourselves, we
  will be paralyzed. We have, first of all, to deal with our own inner problems, our desire
  to control. Then we can deal effectively with those outside. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>G: But what about being a witness? If you are a mere
  witness you will not be concerned or involved.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is true. Initially you need to learn to be a witness
  -- to detach yourself emotionally from situations. But being a witness is only a phase in
  learning to be objective. When we have learned to be objective, we have to step back into
  the drama of life again. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>G: But won't we be caught up again in the same old
  cycle of affairs?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, that is a danger. If you have not gained any insight
  by your withdrawal, you may return to the same vicious cycle. But if you have really
  understood how to &quot;let go and pick up at the same time,&quot; you won't get tangled
  up again. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You see, when you step back into the drama, you step back
  differently. Now, you act with clear understanding rather than fear or ignorance.
  Previously, you looked at the situation through your ego -- you saw everything through
  filters. It was impossible to see the entire situation when you wanted to control the
  situation. Before, it was more important to justify your ego-hood. Now, after stepping
  back and removing the filters, you can see clearly the whole panorama of what is happening
  around you. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The more freedom you have in the moment, the more clarity
  you have about the situation. This clarity brings with it a sensitivity and compassion for
  others which keeps you involved, even if they don't respond immediately. You can persevere
  in your search for a way to benefit others, because you are not emotionally burdened. The
  act of involvement itself becomes joyful because it is a free act, an act of pure love and
  spontaneity. You are part of the whole; you are no longer isolated from others. You are
  connected to them without losing yourself in their problems. You stand free, yet you are
  not apart. That is true equanimity. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Sense Pleasures</font></h3>
  <b><i><p><font face="Times New Roman">SDD: I have just read something by a well known
  Buddhist teacher on sense pleasures and how they are the scourge of human beings. The
  teacher talks about how clinging to sense pleasures creates problems in society</i></b>. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> It is true that there is excessive
  indulgence in sense pleasures. No doubt, modern civilization has become too preoccupied
  with them and allowed itself to be enslaved by them. Let us look objectively at the root
  cause of the problem. Otherwise, we fall into the trap of rejecting the sense world and
  escaping from it, and in the end this is the same as being enslaved by the senses. It is
  possible to be bound up in rejecting the sense world. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SDD: How is that?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you think preoccupation with the sense world is the
  root cause of the human problem, you may feel a sense of guilt where sensual enjoyment is
  concerned. You may even be afraid to experience sensual pleasures. This can lead to
  escapism and phobias if you are not careful. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SDD: Then what is the solution to this?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Craving after sense pleasures is primarily due to
  insecurity and not recognizing craving in ourselves. We don't know what we are lacking, so
  we look outside ourselves. We try to fill our emotional vacuum with all kinds of
  diversions. And, of course, with the rampant commercialism, the handiest thing is to
  indulge in all kinds of new experiences that cater to the senses. But invariably we find
  that there is no end to indulgence and pleasure-seeking. There is no lasting and absolute
  satisfaction from these sense pleasures because we are not free in the moment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SDD: Why is that so?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mind, in its state of insecurity, needs to cling to
  something -- material possessions, sense pleasures, distractions, wealth, fame, success or
  just about anything on earth -- in order to fill the emotional vacuum. Actually, all these
  give us is a false sense of security or temporary satisfaction. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SDD: How does one deal with insecurity?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is only one way to deal with insecurity. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SDD: What is that?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is to arrive at the understanding that security cannot
  be found anywhere or in anything. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SDD: Oh? Why is that?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the search for security itself that makes the mind
  insecure; the mind is so bound up with the search that it is not free to experience what
  can be found in the present moment. We tend to project ourselves into the future, so we
  cannot live fully in the present; we experience the present only partially. Thus we do not
  experience the freshness of each moment. But if each moment is experienced fully with
  every encounter, the beauty and the joy that day-to-day surroundings bring become so
  obvious that there is no need to look for satisfaction elsewhere. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SDD: But how does one learn to live in the present
  moment?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It all goes back to being mindful in the moment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SDD: Mindful of what? Is it on the body or on what
  you are doing?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness on the body does help you to exist in the
  present moment, but the most crucial thing is to realize your own freedom in the moment.
  If you start to want this and want that, thinking about the past or thinking about how you
  are going to enjoy the future, you are not free. Your present moment is preoccupied with
  the wanting and as a result your natural freedom in the moment is lost. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SDD: You mean, we are naturally free but make
  ourselves &quot;un-free?&quot;</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, it is as though you were being tied by with an
  invisible rope, by no one but yourself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SDD: What you mean is, when you realize that there
  is no such thing as a rope tying you, you are already free!</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's exactly it. You are back to your natural freedom in
  the moment, and you can experience relationships afresh, in ordinary living. Even very
  mundane things become so fulfilling that there is no need to search for freedom elsewhere
  or to be dependent on new experiences and sense pleasures. You see, this natural freedom
  in us is the only permanent thing, because it is the innate essence of our being; it is
  life's natural gift. Everything outside of ourselves is contrived and unsatisfactory. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, to be free of sense pleasure is neither to cling to
  nor run away from it, but to learn to be free in yourself. From this premise of freedom in
  yourself, the sense world will neither threaten nor attract you. Then you will be able to
  experience sense pleasures without becoming a slave to them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In fact, we don't study the Dhamma to shut out the
  external world or to be enslaved by it, but to arrive at our innate natural freedom. Then
  we can experience the world as it is, in its beauty and ugliness, in the mundane as well
  as the extraordinary, without having hang-ups or being caught by life's snares. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Outward Form</font></h3>
  <b><i><p><font face="Times New Roman">D: You said we should neither cling to form nor
  reject it. How do we know if we are clinging or not?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thynn: It depends on whether or not you are having
  conflicts with yourself regarding form. Society requires certain forms. You are expected
  to behave in a certain way, dress in a certain manner. This conventional truth is called
  pannati. It means knowing which form is appropriate for that situation. But if you cling
  to the form, your mind will be rigid and you will enslave yourself to form. On the other
  hand, if you reject the form while you are in it, then you are also enslaved. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>D: Why is that so?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you reject something, you are clinging to your
  rejection. Your mind becomes fixed on the rejection. Clinging or rejecting, either way,
  your mind is fixed and can never be free of conflict. You perpetually struggle. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>D: How does we get out of this fixation?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You have to transcend the dualism of form as well as of
  not-form. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You cling to form or reject it because you have set up
  likes and dislikes in your mind. Perhaps you reject a conventional truth. Although this
  truth is relative, it is still the established norm for the moment. When you rebel against
  a form, you are unable to accept things as they are. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>D: But how can we accept a form if it is against our
  better judgment?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is exactly the point. It is precisely because of our
  value judgments that we are unable to see things as they are. We see things according to
  our way of thinking. Our likes and dislikes become our frame of reference. We reject
  outright anything that does not fit into this framework. Conversely, if something fits
  into our framework, we embrace it as our possession. Our mind always flits between these
  two extremes, clinging and rejecting. As long as our minds are polarized in this manner,
  we continue to be attached. When we are so attached to our likes and dislikes, how can our
  minds be free to see form as it is? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>D: Then what do we do?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is nothing to do but learn to be silent, to not
  judge the form. As soon as you stop judging, your likes and dislikes will also cease, as
  will your clinging and rejecting. Once you stop being judgmental, you will see the form as
  the form, no more, no less. You will see it as it is and you will be able to relate to it
  freely. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unhindered by rejecting or clinging, you can function
  within form or no-form. </font></p>
  <hr width="30%">
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Ordinary Awareness</i></b> Being a close friend, and
  closer still in spirit, makes possible open and free communication without constraint
  either way. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: I am aware of a stillness in me that is so
  peaceful and exquisite that I feel as if I were living in a cocoon</i></b>. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> This is only a phase. It will pass away, and
  later it will become ordinary. There is nothing extraordinary about peace. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: But this is not ordinary! I felt this peace when
  I was very young, but when I grew up I became filled with emotions, conflicts and
  frustrations, and I lost this stillness. Only now, through meditation and study of the
  Dhamma, am I beginning to experience this again! This is a marvelous thing and it is
  definitely not ordinary. What I mean by ordinary is the angers and frustrations I went
  through before. I don't have them now. That is what I mean by not being ordinary.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is true that the feeling of marvel and exquisiteness
  makes one think one is enveloped in a cocoon. This is only in the beginning. This feeling
  of exquisiteness -- or whatever you want to call it -- will fade away like everything
  else. For the moment, you feel separate from others and may even think yourself above
  them. Actually, there is neither above nor below. We are all the same as human beings. We
  all possess this inner stillness, everyone of us. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We are neither better nor worse than others. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is just that we are more fortunate than some others
  because we have been presented with a set of circumstances in which we can learn to
  experience this inherent inner quality. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: You mean everyone has it in them?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course. Most people are not aware of this peace because
  they are caught up with their emotions and everything that goes on outside of themselves.
  In Buddhism, this is called moha, or delusion. Just because we know how to look within
  doesn't make us any different from others. If we think we are different, we are creating a
  huge gulf between ourselves and others. We are creating a mental division and will never
  be at one with them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: But why do you say this awareness of peace is
  ordinary?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, you see, it may seem extraordinary to you now
  because for a long time you have been functioning with a roller-coaster mind. But the
  newness will wear out and this awareness of peace will become second nature. Once you
  become accustomed to this relatively new state of mind, it becomes just an ordinary way of
  being, an everyday awareness. The only difference is that previously your awareness was
  tied to the outside world and to your emotions and confusions. Now it has learned to stay
  in its own peace. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: But how did we lose our peace?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We never lost peace; it has always been there. We were
  just too preoccupied with our emotions and were not aware of our peaceful state. This
  peaceful state is nothing extraordinary. But one has to be very careful here. As long as
  we think this stillness is extraordinary, we cling to it. This clinging is so subtle and
  refined that it is difficult to recognize in oneself. One does not realize that one is
  still on a very refined ego trip. So long as that is the case, even when one experiences
  stillness through samadhi (concentration), there is no chance for panna (wisdom) to arise.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: Why is that?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even a very concentrated mind, if it is not completely
  free, impedes the unfolding of wisdom. You see, in achieving samadhi, although you can
  suppress defilements to some extent, they are not totally extinguished. Samadhi enables
  the mind to achieve a sharpness and sensitivity that is greater than ordinary. This
  sensitivity is what experiences peace and stillness so clearly. Sensitivity has its
  drawbacks in that the stillness is so unique and exquisite that one clings to its
  uniqueness. Thus self-importance arises. Many are stuck in this way and are unable to
  proceed from there. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: Don't you need samadhi to achieve panna (wisdom)?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sure -- but let's be clear. There are two kinds of
  samadhi. In addition to jhanic samadhi, there is also what is called khanika samadhi. It
  is only momentary in nature but it is penetrating enough to realize Truth. Khanika samadhi
  can occur even without strenuous meditative efforts, given the right circumstances and
  mental state. Even in jhanic samadhi, realization of Truth or anatta (not-self) is only
  momentary. After that, one is back to ordinary consciousness. The unfolding of insight
  wisdom with khanika samadhi occurs with few or none of the mystic experiences or
  sensations of bliss that are usually encountered in jhanic samadhi; thus, the person has
  no chance to cling to blissful sensations. Before they know it, they are back to ordinary
  consciousness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: But don't people who experience khanika samadhi
  also accumulate some experiences they hang on to?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course they do, and that is why in all cases there
  should be a guiding hand to help people free themselves from their own achievements. As I
  said just now, clinging to progress on the spiritual path is so subtle that it is never
  easy for us to realize this in ourselves. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: Would a teacher know it?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It depends upon the sensitivity of the teacher and his or
  her own experience. But a truly wise teacher should be able to detect where the clinging
  or the problem is and help accordingly. I still remember clearly eighteen years ago when
  my teachers chastized me mercilessly for getting a swelled head. Thinking back now, I
  realize how fortunate I was to experience my teachers' great compassion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>E: Wasn't it painful for you at that time?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course it was. I was only thirty-three then and the
  only woman in the Dhamma circle. You can imagine how inflated I became with all the praise
  and attention I was getting. My teachers saw all of this and took it upon themselves to
  put me in my right place. They taught me the essence and virtue of humility. From them I
  learned that spiritual achievement without wisdom and humility is useless to oneself or
  humanity. </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The essence of the spiritual path lies only in the
    beauty of the ordinariness, in the mundane, and in the freedom from separation of the
    spiritual and the ordinary. </font></b></p>
