<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
  <i><b>A: I have a lot of worries and stress. I try to meditate in order to relax, but it
  is no use.</b></i> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> In this fast-moving world, meditation is
  regarded as an instant remedy for life's ills. If you look upon meditation as merely a
  tranquilizer, you are underestimating its true value. Yes, relaxation does occur through
  meditation, but that is only one of its many results. Meditation in Buddhism is neither an
  instant cure nor just a stress-relieving measure. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation in Buddhism means cultivation of the mind in
  order to achieve insight wisdom or pañña, ultimately leading to liberation or nibbana. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i><b>D: Nibbana aside, I want to meditate, but I cannot
  find the time.</b></i> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you speak of meditation, you may think of the type of
  meditation that is popular these days, the sitting form of meditation. But that form is
  merely an aid, a support to develop a mental discipline of mindfulness and equanimity. The
  form should not be mistaken for the path. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The popular notion is that you need to set aside a special
  time or place to meditate. In actuality, if meditation is to help you acquire peace of
  mind as you function in your life, then it must be a dynamic activity, part and parcel of
  your daily experience. Meditation is here and now, moment-to-moment, amid the ups and
  downs of life, amid conflicts, disappointments and heartaches -- amid success and stress.
  If you want to understand and resolve anger, desires, attachments and all the myriad
  emotions and conflicts, need you go somewhere else to find the solution? If your house was
  on fire, you wouldn't go somewhere else to put out the fire, would you? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you really want to understand your mind, you must watch
  it while it is angry, while it desires, while it is in conflict. You must pay attention to
  the mind as the one-thousand-and-one thoughts and emotions rise and fall. The moment you
  pay attention to your emotions, you will find that they lose their strength and eventually
  die out. However, when you are inattentive, you find that these emotions go on and on.
  Only after the anger has subsided are you aware that you have been angry. By then, either
  you have made some unwanted mistakes or you have ended up emotionally drained. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: How do you handle these emotions? I know that
  when I am angry I want to shout and throw things. Should I control these emotions or
  express them?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The natural inclination is to try to control the emotions.
  But when they are kept under a lid, they try to escape. They either rush out with a bang
  or they leak out as sickness or neuroses. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: What should I do? Do I let my emotions go wild?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Certainly not. That is exactly what we don't want to do.
  That is another extreme -- to release your emotions impulsively. The important thing is
  neither control nor non-control. In either situation you are working up your desire to
  control. Neither situation is tenable. So long as this desire occupies your mind, your
  mind is not free to see anger as it is. Hence another paradox arises: the more you want to
  be free of the anger, the more you are not free of it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To understand the mind, you have to watch and pay
  attention with an uncluttered, silent mind. When your mind is chattering away, all the
  time asking questions, then it lacks the capacity to look. It is too busy asking
  questions, answering, asking. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Try to experience watching yourself in silence. That
  silence is the silence of the mind free from discriminations, free from likes and
  dislikes, free from clinging. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thoughts and emotions by themselves are just momentary and
  possess no life of their own. By clinging to them, you prolong their stay. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Only when your mind is free from clinging and rejecting
  can it see anger as anger, desire as desire. As soon as you &quot;see,&quot; your mental
  process is fully preoccupied with &quot;seeing,&quot; and in that split second anger dies
  a natural death. This seeing, or insight, called panna, arises as a spontaneous awareness
  that can be neither practiced nor trained. This awareness brings new insight into life,
  new clarity and new spontaneity in action. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, you see, meditation need not be separate from life and
  its daily ups and downs. If you are to experience peace in this everyday world, you need
  to watch, understand and deal with your anger, desire and ignorance as they occur. Only
  when you cease to be involved with your emotions can the peaceful nature of your mind
  emerge. This peace-nature enables you to live every moment of your life completely. With
  this newfound understanding and awareness, you can live as a complete individual with
  greater sensitivity. You will come to view life with new and fresh perceptions. Strangely
  enough, what you saw as problems before are problems no more. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Staying with the Moment</font></h3>
  <b><i><p><font face="Times New Roman">R: You say I can meditate in daily life by
  cultivating sati (paying attention) in my mind. But I find that very difficult; my mind is
  too distracted.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> That is not unusual. You see, to focus on
  your mind as you function in everyday life, you need to turn your mind inside out. Indeed,
  your mind must be strong and focused in order to be mindful of itself. So naturally it is
  difficult to focus on your mind if you are agitated or distracted. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i><b>R: How can I start then?</b></i> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Try being mindful of whatever you are doing at the moment
  -- walking, sitting, bathing, cleaning, looking at a flower. You can do this at any time
  and in any place. As you train your mind to focus, you will find you are less distracted.
  Later, as you go on, you can be mindful of your thoughts and emotions as they arise. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose you are driving. You have to pay attention to the
  driving, don't you? Your mind has to be there at the time and place of driving,
  concentrating on the road, watching the other drivers. You cannot afford to be distracted
  too much by other thoughts. It is something like meditation on the task at hand. But often
  we do not carry out other tasks in this concentrated way. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>D: Why not?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Probably because they are less dangerous than driving. But
  you can apply the same principle to other activities. Suppose you are eating. If your mind
  is distracted, you may not even be aware of tasting the food, let alone enjoying it. Only
  when you focus on eating can you really enjoy the food. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same is true even in passive activities. Suppose you
  are sitting on a bus. Try simply to be where you are, rather than letting your mind
  wander. Train your mind to focus on your surroundings. Be aware of the other people on the
  bus, how fast the bus is going, and where it is going. This is a very good way to start
  meditation. Simply be where you are rather than letting your mind roam. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>P: I have tried being mindful of the moment. But it
  is strenuous and I get all tangled up.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For goodness sakes, staying with the moment is only a
  figure of speech. It is not a commandment to be followed rigidly. This is not a
  proficiency test. You must understand this from the outset; otherwise you will be tied up
  in knots trying too hard every second of the day. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you become too involved with staying in the moment, you
  lose the art of living -- of free flowing. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You must realize that staying with the moment is just a
  means to break the mind's old habits. Usually the mind flitters between thoughts and
  feelings about the past, present and future. Staying with the moment is just a way to
  train the mind to cease flitting. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is not important that you be with the moment every
  single moment of the day. What is important is that you learn to get out of the constant
  mental run-around and to be more focused and grounded. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once you break the habit of the roaming mind, you will
  find you are more centered and more with the present moment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SD: What do we gain from this?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is a very pertinent question. Of course, you will
  have better concentration, but you can achieve concentration without learning the art of
  meditation. Many activities -- golf, chess, reading -- enhance concentration. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SD: What is the difference between those activities
  and moment-to-moment meditation?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you look into the process involved in those activities,
  you will see an element of desire -- the desire to achieve perfection, to win a game, to
  feel good, whatever. You are motivated by desire. Also, there is an end to the activity
  and so to the concentration. Concentration is also very important in meditation, but it is
  not everything. If we simply concentrate, we will not get any further benefit. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To meditate, it is crucial to be mindful without desire,
  without aversion, without likes and dislikes, and without goals. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you can be mindful without judgments and without likes
  and dislikes, then you are practicing with an inner silence or equanimity, called upekkha
  in Pali. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is true in both formal sitting meditation and in the
  informal, unstructured meditation we are discussing now. Two elements are involved:
  staying with the moment and viewing everything without likes and dislikes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: Oh, it's not that easy. We have to do more than
  just notice our surroundings.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">No, it's not easy. That's why it's better to start slowly
  by focusing on a particular moment. You may not be good at it all at once. But you will
  find that this practice of staying with the moment facilitates the inner silence. If you
  concentrate on the moment, and if your concentration is good, then no stray thoughts will
  enter your mind. As you practice, not only will you be more focused, but you will also
  become more alert and sensitive to what is happening around you. When your mindfulness is
  strong, then you can direct your attention inward to your mind, your emotions or your
  thoughts. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SD: So just being mindful is not enough?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's right. Being mindful is not sufficient. It is only
  a means. What is crucial is incorporating equanimity or <i><b>upekkha</b></i> into your
  mindfulness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SD: Will upekkha lead to inner silence?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, the only way that will lead the mind to silence is
  upekkha. Upekkha is not just a product of meditation training. It is itself a tool in
  meditation. When you become proficient at looking with equanimity at your own mind, your
  thoughts and your emotions, then this upekkha approach will also spill over into other
  areas of life. You will begin to listen, look, feel and relate to everything with upekkha.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just mindfulness and concentration do not constitute
  meditation; equanimity must be a constant ingredient. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SD: Doesn't upekkha mean detachment?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes it is translated as detachment, but that
  translation is very inadequate. You have to understand that upekkha transcends both
  detachment and attachment. When you are detached, you may also become indifferent if you
  are not careful. This indifference can lead to dissociation and subtle rejection. Upekkha
  transcends not only non-attachment, but also rejection. The mind is very tricky and has
  many nuances you have to be aware of. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The full essence of upekkha is to go beyond attachment and
  detachment, beyond likes and dislikes, to relate to things as they are. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it is crucial that you begin your mindfulness right
  from the start on the basis of upekkha, the nondualistic, the Middle Way. When you can
  view the world and your own mind or yourself with upekkha, then you are already on the
  right path of meditation. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Staying with More Moments</font></h3>
  <b><i><p><font face="Times New Roman">P: Sometimes it's a luxury to be mindful of a task
  with undivided attention. I only get frustrated if I try to be mindful of a task when my
  young children demand my attention. It seems like the only thing to do is to redirect my
  attention to the children and do the task on automatic pilot.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn: </b>I like your phrase &quot;automatic
  pilot&quot;! Again, I have to emphasize that being mindful is only a means to practice
  focusing. Don't compete with yourself. What you choose to pay attention to is entirely
  circumstantial. If the children need you, focus on them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The only guideline is to avoid rigid conditioning. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This does not mean that if you are cooking vegetables, you
  must be absolutely mindful of the color and smell of the vegetables and ignore the
  children's questions. If you did that, you'd be clinging to the cooking. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>P: Oh, so that's why I feel frustration?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, because you are clinging. Once again, you must
  understand that upekkha should be in every act. If you can view cooking with upekkha, then
  you won't have a problem letting go of mindfulness on the cooking and you can redirect
  your attention to the child. Sometimes you can cook -- on automatic pilot, as you say --
  and answer the child. Other times, if the child has a pressing need, you might find it
  better to stop cooking and really devote all your attention to the child. There are no set
  rules. </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">You can become attached to your mindfulness of the
    moment just as you can become attached to anything else. </font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is very subtle, but understand from the outset that
  you can be bound by your own mindfulness! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>P: If things are very hectic I cannot even redirect
  my attention to another activity, but find I have to just live in the chaos. </i></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, letting go of the mindfulness can be appropriate.
  But we must also talk about living in the chaos. How do you deal with the chaos? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>P: Sometimes I become involved in the chaos and get
  carried away by it.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, if your mindfulness is not strong enough you can
  easily be drawn into the chaos. The mindfulness I am talking about is the mindfulness of
  your own mind. If you are not aware of your thoughts and your feelings about the chaos,
  you can easily slip into interacting in the situation, reacting to the chaos. Before you
  know what's happening, you are already storming through the chaos, thus creating more
  chaos. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you are mindful of your own feelings as you notice the
  chaos, you can choose how to act in the situation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Instead of being only aware of the outside chaos, stop and
  look directly into yourself and see what is there. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>D: But that's not easy.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course not. But you have to start somewhere. As long as
  you are not silent inside, you will always be on a roller coaster ride with the outside
  chaos. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To look into yourself directly is to come back to your own
  source and to reach an inner equilibrium and silence. It is only from this inner
  equilibrium that you can view the outer chaos objectively. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this happens you can see the chaos as chaos, as only
  a circumstantial situation. You'll see the cause behind the chaos and you can act
  accordingly. In short, when you penetrate to the heart of the chaos, you will
  spontaneously resolve it in the best way for the circumstances. This is what is called
  penetrating insight wisdom, or panna. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i><b>P: Do you mean we should be passive in a chaotic
  conflict?</b></i> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">No. Again, there is nothing rigid about it. One situation
  may require a firm hand that cuts right through to the heart of the matter. If you are
  acting with awareness it will be the right action. Another situation might require that
  you become quiet and not generate more confusion. If you stop and look, you will know what
  to do in each situation. If you view both the chaos and your mind with upekkha, you will
  know what to do and will not be bothered by the chaos. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>P: If we stop to look, how can we react to others in
  the right way? We wouldn't have time to think of what to do.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the most difficult part to explain. We are so used
  to functioning with the intellect that it seems quite impossible to function in any given
  situation without conceptualizing. You see, here we are talking about insight or panna.
  It's a paradox: insight does not arise unless the conceptualizing stops altogether. In a
  chaotic situation insight can arise only when we stop conceptualizing about the chaos.
  Mindfulness of our own mind will in fact stop the conceptualizing that our minds normally
  go through. When the mindfulness is strong enough and there is total silence in the mind,
  then insight will spontaneously arise as to how best to deal with the situation at hand. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>D: I have another question. I find I can stop being
  emotional, right in the middle of a difficult interaction, but then I don't know where to
  go from there. Since I am studying Buddhism and learning to practice the Buddhist way, I
  feel I should react with more compassion. But I may not feel compassionate. Because I
  don't know how to go on, I go back to my old conditioning of either resentment or
  aggressiveness.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">My dear, this is only a phase in your own progress. You
  have come this far. It is possible to go further. Look into the process involved in your
  mind right in the midst of reacting. When you are able to stop in your tracks, you are
  already doing quite well. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is only when you start intellectualizing again that you
  get into trouble. If you have the notion that as a practicing Buddhist you should be
  compassionate, then you are setting up an image of yourself. As soon as that thought is
  allowed to come into your mind, you are not free. At that moment your mind is filled with
  the desire to fulfill your own image as a practicing Buddhist. </font></p>
  <b><blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the mind is not free, there is no chance for true
    compassion to arise.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  </b><p><font face="Times New Roman">It is as simple as that. Only when you free yourself
  of preconceived perceptions of yourself can spontaneous compassion arise. When you are
  free of concepts, you will act spontaneously and compassionately as well as creatively. </font></p>
  <hr width="30%">
  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Meditation in Action</font></h3>
  <b><i><p><font face="Times New Roman">D: You say we can work on meditation in our everyday
  lives. What is the best way to start?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> Generally speaking, your mind is caught up
  with the external world and you react to the world in an automatic and habitual manner.
  When you are preoccupied with the external world, you grossly neglect your mind. The most
  crucial thing is to realize that you have to redirect this external focus of attention
  inward, toward your own mind. In other words, learn to be attentive to your mind in the
  context of daily living -- as you eat, work, tend the children, cook, clean, whatever. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: Do you mean I have to take note of everything
  that comes into my mind? That would be incredibly difficult. Suppose I'm driving. How can
  I notice my mind and still pay attention to the road?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's a very relevant question. It's impossible to take
  note of your mind all of the time. You would tie yourself up in knots and run off the
  road. Instead of going to an extreme, begin by concentrating on one particular emotion in
  yourself. Choose the emotion that bothers you the most, or the one that is most prominent
  in you. For example, if you tend to be a temperamental kind of person, start by watching
  your anger. If you are easily hurt, then work with your mood swings. Pay attention to
  whichever emotion is most noticeable and troublesome to you. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For many people, anger is a good starting point because it
  is easily noticed and dissolves faster than most other emotions. Once you begin to watch
  your anger, you will make an interesting discovery. You will find that as soon as you know
  you are angry, your anger will melt away by itself. It is very important that you watch
  without likes or dislikes. The more you are able to look at your own anger without making
  judgments, without being critical, the more easily the anger will dissipate. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You may find in the beginning that you notice your anger
  only when it is about to end. That is not important. The important thing is to decide that
  you want to focus on your anger. Gradually the watching will become more and more natural.
  Before long you will notice, suddenly, in the midst of a fit of anger, that your anger
  drops away without warning. You will find yourself just being aware and no longer
  entangled in the anger. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>A: Can that really happen?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course. You see, when you make an effort to turn your
  attention inward, you are reconditioning yourself. Before this, you were only looking
  outward. Now you are conditioning yourself anew to look inward some of the time. This
  looking inward can become habitual; it becomes a kind of conditioning in which your mind
  automatically focuses on itself at all times. In the beginning this may not be frequent,
  but don't be discouraged. As time goes on, you will be surprised to find you are aware of
  your anger sooner than before. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This awareness, when it becomes stronger, will spill over
  to other emotions. You might find yourself watching your desire. In that watching, the
  desire will resolve and you will be left only with the awareness. Or you may watch
  sadness. Sadness is slower to arise and resolve than some other emotions. The most
  difficult emotion to watch is depression. But that too can be done with stronger
  mindfulness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As you get into the swing of it, you will find your
  awareness becoming sharper. At the same time, the episodes of anger will get shorter and
  less frequent. As the intensity of anger lessens, you will find you are grappling less and
  less with your emotions. In the end, you will be surprised to find that you can be friends
  with your emotions as never before. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: What do you mean? I can't imagine ever being
  comfortable with anger.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because you are no longer struggling with your emotions,
  you can learn to look at them without judging, clinging or rejecting them. They are no
  longer threatening to you. You learn to relate to your emotions more naturally, like a
  witness. Even when you are faced with conflicts and filled with emotions, you can be
  equanimous with them. As you become more stable, you can deal with conflicts without
  losing your emotional balance. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>D: If my awareness becomes more and more sensitive,
  is it possible for my mind to know anger as soon as it arises?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Certainly. You see, as your mindfulness becomes stronger
  and more alert, your mind becomes more aware of its own workings. When mindfulness is
  complete and dynamic, then you know anger as soon as it arises; as soon as you know it, it
  begins to dissolve. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>D: I have tried watching my anger and I can even see
  it die down for a moment, but it comes back again and again. Why?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the initial stages, when mindfulness is still weak and
  incomplete, anger may die for a moment as you watch. Then, the mind may revert back to its
  old, habitual angry state. The old conditioning is still strong and you have yet to master
  the art of mindfulness. You are so used to intellectualizing about the cause of anger --
  who's to blame, why the conflict escalated, and so on. In fact, this is the mind going
  back to its treadmill of reacting in the old ways. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You yourself restart the old cycle of creating the anger,
  thinking about the anger, reacting according to the anger. Here you have
  anger-intellectualizing- reacting in a vicious cycle. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The purpose of learning to pay attention to anger with a
  silent mind is to break this cycle of anger and the intellectualization on anger. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The only logical solution is to stop intellectualizing the
  conflict and simply watch your own mind in the midst of confusion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: Do you mean I should just stop thinking in such a
  situation and do nothing but watch my mind?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's exactly what I mean. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SD: Suppose I find it difficult to focus on anger.
  What should I do?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If that is the case, then focus on milder emotions like
  aversion and desiring. The same thing will happen when you do that. As soon as you are
  aware of aversion, you will find its intensity decreases; and when your mindfulness
  becomes strong, the aversion or desiring will resolve. As you proceed and build up your
  mindfulness, you will find you are able to go on to stronger emotions like anger, craving
  and greed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>SD: What about problem solving? How can I work my
  way through complicated situations in which anger and judgment interfere with mindfulness?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the same in complicated situations. Let's be very
  clear -- be mindful and watch without judgment. The mindfulness itself trains one towards
  a pure and simple mind, devoid of judgment and discrimination. To be mindful is a
  transcending act -- transcending anger, transcending judgment. So, if you master the art
  of mindfulness, you will no longer react with anger or judgment, because paying attention
  is itself a transcending act. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: What about other people? How can I react to
  others? I still need to react to get out of a conflict situation.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is exactly the point. Most often you are just
  reacting rather than acting. You are reacting in the ways you have been conditioned. The
  way to stop reacting is to break that conditioning. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Stop rationalizing. Stop the thinking mind and train it to
  experience itself by watching itself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the mind stops its roller-coaster thinking, it sees
  the entire situation as it is. This is crucial. The seeing, the awareness, is total. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You have to start with yourself. Make the decision to
  watch the mind and then see the process. Although you start with yourself, the actual
  seeing encompasses the total situation. You stop seeing yourself in isolation and see
  yourself instead in the context of the whole situation. </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, there is no longer an outside or inside. You are
    part of the whole. &quot;You&quot; now, are not as important as &quot;you&quot; used to
    be. </font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before, you saw your situation and your own importance and
  you needed to guard your identity, to control the situation. Now, when you see no division
  between yourself and others, when you are no more or no less important than others, only
  now are you able to grasp the whole situation, as it is, with clarity. Now you see very
  clearly where the problem lies, and instead of reacting, you simply act. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>D: Can you give us an example from everyday life?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Would one of you like to give an example? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>P: Let's say my young child is crying because I
  won't allow him to have something he wants. If I stop to look, I see my own annoyance and
  frustration. I even feel anger, because I cannot reason with the child. The moment I see
  that anger, it dissolves -- and rather than responding to my son in anger, I am able to be
  understanding, yet firm, towards him. It's strange, because suddenly I know how to deal
  with the problem. I don't get involved in his anger and frustrations, or my own. He seems
  to pick up on this and he becomes calmer too.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, that's it. At that moment of seeing your anger, you
  transcend your own feelings of anger and frustration. You become centered. You no longer
  generate conflict, and because you are calmer, naturally the child responds. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">More often than not, your actions are so complete that the
  conflict will not continue; you no longer generate reasons for continuing the conflict.
  This complete, non-generating action in Buddhism is called right action, or samma kammanta
  in Pali. This right action is what I mean by meditation in action. By so doing, you are
  already on the Noble Eightfold Path. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Letting Go and Picking Up</font></h3>
  <b><i><p><font face="Times New Roman">J: Why is &quot;letting go&quot; so important in
  Buddhism?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> The term &quot;letting go&quot; has become a
  catchword in Buddhist circles. It is true that &quot;letting go&quot; is crucial for
  arriving at self-realization of inner freedom, but you have to understand how to let go. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>J: What are we supposed to let go of?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let go of your clinging. Let go of the motivating desire
  behind whatever you're doing. It may be a desire to succeed, to be perfect, to control
  others or to glorify yourself. It doesn't matter what it is specifically; what matters is
  the desire behind your act. It is easy to mistake the act for the desire. </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">To let go is to let go of clinging to desire, not to
    let go of the act.</font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have been talking about stopping and looking at
  emotions. Try to stop and look at an act; see if you can identify the desire propelling
  it. When you see the desire, you can also detect the clinging to the desire. When you see
  the clinging, you see it resolve and you spontaneously let go. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: There are so many things in life I don't want to
  renounce or let go of.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course not. We don't let go for the sake of letting go.
  There is a parable about a Zen master who was approached by a pupil. The pupil asked,
  &quot;I have nothing in my mind now; what shall I do next?&quot; &quot;Pick it up,&quot;
  replied the master. This is an excellent example of the negation that comes with proper
  understanding, as opposed to pure nihilism. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we are bound to the concept of letting go, then we are
  not free. When we are not free, understanding -- panna -- does not arise. But if we truly
  see the clinging to desire and let go of it, our act becomes a pure act, without any
  attendant tensions or frustrations. When the act is pure and simple, we can accomplish
  more with less stress. At that point, you are &quot;picking up&quot; just as you are
  &quot;letting go.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>D: Why is letting go so difficult? I can watch my
  other emotions like anger and hatred, but it is much harder to see desire and clinging.</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's because desire and clinging precede anger and
  hatred. In any fit of emotion -- and our mental formations occur so very fast -- we can
  only identify gross emotions like anger and hatred. Desire and clinging are much more
  subtle, so it takes stronger samadhi to be able to see them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You have been conditioned since you were very young to
  relate everything to yourself. As soon as you learn to recognize people and things, you're
  taught how to relate these to the &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;-- my mom, my dad, my
  toy, etc. As you grow up you're taught how to relate ideas and concepts to yourself. You
  have to learn that so that you can function properly in society. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But at the same time, this process slowly and
  unconsciously creates a concept of selfhood, and you build up your ego. This buildup is
  strengthened by the values of society. You learn to compete, to achieve, to accumulate
  knowledge, wealth and power. In other words, you are trained to possess and to cling. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By the time you are grown up, the concept of ego-self has
  become so real that it is difficult to tell what is illusion and what is reality. It is
  difficult to realize that &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; are temporary, relative and
  changeable. The same is true of all that is related to &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine.&quot;
  Not understanding that &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; are temporary, you struggle to
  keep them permanent; you cling to them. This desire to try to keep everything permanent is
  what makes it so difficult to learn to let go. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: I have trouble accepting the Buddhist idea of
  self as an illusion.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You have become so used to functioning with the
  &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine,&quot; so used to thinking your &quot;self&quot; is real,
  that it is naturally difficult to understand the Buddhist way of thinking. The
  &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine,&quot; being illusions themselves, survive only by clinging
  to illusions of their own making. They cling to all kinds of mental possessions -- be they
  power, wealth, status or whatever -- which are themselves conceptual creations of the mind
  with no substantial reality. In short, they are also illusions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>R: If &quot;I&quot; is an illusion and not reality,
  how can &quot;I&quot; get rid of the &quot;I&quot;?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">How can you get rid of something that never was? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: I feel that if I let go of &quot;I&quot; and
  &quot;mine,&quot; I would lose my identity. How can I exist if I let go of everything?
  Won't I become cold and unfeeling? It sounds scary, like living in a vacuum.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You have to understand that what you lose is merely an
  illusion. It never was. You empty the mind of illusion about self. Just let go of the
  illusion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In fact, you are not losing anything. You just remove an
  imaginary screen before your eyes. In the process you gain wisdom, or panna. From this
  wisdom unfold the four virtues of unconditional love, compassion, sympathetic joy and
  equanimity. These virtues manifest themselves as concern, humanness and sensitivity to
  others. When you have panna you can fully experience the beauty and warmth that is within
  all human relationships. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is why letting go is not losing your illusory ego.
  You are actually uncovering a great treasure. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Peace-Mind</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you just stopped thinking for a while and sat back to
  reflect on your own mind, you would be surprised to realize that you are at peace. Even if
  you agree with me, you might argue that this peace is only temporary. So be it. But let us
  look into this peaceful tranquil state, temporary or otherwise, since it is already with
  us -- without our having to make any effort at all at being peaceful. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You were born with this peace-nature of the mind;
  otherwise you would not be what you are, would you? You did not run around meditating to
  bring about this peace to yourself: you did not learn from someone or some book to make
  possible this peaceful state in yourself. In other words, &quot;you&quot; had nothing to
  do with it. Peace is a natural mind-state in every one of us. Peace has been there since
  the day we were born and it is going to be there till the day we die. It is our greatest
  gift; so why do we think we have no peace of mind? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Experiencing peace is like looking at our hands. Usually,
  we see only the fingers -- not the spaces in between. In a similar manner, when we look at
  the mind, we are aware of the active states, such as our running thoughts and the
  one-thousand-and-one feelings that are associated with them, but we tend to overlook the
  intervals of peace between them. If one were to be unhappy or sad every minute of the
  twenty-four-hour day, what would happen to us? I guess we would all be in the mad house! </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Then why is it that we supposedly never are at peace?
    It is simply because we never allow ourselves to be so. </font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We enjoy battling with ourselves and our emotions so much
  that the battle becomes second nature to us. And we complain that we have no peace of
  mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why don't we leave aside all these complicated ideas for a
  while and simply contemplate this peaceful nature of ours -- since we are fortunate enough
  to have it -- instead of frantically trying to find peace of mind someplace else? How can
  we find something elsewhere, when it is already in ourselves? Probably that is the reason
  why we often do not find it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We do not have to do anything to have this peace, do we?
  Mind is by itself peaceful. </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">But we do need to do something to our minds in order to
    be angry or sad.</font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Imagine yourself enjoying a moment of quiet. Suddenly
  something disturbs your enjoyment. You start up at once, annoyed or angry at the
  disturbance. Why? Because you dislike the interruption. Your mind &quot;acts.&quot; It
  dislikes. It sets up thoughts of dislike, followed by annoyance, anger and a whole series
  of reactions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thought moments are extremely fast, so you don't notice
  the moment of the mind setting up thoughts of dislike. We generally think that the outside
  situation is what is responsible for our annoyance. But even during the most durable and
  miserable experiences of our lives, we find moments when our minds are distracted from the
  cause of misery and we are relatively free from the devastating emotional state. Once we
  set our minds back on the event, the unpleasant feelings come rushing in again
  immediately. When these emotions subside, what happens to them? We seem to take it for
  granted that they end up or phase out somewhere outside of us. But if they had their
  origin in the mind, they must surely end in the mind. If they had their origin in a
  peaceful state, then they would surely end in that peaceful state also. It is only
  logical. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us contemplate this peaceful state. We recognize it
  before emotions have set in and also after they have disappeared. What about the
  in-between times? Is peace destroyed during the time that we have been angry or sad? We
  are so used to implying that this or that destroys our peace of mind that we have come to
  assume that peace of mind is a contrived state that can be arrived at or deleted at will. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But this is not the case. Peace and tranquillity are part
  and parcel of our own mental makeup. If they are destroyed during emotional upheavals, our
  minds might as well be destroyed too. Peace is the essence of our own innate nature and
  can never be destroyed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Peace is with us every single moment of our life, but we
  do not recognize it. This is because we are ignorant about peace -- most of the time we
  are too preoccupied with the external world and our own running thoughts and emotions to
  be aware of it. We have lost touch with our inner selves, with what is the best in us. We
  frantically try to find the answer outside when all the time peace is sitting there,
  silently waiting until we come home to it. </font></p>
  <hr width="30%">
  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Non-Peace</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we agree that have innate peace, what do you think
  gives us non-peace? From the standpoint of peace of mind, thoughts by themselves are
  neither good nor bad. It is only when the concepts of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;
  arise that the mind is thrown into conflict. Likes and dislikes quickly follow these
  concepts of self. This where the real trouble begins. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A thought by itself is okay. Let's say you've lost your
  keys. It happens. The problem begins when you start judging the fact that you misplaced
  your keys. &quot;I dislike it when I lose my keys.... I like it so much better when I have
  my keys and I can continue my busy schedule.&quot; You might go on with your thinking:
  &quot;Why am I so careless? It must have been because the children were rowdy.&quot; Then
  you might put your thoughts into words: &quot;Look what you made me do -- I was so busy
  with you that I lost my keys.&quot; You might put those thoughts and emotions into
  physical actions by rushing around looking for the lost keys. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">All this commotion stems from your reaction to a couple of
  misplaced keys. Let's go back to what prompted the commotion. When you had the thought,
  &quot;I lost my keys,&quot; you weren't able to let go of that thought. Instead, you
  immediately jumped into likes and dislikes. Feeling, conflicts and frustrations are born
  from this dichotomy of likes and dislikes. You allowed yourself to be swept away by your
  judgments, your feelings, your frustrations. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But let's look at the thoughts for a moment. They arise,
  and by their own accord they fall away. That is, unless we cling to them. If we allow
  thoughts to continue their normal span, they will naturally fall away. All thoughts are
  subject to the universal law of impermanence, anicca. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For those of you who are familiar with Buddhism, you know
  this law of change. You accept it in many aspects of your lives. But can you apply it to
  the most important area of all -- your mind? Can you watch thoughts and emotions as they
  arise in your mind? Can you allow them to naturally fade away, without clinging to them?
  Or do you indulge in letting the &quot;I&quot; grasp onto a thought, an emotion? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By their nature, thoughts are transient, unless the
  &quot;I&quot; interferes and refuses to let them go. By clinging to thoughts and emotions,
  the &quot;I&quot; prolongs the emotion-span -- on and on. It is the &quot;I&quot; which
  insists on clinging to thoughts and emotions that creates non-peace. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Peace has nothing to do with the &quot;I.&quot; It is not
  &quot;my&quot; peace. As long as you think you own peace -- as long as you think, &quot;I
  like my peace&quot; -- then you will not experience peace. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A friend of mine, a spiritual educator, came up with a
  metaphor that may help explain the process. Let's take the phrase, &quot;I like
  peace.&quot; If we eliminate the &quot;I,&quot; then we are left with &quot;like
  peace.&quot; If we go further and eliminate the &quot;like,&quot; then all that remains is
  peace. Peace is something that can be felt but not owned. Peace can be experienced when we
  eliminate our ideas of likes and dislikes about peace. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>P: It sounds as though we can do something to
  realize this state of peace ... that we can purposely eliminate concepts of &quot;I&quot;
  and likes and dislikes.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> No, this example is just a metaphor.
  Realization of peace does not come with &quot;doing&quot; anything with your mind, nor
  does it come with &quot;not-doing.&quot; &quot;Doing&quot; and &quot;not-doing&quot; are
  just more concepts to cling to. Right? When you can let go of your ideas of how to obtain
  peace, of what to do and not do, then your mind is silent and you can experience peace. As
  long as your mind is rushing back and forth between likes and dislikes, then your mind is
  too busy to experience peace. When the mind calms and is silent, then you can realize its
  innate peaceful nature. </font></p>
  <hr width="30%">
  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Meditation on Peace-Mind</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many have asked how to go about finding inner peace. Once
  you have recognized that <b>peace is not an induced state, but an innate-natural state,</b>
  that is exactly where you begin. There is absolutely nothing to do but look within
  yourself and recognize peace this very moment. When you recognize peace in your mind, you
  have in fact already experienced peace. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you do recognize your own peaceful moments at times,
  then you are already started. Never mind if this recognition is very brief. You can make
  this peace-moment the base from which to investigate your own mind. This can be the focal
  point from which to launch your investigation. And surprisingly, you will find this is
  also the home base to which you return. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You may find that it is not easy to come back to this
  peace-moment. That is not important. It is more important to decide that you want to pay
  attention to your own mind. We are so conditioned to looking outward that our minds have
  fallen into a kind of mental groove. It is difficult to rise up and leave that groove
  because it is easy and comfortable there. To turn outward attention inward is difficult
  unless one has the &quot;will&quot; to do it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In your initial attempts to see peace-moments, they may be
  very infrequent and brief, but that is all right. It may even be that the more you try,
  the more difficult seeing peace or peace-moments becomes. If that is the case, just let
  go. Very often the awareness of peace-moments is unforeseen; it comes when you least
  expect it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You may ask whether there is a specific method to
  &quot;see&quot; these peace-moments. And I would say no -- not beyond the &quot;will&quot;
  to pay attention to the mind. Paying attention requires no particular time or place. It
  goes on while you go about the daily business of living, playing, doing the
  one-thousand-and-one chores of what is called life. There is nothing to do beyond this.
  There is just something specifically you should not do and that is to let opinions,
  judgments and discrimination crowd your mind. The mind watching itself needs to be whole
  so that it can pay complete attention. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you start discriminate, your mind becomes preoccupied
  with making judgments. Your mind ceases to be free. Then you cannot see or experience the
  peace within yourself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to understand how things move in space, you must
  be able to see the whole panorama of space as well as the objects in it. Without space,
  objects cannot have motion. Objects may be affected, but the space will never be affected.
  The objects may disintegrate in space, but the space remains. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Your home base -- the peace-nature of the mind -- is just
  like physical space outside your body. Within you is the space of consciousness where
  thoughts and emotions move about. As with the outside space, it is because of this space-
  mind that thoughts and feelings can arise freely and also cease freely. If your mind is
  already crammed, there is no room for anything to arise in it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you can &quot;see&quot; this space clearly in yourself,
  you also see what is rising and falling more clearly. At first, you may notice only the
  falling -- because it is more obvious. You will find yourself less involved with your own
  emotions and thus more at your home base. And the more you are at your home base, the more
  at peace you will be with yourself and with the world. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You may not have found perfect peace as yet, but at least
  you will find a breathing space in yourself, a respite. This is the time you learn to be
  friends with your own mind and your emotions. You will find that you no longer wrestle
  with them as before. The beautiful part is that you will find yourself loosening up
  inside. This loosening up may not appear important to you, but actually this first step is
  always the most important. When you are not in a tightly bound, self-inflicted tangle, you
  can look at yourself more objectively. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Never mind, if you do not see the rising. There is time
  for everything. Even when you &quot;see&quot; the falling away, you will notice a change.
  You will already experience peace. Keep on &quot;experiencing&quot; this peace as you
  would experience a good cup of coffee or a scoop of ice cream. After a while, you will
  find that you can &quot;experience&quot; your emotions without getting involved in them.
  Since you are more at home base, you will find that your feelings are in and of themselves
  fleeting. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, you may be surprised to find that feelings do
  not stay for a long time without your own invitation and your clinging to them. You will
  also see that they are part of the natural phenomena of the mind. In Buddhism, all
  phenomena are impermanent, are not of the self, and are themselves the basis of suffering.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Becoming aware of your feelings in this way is like
  discovering a new friend. When you realize that thse transient feelings have no power of
  their own, they cease to threaten you. This realization gives you a positive feeling,
  because you are no longer overwhelmed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As you find out more about yourself in this way, you will
  also find that you reside more and more in your own peace home base. You will also realize
  this peace has always been there. It is just that you were so engrossed in trying to get
  rid of your frustrations that you had neither the time nor the skill to see this peace
  that is already there. In fact, peace-mind has been there all along for you to rediscover.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The path to inner peace is quite simple. You complicate it
  by thinking that the method should be difficult. You are conditioned to achieving this,
  accomplishing that. Your mind is in perpetual motion. Of course, you must earn a living,
  feed your family, make friends, take your children to school. That is the business of
  living. But if you perpetuate this frantic mode as the mode of your search for peace, you
  won't find peace. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What we are concerned with is slowing down ... so you can
  understand yourself, and experience what is already there. When you are already at the
  home base, do you need to do anything to stay there? </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">You need only to wake up and realize you have always
    been home.</font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We must be aware that this kind of meditation is a way of
  investigating and understanding ourselves, of awakening to our actual state of mind, to
  all the mental formations that arise and fall. It is an entrance to ourselves. We will
  discover the bad things as well as the good, but in the end the investigation will pay
  off. For now we can find an opportunity to discover our own wondrous inner depths and draw
  upon the essence of what is the best in us. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> You must realize that you cannot make the
  mind silent. The more you try to silence the mind purposefully, the more you tie yourself
  up in knots. The more you try to quiet your mind, the more you propel it into activity. If
  you try to vanquish your mind, you'll find that the action of subduing is itself
  disquieting. You see, a mind that is already unquiet cannot deal with a nonquiet mind.
  This vicious cycle perpetuates a continuous state of frenzy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: What do you mean by silent mind? If there is no
  action in the mind, aren't we paralyzed? How can we function?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A silent mind is not a dead or static mind. A mind is dead
  or static when it is dulled with ignorance of oneself. In Buddhism, this ignorance is
  called avijja. Self-conceit, anger, greed and confusion cloud the mind. The mind may be
  active with greed, hatred and anger, but that mind is dead to the world and to others.
  Totally wrapped up in its own confusions, that mind is insensitive to the needs of others.
  This is a true paralysis of the mind, which renders it unable to open up to others. A
  truly silent mind, on the other hand, is alert and sensitive to its surroundings. This is
  because a silent mind is devoid of judging, clinging or rejecting. The silent mind is free
  from hatred, anger, jealousy, confusion and conflict. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>J: It sounds so beautiful! How can we achieve this
  silent mind?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mind is silent when it transcends the duality of
  liking and disliking. Generally we perceive the world through a conceptual framework based
  on a dualistic way of thinking. As soon as we perceive something, we judge it. Let's say
  we judge that it is good. As soon as we judge something as being good, then anything
  opposing it automatically becomes bad. We constantly divide our conceptual world in this
  polarized manner; we set up good and evil, beauty and ugliness, right and wrong, according
  to our own standards. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: But we have to discriminate in order to function
  in everyday life. I'm not going to eat a rotten apple. It would make me sick. I have to
  judge this apple rotten, that one ripe and good to eat.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course you need to make judgments to function in this
  world. You need to recognize a good apple from a bad one. This is rational, not emotional,
  judgment. But usually we don't stop at making rational judgments. We go on to impose our
  emotional judgment of likes and dislikes onto our perceptions. We dislike a rotten apple,
  don't we? Therefore, we cling to our dislike of it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose someone offers you a rotten apple. How would you
  feel? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: I would be annoyed.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes. And if they gave you a big beautiful apple? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: I'd be delighted.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Do you see how your emotions are built up around your own
  likes and dislikes? When you find something that appeals to you -- an idea, a person or a
  thing -- then you want to cling to it, to possess that idea, person or thing. You become
  caught up in the duality of beauty versus ugliness, good versus evil, on and on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's go back to your big, beautiful apple. Suppose
  someone snatches your beautiful apple away? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: I'd be very annoyed.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There you see. Where's the problem? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: Oh, you mean the apple is not the problem, but we
  are?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Exactly. Apple is just apple, good or rotten. You can take
  it or leave it. You can make a rational judgment about it. But our problem is that we make
  emotional judgments instead. This is what we need to be clear about. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we make emotional judgments, we set up ripples in our
  minds. These ripples cause larger ripples and soon a storm is brewing. This storm disturbs
  the mind. In all this we lose touch with the silence in the mind, the peace within. It is
  only when we can calm these ripples that the mind can reside in its own silence, its own
  equanimous state. When the mind can rest in its own stillness it can see things as they
  are. I call this silent mind, &quot;peace- mind.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we don't allow the mind to be silent, we make emotional
  judgments and then we get into trouble. Here is where the battle starts, within ourselves
  and outside of ourselves. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>J: Oh, I see. We cling to what we judge to be good,
  right or beautiful, and reject its opposite.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, you've got it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>J: But how do we break out of this duality?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Remember, duality is a creation of our conceptual minds.
  We love to cling to what we have created. The duality we create becomes a personal
  possession. &quot;I&quot; want to hold onto &quot;my&quot; idea of right, &quot;my&quot;
  idea of beauty, &quot;my&quot; idea of good. Our minds become rigid, and we end up looking
  at the world through narrow blinders. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>J: How can we free ourselves from this fixation?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By being mindful. When you are mindful of yourself judging
  in that moment, the judging will stop. Once you stop judging, &quot;seeing things as they
  are&quot; will follow naturally. Eventually, you will become more equanimous; your mind
  will stop and look instead of running around in circles. When the mind is busy judging,
  clinging and rejecting, it has no space for anything else. Only when you stop
  discriminating can you see things as they are, and not as you think they are or want them
  to be. This is the only way to transcend the duality of likes and dislikes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once we transcend duality, once we break through the
  boundaries of our own conceptual framework, then the world appears expanded. It's no
  longer limited by our tunnel vision. When the bondage is broken, then whatever has been
  dammed up within us all these years has a chance to emerge. Love -- and along with it,
  compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity -- come forth and bring sensitivity to others. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the past, our energy was sapped by conflict,
  frustration, anger, rejection, etc. This conflict was exhausting. Now free from conflict,
  we can redirect ourselves toward harmonious living and meaningful relationships with
  others. Only then does life become worth living, because now we can experience fully each
  moment in its freshness. We can also see our relationships with others in a totally new
  light. Now we can truly live in harmony. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Four Noble Truths in Daily Life</font></h3>
  <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Thynn:</b> The Four Noble Truths are the cornerstone of
  Buddhism. Understanding them helps us in daily life. The First Noble Truth is dukkha, or
  suffering. The Second Noble Truth is samudaya, or craving. The Third Noble Truth is
  nirodha, or cessation of suffering. The Fourth Noble Truth is magga, the Eightfold Noble
  Path, leading to cessation of suffering. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: When I hear the First Noble Truth, that life is
  suffering, I think Buddhism is a pessimistic, negative philosophy.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, some people misunderstand it that way. But this is
  because the teaching has not been fully understood. When dukkha is translated as
  suffering, it is understood as gross physical suffering. But in truth, dukkha can be
  experienced on many levels; the actual meaning of dukkha encompasses the whole range of
  human experience from very subtle dissatisfaction to gross misery. Dukkha is the
  inescapable fact of old age, illness and death. It is being separated from what one likes,
  enduring what one dislikes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the most profound level dukkha is the failure to
  understand the insubstantiality of all things. Everything is insubstantial; nothing is
  concrete, nothing is tangible. To be ignorant of or go against the natural state of
  impermanence is itself suffering. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism seems negative only if one looks at the First
  Noble Truth in isolation. But if you look at the Four Noble Truths collectively, you will
  find that they are positive, because the three other noble truths show the way out of
  suffering. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: But how do we incorporate the Four Noble Truths
  into daily life?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> That is not difficult. To begin with, you
  have to see dukkha in its entirety before you can see your way out of it. You don't have
  to be in physical or mental agony to understand dukkha. It is everywhere around you. Right
  now, how do you feel about the pounding noise next door? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">[Noisy construction work was going on at a neighbor's
  house.] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: I feel irritated because I want to have a
  peaceful experience and listen to you and learn what you are talking about. In fact, I'm
  trying to eliminate the noise from my consciousness, but I can't.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because that is not the way to solve the problem. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: The noise annoys me and I want to stop it. I have
  a craving for the workers to stop.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well then, you have already set up a desire that the noise
  should stop. How did the desire arise? It arose from your dissatisfaction with the current
  situation. In other words, you desire a peaceful circumstance right now. Since you can't
  have it, you are annoyed. There is already aversion in your mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose you were in the midst of doing something that was
  very important to you. Then this aversion might flare up into overt anger, hatred or even
  violence. Aversion is already a stressful state. Anger, hatred and violence bring on even
  greater stress and suffering, both to oneself and to others. These are the truths that we
  have to face in every moment of our daily lives. But we are not aware of this aversion and
  suffering. We blame our dukkha on someone or something else. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This lack of awareness is called avijja, or ignorance --
  that is, ignorance about the Four Noble Truths. This ignorance is described as an
  unawakened state. If you wake up to your own state of mind, right now, you will see what
  is happening there. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Can you look into your own mind this very moment and see
  what is happening there? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: See what?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What happens to the annoyance. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: When I become aware of the annoyance, it sort of
  lessens.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As soon as you become aware of the annoyance, the aversion
  fades away. It resolves in the mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: Yeah, a little bit.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Is it still there? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: You mean the annoyance? It's much less. It is
  still there but it is much less now. [laughter] I see. So it's not a question of putting
  the irritation out of your mind. It is a question of accepting the fact that your mind is
  irritated and annoyed.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You are right. The issue is not the noise. It is your
  reaction to the noise. You have to deal with yourself first before you deal with the
  noise. Now, what are you going to do about it? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: That's my next question. We have a number of
  choices. We can move away from the noise. We can ask the workers to stop hammering. We can
  continue to sit here and try to maintain our awareness of the noise in order to minimize
  the irritation.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You have to be clear. Is it the awareness of the noise or
  the awareness of your own state of mind? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: Awareness of my own state of mind regarding it.</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right. There are many situations in life when you will not
  be able to eliminate external factors. We cannot eliminate or control most of the external
  factors in our lives, but we can do something about ourselves. You begin with yourself.
  Since you are born with a free will, it is absolutely up to you what you want to do with
  yourself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: Are you saying that since I cannot make the noise
  go away, I can just choose to accept it?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You must understand the difference between accepting
  things blindly and accepting them intelligently. Acceptance can be complete only when you
  harbor no judgments. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now let's go back to the Four Noble Truths. Your
  dissatisfaction with the noisy circumstances is the First Noble Truth of Suffering --
  dukkha. Your desire or craving for peace is the Second Noble Truth -- samudaya -- which is
  the cause of dukkha. Now as soon as you look within yourself and resolve the annoyance,
  you are free from the cycle of desire-aversion-desire. Aren't you ? Now look into yourself
  again. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: The annoyance is already gone! It is amazing that
  you had to bring the noise back again into my awareness.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's look at what we've been going through. You have seen
  that it is possible to break the cycle of suffering by merely looking into your own state
  of mind. This in actual fact is mindfulness of the mind, which is the basis of
  satipatthana meditation in Buddhism. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Do you see now how practicing mindfulness can lead to the
  end of suffering? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: No, not yet. How does mindfulness relate to the
  acceptance of the noise?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The acceptance is the result of mindfulness. The act of
  mindfulness is a transcending act. It transcends likes and dislikes, and purifies our
  vision. We see things as they are. When we see or hear things as they really are,
  acceptance comes naturally. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: You are aware of the noise. You get rid of the
  clinging to silence and you accept the noise. You accept that the noise will be part of
  the experience.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is not even &quot;you&quot; there. There is just
  acceptance. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: Aahh.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The acceptance comes from the freedom of the mind in the
  moment. As soon as the cycle is broken, you no longer feel annoyed. When your mind frees
  itself emotionally from the noise, it assumes a state of equanimity and acceptance. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: You're not expecting it to stop and you're not
  expecting it to get louder.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's right. You are free of any conceptualizing
  regarding the noise. You arrive at a point where you can just hear it as it is. With that
  hearing of the noise as it is, acceptance is already part of the situation. You can't
  force yourself to accept it. That's why I am very careful using these words. When you say,
  &quot;I accept,&quot; that usually means... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: I am in control.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, that's right and that doesn't really solve the
  problem. The kind of acceptance we are talking about is a natural spontaneous absorbing of
  the environment, being one with it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: Oh, I see. There ceases to be a division between
  the noise and my experience of the noise. So there is nothing to accept or be annoyed
  about.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right. Now let us go back to your experience right this
  minute. Are you still irritated by the noise? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: Not anymore. I'm completely free of it. You
  mentioned mindfulness being the foundation of meditation. How does that work?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes. Mindfulness of one's own mind at any moment is part
  of the practice of satipatthana. In this particular instance, your own mindfulness of
  annoyance is contemplation of the <b>First Noble Truth</b> -- dukkha. Your mindfulness of
  the desire for peace and of clinging to silence, which is the cause of dukkha, is
  contemplation of the <b>Second Noble Truth</b> -- samudaya. The moment that you become
  free of the annoyance is nirodha -- the <b>Third Noble Truth</b>. In this case, the
  cessation of suffering is momentary, so it can be called tadanga nirodha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: And the Fourth Noble Truth?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you practice mindfulness you are in fact practicing
  magga, the <b>Noble Eightfold Path</b>. You are making the right effort, called samma
  vayama, to be mindful, called samma sati, of your annoyance. As a result, your mind
  becomes collected, which is called samma samadhi. When you transcend your dislike of the
  noise and your irritation ceases, at that moment you are able to regard the sound as it
  is. This is called samma ditthi or right view. It is samma sankappa, right thinking, when
  you are not expecting it to get louder. You are able to verbalize the situation with
  proper insight, called samma vaca. Now do you still feel like running away from the noise?
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: Not anymore. At first I did. I might have said or
  done something nasty if I had had the chance.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But you didn't and that is samma kammanta, right action. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: You mean no action in this context is right
  action?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes. So you can see how by practicing mindfulness with
  equanimity in daily life, one is already applying the Four Noble Truths and integrating
  the Noble Eightfold Path as living meditation. </font></p>
  <hr width="30%">
  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Unity of the Noble Eightfold Path</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhism, the Noble Eightfold Path is the guide to the
  attainment of liberation. If it is to be understood and incorporated into our daily lives,
  it must be viewed in terms of unity of mind, speech and action. The Path can be explored
  in such great detail that one could get lost in digressions. To avoid that, we take a
  practical, accurate and holistic view of the Path. We look at it in terms of wisdom,
  ethical conduct and concentration, or -- in Pali -- panna, sila and samadhi. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Wisdom (Panna)</b><br>
  </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Right understanding (samma ditthi) <br>
    2. Right thinking (samma sankappa) <br>
    </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Ethical Conduct (Sila)</b><br>
  </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Right speech (samma vaca) <br>
    4. Right action (samma kammanta) <br>
    5. Right livelihood (samma ajiva) <br>
    </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Concentration (Samadhi)</b><br>
  </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. Right effort (samma vayama) <br>
    7. Right mindfulness (samma sati) <br>
    8. Right collectedness (samma samadhi) <br>
    </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even these three aspects of the Path, although identified
  separately for clarification, are not separate. In actual practice, with proper
  understanding, sila, samadhi and panna are assimilated in each moment, in every thought,
  word or deed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Take, for instance, sila, or ethical conduct. How does one
  refrain from wrong speech and action? First of all, what is right speech and wrong speech?
  Are they not relative to time, place and person? Is there such a thing as absolute right
  and absolute wrong? We can go on and on without coming to a definite conclusion, and by so
  doing we veer away from ourselves -- that is, from our minds. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The purpose of sila is to refrain from hurting others by
  way of harmful speech and action -- but how much restraint we can impose on ourselves at
  all times? We react to our environment in such a habitual way that we may already have
  hurt others before we realize what has happened in the mind. This is because we are
  conditioned to neglect our own minds in our daily life. Our attention is almost always
  directed outward. This preoccupation with the outer world is what we have to transcend. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although we are dealing with verbal and physical acts, all
  of these originate from the mind itself. The actions of the mind, speech and body occur in
  such rapid succession that there seems to be no interval in between. As soon as a thought
  has arisen, we find ourselves speaking or doing something. We find that we cannot control
  speech and bodily behavior fast enough to refrain from harmful speech and action. But sati
  (mindfulness) on the mind renders it alert to its own actions of speech and body. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">How do we redirect our attention to our own mind? This was
  the Buddha's purpose in laying out the path of mindfulness. The objective of cultivation
  of the mind is to learn to break the habitual preoccupation with the external world so
  that we become more aware of what is happening in us, in our own minds, as we go on in
  life. As soon as mindfulness, samma sati, occurs, we find that the mind acts no more; it
  stops like a witness to watch the inner state. When this watching becomes a constant
  habit, second nature, the cycle of reacting mindlessly to the environment is broken. In
  this moment of breakthrough, &quot;seeing&quot; or &quot;awareness&quot; occurs:
  crystal-clear perception of things as they are, of people, situations and things properly
  in perspective, free of discriminations, likes and dislikes. From this new insight thre
  follows right thinking, right speech and right action, relative and appropriate to each
  specific circumstance and instance. Then the question of what is absolutely right or
  absolutely wrong no longer arises. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, in terms of the Noble Eightfold Path, as soon as we
  pay attention to our mind, there is already samma vayama (effort) and samma sati
  (mindfulness). When samma sati is full and complete, the mind enters instantaneously into
  khanika samadhi (momentary concentration), which brings forth panna (wisdom). Wisdom sees
  things in the right perspective, samma ditthi. Wisdom brings samma sankappa (right
  thought); and thereby samma vaca (right speech), samma kammanta (right action) and samma
  ajiva (right livelihood.) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hence it is possible in every conscious moment that sila,
  samadhi and panna are all three incorporated in our daily business of living -- while we
  eat, work, play and struggle. In short, our life itself becomes the Noble Eightfold Path. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>MS: You have translated samma samadhi as
  &quot;one-pointedness of mind&quot; or &quot;right concentration.&quot; Isn't, textually
  speaking, samma samadhi an absorption in the four jhanas? One-pointedness of mind can be
  right- or wrong-pointedness of mind and, therefore, may not fit the true understanding of
  samma samadhi. This distinction becomes important when we talk about meditation and
  concentration in daily life.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn:</b> Well, samma samadhi is generally translated
  as one-pointedness of mind or right concentration. But when it is expounded in detail it
  is described in two categories: jhanic absorption as in samatha meditation, and khanika
  samadhi (momentary concentration) as in vipassana meditation of the dry- visioned
  (sukkha-vipassaka) path of daily life.* Thus I personally think it should not be
  translated as absorption in the four jhanas only. In this I am following the commentarial
  rather than the canonical tradition. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You are correct, though, that one-pointedness of mind can
  be of the right or wrong kin, because the power of the concentrated mind is enormous and
  can be directed toward harmful activities if not governed by wisdom. This is exactly why
  the Path sould be understood and practiced in a holistic manner. If you take meditation
  out of the context of the Noble Eightfold Path, without morality or the pursuit of wisdom
  (panna), then naturally it cannot be called samma samadhi. In the case of meditation in
  daily life, what is important is the arising of wisdom (panna) as a sequel of mindfulness
  in the moment as a preventive to harmful thoughts, words, action or livelihood. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A traditional elaboration of the Noble Eightfold Path is
  given at the end of this book. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Dynamics of Meditation</font></h3>
  <b><i><p><font face="Times New Roman">M: What really scares me about meditation is the
  idea of becoming completely without thought, completely mindless.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn: </b>Let me clarify your usage of
  &quot;mindless&quot; and &quot;completely without thought.&quot; Mindless in your context
  would mean that the mind is totally absent, without any consciousness, a vacuum. This is
  not possible. Without consciousness we would be dead. &quot;Completely without
  thought&quot; means consciousness exists, but no thoughts are present. This is possible in
  meditation, but only under certain conditions. In some forms of sitting meditation it is
  possible to reach a state where the mind is absolutely quiet, one-pointed and absorbed in
  itself. This is called jhanic samadhi. In this meditative state, the person cannot
  function. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: I don't think I could be completely without
  thought. It sounds like I would become like a zombie.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is only a temporary state, which one comes out of. But
  we have been talking about another way of meditating, a way that sidesteps the problems of
  jhanic samadhi. If you practice mindfulness in everyday life as you have experienced just
  now, you do not go through absorptive states. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: It sounds like daily-life meditation is a more
  active process than I had thought. How does the mindfulness process relate to this kind of
  meditation?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's be clear. The process is active whether one is in
  formal meditation or in a daily-life situation. In the sitting practice, although the body
  is stationary, the mind is actively watching; it is mindful of the body or the mind.
  Meditation is a mental discipline that ultimately leads the mind to a purified state. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: In daily-life meditation, is the mind actively
  watching itself through a state of no thought?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes. When your mindfulness is at its peak, you can
  experience states where thoughts fall away. But the no-thought state lasts for only a
  split second. You experience a heightened awareness that is one-pointed as well as
  absolutely quiet. This momentary one-pointedness of the mind is called khanika samadhi.
  Although it is not as prolonged as the samadhi states in sitting meditation, khanika
  samadhi has the same intensity and quality. In khanika samadhi, thoughts fall away and the
  mind arrives at its purest state. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: If thoughts fall away, does it mean that no
  &quot;I&quot; exists in that moment?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, but only momentarily. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>M: If no &quot;I&quot; exists in that moment, what
  does exist? What happens in that moment of no thought?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When split-second samadhi occurs, in that moment there is
  no thought, but only an absolutely pure and heightened consciousness. It is at that moment
  that panna or insight awareness arises. The person experiences pure vision, ditthi
  visuddhi. In Pali, ditthi means view and visuddhi means purity. So, it means pure vision. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although this experience may be brief, it is timeless and
  infinite; it is a moment of transformation. It is the moment when the &quot;I&quot; and
  &quot;mine&quot; resolve. After that moment of no thought, pure vision is followed by
  thought, but the thoughts, emotions and actions are not in the old habitual routine. In
  the moment of an absolutely still and quiet mind, pure vision (panna or insight), love and
  compassion arise from our inner depths. Subsequent thoughts and actions are tempered with
  love and compassion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You see, meditation does not make you into an inert,
  unthinking, unfeeling person, my dear. In fact, meditation brings out the best in you --
  love, warmth and sensitivity to all beings. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The practice of mindfulness, whether within the sitting
  meditation or in this daily-life meditation, is an active, ongoing process. In the sitting
  practice, although the body is stationary, the mind is actively watching and mindful of
  the body or the mind. Likewise, in meditation in daily life, the mind is actively watching
  itself regardless of posture and time. The mental discipline involved in each form is what
  is most crucial and ultimately leads the mind to its purified state. It is not the
  postures that lead to enlightenment, though postures are useful in helping the mind to
  quiet itself. If you understand this clearly, you can meditate anywhere and anytime. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Inner Retreat</font></h3>
  <b><i><p><font face="Times New Roman">L: I've just finished a retreat at a meditation
  center and I am having some difficulty adjusting to the outside world. It was so tranquil
  in the center that I find it very difficult to cope with the sights and sounds and all the
  confusion outside. How can one cope with the transition?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Thynn: </b>Your experience is not unusual. Many people
  find themselves in the same kind of situation when they first leave a meditation center.
  In the retreat, conditions for peace and quiet are established, and meditation can be
  practiced without disturbance. While you are in the retreat, you become temporarily
  conditioned to these quiet circumstances. So when you come out, you find the bombardment
  of the sights and sounds difficult to handle. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>L: How can one better cope with the transition?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's look at how your mind functions inside and outside
  the retreat. When you were in the retreat, you were practicing mindfulness intensively.
  Your mindfulness was in a very high gear. When you came out, you probably left the
  mindfulness behind, didn't you? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>L: Ha! I actually did.</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There you are! As soon as you left the retreat, you
  changed gear. You let your mindfulness go and you were back to your old unmindful state.
  When you are suddenly faced with the confusion in the outside world, you find it difficult
  to handle. The difficulty arises because you separate meditation from daily experience.
  Actually, the mindfulness you have learned in the retreat should equip you better to face
  the outside world. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>L: How's that?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, first you must overcome the impression that
  mindfulness can only be practiced in the retreat and at a particular time and place. This
  conditioning renders it difficult for anyone to bridge the gap between the retreat and the
  outside world. In the retreat, you have learned to be mindful sitting cross- legged with
  your eyes closed. Now that you are out of the retreat you can practice the same kind of
  mindfulness, but you have got to be able to do it with your eyes open, while you deal with
  a myriad of problems and bombardments. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>L: Isn't that difficult?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nothing is too difficult if you know how. Probably the
  first thing you learned in the meditation retreat was how to be in the present moment. You
  can also practice that outside. You can be mindful of everything you do -- cooking,
  washing up, bathing, driving, walking. You can be mindful of just about anything. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not only that, but in the retreat you invariably learn to
  watch your mind like a witness, without likes and dislikes. In daily life you can watch
  your mind like a witness in the same way. You can watch your aversions to sights and
  sounds as they come to you. Let them come and let them go. Be equanimous to your feelings
  about the outside world, and your equanimity will overflow to the outside world itself as
  well. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As you are witness to your own reactions to the outside
  world, you will also become a witness to the sights and sounds, and not be so disturbed by
  them. When you become quite good at this, you will actually be living with an inner
  retreat whatever your circumstances, whether quiet or not. All the world may go round and
  round, but your inner world will be still and you will find you won't need a separate time
  and place to meditate. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>L: What about setting up a time to practice at home
  in the course of the day?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is fine to do that if you can be equanimous about that
  set period of practice. You see, what happens with most people is that they become
  dependent on that meditative practice and find they cannot function the whole day properly
  if they do not have the chance to sit and meditate in the morning. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>L: Why is that?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is a form of conditioning like everything else. It is
  like being addicted to the morning cup of coffee or tea. You can become addicted to
  meditation also. Although this is definitely not a bad conditioning per se, there are many
  subtleties that one must be aware of in meditation. The mind is very tricky, and one must
  always be aware of how the mind can be trapped. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>L: Then what does one do in such circumstances?</i></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most important thing is to develop equanimity toward
  your own practice. It may be the most difficult thing to do because, like everything else,
  one becomes attached to the meditative practices. We learn to be equanimous with other
  things, but forget to be so with our own practice. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>L: If we can be equanimous with our practice, will
  it be possible to set aside a time for meditation and yet maintain an equilibrium through
  out the day?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That will be possible if you can be equanimous and at the
  same time mindful outside the practice session. Then you can be good at meditating, both
  in and out of the set period. </font></p>
