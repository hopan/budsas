  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Foreword</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I am very impressed by the thoroughness and care with
  which Dr. Thynn Thynn explains the path of mindfulness in daily life in her book. This has
  not been emphasized as strongly in the monastic and meditative teachings of Buddhism that
  have taken root in the West. In fact, much of Buddhist practice in Asia has followed the
  intensive model. But clearly, that will not work for those of us who are householders in
  the West. And anyway, the wonderful experiences of intensive practice often lead to less
  transformation of our lives than we might hope, so that after intensive meditation
  practice we are back again in the midst of our lives with the question of how to bring the
  Dhamma to bear in everyday life. I am so pleased when I see a book like Dr. Thynn Thynn's
  that speaks directly to this situation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I applaud her clarity and courage for teaching in the
  straightforward way that she does. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Introduction</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Years ago when I came to Thynn-Thynn's small Dharma group
  in Bangkok, I was a newcomer to Buddhism. Thynn-Thynn opened the door to her home and
  welcomed me with warm eyes and an infectious laugh. Several of her friends joined us and
  began asking her questions about Buddhism. Smiling, she answered them in a casual way,
  often using personal anecdotes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the years went by, the group grew. Friends invited
  their curious friends to come. Thynn-Thynn responded by offering more structured sessions.
  We literally sat at her feet as she gave a discourse, drew diagrams, and defined Pali
  terms. After a lunch filled with laughter and talk, we met again for lively discussions.
  Someone would ask for clarification of a point. The discussion would roll around to: How
  can I apply this in my life? How will it help me be mindful around my little toddlers? How
  can I practice equanimity with my rebellious teenagers? How can I share this with a
  closed-minded spouse? How can I be more compassionate to a friend in need? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thynn-Thynn would gently offer, in a soft voice, her
  insights. Rather than suggest a specific solution, she would propose a Dharma way of
  looking at a problem. The questioner would return home and try &quot;stopping and
  looking&quot; and &quot;letting go.&quot; That was our practice. Go home and try it out. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Over the years, we became a support group, but one with a
  difference. The Dharma propelled us forward in our lives; it held us together as a group.
  It wasn't always easy. We were all so different -- or so we thought at first. We came from
  many countries -- Burma, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Mexico, Switzerland, Russia and the United
  States. We were an eclectic mix of religious backgrounds -- Buddhist, Catholic,
  Protestant, Jewish, Muslim and atheist. And we had very different personalities --
  devotional, intellectual, artistic, out-going and contemplative. In a sense, we were
  speaking different languages: the logic of the intellectual left the devotional unmoved;
  dramatic insights overwhelmed those with more reserved temperaments. Sometimes sparks
  would fly at meetings. But Thynn-Thynn leavened these delicate situations with her ready
  humor and perceptive awareness. The social interactions within the group itself also
  became part of our practice. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Going one step further, Thynn-Thynn customized the
  practice for each of us. She matched, point for point, the heated arguments of the
  intellectual. She urged artists to delight in the beauty of the moment. Nurturing each
  person's natural tendencies, she encouraged each person to open up and blossom. Acutely
  sensitive to each person's needs, Thynn-Thynn sought to balance our rigid conditioning.
  She prodded the lazy, shocked the arrogant, and relaxed the compulsive. In doing so, she
  revealed many different paths to understanding. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Gradually, each of us softened into Buddhism. We found we
  smiled more, laughed more and loved more. We slowed down and had glimpses of things as
  they are. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Recently, Thynn-Thynn has moved to the United States; new
  friends gather around, eager to learn the Dharma and apply it to their daily lives. The
  Bangkok group still continues. Those of us who were in the original group remain friends
  and continue to practice, although we are separated by years and miles. Despite our
  differences, we found we have a lasting commitment to living the Dharma, and an abiding
  love for the woman who showed us it can be done. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Preface to the Second Edition</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ten years ago, when our small Dhamma group started to meet
  in Bangkok, I was inspired to write about the many questions that arose. The articles
  compiled in this book came out of those many discussions. As I wrote, I gave these
  articles to Dhamma friends to help them digest the Dhammic point of view and encourage
  them in their spiritual quests. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I wrote the articles to encourage practitioners learning
  to meditate in daily life. In this sense, the articles are presented as a
  &quot;hands-on&quot; or, more accurately, a &quot;minds-on&quot; training manual. Although
  I discuss meditation in general, the real focus is on how the Dhamma brings us into
  spontaneous, wholesome and creative living. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This book is primarily for beginners in meditation. I have
  used theory and Pali terms sparingly. The emphasis is on the process and insights into the
  nature of the mind. My objective in presenting the articles is to help the aspirant build
  up a solid foundation of mindfulness as a way of life rather than as a practice separated
  from daily living. For those who have been practicing meditation in the formal way, this
  approach can help them incorporate their mindfulness practice into everyday experience.
  The process of mindfulness is the same, except in one important aspect: instead of sitting
  down, closing the eyes and watching the mind, the practice is done while attending to
  everyday business. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the first edition of this book came out in 1992, I
  received comments to the effect that my teaching style is similar to Krishnamurti and Zen.
  When someone once mentioned it to my friend, the Theravada nun Shinma Dhammadina, she
  replied, &quot;That's because her teachers' teachings are very much like Krishnamurti and
  Zen.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">My teachers are Burmese abbots, Sayadaw U Eindasara of
  Rangoon and Sayadaw U Awthada of Henzada. They are Theravada monks, but teach the Dhamma
  in a very unorthodox and dynamic fashion. They veer away from the emphasis on the
  traditional form of &quot;sitting&quot; meditation, and instead strongly emphasize
  &quot;looking directly within and practicing mindfulness in everyday life.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I was very much attracted to this approach because of its
  simplicity, directness and practicality in daily life. Just before I met my teachers in
  1973, I had meditated briefly in the traditional sitting style at the Mahasi Meditation
  Center in Rangoon with the late Sayadaw U Zawana. After a few sessions with him, I began
  to realize I was automatically becoming aware of my feelings in daily life and was
  becoming much calmer without formal &quot;sitting in meditation.&quot; I discovered that
  as soon as I focused on my feelings they would drop away very quickly. Then, through some
  good Dhamma friends, I found out about my teachers' method of finding peace of mind by
  stopping and looking at the mind, moment by moment, in daily life as a form of meditation
  practice. I felt immediately drawn to this style of teaching since I was experiencing
  exactly what these teachers taught. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When I met my teachers, I was struck by the Sayadaws'
  profound wisdom and their innovative style of teaching. Their liberal interpretation of
  Theravada Buddhism is rarely found in traditional Buddhist Myanmar. Their teachings may
  sound similar to Krishnamurti's, in an attempt to break down the mind from all
  conditioning to its ultimate freedom, but what is striking in the approach of the Sayadaws
  is that they provide a means to reassimilate the relative with a new insightful
  perspective. They are also exceptionally skillful in providing hands-on training which is
  similar to a direct transmission in the Zen tradition. This is probably why my book may
  appear to some as an integration of Theravada Buddhism, Krishnamurti and Zen. My teachers
  have not been Western-educated, and came to know about Krishnamurti and Zen only when we,
  their students, introduced them to these teachings. It is thus interesting to see the
  confluence of such apparently disparate approaches to spiritual truth in such an unlikely
  manner. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I am often asked what my teachers were like. They are
  actually an unlikely pair. Sayadaw U Eindasara is a profound mystic and poet and the
  quieter one of the pair. We fondly call him &quot;the laughing Buddha.&quot; He rarely
  appears or talks in public but devotes extraordinary energy to working with his students.
  Sayadaw U Awthada is brilliant and quick-witted and we called him &quot;the Burmese Zen
  Master&quot; in recognition of his Zen-like ability to tie up his students in knots and
  push them beyond the intellect. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These teachers invite comparisons with Krishnamurti in
  that they live a very simple life, without seeking followers, without setting up any
  institutions or organizations, and keeping away from publicity and fame. They still live
  and teach within the confines of monkhood, yet maintain an integrity and openness rarely
  found in Buddhist Asia. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I had the good fortune to study closely with these two
  remarkable teachers and I remember with fondness and gratitude the time I spent training
  with them. They thought I was a little tricky, as I would continuously bring people from
  all walks of life to be exposed to their teaching first-hand. From such close encounters I
  have the privilege now to share my experiences with members of my Dhamma groups and also,
  through this book, with many others. To these two teachers, I bow in great reverence; I
  also bow down to my guru, Shwe Baw Byun Sayadaw, for his kind support for this book and
  for my Dhamma work in the West. </font></p>

  <h3><font COLOR="#0000a0" face="Times New Roman">Acknowledgements</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I am deeply indebted to my dearest Dhamma friend, Pam
  Taylor, who was the very first person to suggest that I should get my writings published,
  and who also took it upon herself to better organize my random writing and restructure it
  into a manuscript. Without her valiant efforts and superb editing, my manuscript would
  still be lying on a shelf in my basement. My thanks also go to Marcia Hamilton, who edited
  the first draft manuscript, and to Ashin U Tay Zaw Batha, who edited the text. Then it was
  my illustrious husband, Dr. San Lin, who succeeded in nudging me to complete the
  manuscript and who was enormously helpful in preparing the final version. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is not only to my husband, but to my wonderful
  children, Win and Tet, that I owe many insights into myself, human nature and family life.
  Many friends ask me what my meditation is and I always reply, &quot;My family is my
  meditation.&quot; It is mostly through my family that I have learned to practice what I
  preach. It is the family that compels me to sharpen my wits, to train and retrain my own
  mindfulness. In fact, my family is my greatest challenge and training ground. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I am very grateful to my old Dhamma friends from Bangkok
  for the memorable and joyous times I had with them and for their candid and challenging
  questions which resulted in this book. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many thanks to John Hein and Charlotte Richardson for
  their careful editing and revising, to Nee Nee Myint for retyping, and to David Babski for
  formatting the manuscript. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lastly, I would like to thank John Bullitt for putting it
  on-line. </font></p>
