    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">I.2.1 : INDIAN SOCIETY AND THOUGHT
    BEFORE THE ADVENT OF LORD BUDDHA.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>General introduction: </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Indian society is the one which gave birth to one of the
    oldest civilization of the world. It was at first a &quot;Bronze Age&quot; formed about
    3,000 B.C. according to the archaeological information. The settled people in India, such
    as Mundian, Sumerian,......, especially Dravidian, were possible to form an agricultural
    civilization called the indus civilization. According to A.K. Warder, in his book titled
    &quot;Indian Buddhism&quot; (Delhi 1991, p.17), this civilization spread Eastwards into
    the Ganges valley and South-East across Gujarat. Its main centres were two great cities,
    one in Punjab, and the other in Sindh. Mentioning the religion of Indus people, Warder
    wrote: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In religion the Indus people appear to have had a
      cult of a Great God, some of whose characteristics suggest that he was the prototype of
      the modern S ùiva (who has always been especially popularamong the Tamils): on the one
      hand he seems to symbolize creation and fertility, on the other hand he may appear in the
      role of an ascetic, or a yogi developing his supernatural powers&quot;. (1) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the period of time from the 16th century B.C. to the
    13th century B.C., the Indus civilization came to collapse when the Ariyan people possibly
    from the Caucasia (belonging to Armenia, U.S.S.R.) entered India. They passed Hindu - Kush
    mountains, arrived at Punjab. Here the Dravidians firmly fought against the Aryan, but
    they failed. The Ariyans turned to be influenced by the agricultural civilization of the
    Dravidians; they followed the way of life of the Dravidians, settled in villages, towns
    and cities. The Dravidian, on the other side, were influenced by the thoughts of the
    Ariyan as nomads. These two civilizations were combined and made up in a new one during
    the period of time of the &quot;Iron Age&quot;, around 1,000 B.C. to 800 B.C..Regarding
    this historical event, A.K. Warder wrote: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;According to the archaeological evidence Aryan
      people entered India at the time of the collapse of the Indus civilization (about 1,600
      B.C.). In fact they were probably barbarian invaders who conquered the Indus people and
      destroyed their cities. These Aryan spoke an early form of Sanskrit called
      &quot;vedic&quot; after the earliest extant Indian texts (the Veda) which can at present
      be read. The earliest of these Vedic texts of the Aryans were perhaps composed two or
      three centuries after theconquest&quot;. (2) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr. Chandradhar Sharma claimed that: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The Vedas are the oldest extant literary moment
      of the Aryan mind. The origin of Indian philosophy, as an autonomous system, has developed
      practically unaffected by external influences. Unfortunately our knowledge of the Vedic
      period is, even to this day, too meagre and imperfect&quot;. (3) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The thoughts introduced in the Vedas, especially in the
    Rig-Veda were therefore under the colours of the Aryans. They seemed to have originated
    from the Caucasia of the very old days, from the places where the Aryan nomads paused
    after they passed many mountainous regions, lonely deserts or immense plateaus, in shining
    sky, heavy rains, snowy storms, or under the torches flickering in late nights. Those
    thoughts are of the boundless and powerful universe which relates to human beings. They
    became more and more practical and closer and closer to men when they mentioned gods of
    earth, of trees, of cows of the Dravidians in the very old time of the agricultural
    civilization. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A.K. Warder added: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;During the period of the Paurava Empire the
      ancient Vedic texts were collected, many more were composed, and older and newer texts
      were formed into a Canon of scriptures collectively called the Veda. In actual fact there
      was not a single Canon, but several recensions belonging to as many schoolsof
      priests....... The canon is therefore the collected learning of the brahmans or priests.
      It consists of poetry, songs, ritual and philosophy&quot;. (4) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There were a lot of changes in Indian society in the
    beginning of the &quot;Iron Age&quot;, so A.K. Warder continued: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;From the Veda effectively codified under the
      Pauravas, and from the compositions attributed to this group of thinkers of about the 9th
      century B.C., orthodox and conservative thought in India has since derived its religion,
      its ritual, its philosophy, its heroic epic, its ancient historical traditions, its laws,
      its geometry, its astronomy and its linguistic science. All this constitutes what is
      generally known as &quot;Brahmanism; as a civilization, a way of life, a religion and much
      else. In a sense this formative of Brahmanism was a &quot;heroic period&quot; that of the
      most famous heroes celebrated in the epic&quot;. (5) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, the earliest period of time of the Vedas may be
    called the Vedic period, and the next period of time, when the Indian thoughts became more
    practical and scientific, the Post Vedic period. The Indian thought of these two periods
    are described clearly by Benimadhab Barua in his work titled &quot;A History of
    Pre-Buddhistic Indian Philosophy&quot;. It may be summarized as follows: (6) </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- At the early time of Indian culture, Vedic Sages opened
      the pages of hymns mentioning cosmological problems and considering water as the original
      matter ofthings. Then another question arose: What came into being immediately after water
      before created things? </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For this question, Aghamarsana, who was known as the first
    philosopher of India, replied: that was the year, the time principle which is the lord of
    birth and death. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- Heranyagarbha said it was the Golden germ. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- Narayana claimed it was Purusa. Etc. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, again another question was put up: from what did
    water spring up? </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- Ghamarsana said it was from night or chaos. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- Prajapati Paremesthin replied: I may know it, or
      perhaps I may know it not. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- Brahmanaspati claimed: it was from nothing. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- Anila's answer was from Air element. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And so forth... </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The philosophical questions gradually came into being
    after the Vedic period of time. They became clearer and clearer, and more and more
    scientific. This clearly tells us that the conception of selfness of things were more and
    more emphasized. From the philosophical question asked from the early time of the Vedas:
    How can I unite with nature, god or Brahman? came to the question asked by later Brahmana
    teachers that: Who am I? (or Who is he?). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The answer to this question related to metomophosis from a
    physical or organic man to a physiological man, then to a psychological man, then to a
    metaphysical man, then lastly to a spiritual or religious ethical man (7). </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- I am Naramaya: I am an individual being as all animals
      on earth and all creatures of the air are. All organic or inorganic beings are formed from
      Purusa (the Sun or the solar substance). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- I am Annamaya (embryonic man): a man is composed of
      food or five elements, produced from the essence of food digested by the father
      communicated to the mother and established in the womb. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- I am Pranamaya (physiological man): a man born of the
      parents, brought forth by the mother, a living body, that is to say, a body imbued with
      life, composed of food or elements nourished by food, reduced at death to an anatomical
      man, a corpse dissolved hereafter into elements or returned to the physical world. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- I am Manomaya (psychological man): is a conscious
      individual who can perceive through the senses, who dreams, imagines, thinks, fells, wills
      and who perceives duality and plurality among things. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- I am Vijnànamaya (metaphysical man): a man who is
      endowed with nothing but the inherent conscious sentient principle or soul, a thinker who
      realizes the unity of cause in the variety of appearance. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- I am Ànandamaya (spiritual or religious - ethical
      man): a blessed soul united with divine. It seems to appear to us that early Vedic sages
      lived very naturally and closely to nature - this relates to the way of life of the Aryans
      as nomads -. The limit between man and nature didn't appear clear. Their philosophical
      questions were therefore centered on &quot;who is he?&quot; and&quot;How can I unite with
      him?&quot; But after that period of time, the Brahmana teachers turned to think and think
      of the &quot;I&quot; (the first person), of the self of things as entities, then the
      colours of Indian thoughts started turning practical - this relates to the settled way of
      life of the agricultural civilization of the Dravidian. This is the reason why the author
      of this work call this period of time of Indian philosophy the Post Vedic philosophy. This
      period existed until the time when the six Schools of thought appeared. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Six Schools of thought under the time of Lord
    Buddha: </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Under the time of Lord Buddha, the Masters of the Six
    Schools of thought in India were best known. They all opposed to the doctrine taught by
    Lord Buddha, and were classed by Buddhists as the Six Heretics or Sophists
    (cha-titthiyà). They were known as Purana kassapa, Makkhali Gosàla. Ajita kesa -
    Kambala, Pakudha Kaccàyana, Sanjaya Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nàtaputta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em>Purana Kassapa:</em></strong> (8) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He was known as a naked ascetic, died in 572 B.C...His
    doctrine, according to the Sutta of Samannaphala (Length Sayings, Vol.I), is called
    Akiriyavàda, or Ahetuvàda (the doctrine of non-action). For him, when we act or cause
    other to act, it is not the soul that acts or cause others to act. The soul really is
    passive (niskriya), out of the result of good or bad actions - the reality is also beyond
    both good and evil. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em>Makkhali - Gosàla </em></strong>(or Maskarin
    Gosala): (9) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Jaina Bhagavati sutra and itscommentary,Makkhali
    Gosala theory is summed up as the doctrine of transformation, but in Buddhist texts,
    Sàmannaphalasuttam, it is considered as &quot;theory of purification through
    transmigration (samsàra - suddhi). For this point of view, both fools and wise alike will
    reach perfection by gradual transformation. All beings will attain, and must attain,
    perfection in course of time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Ajita Kesa - Kambala:</strong></em> (10) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His philosophy is materialism, it may be called
    annihilationism or non-eternalism. He claimed that there is no individuality after death.
    When a living body constituted of the four elements dies, earth element returns to the
    earth, water to the water, heat to the fire, air to the air, and the sense faculties pass
    into space. Everybody ceases to be after death. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Pakudha Kàtyayana: </strong></em>(11)(orKakuda
    Kàtyàyana): </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hisphilosophy is seen in sàmannaphalasu-ttam as the
    doctrine of seven categories (satta - kàya - vàda); in Jaina sutra Kritanga it is
    described as the doctrine of soul as a sixth (atma - sastha - vàda). For his view, there
    is no act of killing, or hearing, knowing, or instructing in reality. That is only the act
    of separating from one another the elements constructing their organic unity. When a man
    with a sharp sword cleaves a head in twain, he does not thereby deprive anyone of life, a
    sword only penetrated into the interval between seven elementary substances. This way of
    reasoning is very dangerous. It can cause men to destroy ethics and make disorder of
    society. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Sanjaya Belatthaputta</strong></em> (12): </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sanjaya Belatthaputta is classed by Buddhist text as the
    best known sceptic. He was a master of Sàriputta, the chief of disciples of Lord Buddha,
    before the latter became a disciple under the guidance of Lord Buddha. His doctrine is
    known as Agnostics, Sceptics or Eel Wrigglers. Lord Buddha says, when Sanjaya and his
    disciples are asked a question on this or that, they equivocate and wriggle like an eel
    and their reason will fall into one or another or all of the following four cases. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Case 1 and 2: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">We neither know the good (kusala) nor the evil (akusala)
      as it really is. In such case, if we make a positive declaration either with regard to
      good or evil, we may be led away by conceit or pride, or influenced by ill-will and
      resentment. Under these conditions we may be proved wrong, and that may cause us the pain
      of remorse and ultimately a hindrance to the tranquility we aim at. Or in the second
      place, we may fall into a grasping condition of heart (upàdana) which will culminate in a
      similar disturbance of peace. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Case 3 and 4: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">We neither know the good nor the evil as it really is.
      There are persons who are clever, subtle, expert, controversialists, hair splitters (vàda
      - vedhi - rupa), who go about, as it were, shattering the dogmas of others. But we, on the
      other hand, are dull and stupid. Hence, if we make a definite statement with regard to
      good or evil, they may join issue with us, ask us for reasons, and point out our errors.
      This may cause us as before, the pain toremorse and disturb our imperturbability. Thus,
      fearing being wrong in an expressed opinion, the falling into a grasping condition of
      heart, or the joinder of issue, we declare nothing to be either good or evil, but on a
      question being put to us on this or that, we answer thus: </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- Is A B? -- No. <br>
        -- Is A not B? -- No. <br>
        -- Is A both B and not B? -- No. <br>
        -- Is A neither B nor not B? -- No. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such is a reason of a wriggling eel ! </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Nigantha Nàtaputta:</strong> (13) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nigantha Nàtaputta's doctrine is described in
    Samannaphalasuttam as fourfold self - restraint. When he was asked by King Ajàtasattu
    that, &quot;Can you, Nigantha Nàtaputta, point to such a reward visible here and now as a
    fruit of the homeless life?&quot; Nigantha Nàtaputta said, your majesty here a Nigantha
    is bound by a fourfold restraint. What four? He is curbed by all curbs, enclosed by all
    curbs, cleared by all curbs, and claimed by all curbs. And as far as a Nigantha is bound
    by this fourfold restraint thus the Nigantha is called self-perfected, self-controlled,
    self-established&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the above Indian thoughts, from Vedic thought, were
    evaluated and classified in Buddhist text as follows: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- Eighteen kinds of wrong view concerning the past: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Eternalism: 4 kinds of wrong view. <br>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For those 62 kinds of wrong view, Lord Buddha declared: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This, monks, the Tathàgata understands: these
      view points thus grasped and adhered to will lead to such and such destinations in another
      world. This the Tathàgata knows, and more, but He is not attached to that knowledge. And
      being thus unattached He has experienced for himself perfect peace, and having truly
      understood the arising and passing away of feelings, their attraction and peril and the
      deliverance from them, the Tathàgata is liberated without remainder. These, monks,
      arethose other matters profound, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, excellent
      beyond mere thought, subtle, to be experienced by the wise, which the Tathàgata having
      realized them by his own superknowledge, proclaims, and about which those who would

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Evaluation of Indian thought by Indian thinkers: S.
    Radhakrishnan, a contemporary Indian thinker, gives an evaluation of Indian thoughts in
    his work titled &quot;Indian philosophy&quot; that : </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; The Indian never felt that the world was a field
      of battle where men struggled for power,wealth and domination. When we do not need to
      waste ourenergies on problems of life on earth, exploiting nature and controlling the
      forces of the world, we begin to think of the higher life, how to live more perfectly in
      the spirit. Perhaps an enervating climate inclined the Indian to rest and retirement. The
      huge forests with their wide leafy avenues afforded great opportunities for the devout
      soul to wander peacefully through them, dream strange dreams and burst forth into joyous
      songs... It was in the asramas and tapovanas or forest hermitages that the thinking men of
      India meditated on the deeper problems of existence&quot;. (16) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">S. Radhakrishnan added: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; The philosophic attempt to determine the nature
      of reality may start either with thinking self or the objects of thought. In India the
      interest of philosophy is in the self of man where the vision is turned outward, the rush
      of Fleeting events engages the mind. In India &quot; Atmamam viddhi&quot;, know the self,
      sums up the law and the prophets. Within man is the spirit that is the center of
      everything. </font></p>

      potential God. Education made man the meeting point of Heaven and Earth. In the
      Upanishadic language the task of education was to draw out the lustre of the heavenly fire
      and to fill the Earth with it. According to Badarayana of the Brahma Sutra the purpose of
      education was to produce men of wisdom, holiness and sanctity... Aim of education in
      Ancient India has, however, been character building to increase strength of mind with a
      view to expand one's intellect, to enable the people to stand on their own feet and to
      produce men of wisdom, holiness and sanctity&quot;. (18) </font></i></p>

    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; The Indian seers clearly perceived that
      education is necessary for man to lead an ideal life. Aim of education in ancient India
      was to train the boys and girls to take initiative, to accept discipline, responsibility
      and leadership, to behave, to appreciate the difference between right and wrong and be
      familiar with accepted social and moral codes of behaviour and finally to possess a
      healthy sense of the richness of his country's past history, to enable him to serve his

      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">The illumination, insight and guidance whicheducation
      gives to us effects a complete transformation. &quot;If one human being is superior to
      another&quot;, says a Vedic thinker, &quot;It is not because he possesses an extra hand or
      eye, but because his mind and intellect are sharpened and rendered more efficient by
      education. Devoid of education, says Bhartrihari, we are mere beasts; education elevates
      us into human beings. Life without education is, therefore, utterly futile and
      worthless&quot;. (19) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From what S. Radhakrishnan and S.D. Dev expressed, as
    quoted above, the author recognizes that the central point of the thought and education of
    ancient India lies in the self of human being where exists wisdom or the spirit that is
    the center of everything. This is also a crucial point, in the author's opinion, opening a
    new course of modern education or culture for peace and happiness of men. However,
    &quot;What is that true self&quot;, and &quot;how to cultivate, or produce, wisdom from
    that true self&quot; are other problems. It is the same for the way of meditation: one may
    ask: What is that way of meditation? What people could get from it? The right answer for
    those questions still existed as a dream of India until the time when Lord Buddha Gotama
    attained Enlightenment under the &quot;Bodhi - tree&quot; at Bodh Gaya. Then the great
    dream of great India really came true. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the discourse of Brahmajàla said, the Indian sages and
    thinkers were obsessed by their attachment to knowledges and feelings therefore they
    couldn't know and see truth and the Way to Truth. Only Lord Buddha did not attach to His
    knowledge and feeling, so He realized Truth, Enlightement. This fact will be examined in
    next part. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>About Lord Buddha Gotama: </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The man who realized Noble Truth and became the Buddha was
    the prince, Siddhattha by name. He was born in 624 B.C. according to the source of
    information taken from the World Buddhist Conference held in Tokyo in 1952 - at the park
    Lumbini in the Kingdom of Nepal of today. His father, Suddhodana, belonging to Khattiya
    social class, Sàkya family, was the king of Kapilavatthu. His mother, the queen
    Mahàmàyà, died a week after giving birth to Him. Right after the birth, a wise sage,
    named Asita, read His body and foretold in general that: there were thirty two special
    marks on His tiny body which say that He would lead His homeless life as a wandering monk
    and would become a fully - enlightened Buddha, a teacher of Gods and Men. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The discourse of Nàlaka of Suttanipàta (Khuddakanikàya
    Collection) recorded Asita's words as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">-- Then remembering his own migration he was displeased
      and shed tears; seeing this the sakyas asked the weeping Isi whether there would be any

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Siddhattha grew up to be a very splendid young man, was
    good at His studies, excellent at all kinds of sportsand martial arts, was very handsome,
    just and kind. He married Yasodharà, the most beautiful girl of His time, when he was
    eighteen years of age. His only son, Ràhula, was born when He was twenty nine years of
    age. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Siddhattha made four fateful trips to the outside world,
    out of the Kingdom. On the first trip, He met an old man; on the second, a sick man; on
    the third, a corpse being carried away to be cremated on the burning ghat; and on the
    fourth, a wandering holy monk. He did receive a vital shock on the above trips which made
    Him come to the most important decision of His life: He left His throne for leading His
    life as a wandering ascetic monk to look for truth. He was twenty nine years old then. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He came to study under two most distinguished Samana
    teachers of the time: Àlàra Kàlàma and Uddaka Ràmaputta. Àlàra kàkàma taught Him
    how to attain the jhàna of Nothingness; Uddaka Ràmaputta taught Him how to attain the
    jhàna of Neither perception nor non - perception. He obtained in a short period of time
    what Alàra and Uddaka obtained, but He was still unsatisfied with His attainment, because
    He knew he was then hindered by ignorance (avijjà) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Siddhattha then went into the jungle near Uruvelà and
    practised the forms of asceticism with the sage Kondanna and his four friends. He spent
    six years living alone and naked in forests, slept on beds of thorns, burned in the heat
    of midday sun, and suffered cold at night, until the day He starved Himself into a state
    of extreme emasculation. In this period of time of practisingasceticism, there were three
    thoughtful images arising in His mind once. They were recorded that: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Moreover, Aggivessana, three similes occurred to

    there were violent pains in His body and head. He realized this way of practising could
    not answer to his main problem; if He went on abusing His body in that way, He would die
    before He could find the answer. He then took food again in order to have enough strength
    to make a new start of practice. His five fellow asceticswitnessed His change and
    declared, <b>&quot;Gotama has taken the easy life !&quot;</b> then they kept themselves
    far away from Him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Siddhattha was then so lonely in the midst of the immense
    ocean of sufferings of birth and death. He started thinking again and again of a middle
    way between the luxurious and the ascetical ways that He had not practised. He recalled an
    incident during a &quot;ploughing Festival&quot; when, as a child of six or seven years
    old, He sat under a rose - apple tree and entered meditative absorptions. He said to
    himself that, &quot;Might that be the way to Enlightenment ?&quot; </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, Dependent Origination realized by Lord Buddha Gotama,
    which had not been heard before in India, is a very special doctrine determining the
    difference between Buddhism and other religions and philosophies. It is this which opens
    what is called Buddhist Pàli Tipitaka or Pàli Suttapitaka in a narrow meaning. It is
    this which shows the truth of men and nature, and the truth of men's suffering and the way
    of ceasing it. Therefore, it may be considered as the source of a good course of education
    or culture suggesting a new course of research for the true meaning of personality which
    says that the meaning of Dependent Origination really is the Buddhist concept of
    personality; to understand what a man really is, one should understand what Dependent
    Origination is. It is unnecessary to examine separately the concept of man as the
    existence of the Four Elements (Catu-dhàtu), or as a Satta, a puggala, attà, jiva etc.
    which denote, &#145;ego-entity', because all these concepts are implied in the term
    Nàma-ruùpa, the fourth element of the Dependent Origination - This is what the author is
    going to discuss about in next chapters. </font></p>
