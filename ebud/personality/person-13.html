    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">I.1.1: TITLE AND CLARIFICATION OF
    THE TOPIC</font> </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Education is often understood as what has made up culture
    and civilization of a country. It includes creative works as the source of civilization,
    and its various roles of building and developing society as the source of the culture of a
    people. Education, culture and civilization all are products of man&#146;s way of
    thinking. People of all times always wish safety, peace and happiness to themselves. A
    system of human education or culture must therefore bring safety, peace and happiness to
    human beings. Such a system of education, or such a course of culture, must be based on an
    ideal system of educational philosophy, psychology, and an ideal pattern of education.
    These important educational problems, in the author&#146;s opinion, must come from an
    ideal theory of personality which can tell the truth of man, life and the unseparable
    relationship between them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As people could know, the civilization of human beings of
    nowadays is in crises. The developed countries have centered on developing light and heavy
    industries, especially the heavy ones. The developing countries are on their ways to
    industrialization. They are all concerned much about the development of economy -ie.
    concerned much about production and advantages - and in the process almost ignoring the
    development of a moral and spiritual way of life. This course of development relating to
    the craving (tanhà) and grasping (upàdàna) of human beings has brought to this world
    cold and hot wars, the serious pollution of the environment and ethical, social crises.
    The contemporary educators, religious leaders, ecologists etc., all over the world have
    warned us of the danger of mass-destruction through atomic and chemical wars, and air,
    land and water pollution. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are also other values of the current education that
    need to be re-evaluated and clarified through the Lord Buddha&#146;s teachings, such as: </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">1.The problem of competition: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The civilization of the twentieth century is based on the
    spirit of competition. For Westerners, this spirit can help them have a fast development
    of economy and culture. But, in reality, it has caused the crises as mentioned above. So
    it must be reviewed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Competition itself is an effort of a man who wants to be
    stronger or better than others, while his main problem is as to how to be better than what
    he is now, as Lord Buddha taught: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">-.&quot; If one man conquer in battle a thousand times
      thousand men, and if another conquer himself, the latter is the greatest of
      conquerors&quot;. (1) (Dhp. 103) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-(&quot; Yo sahassam sahassena sangàme manusse jine
      Ekanca jeyyamattànam sa ve sangàmajuttamo&quot;).(2) (Dhp. 103 ) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-&quot; One&#146;s own self - conquered is better than all
      other people; not even a god, a gandharva, not Màra with Bràhman could change into
      defeat the victory of a man who has vanquished himself, and always lives under
      restraint&quot; (3) + (4). (Dhp. 104 - 105) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">( &quot;Attà have jitam seyyo yà cà&#146;yam itarà
      pajà Attadantassa posassa niccam sanatacàrino&quot; (5) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Neva devo, na gandhabbo, na màro sahabrahmmunà
      Jitam apajitam kayirà tathàruùpassa jantuno&quot;.) (6) </font></i><b></p>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">2. The problem of training only a social man: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The economic and industrial development requires a system
    of education emphasizing the training of a social man, or a man of power, while an
    education of humanness requires a man himself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For a man himself, he should know who he really is, and
    how to attain happiness in the here-and-now. With regard to this, Lord Buddha said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">-&quot; Self is the lord of self, who else could be the
      lord ? With the self well subdued, a man finds a lord such as few can find&quot;. (7)
      (Dhp. 160) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot; Attà hi attano nàtho ko hi nàtho paro siyà
      Attanà&#146;va sudantena nàtham labhati dullabham&quot;) (8) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- &quot; Let the wise man guard his thoughts, for they are
      difficult to perceive, very artful, and they rush wherever they list: thoughts well
      guarded bring happiness&quot;. (9) (Dhp.36) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-(&quot; Sududdasam sunipunam yatthakàmanipàtin-am
      cittam Rakkheyya medhàvi cittam guttam sukhàvaham&quot;) (10) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-&quot; We live happily indeed, though we call nothing our
      own ! We shall be like the bright gods feeding on happiness&quot;. (11) (Dhp. 200) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot; Susukham vata jìvàma yesam no natthi kincanam
      Pìtibhakkhà bhavissàma devà àbhassarà yathà&quot;) ( 12) </font></i><b></p>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">3. The problem of a pattern of education: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The contemporary educators tend to create a pattern of
    education. This means giving a fixed nature to a man, and stopping his process of
    becoming. It sounds like making shoes of one size for all people of different sizes. So,
    there must be something wrong in that pattern. For the truth of man, Lord Buddha declared:
    </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">- &quot; All forms are selfless&quot;... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- (&quot;Sabbe dhammà anattà&quot;... )</font></i><b></p>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">4.The problem of interrelationship among things: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If a man cannot realize the interrelationship among
    things, he cannot realize the truth of man and life. His ignorance will cause him and his
    life lots of troubles, as it does in the case of environmental pollution. In this case,
    education should help men understand the truth of every existing thing to protect
    environment as well as men. The Buddhist doctrine of Dependent Origination
    (Paticcasamuppàda)and the Five aggregates (Pancakkhandha) may be theories of this
    education for environment that will be discussed in the following pages. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">5. Education for lasting peace for the world: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Peace is the absence of war. In schools, the science of
    history only mentions the events and apparent causes of peace and war, but not the motives
    coming from men&#146;s mind. So, it cannot help human beings build up the lasting peace
    for the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Lord Buddha&#146;s teachings, the root causes
    of all evil deeds, including wars, are greed (lobha), ill-will or hatred (dosa), and
    ignorance (moha). So, the best thing to be done to extinguish all wars is dealing with
    greed, ill-will, and ignorance by practising Dhamma as He taught: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">-&quot; Victory breeds hatred, for the conquered is
      unhappy. He who has given up both victory and defeat, he, the contended, is
      happy&quot;(13) (Dhp. 201) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot; Jayam veram pasavati dukkham seti paràjito
      Upasanto sukham seti hitvà jayaparàjayam&quot;; (14) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-&quot; We live happily indeed, not hating those who hate
      us ! Among men who hate us,we dwell free from hatred !&quot; (15) (Dhp. 197) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot; Susukham vata jiìvàma verinesu averino Verinesu
      manussesu viharàma averino&quot;) (16) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-&quot; We live happily indeed, free from greed among the
      greedy ! Among men who are greedy let us dwell free from greed !&quot; (17) (Dhp. 199) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot; Susukham vata jiìvàma ussukesu anussukà
      Ussukesu manussesu viharàma anussukà&quot;) (18) </font></i><b></p>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">6. A system of educational philosophy: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Educational philosophy is used to serve educational
    purposes in opening a good course of education for men&#146;s happiness. It is based on
    three spheres: epistemology, axiology and ontology. The current system of educational
    philosophy, as well as philosophy in common sense, is created by self-thought which is
    untrue, therefore it meets with crisis. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The truth of Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppàda)
    Lord Buddha realized will show the way to come out of the crisis which is the operation of
    non-self thought, or the operation of wisdom (panna or vijja) leading to the cessation of
    ignorance. This operation will be discussed in next chapter (I.2.) </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">7. Education to remove individual problems: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It may be said that all schools of thought from the old
    days are classified in three spheres: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">a. The third person sphere: All thoughts claiming that
    there exists the first cause of this universe are called thoughts of the third person -
    the person people are talking about. Since the role of mastering life of human beings has
    been lost in this sphere, this thought sphere is called alienation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">b. The second person sphere: All thoughts claiming that
    truth exists in nature or the phenomena are called thoughts of the second person - the
    person people are talking to. This thought sphere is also called alienation because of the
    same reason as given above. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">c. The first person sphere: All thoughts claiming that a
    human being is the master of his own life, or life is for human beings&#146; happiness,
    are called thoughts of the first person - the person is talking. This thought sphere is
    humanist. It includes Buddhism, Existentialism, Phenomenology and world organizations for
    human rights that help a man awaken and turn back to himself. But here a man is still
    facing the hot problems caused by the contradiction between orders coming from his
    thinking and his desiring. This appears like the contradiction between the &quot;Id&quot;
    and the &quot;Superego&quot; discovered by Sigmund Freud. In the author&#146;s mind this
    contradiction may only be resolved by the doctrine of Paticcasamuppàda which suggests a
    way to come out of self-thought, desire and sufferings caused by them. This doctrine may
    also suggest many interesting thoughts on education that the author is going to mention
    next (in &quot;I.2&quot;.). </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">8. On educational psychology: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Educational psychology is a branch of study examining
    theories of personality, human behaviours, the growth of children, adolescents and adults,
    also examining the nature of teaching, learning, the tools of research and evaluation, and
    the way of helping men resolve their problems for their happiness. With regard to the aim
    of understanding man, and of helping man be happy, many teachings of Lord Buddha recorded
    in Pancanikàya are available: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">- &quot;This is the case, monks, where an uninstructed
      average person, taking no account of the pure ones, unskilled in the dhamma of the pure
      ones, ..., recognizes extension as extension, he thinks of extension, he thinks (of self
      as) extension, he thinks, &quot;extension is mine&quot; - he rejoices in extension. What
      is the reason for this ? I say that it is not thoroughly understood by him&quot;.(19). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- (&quot;Idha, bhikkhave, assutavà puthujjano ariyà-nam

      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; And, monks, the Tathàgata also, Perfected one,
      Fully self - awakened one, intuitively knows extension as extension; from intuitively
      knowing extension as extension, he does not think of extension, he does not think (of
      self) in (regard to) extension, he does not think (of self) as extension, he does not
      think, &quot;extension is mine&quot; - he does not rejoice in extension. What is the
      reason for this ? It is because he, having known that delight is the root of anguish,
      knows that from becoming there is birth, and that there is old age and dying for the
      being. Consequently I say, monks, that the Tathàgata, by the waning of all cravings, by
      dispassion, by stopping, by abandoning, by completely renouncing, is wholly self -
      awakened to the incomparable Full self - awakening&quot;.(21) </font></p>

    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">9. A theory of personality: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The personality theory is the central point of education
    in general, of educational psychology in particular, on which the content of education,
    methods of teaching and counseling are based. The educational psychologists and theorists
    therefore always do their best to form it. The current personality theories by Freud, Carl
    Jung, Eric Fromn, Adler, Maslow, Lewin, Skinner, Allport, Carl Rogers, etc,. are useful
    and very well-known, but very limited; they cannot say the true nature of man and life,
    because they regard them as having a fixed nature while in fact they are impermanent and
    selfless. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhism, over fifteen centuries ago, and more than
    that, there were at least three personality theories formed, such as Abhidhamma of
    Theravada Buddhist Sect, Abhidharmakosa of Sarvastivàda Sect, and Vijnànavàda of
    Mahayanist Sect. All of them are mental analyses which divide a person&#146;s mind into
    healthy or good mental factors. (kusala cittas), unhealthy mental factors (akusala cittas)
    and neither healthy nor unhealthy mental factors. All of them also relate to the practice
    of meditation as a means to realize one&#146;s mind and to release sufferings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this work, the author only mentions the personality
    theory taught directly by Lord Gotama Buddha, and recorded in the Pancanikàya. Lord
    Buddha did introduce it in different forms: sixfold-sense-fields (salàyatana);
    sixsense-organs and six sense-objects; six sense-organs, six sense-objects and six
    consciousnesses; five aggregates (pancakkhandha); and Dependent Origination
    (Paticcasamuppàda). The writer believes only the doctrine of Dependent Origination and of
    the five aggregates can say what a person really is, and can show the way to come out of
    individuals&#146; problems and social crises. Let us now follow some of Lord Buddha&#146;s
    teachings regarding to the root purpose of education of the modern time: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">- &quot; How, brethren, the untaught many - folk have
      this view: &quot;This body is mine: I am this: this is myself !&quot; Of such an one the
      body alters and becomes otherwise. Owing to the altering and otherwiseness of body, sorrow
      and grief, woe, lamentation and despair arise in him. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- So also with regard to feeling, perception, activities
      and consciousness. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- And how, brethren, is there no grasping and no worry ? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Herein, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple has
      this view: &quot;This body is not mine: I am not this: this is not my self&quot;. Of such
      an one the body alters and becomes otherwiseness. But in spite of altering and
      otherwiseness of body, sorrow and grief, woe, lamentation and despair arise not in him. So

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the Enlightened One, as the above quotation shows, a
    human being is nothing but the five aggregates flowing on and on. His point of view of
    educating men is showing them the truth of suffering, its cause, its cessation and the way

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The term &quot;personality&quot; has a lot of meanings as
    used by western psychologists and personality theorists. It is used in the sense of
    &quot;social skill or adroitness&quot; in the terms of &quot;personality training&quot; or
    &quot;personality problem&quot;. It is also used in the sense of &quot;the most
    outstanding or salient impression&quot; a person creates in others, in terms of
    &quot;agressive personality&quot; &quot;submissive personality&quot; or &quot;a fearful
    personality&quot;. It may be used in the sense of &quot;social stimulus value&quot; of an
    individual, or in the sense of &quot;individual aspects of behaviour&quot; etc. In this
    thesis, personality only means what a man really is, or what a man consists of in a
    realistic and practical way of analysis by Lord Buddha Gotama. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the term &quot;concept&quot; or &quot;theory&quot;, it
    is commonly understood as what is opposite to a fact. It is just a speculation concerning
    reality that is not yet known to be so. In this topic, theory or concept has a quite
    different sense, because it is not created by pure speculation or by way of thinking of
    duality. It means the declaration of what a man really is by the One who himself realized
    the truth of man and life. Here, theory, or concept, is therefore very close to the fact,
    it appears as a shadow of reality. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pancanikàya is the term showing Suttapitaka belonging to
    the Tipitaka of Theravàda Buddhist Sect. It lies in the Pàli literature from the time of
    Lord Buddha to the time of the King Asoka. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Tipitaka, in Pàli, includes Vinayapitaka, Suttapitaka
    and Abhidhammapitaka. Vinayapitaka contains rules and regulations of the Buddhist Sangha
    such as rules for reception into the Order, for the periodical confession of sins, for
    activities in rainy seasons, for abiding, clothing, medical remedies, and for the Sangha
    activities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Abhidhammapitaka is a supplement to the Sutta. It
    includes the Dhammasangani, the Vibhanga, the Kathàvatthu, the Puggalapannatti, the
    Dhàtukathà, the Yamaka and the Patthàna. These works were formed by Lord Buddha&#146;s
    disciples at the time of the Third Council held during King Asoka&#146;s reign, in the
    third century B.C. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Suttapitaka is the direct teaching of Lord Gotama
    Buddha during forty five years of His life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It consists of five collections called Pancanikàya: (27) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Long Sayings (Dìghanikàya), Middle Length Sayings
    (Majjhimanikàya), Kindred Sayings (Samyuttanikàya), Gradual Sayings (Anguttaranikàya),
    and Minor Sayings (Khuddakanikàya). (28) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this work, the author only refers to the above
    Pancanikàya, and specially examines the doctrine of Dependent Origination
    (Paticcasam-uppàda) and of the Five Aggregates (Pancakkh-andha) as the basis on which the
    personality theory is formed. His purpose is to introduce a new regard to things seeing
    that: a man, not as a permanent entity, cannot separate from his society and environment;
    without society or environment, he cannot exist; in other words, environment or society
    appears as a part of his own body. This is different from the current personality theories
    claiming that a man is an entity independent from nature. From this new regard, a new
    course of education may be opened for solutions for the current social crises. For that
    purpose, this work will be done under the form of an applied and fundamental research. It
    will start with chapter 2 (I.2) on the doctrine of Dependent Origination as the truth of
    life. </font></p>

      (27) : There is a difference of opinion in the Theravàda tradition with regard to the
      range and number of treastises falling under theKhuddaka-Nikàya. One tradition holds that
      the Khuddaka-Nikàya consists of only 15 treatises. The range of the present work has been
      limited as per the second tradition excluding the Vinaya-pitaka and the Abhidhamma-pitaka.
