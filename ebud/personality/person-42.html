    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As discussed in (IV. 1.5), training a man for his regard
    of wisdom requires various spirits of education very human, practical and realistic,
    although such a theory of personality as usual is not available here. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">IV.2.1: INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION</font>
    </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With regard to individual differences in the spheres of
    physics, psychology, spirituality, social class and capacity, individualized education is
    needed in schools of modern time. Lord Buddha was the one who taught people on the basis
    of spirits of individualized education in response to various temperaments of men:
    Precepts (or Sìla) applied for lay people are different from those applied for monks and
    nuns. Speeches used to teach dhamma to worldly persons are different from those used to
    teach the learned. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Kindred Sayings, Vol. V, PTS, 1990, pp. 364-365, it is
    recorded that: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Monks, the Aryan Truth of &quot;This is
      Ill&quot; has been pointed out by me. Therein are numberless shades and variations of
      meaning. Numberless are the way of illustrating this Aryan Truth of &quot;This is
      Ill&quot;. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Aryan Truth of &quot;This is the arising of Ill&quot;
      has been pointed out by me... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Aryan Truth of &quot;This is the ceasing of Ill&quot;
      has been pointed out by me... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Aryan Truth of &quot;This is the Practice that leads
      to the ceasing of Ill&quot; has been pointed out by me...&quot;.</i> (1)</font></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When introducing &quot;passion&quot; to peasants or
    worldly men, Lord Buddha used simple words spoken by them in daily life. He said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">_&quot; As rain breaks through an ill-thatched house,<br>
      Passion will break through an unflecting mind&quot;. (3) (Dhp. 13) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">*(&quot;Yathà agàram ducchannam vutthi samativijjhati<br>
      Evam abhàvitam cittam ràgo samativijjhati).(4) (Dhp. 93) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">_&quot; As rain does not break through a well- thatched
      house, <br>
      Passion will not break through a well- reflectingmind.&quot; (5) (Dhp. 14) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">*(&quot;Yathà agàram succhannam vutthi na
      samativijjhati, <br>
      Evam subhàvitam cittam ràgo na samativijjhati&quot;.) (6) </font></p>
      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The picture of an ill-thatched and well-thatched house is
    very close to the peasants: it will be very easy for them to understand what Lord Buddha
    means. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the learned lay people or monks, Lord Buddha used the
    language spoken by them, such as: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The eye of a man, brethren, is the ocean. Its
      impulse is made of objects (or forms). Whoso endureth that object-made impulse, of him,
      brethren, it is said, &quot;he hath crossed over that ocean of the eye, with its waves and
      whirlpools, its sharks and demons, the brahmin hath crossed and gone beyond. He standeth
      on dry ground. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The tongue of a man, brethren, is the ocean... The ear...
      The nose... The mind... &quot;</i> (7) </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Cakkhu, bhikkhave, purisassa samuddo tassa
      ruùpamayo vego // yo tam ruùpamayam vegam sahati ayam vuccati, bhikkhave, atari

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Or such as: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; .. Brethren, the all is on fire. What all,
      brethren, is on fire? The eye, brethren, is on fire, objects areon fire, eye-consciousness
      is on fire, eye-contact... that also on fire. On fire with what? - On fire with the blaze
      of lust, the blaze of ill-will, of infatuation, birth, decay, death, sorrow, etc. So I
      declare?</i> (9) </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Sabbam, bhikkhave, àdittam, // Kinca, bhikkhave
      sabbam àdittam // Cakkhum, bhikkhave, àdittam // ruùpà àdittà // cakkhu vinnànam

      //... Mano àditto dhammà àdittà manovinnànam àdittam...//&quot;) </i>(10) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This language sounds very philosophical and thoughtful. It
    may keep a deep attention of the learned.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the above examples imply the same doctrine of wisdom,
    although they are spoken in different languages. This is the meaning of the expression
    that: &quot;Lord Buddha taught His wonderful Dhamma in different ways to different groups
    of listeners&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Khuddakanikàya, the stories about Therà and Therì
    were recorded that : Lord Buddha did teach them in different ways to destroy their
    fetters. This says themeaning of individualized education: each person has his own Kamma,
    and so he needs a separate way to deal with that Kamma. In other words, each individual
    thinks with his own mind and goes with his own legs. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Self-responsibility:</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A system of individualized education demands educational
    spirits of self-responsibility, self-confidence, self-support, self-control.
    self-acceptance, self-awareness, etc... Without them, it cannot work. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For self-responsibility, Lord Buddha did ask people not to
    depend on Him or on any external power. He taught: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Self is the lord of self, who else could be the
      lord? With self well subdued, a man finds a lord such as few can find&quot;</i> (11) (Dhp.
      160) </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Attà hi attano nàtho ko hi nàtho paro siyà,
      Attano'va sudantena nàtham labhati dullabham.&quot;)</i> (12) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When
      thy impurities are blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt enter into the
      heavenly world of the Ariyans&quot; </i>(13) (Dhp. 236) </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;So karohi dìpamattano khippam vàyama pandito
      bhava,Niddhantamalo anangano dibbam ariyabhuùmimehisi&quot;) </i>(14) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Or: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; All that we are is the result of what we have
      thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or
      acts with an evil thought, pain follows him as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that
      draws the carriage&quot;.</i> (15) (Dhp. 1.)</font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Manopubbangamà dhammà manosetthà manamayà,
      Manasà ce padutthena bhàsati và karoti và, Tato nam dukkhamanveti cakkam va vahato
      padam&quot;.)</i> (16) (Dhp. .1) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhammapada, Verse No 2, says similarly: if a man acts or
    speaks with a pure thought, happiness follows him like his shadow that never leaves him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the above teachings imply the emphasis on the spirit
    of self-responsibility. Without it, the law of Kamma does not work, and Buddhism has
    nothing to do with human beings. Without it, no system of social law could be implemented,
    and human society immediately falls into disturbances. Without it, no system of education
    can be formed either. Self-responsibility is therefore one of the root spirits of Buddhist
    education as well as non - Buddhist education. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It should be noted here that: Lord Buddha taught the truth
    of selflessness of every existing thing on the one hand, and asked a person to regard
    things as not &quot;he&quot;, not &quot;his&quot; and not &quot;his self&quot; so that he
    can abandon craving and grasping - the causes of his suffering, on the other hand. He
    taught the self-spirits of education so that the person himself can develop his capacities
    for his liberation and happiness. No contradiction exists therein. This is the only way
    for him to achieve his purpose of life: wisdom and happiness, and to achieve the truth of
    selflessness: the ultimate Noble Truth, because the other self-perception ways having been
    tested by human beings just cannot resolve their fateful suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That spirit of self-responsibility therefore helps a
    person get out of the phenomenon of alienation and really proves that the
    non-self-perception way of life is extremely close to individuals and human society.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Self-confidence:</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Besides self-responsibility, the practice of wisdom regard
    asks the practician to have self-confidence being sure that with his own effort he can
    realize truth and happiness in the here - and - now. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The meaning of taking refuge in oneself, as Lord Buddha
    taught above, is the meaning of self-confidence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fact Lord Buddha declared in the Assembly of Sangha
    the attainment of Arahantship of those who got it implies the encouragement of
    self-confidence and the awakening of self-confidence in those who had not attained the
    highest Sainthood. This will help them improve their self-control shaken by a lack of
    self-confidence. Lord Buddha said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; If a man's faith is unsteady, if he does not
      know the true law, if his peace of mind is troubled, his knowledge will never be
      perfect.&quot; </i>(17) </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Anavattathitacittassa, saddhammam avijànato,
      Pariplavapasàdassa pannà na paripurati.&quot; ) </i>(18) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Kàlàmas wavered among various points of view of
    non-Buddhist masters, they came to Lord Buddha for advice, Lord Buddha spoke: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Now look you, Kàlàmas. Be ye not misled by
      report or tradition or hearsay be not misled by proficiency in the collections, nor by
      mere logic or inference, nor after considering reasons, nor after reflection on and
      approval of some theory, nor because it fits becoming, nor out of respect for a recluse
      (who holds it). But, Kàlàmas, when you know for yourselves: these things are
      unprofitable, these things are blameworthy, these things are censured by the intelligent;
      these things, when performed and undertaken, conduce to loss and sorrow, then indeed do ye
      reject them, Kàlàmas.&quot; </i>(19) </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Alam hi vo, Kàlàmà, kankhitum alam
      vicikicchitum. Kankhàniye va pana vo thàne vicikicchà uppannà. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Etha tumhe, Kàlàmà, mà anussavena mà paramparàya mà
      iti kiràya mà pitakasampadànena mà ditthinijjhànakkhantiyà mà bhavyaruùpatàya mà

      dukkhàya samvattantì ti atha tumhe, Kàlàma, pajaheyyàtha.&quot;)</i> (20) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above teaching is but a guidance suggesting the
    Kàlàmas to turn back to their true experience of life and to be confident in themselves.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Indeed, in daily life, a person can continue surviving
    without confidence in others, but without self-confidence he cannot survive; otherwise, he
    exists as a body without soul. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a religious life, every task done for liberation, the
    release of suffering, requires the presence of right view, right thought and right effort
    which never lack of self-confidence. A stream Enterer (sotagami), the first fruit (phala)
    of Sainthood, is defined as the one who has unshaken confidence in Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha
    and sìla (precepts), so he must have confidence in himself and his effort. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fact that Lord Buddha enlightened in this life through
    His own effort has a meaning of establishing self-confidence for human beings: with his
    own effort, a human being can attain what Lord Buddha attained under the Bodhi-tree. And,
    even the Noble Truth of Dependent Origination Lord Buddha realized gives individuals a
    confidence that a man's suffering and ignorance are conditioned: they are unreal and may
    be changed if he has right thoughts and actions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above statements all imply the meaning of establishing
    self- confidence. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Self-awareness: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With self-responsibility and self-confidence, a person
    starts practising his regard of wisdom to extinguish his troubles. The regard asks him to
    be aware of existing things around him without attachment to them. So, from his observing
    and analysing things his awareness isreinforced: this is the existence of self-awareness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the course of his practice of the mentioned regard, he
    will see the impermanence, egolessness and suffering of the five aggregates. This seeing
    is meant his self-awareness which helps him detach from his desire for impermanent things
    and his troubles. When this practice is cultivated again and again; his
    &quot;self-awareness&quot; will be at a level called wisdom (pannà). In other words, in
    worldly men, self-awareness really is &quot;right view&quot; and &quot;right
    thought&quot;; in meditations, it is called medetative vision; and in Saints, it is called
    wisdom or perfect wisdom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the basis of awareness, the practician develops his
    &quot;self-control&quot; of Activities aggregate (meaning controlling his mind, his speech
    and his body) and his task of the blowing off his impurities as Lord Buddha said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; The wise who control their body, who control
      their tongue, the wise who control their mind, are indeed well controlled.&quot; (21)
      (Dhp. 234) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Kàyena samvutà dhìrà atho vacàya samvutà, <br>
      Manasà samvutà dhìrà te ve suparisamvutà&quot;) (22) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and
      their mind day and night always delights in compassion.&quot; (23) (Dhp. 300) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Suppabuddham pabujjhanti sadà Gotamasàvakà, <br>
      Yesam divà ca ratto ca ahimsàya rato mano.&quot;) (24) (Dhp. 300) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and
      their mind day and night always delights in meditation.&quot; </i>(25) (Dhp. 301) </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Suppabuddham pabujjhanti sadà Gotamasàvakà,<br>
      Yesam divà ca ratto ca bhàvanàya rato mano.&quot;) (26) </font></p>
      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Self-awareness is the soul of a person's regard of wisdom
    indeed: it is the start and also the destination of that regard. In other words,
    self-awareness is the first and last purpose of practising Dhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is this which is the object of the search for truth of
    man, but not any nature of personality. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Self-acceptance: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the case a person's awareness is not strong enough or
    is absent from his regard to things, especially his regard to the inside parts of his five
    aggregates, his wrong view and thought, as of his kamma, arise in his mind and lead him to
    wrong deeds and to troubles. This is the time when he becomes unsatisfied with himself:
    his body, his descent, knowledge or social position, etc. So, for preventing the arising
    of wrong thoughts and deeds in that case, the person should learn to accept what he is and
    what he has. This is the meaning of self-acceptance. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For his body, a person always wishes for a good looking
    form with beautiful face, complexion, etc. If his body appears not good looking as what he
    wants, he feels so painful. For his descent, if he was born in a family of low caste, he
    feels terribly disappointed. For his knowledge and social position, if he does not have
    high knowledge and high rank to be admired or respected, he may feel so sad... In addition
    to those things, hornours, praises, advantages,.., may cause him shaking. Therefore, Lord
    Buddha declared: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Monks, these eight worldly conditions obsess the
      world; the world revolves round these eight worldly conditions. What eights?- Gain and
      loss, fame and obscurity, blame and praise, contentment and pain. Monks, these eight
      worldly conditions obsess the world, the world revolves round these eight
      conditions...&quot; (27) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Atth'ime, bhikkhave, lokadhammà lokam
      anuparivattanti, loko ca attha lokadhamme anuparivattati Katame attha? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Làbho ca alàbho ca yaso ca ayaso ca nindà ca pasamsà

      ca ime attha lokadhamme anuparivattatì ti.&quot;</i>) (28) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above worldly conditions are impermanent. Even when a
    person gets &quot;gain, fame, praise and contentment&quot; his fear of change may cause
    his mind agitated and worried. So, to keep his mind in peace he must know how to accept
    what he is. Otherwise, the worldly conditions will happen to him as a strong wind blowing
    and striking at the root of his meditation tree and causing disaster in his mind.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Spirit of Practicalness </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A person's trouble may be caused by his wrong thought of

    <blockquote>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The discourse on &quot;Bhaddekaratta&quot; explained the
    meaning implied in the above teaching. With regard to this discourse, a person thinks of
    his material shape in the past, thinks of his feeling, his perception, his activities, his
    conciousness in the past, and delights therein: this is the meaning of following after the
    past that should not be done. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The person thinks of his future and a thought arises in
    his mind that: &quot;may my body, my feeling, my perception, my activities, my
    consciousness be thus in the future&quot; and he delights therein: this is the meaning of
    desiring future that should not be done. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As to the present things, he should regard his body, his
    feeling, his perception, his activities, his consciousness as not his self, or self not
    having them, or they are not in the self, or the self not in them: this is the meaning of
    having vision of persent things he should practise day after day. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, the above teaching really shows individuals the
    practical way to live in peace of mind: if a person practises it one day, he will be a
    sage at peace in one day; if he practises it day after day, he may become a true sage, who
    completely destroys the cause of all troubles and sufferings, and abides in happiness for
    good. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the case of a worldly man who just can practise it
    partly, he may reduce his immediate troubles to the least, and save a lot of energy for
    use for his jobs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the author's opinion, following after the past or
    desiring the future is living with the image of reality, but not living in reality; this
    is an unrealistic and unpractical way of life. Living in the very present moment is living
    a true life which can help a man see things as they really are: this is a realistic and
    practical way to live: this also is the meaning of the spirit of practicalness taught by
    Lord Buddha. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Spirit of middle way: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another spirit of education taught by Lord Buddha to help
    individuals avoid two extremes of life for vision, knowledge and calm is the spirit of
    middle way. In His first discourse of Noble Truths He said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Monks, these two extremes should not be followed
      by one who has gone forth as a wanderer. What two</i>?</font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">Devotion to the pleasures of sense, a low practice of
      villagers, a practice unworthy, unprofitable, the way of the world (on the one hand), and
      (on the other) devotion to self - mortification, which is painful, unworthy and
      unprofitable. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">By avoiding these two extremes the Tathàgata has gained
      knowledge of that middle path which giveth vision, which giveth knowledge, which causeth
      calm, special knowledge, enlightenment, Nibbàna. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what, monks, is that middle path which giveth

      right thought, right speech, right action, right living, right effort, right mindfulness,
      right concentration. This, monks, is that middle path which giveth vision, which giveth

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above teaching is excellent advice by Lord Buddha for
    individuals practising Dhamma. It always requires wisdom (or right view and right thought)
    to follow a person's mind to know where it is to choose which path is appropriate for the
    immediate practice - knowing where one's mind also means self - understanding. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Spirit of analysis: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The middle way of practice is also lighted up by other
    interesting spirits such as analysis, criticism and creativeness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It must be said that Lord Buddha's method of teaching
    Dhamma is analysis based on reality. This method is far different from those which are
    based on pure reasons of soul - theories. The Four Noble Truths preached for the first
    time at Deer Park, Benares, started from reality: &quot;life is suffering&quot;, then
    analysed in fouraspects: suffering which is birth, old-age, sickness, death, separating
    from what one likes, being with what one dislikes not getting what one wants, in short,
    five aggregates are suffering; the cause of suffering which is craving or the arising of
    Dependent Origination; the cessation of suffering which is Nibbaàna; and the way to the
    cessation of suffering which is the Eightfold Noble Path. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The doctrine of Dependent Origination, the truth of this
    world, and the five aggregates making up what is called a man were analysed thoroughly by
    Lord Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Analysing the understanding an existing thing, Lord Buddha
    showed that: a man should know its existence, the cause of its existence, its ceasing, and
    the way to its ceasing (in many discourses). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the dhammas which can only be seen directly by perfect
    wisdom, Lord Buddha advised individuals not to think of them, such as: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Monks, there are these four unthinkables, not to
      be thought of, thinking of which one would be distraught and come to grief. What are the

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Gradual Sayings (Vol I, PTS, 1989, pp. 178-179), Lord

    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- If a person is asked a question, and he can give a

      requiring it, a counter - reply to the question requiring it, or he does not waive a
      question which should be waived, such a person is really competent to discuss. And
      inversely. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- If a person is asked a question, and he does not abide
      by conclusions, whether right or wrong, he does not abide by an assumption, does not abide
      by recognized arguments, does not abide by usual procedure, such a person really is
      incompetent to discuss. And inversely. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- If a person is asked a question, then he evades the
      question by another, or he turns it off the point, or he displays his vexation, malice or
      sulkiness, such a person is actually incompetent to discuss. And inversely. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- If a person is asked a question, then instead of giving
      reply he loads with abuse and beats down the questioner, laughs him to scorn and catches
      him up when he falters, such a person is actually incompetent to discuss.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- If he does not do anything of the above, he really is
      competent to discuss. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above are typical cases of analysis among so many
    cases taught by Lord Buddha. All of them will bring men insight into things, but not
    knowledge coming from the experience of sense organs. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Spirit of criticism: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Together with the method of analysis, Lord Buddha taught a
    spirit of criticism. This spirit estimates the object analysed whether it is right or
    wrong, wholesome or unwholesome, acceptable or unacceptable, suitable to Dhamma or not;
    etc. after process of analysis. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the teaching for the Kàlamas mentioned before, it runs
    that, &quot;... Be ye not misled by report...&quot; the Tathàgata asked His disciples to
    criticize things on the basis of their observation, analysis and wisdom. He asked them, in
    &quot;the discourse on Inquiring&quot; (vìmamsakasuttam) (Middle Length Saying, Vol, No
    47) to observe and check Him whether He is a Fully self - awakened One or not. He said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Monks, an inquiring monk, learning the range of
      another's mind, should make a study of the Tathàgata so as to distinguish whether He is

      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">Monks, should study the Tathàgata in regard to two

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above quotation proves Lord Buddha, on His way of
    educating men, concerned much about the spirit of criticism. This spirit will help His
    disciples improve their &quot;self - awareness&quot;, &quot;self - understanding&quot;,
    &quot;self- confidence&quot;, their capacity of analysis, and their vision. This sounds
    very wise and human. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Spirit of creativeness: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Being with the wisdom regard, self - awareness, spirit of
    criticism,.., creativeness is another distinguished spirit of Buddhist education. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The wisdom regard to things existing in &quot;self -
    awareness&quot; always sees things as they really are in the very present moment. These
    things are flowing on and on without any pause: this means they always are new at each
    moment: the subject of the regard is new, and its object is also new. This is the
    condition of the seeing of creativeness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Charles E. Skinner in his book titled &quot;Educational
    Psychology'' wrote: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Creative thinking means that the predictions
      and/or inferences for the individual are new, original, ingenious, unusual. The creative
      thinker is one who explores new areas and makes new observations, new predictions, new
      inferences&quot;)</i> (41). </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With regard to this definition of creative thinking, or
    creative thinker, the Buddhist way of life led by the wisdom regard ; or by right view and
    right thought; really is a way of life of creativeness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It may be said without doubt that the individual's
    characteristics of self-confidence, self-awareness, self-support, self-responsibility,
    criticism, analysis, actually are those of a creative thinker. When a person's task of
    cultivating his regard to things is done, the five hindrances (panca niìvaranàni) and
    the ten fetters (dasa kilesà) hindering his mind from the truth of things are gradually
    destroyed, and his mind becomes free: this free mental state really is a state of
    creativeness. When his mind abides in the third and fourth meditation, his regard can see
    in the depth of the existence of things and discover new areas of them: this is a regard
    of creativeness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such is the spirit of creativeness of the way of life
    taught by Lord Buddha. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Spirit of meditation: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The wisdom regard mentioned will be reinforced and the
    source of creativeness of mind will be awakened by the practice of meditation which is the
    main task of the Buddhist Way (Magga) to liberation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation is understood as calming individual's desire
    and immediate troubles. It transforms the five hindrances (restlessness, torpor and sloth,
    sensuous desire, ill-will, sceptical doubt) into the five meditative mental factors
    (thought-conception, discursive thinking, rapture; joy, equanimity- happiness-one
    pointedness in the &quot;first meditation; rapture; joy, equanimity-happiness-
    onepointedness in the &quot;second meditation&quot;; joy,
    equanimity-happiness-onepointedness in the &quot;third meditation&quot;; equanimity -
    happiness - one pointednessin the &quot;fourth meditation&quot;). And all evil thoughts
    arising from the five hindrances also are calmed or destroyed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the &quot;fourth meditation&quot;, the wisdom regard or
    vipassana is developed fast and comfortably. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, meditation responds to the following purposes of life:
    </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Calming immediate troubles of a person practising it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Opening a source of creativeness which is a very
      important factor contributing to the construction of human culture and civilization. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Developing the wisdom regard for ceasing the cause of
      suffering. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Seeing the truth of the existence of men and things. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is why Lord Buddha taught His disciples that: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; The Bhikkhu whose body and tongue and mind are
      quieted, who is collected, and has rejected the baits of the world, he is called
      quiet.&quot;</i> (42) (Dhp. 378)</font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Santakàyo santavàco santavà susamàhito,<br>

      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; The bhikkhu, full of delight, who is happy in
      the doctrine of Buddha will reach the quiet place (Nibbàna), happiness consisting the
      cessation of natural inclinations.)</i> (44) (Dhp. 381) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(<i>&quot;Pàmojjabahulo bhikkhuâ pasanno buddha-
      sàsane, Adhigacche padam santam sankhàruùpa samam sukham. &quot;</i> (45) (Dhp. 381) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, during the period of time of practising meditation for
    wisdom regard, an individual lives in the fresh air of mind with happy feelings and gets
    rid of all troubles, worries withering the flowers of young generations </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to the above things, the practice of following
    breathing in - and breathing out may help worldly men improve their capacity of memory and
    observation which is very interesting to students in schools; the practice of following
    and observing their mind will help them see their mental problems as the result of a task
    of self - therapy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short, the way of Buddhist meditation, including Calm
    (samatha) and Insight (vipassanà) is the way of seeing, developing and cultivating one's
    mind. Without it, a person cannot understand what he really is, and cannot resolve his
    psychological problems for peace and happiness in the here - and - now, as Lord Buddha
    affirmed: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; There is, monks, this only way to the
      purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and distress, for the disappearance
      of pain and sadness, for the gaining of the right path, for the realization of Nibbàna:
      that is to say the four foundations of mindfulness.&quot; </i>(46) </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Ekàyàno ayam, bhikkhave, maggo sattànam

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But being with the practice of it - meaning the practice
    of Four Foundations of Mindfulness, cattàro satipatthàna - is the real meaning of a
    significant life to live: it is the way of return to oneself for taking refuge in oneself
    but not in any other man or superpower; it is the way to be an island for oneself. During
    His last days before parinibbàna, Lord Buddha solicitously taught Ànanda, his closest
    disciple, that: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Therefore, Ànanda, you should live as islands
      unto yourselves, being your own refuge, with no one else as your refuge, with the D</i><em>hamma
      as an island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge? Here, Ànanda, a monk
      abides contemplating the body as body, earnestly, clearly aware, mindful and having put
      away all hankering and fretting for the world, and likewise with regard to feelings, mind
      and mind - objects. That, Ànanda, is how a monk lives as an island unto himself,.. with
      no other refuge. And those who now in my time or afterwards live thus, they will become
      the hightest, if they are desirous of learning.&quot; (48) </em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>(&quot;Idh' Ànanda, bhikkhu kàye kàyànupassì

    into practice, many different results will come to different practicians because of their
    different temperaments, capacities, volitions, efforts, determinations, etc., called their

    activities.</font></p>

    <blockquote>

    doctrine of Kamma this life is nothing but the result of kamma having been done in
    previous lives: it is predetermined or predestinate. But, in reality, it does not appear
    as simple as such. There are two kinds of kamma which are called old kamma and new kamma
    as the following teaching mentions: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; And what, brethren, is action that is old? - The
      eye, brethren, is to be viewed as action that is old, brought about and itentionally done,

      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The action one performs now, brethren, by body, speech and
      mind, that is called &quot;action that is new&quot; And what, brethren, is the ceasing of

      that is called &quot;the ceasing of action&quot;. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what, brethren, is the way leading to the ceasing of

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the definition of old and new kamma quoted above, old
    kamma is what has made up this body of the five aggregates with its relation to the
    surroundings, such as: family, social class, country, etc., being born as a male, or
    female with good looking or bad looking body, with nice complexion or not, with graceful
    or ungraceful face, with a high I.Q. quotient or a low I.Q. quotient, receiving good
    education or not, etc. These things are out of a person's mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The new Kamma is defined as what a man has done, is doing
    and will do in this life through his body, speech and mind. The intention, effort, desire,
    will to live, determination, etc., of a person are mental agents of his new Kamma. These
    things can cause him suffering or happy according to his regard to things. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, all causes of the circle of birth - and - death
    created in the past or in the present are what a man is facing in the here - and - now:
    they all exist only in the sphere of the five aggregates. This is the reason why Lord
    Buddha's disciples can attain Arahatship by destroying all defilements arising from
    aggregates only. And this is the meaning of considering the five aggregates as an immense
    ocean of suffering to be acrossed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The gravest result the old kamma has left for a human
    being in this life is his habit of thirsting for things, and of thinking of things as
    having a permanent self (or soul) which has created the current human culture full of
    troubles. If a person brings up his self - thought and desire, he will strengthen his old
    Kamma and go further in suffering. If he stops them, he will come to cease his old and new
    Kamma for freedom and happiness. In fact, he appears completely free in the very present
    moment to make any choice he wants between what he should do and what he should not. It is
    the present moment which is when he copes with his desire arising from his thought caused
    by the attraction of things. This desire invades his mind. He should know the way to fight
    against it as it is taught by the following teaching: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; ... Anyone, monks, knowing and seeing eye as it
      really is (ear, nose, tongue, body, mind)... while he, observing the peril, is not
      attached, bound or infactuated, the five groups of grasping go on to future diminution...
      He experiences happiness of body and happiness of mind.</i>&quot; (54) </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Cakkhunca kho, bhikkhave, jànam passam
      yathàbhuøtam, ruùpe jànam passam yathàbhuøtam, cakkhuvinnànam jànam passam

      pi patisam vedeti.&quot;)</i> (55) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, the author recognizes that Lord Buddha's teaching on
    the doctrine of Kamma really emphasizes an individual's new Kamma, or mental, oral, bodily
    actions, leading to ceasing Kamma itself. His teaching is centered on seeing the truth of
    dependent origination of the five aggregates and detaching from them for true happiness,
    but not on the search for personality as an entity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In daily life, people tend to assimilate themselves with
    conditioned aggregates, therefore they fall into suffering caused by change. If they see
    their wrong view they will come to the cultivation of the aggregates for the release of
    their suffering </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">IV.2.3. CULTIVATION OF THE FIVE
    AGGREGATES AND EDUCATION</font> </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As discussed before, Kamma is volitional action.
    Volitional action is activities aggregate. The operation of activities aggregate is that
    of the five aggregates. So Kamma actually is the operation of those aggregates. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist Way (magga) releasing the bondage of Kamma
    means releasing the bondage of the five aggregates. This suggests that the cultivation of
    aggregates is the task for liberation which has two things to do: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Controlling a person's habits of things as having a
      permanent self from which desire for things arises. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Developping his regard to things as non - self from
      which desireless thought arises. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This task is therefore for the cessation of his troubles
    and sufferings which is the cherished dream of a man, and is the root purpose the branch
    of modern educational psychology aims at. All teachings of Lord Buddha recorded in Pàli
    Suttapitaka are centered on this great point. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, Sàriputta Mahàthera, the Chief disciple of Lord
    Buddha Gotama, explained: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what, your reverences, is right view?
      Whatever, your reverences, is knowledge of anguish, knowledge of the arising of anguish,
      knowledge of the stopping of anguish, knowledge of the course leading to the stopping of
      anguish: this, your reverences, is called right view.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what reverences, is called right aspiration (or right
      thought)? Aspiration for renunciation, a spiration for non - malevolence, aspiration for
      harmlessness: this, your reverences, is called right aspiration.&quot; (56) </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The meaning of &quot;right aspiration&quot;, or thought
    forrenunciation, thought for non-malevolence, and thought for harmlessness, is the motive
    force in a person's deeds leading to peace of mind. This will open an operation of the
    five aggregates to mental peace. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sàriputta Mahàthero continues explaining: </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above actions called good deeds will help a person
    control a lot of troubles arising from his mind. Inversely, if a person does evil deeds he
    will receive bad results in this life and in the next existence which are suffering. On
    the basis of doing good deeds he practises meditation and easily attains concentration by
    his right effort: </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right endeavour, according to the above teaching, is a
    mental force to stop the cause of mental troubles, and to make arisen skilled thoughts.
    Without it, the task of meditation is difficult to be done, and the Way (Magga) is hard to
    be performed. Concentration is therefore necessary to be supported by &quot;right
    effort&quot; and the later is listed in the group of samàdhi: right effort, right
    mindfulness and right concentration. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With right effort, the practician comes to practise right
    mindfulness, or the Foundations of mindfulness dissussed in (IV.2.1: Spirit of
    meditation), for bare attention, keen observation, calm and awareness. In concentrations,
    he can wipe out his evil thoughts. In the fourth meditation, sensual desires are ejected,
    and Insight (vipassana) is developed: he can know and see things as they really are, abide
    in a free state of mind and a feeling of happiness. Here, if Insight is well-developed,
    his regard of wisdom to aggregates may completely destroy his defilements for perfected
    Wisdom or Enlightenment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short, the above factors of the task of cultivation
    relate closely to each other, in which &quot;right view&quot; is the most important factor
    being considered as the starting point and destination of the practising the Way. With
    ragard to their relationship, Lord Buddha taught: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; As to this, monks, right view comes first. And

      right mindfulness; right knowledge proceeds from right concentration; right freedom

    Wisdom or Pannà (right view and right thought) which are three basic steps of cultivation
    of one's mind. These steps are so important that Lord Buddha repeated them several times

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In principle, all teachings of Lord Buddha recorded in
    Pancanikaàya are aimed at releasing human beings' troubles in this life. They have a
    function of helping an individual see the way to make arise the skilful thought, to
    release the opposite evil thought controlling his mind: for example, the five meditative
    mental factors releasing the five hindrances; compassion or mettà (or adosa) releasing
    ill - will (dosa); detachment or greedilessness (alobha) releasing greediness (lobha);
    wisdom or non- illusion (amoha) releasing illusion (moha); perception of selflessness,
    impermanence and suffering releasing conceit &quot;I am&quot; etc.. This task called the
    cultivation of the five aggregates or mind - development is done by the individual himself
    and by his effort itself in the present. The individual really is mentally free performing
    the task in the here - and - now. He just starts from his present conditions of life which
    depend on his body, health, knowledge, emotion, social position, etc., especially from his
    thirst for things: On the one hand, he continues going on his present way of life, on the
    other hand, should be aware of the dangers of his desire for things caused by
    impermanence, and should observe and analyse with his wisdom what is going on with his
    thoughts and feelings. In doing this, his thought of detachment from things observed will
    arise in his mind and bring him liberation of mind and of wisdom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For a laywoman or a layman who has duties to do in daily
    life for herself // himself, for her // his family, company or religion, and country, Lord
    Buddha practically introduced many steps of the way of cultivation. The first and basic
    step for her // him is, according to the discourse on Sigàlaka (Dìghanikàya, Sutta No
    31), to abandon four wrong deeds: not taking life, not taking what is not given, not doing
    sexual misconduct, and not lying speech; not doing what is caused by attachment, ill -
    will, folly or fear; not to waste his substance either by the six ways which are strong
    drink, haunting the streets at unfitting times, attending affairs, gambling, keeping bad
    company, and habitual idleness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to the above things, a laity should live in
    the six good relationships of his family and society: between parents and children,
    between husband and wife, between teacher and student, among relatives and neighbours,
    between monk and laity, and between employer and employee. These relationships are based
    on human love, loyalty, sincerity, gratitude, mutualacceptance, mutual understanding and
    mutual respect which relate closely to individuals' happiness in the present. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the basis of the task suggested above, a laity can
    improve his mind -develpoment by practising the Four Foundations of Mindfulness or
    practising just mindfulness of body together with compassion as showed in the discourse of
    Compassion or Loving - Kindness (Mettàsutta) in Suttanipàta of the Khuddakanikàya,
    generally as follows: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Practising mindfulness of compassion when he is lying,

    thought of loving - kindness in his mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Wishing all beings not wishing each other ill or harm. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Concerning about other's pain and protecting them from
    suffering as a mother's doing for her only child. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the tasks mentioned above are very helpful for the
    development of the wholeness of man, and may have good contributions to the formation of a
    new course of human culture and education. On the side of a practician, he is strongly
    influenced by the qualities of the culture and education of the society he is living in.
    This is to be discussed more. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Education for the cultivation of the five aggregates:</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What a child is after his mother gave a birth to him is
    the result of his old kamma, according to the teaching of Lord Buddha on &quot;new and old
    Kamma&quot; discussed before. What of education he has received from his family and
    society will put strong influences on his way of thought, attitude of life, desire,
    aspiration and deeds which are of what is called new Kamma. It may be said that what a
    person does or will do by mind, speech or body is what culture and education of his
    society suggest him to. In this life, he appears as an &quot;educational being&quot;
    rather than &quot;a reasonable animal&quot; defined in the old days. On the other side, it
    is self - thought of individuals which has shaped the course of education and culture of a
    society. This interrelationship says something different to the development of the five
    aggregates leading to happiness which requires a non - self way of thought and desire. To
    help individuals cultivate their mind on this way of life, all means of communication in
    the present society - such as books, magazines, newspapers, radio - broadcast, movies,
    etc.; - Which strengthen self - thought and sensual and sexual desire need to be adjusted
    or reduced to a considerable level; all means of communication awakening non - self
    thought and desire need to be maintained and developed. This requires education to do the
    same thing: there is no need to build up any theory of personality as a self, but new
    critical studies are needed, which are: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Critical studies on physical body and health for a
    knowledge of troubles arising from it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Critical studies on sensuality and sexuality for
    aknowledge of dealing with them for a physiopsychological balance and peace of mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Critical studies on perception, thought, knowledge for a
    realization the true value of all values in life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Critical studies on behaviours, psychology, psychiatry
    getting along the way of development of the five aggregates. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Critical studies on sociology, ecology, anthropology,
    sciences, literature and education for a knowledge of conditions of life for happiness of
    man. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All those studies aim at the same purpose that is building
    up a good society for man to live in happiness, and therefore building up a new culture. </font></p>
