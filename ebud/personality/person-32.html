    &quot;the operation of the twelve elements of Dependent Origination&quot; are the five
    aggregates of man (Pancakkhandhà), therefore the operation of the twelve elements really
    is the operation of Pancakkhandhà, and realizing that operation means realizing what a
    man really is. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the Deer Park (Migadàya), Isipatana at Bàrànasì,
    right after the first day of teaching the Four Noble Truths (Cattàri Ariyasaccàni), from
    the second day to the fifth, Lord Buddha explained the doctrine of Pancakkhandhà to
    Mahàthera Kondanna and his four Dhamma friends. It runs that: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;At Benares, in the Deer Park was the occasion
      (for this discourse)At that time the Exalted One thus addressed the band of five
      brethren:&quot;Body, brethren, is not the self..., feeling is not the self... likewise
      perception, the activities and consciousness are not the self...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, by this teaching thus uttered the hearts of
      those five brethren were freed from the àsavas without grasping&quot;. (1) </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pancakkhandhà is the second discourse which helped the
    first five disciples of Lord Buddha destroy completely their defilements to attain the
    Arahanthood to see the truth of life and true happiness. Let&#146;s now examine Lord
    Buddha&#146;s teachings on it. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above quotation says that: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Aggregate of body (or form) is understood as a
    person&#146;s physical body, bodies of others and the material world. Aggregate of feeling
    includes feeling of suffering, of happiness and of indifference. It is known as feelings
    arising from eye - contact, ear - contact, nose - contact, tongue - contact, body -
    contact and mind - contact.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Aggregate of perception includes perception of body,
    perception of sound, perception of odour, perception of taste, perception of touch (or
    tangibles), and perception of mental objects (or phenomena). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Aggregate of activities (or volition) is all mental, oral
    and bodily activities. it also is understood as volitionalacts occasioned by body, by
    sound, by odour, by taste, by touching or by ideas. Aggregate of consciousness includes
    eye - consciousness, ear - consciousness, nose - consciousness, tongue - consciousness,
    body - consciousness and mind - consciousness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such is a person ! He is conditioned by this physical and
    mental world. He relates closely to others, to society, and to nature, but can never exist
    by himself. Therefore, he must be selfless, impermanent. Because of selflessness and
    impermanence, a person who always grasp selfness and permanence feels suffering in life,
    as Lord Buddha declared: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Body, brethren, is impermanent. What is
      impermanent that is suffering. What is suffering, that is void of self. What is void of
      self, that is not mine, I am not it, it is not myself. That is how it is to be regarded by
      perfect insight of what it really is. </font></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The truth of a man is selfless: it is not his self, it is
    not his, and he is not it, while the contemporary personality theorists and educators tend
    to search for a self and consider that: it is his self, it is his and he is it, how can
    they come to solutions for individuals&#146; problems?(!) Here is the very crucial point
    from which the personality theorists and educators know what and how to educate
    individuals for a good society and environment they are living in, and for their
    happiness. Evidently, it is not easy to convince people to accept this truth of life, but
    the point is people should not keep themselves away from it. This demands education to
    find the way to do to help people see it as the following teaching shows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Just as if, brethren, this river Ganges should
      carry down a huge lump of foam, and a keen - sighted man should see it, observe it and
      look close into its nature. So seeing it, observing it and looking close into its nature,
      he would find it empty, he would find it unsubstantial, he would find it without essence.
      What essence, brethren, could there be in a lump of foam? Suppose, brethren, in autumn
      time, when the sky-god rains down big drops, a bubble rises on the water and straight way
      bursts, and a keen - sighted man should see it, observe it. look close into its nature. So
      seeing it, observing it, and looking close into its nature, he would find it empty, he
      would find it unsubstantial, he would find it without essence. What essence, brethren,
      could there be in a bubble on the water? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even so, brethren, whatsoever feeling, be it past, future
      or present, be it far or near, a brother sees... he finds it without essence. What
      essence, brethren, could there be in feeling? ...&quot;</i> (9) </font></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is similar for a mirage seen in the dry season at high
    noontide compared with consciousness and other aggregates. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If a man sees that truth, he comes to feel disgust at
    aggregates; feeling disgust he is repelled; by repulsion he is set free and comes to the
    Insight that: he is free.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, following that regard to things, let us take a look
    deep into men&#146;s physical bodies, observe and analyse them, what can we realize? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That physical body comes from a foetus made up by the
    spermatozoon and semen. Thesespermatozoon and semen were created by the essence of food
    coming from many conditions in nature which includes the existence of the Sun about 150
    million kilometers away from here.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That baby (child) has been brought up also by food, etc.
    It exists out of the intention of a person, and changes all the time... </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">How can that body regarded as his own self? Similarly,
    analysing the aggregate of feeling will help a person see : </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Feeling aggregate is nothing but a mass of feelings
    coming from touching which is but the contact of the inward part and the outward part of
    the body aggregate. If body aggregate is seen as not the &quot;I&quot;, the
    &quot;mine&quot; or the &quot;my self&quot; and as emptiness, so is feeling aggregate. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For perception aggregate, it is the perceptions of body,
    of sound, of smell, of taste, of touch and of phenomena. These things belonging to body
    aggregate are empty, as mentioned above, so those perceptions are also empty: they must
    not be considered as the &quot;I&quot;, the &quot;mine&quot; or the &quot;my self&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For Activities aggregate, they are known as the thought of
    body, of sound, of smell, of taste, of touch, and of mental objects, but body, sound, ...,
    are empty and considered as not the &quot;I&quot;, the &quot;mine&quot; the &quot;my
    self&quot; so Activities aggregate must be regarded similarly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For consciousness aggregate, it is the cognition arising
    from eye - contact, ear - contact, nose - contact, tongue - contact, body contact and mind
    - contact. Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind are empty and not the &quot;I&quot;, the
    &quot;mine&quot; or the &quot;my self&quot;; so is consciousness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is called a man is a compound of the five aggregates
    which are empty, he must be selfless and not the &quot;I&quot;, the &quot;mine&quot; or
    the &quot;my self&quot;. This sounds rather strange but true. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such a regard to the five aggregates is that of wisdom
    (pannà or vijja) which can help a person to come out of all troubles. It suggests a
    person to train himself for a regard of wisdom to things, but not for the search for a
    self or personality. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, an individual may ask: if &quot;no-self&quot; is the
    true self of a human being, then who acts? Who receives the result of his actions? - These
    questions implying the meaning of a &quot;self&quot; must belong to self - thought which
    is ignorance (avijja) and is of conception but not of reality. In fact, human beings are
    there, their actions are there, and the results of their actions they receive are there.
    No question on &quot;who&quot; or &quot;why&quot; exists in reality: it is what to live
    with, but not to talk about or to think of. There are only two things to be concerned in
    the fateful existence of a human being: his obsessing suffering and his requirement to
    find out the way to the cessation of that suffering. His main problem is how to have a
    right view on these two things as Lord buddha taught His disciple, Kaccànagotta, that: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; From the very lips of the Exalted one, friend
      Channa, from his very lips as he taught brotherKaccànagotta, I heard this: &quot;On two
      things, Kaccàna, does this world generally base its view - on existence and on non -
      existence. Now he who with right insight sees the arising of the world as it really is,
      does not believe in the non - existence of the world. But, Kaccàna, he who with right
      insight sees the ceasing of the world as it really is, does not believe in the existence
      of the world. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Grasping after systems, imprisoned by dogmas in this
      world, Kaccàna, for the most part. And he who does not go after, does not grasp at, does
      not take his stand on this system - grasping, this dogma, this mental bias, - such an one
      does not say it is my soul. He who thinks, that which arises is but ill: that which
      ceases, it is ill such an one has no doubts; no perplexity. In this matter, knowledge not
      borrowed from others comes to him. Thus far, Kaccàna, goes right view.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;All exists&quot;, Kaccàna, - that is one extreme</i>.
      </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Nought exists&quot; Kaccàna, - that is the other
      extreme. Not approaching either extreme, Kaccàna, the Tathàgata teaches you a doctrine
      by the middle way: &quot;Conditioned by ignorance come the activities, conditioned by
      activities comes consciousness, and so forth. Thus is the arising of this whole mass of
      ill. By the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance comes the ceasing of the
      activities, and so forth. Thus is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill&quot;. </i>(11) </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Sammukhà me tam, àvuso Channa, Bhagavato sutam

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the above mentioned root problem of human beings was
    taught and emphasized by Lord Buddha. It was emphasized several times by Him as the
    central point of His teaching as recorded here and there in the Pancanikàya. He said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Both formely and now also, it is just sorrow and
      the ceasing of sorrow that I proclaim&quot; (13) </font></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha, in addition to the above teaching, also
    emphasized what should be understood by an individual, and what is the understanding of it
    so clearly that: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Brethren, I will show you things that are to be
      understood, likewise understanding. Do ye listen to it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what, brethren, are the things to be understood, Body,
      brethren, is a thing to be understood: feeling is a thing to be understood: perception,
      the activities and consciousness also. These, brethren, are the things that are to be
      understood. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what, brethren, is understanding? The destruction of
      lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of illusion: that; brethren, is called
      &quot;understanding&quot;. </i>(15) </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot; Parinànàeyye ca, bhikkhave, dhamme desisàmi

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short, Lord Buddha&#146;s teachings recorded in
    Pancanikàya are basically concentrated on introducing the five aggregates and the way of
    dealing with men&#146;s desires for them which means introducing the arising of the five
    aggregates and the ceasing of them. This is a very practical and existential way of
    education that suggests to men the purpose of education - which is happiness or the
    cessation of suffering -, and the content of education - which is the understanding of the
    five aggregates and the way of extinguishing sufferings arising from them - That way also
    suggests that the course of modern education, in the name of human beings and their
    happiness in this very life, should be based on that purpose and content of education. The
    search for truth of man and universe now should turn to be the realization of the five
    aggregates, the operation of which will be mentioned next.</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">III.2.2: THE OPERATION OF PANCAKKHANDHA</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As mentioned in (III.2.1.) the operation of the five
    aggregates is that of Name-and-Form (nàma - rupa) of Dependent Origination and so is the
    operation of Dependent Origination itself. And, the five aggregates co - exist; they
    cannot separate from each other. This is an important thing to be noticed before
    mentioning the operation of each aggregate. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The operation of Consciousness (Vinnana)</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consciousness is the cause of Name-and-Form element in
    Dependent Origination, and so it is understood as the cause of the five aggregates on the
    one hand, and on the other hand it is conditioned by the other eleven elements of

      <p><font face="Times New Roman">So also, brethren, if lust for the consciousness element
      be abandoned by a brother, by that abandonment of lust, its foothold is cut off. Thereby
      there is no platform for consciousness. Without that platform, consciousness has no
      growth, it generates no action and is freed: by freedom it is steady: by its steadiness it
      is happy: owing to happiness it is not troubled. Being untroubled, of itself it becomes

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lust for body, feeling, perception, the activities and
    consciousness is a mental activity which belongs to the Activities element (sankhàra) of
    Dependent Origination or Activities aggregates of the Five aggregates. Owing to this lust,
    consciousness arises, develops and matures. This lust for the Five aggregates exists
    because of the existence of the satisfaction of the Five aggregates. This satisfaction
    exists owing to the fact that one attaches to the selfness of things which is called
    Ignorance (avijjà).If the attachment to things (or Ignorance) ceases to exist, the
    satisfaction of things cannot exist and one&#146;s lust for the satisfaction of things
    also ceases to exist.If one&#146;s lust for things ceases to exist, the cause of
    sufferings - which aregrasping, becoming, birth, old-age - cannot appear; then one comes
    to extinguish all troubles and attain happiness of one&#146;s free mind. This also means
    the cessation of consciousness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another aspect of the operation of Consciousness may be
    regarded as the cause, the origin and the condition of Name-and-Form as mentioned in
    (II.1.2.) - &quot;the meaning and operation of the twelve causes - but it is not an
    entity: it includes six groups: eye - consciousness exists when there exists the contact
    between eyes and forms, ear - consciousness exists when there exists the contact between
    ears and sounds, ..., and mind -consciousness exists when there exists the contact between
    mind and mental objects. If the contact does not exist, consciousness cannot be present
    and cannot operate. So, consciousness is but the existence of a group of conditions which
    must not be regarded as the &quot;I&quot;, the &quot;mine&quot; or the &quot;myself&quot; </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The operation of Activities aggregate (sankhara) </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Activities aggregate is the very Activities element of
    Dependent Origination. It is a compound of mental activities, oral activities and bodily
    activities. It is also regarded as one&#146;s will to live and defined by Lord Buddha as
    follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what, brethren, are the Activities? These six
      seats of will: the will that is in body, sound, odour, taste, touch, and in mental images.
      These, brethren, are called the Activities. From the arising of contact, comes the arising
      of the activities. From the ceasing of contact is the ceasing ofactivities.&quot; </i>(19)

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above quotation and what has been expressed in the
    Activities element of Dependent Origination in part (II.1.2.) shows that: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* All thoughts of and desires for body, sound, odour,
    smell, taste, and mental images of a person make up Activities aggregate (sankhàra
    khandha). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* If contact is not present, his feeling is absent; and
    his desire for things does not exist, his thought of thing does not come into existence
    either. This means Activities aggregate is an empty entity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* All psychological activities of a person - such as
    wishes, vows, wholesome and unwholesome thoughts, hate, love, jealousy, self - pride,
    mental reactions to life... - which have created his life in the present and in the next
    existence are of Activities aggregate. These things make sense for life, without them life
    becomes meaningless. However, the operation of them is but the operation of an illusion of
    a self (or ignorance) which says the true meaning of all values of ahuman life is very
    shadowy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a more positive expression of that operation, Lord
    Buddha taught His disciples that: </font></p>

      creatures he experiences suffering and grief. Even with suffering, even with grief; he
      becomes one who takes what was not given..., he becomes one to behave wrongly in regard to
      sense pleasures..., he becomes a liar..., a slanderer..., a harsh speaker..., a frivolous
      talker..., he becomes covetous..., malevolent in thought... of wrong view, and because of

      craving (Kàmaràga) and ill - will (vyàpàda), he becomes an Once-Returner
      (Sakadàgàmi). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) If he destroys completely the above five mental
      defilements, he becomes a Never-Returner (Anàgàmi)</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the period of time of practising insight
    (vipassanà), the practician puts the operation of Activities aggregate under the control

    of Activities, or of the twelve elements of Dependent Origination. In Kindred Sayings,

    without consciousness, without Name-and-Form, without six - sense spheres, without
    feeling, without craving, without grasping, or without becoming, perception aggregate
    cannot arise. Inversely, without perception aggregate, the other aggregates or the twelve
    elements of Dependent Origination cannot arise. It is similar for the ceasing of
    perception and the ceasing of others. In other words, there are only conditions making up
    perceptionand others which exist, but no perception considered as entity exists. In
    realizing this truth, a person may detach from all aggregates. From that detachment,
    meaning from the ceasing of attachment or grasping, the operation of perception leading to
    its ceasing and the ceasing of all troubles will come into existence: this is what is a
    way of life of experience, but not of reasons, about which people must not ask why, as
    they must not ask why a bird can fly or a fish can swim. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing the above operation means &quot;right view&quot;;
    thinking of it means &quot;right thought&quot; (or right understanding); striving to abide
    in that vision means &quot;right action&quot;, &quot;right livelyhood&quot;, and
    &quot;right effort&quot;; being mindful of it means &quot;right mindfulness&quot;,
    concentrating one&#146;s thought on it means &quot;right concentration&quot;. This is a
    way of cultivating the &quot;Eightfold Paths&quot; leading to the cessasion of all
    sufferings. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Operation of Feeling aggregate: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Happiness or suffering is a feeling which belongs to

    leading to the ceasing of suffering means the operation leading to the ceasing of Feeling

      brethren, is called feeling. Owing to the arising of contact there is arising of feeling -
      owing to the ceasing of contact, there is ceasing of feeling. This is that Eightfold

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is quite evident that the satisfaction of feeling makes
    arise desire in a person&#146;s mind and the person follow after pleasures from things.
    Without feeling, his desire becomes groundless and ceases to exist. If desire ceases,
    grasping comes to cease and suffering is not present. This is the ceasing of ignorance, of
    activities, of consciousness, of Name-and-Form, ..., and of becoming. So, the ceasing and
    arising of feeling are the very ceasing and arising of other aggregates or elements of
    Dependent Origination. In other words, the operation of feeling really is the operation of
    ignorance (avijjà), and the existence of feeling is but the existence of ignorance or of
    self - thought. If a person, through the practice of insight (vipassanà) realizes this
    operation, he will surely search for wisdom instead of the satisfaction of feeling. If
    not, he will be drowned in his feelings. With that wisdom, he will be happy living with
    what he is and what he has in the here - and - now without worries, and will open a new

    are observed, regarded closely again and again, as mentioned in (III.2.1.), they will be
    found empty. Because of that regard, the person comes to disgust at the body; owing to
    this disgust, he detaches from it. This is an operation of body controlled by wisdom which
    leads to the destruction of troubles. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short, from Lord Buddha&#146;s way of analysing the
    five aggregates, as well as Dependent Origination, and from the operation of the five
    aggregates and ignorance element the author has described, emerges the centralpoint of
    Lord Buddha&#146;s teaching which is the emphasis on showing the truth of human
    beings&#146; suffering and the way to come out of it in introducing the truth of man and
    the world. This point is going to be separately mentioned.</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">III.2.3: THE FIVE AGGREGATES AND THE
    PROBLEM OF SUFFERING AND HAPPINESS </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first words Lord Buddha declared in His first
    Discourse at the Deer Park (Migadaya) are: &quot;Life is nothing but suffering&quot; and
    &quot;The five aggregates are suffering&quot;. How important are they ! These words were
    repeated several times by Him and His disciples during fourty five years of His preaching
    Dhamma. Once, at Saàvatthi, He said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; I will teach you, brethren, pain and the root of
      pain. Do you listen to it. And what, brethren, is pain? Body, brethren, is pain: feeling
      is pain: perception..., the activities ..., consciousness is pain. That, brethren, is the
      meaning of pain. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what, brethren, is the root of pain? It is this
      craving that leads downward to rebirth, along with the lure and the lust, that lingers
      longingly now here now there: namely, the craving for sense, the craving for rebirth, the
      craving to have done with rebirth&quot;.</i> (33)</font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Aghan ca, bhikkhave, desissàmi aghamuølanca //
      tam sunàtha//. Katamanca, bhikkhave, agham // Ruùpam bhikkhave, agham // vedanà agham
      // sannà... // sankhàrà ... // vinnànam agham // Idam vuccati, bhikkhave, agham //

      bhikkhave, aghamuùlan ti //&quot;)</i>. (34) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above teaching is Lord Buddha&#146;s typical words on
    the suffering of human beings which is the result of the arising of Dependent Origination,
    also of the arising of the Five aggregates discovered by Him. This is a great discovery
    having brought Him to the position of the World - Honoured One. So, the true meaning of
    the search for truth of man is the very meaning of the search for the truth of suffering
    of life called the Noble truth of suffering. With regard to this truth, it is not the five
    aggreates - or human beings and the world - that cause suffering, but a person&#146;s
    craving for the five aggregates that causes suffering. Now, the root meaning of the search
    for truth of man and life turns to the meaning of examining human beings&#146; craving for
    things. This is the meaning of the operation of craving element and of Activities
    aggregate the writer has discussed in (II.1.3.) and in (III.2.2.), and this is the very
    operation of Ignorance element (avijjà) of Dependent Origination. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ignorance means a person&#146;s wrong view and thought
    supposing that every existing thing has its own self (or soul), as explained in (II.1.3.)
    and (II.2.4.); it also means self - thought of a man. Therefore, studying self - thought
    is the main task of studying suffering and happiness of men, and of the search for truth
    of man and the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is self - thought which makes up the essence andvalue
    of things and causes grasping leading to troubles as Lord Buddha explained: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; And how, brethren, is there grasping and worry?
      Herein, brethren, the untaught many - folk, who discern not those who are Ariyans, who are
      unskilled in the Ariyan doctrine, untrained in the Ariyan doctrine, ..., these regard body
      as the self, the self as having body, body as being in the self, the self as being in the
      body. Of such an one the body alters and becomes ortherwise. Owing to the altering and
      otherwiseness of the body, his consciousness is busied with the altering body. From this
      being busied with the altering body, worried thoughts arise and persist, laying hold of
      the heart. From this laying hold of the heart he becomes troubled, and owing to vexation
      and clinging he is worried. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">So also with perception, feeling, the activities and
      consciousness. Thus, brethren, comes grasping and worry&quot;. (35) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Katham ca, bhikkhave, upàdà - paripassana hoti //

      (36) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fountain-head of grasping and worry (or suffering) is
    therefore the regard of self-thought of a person. Grasping and suffering do not come from
    outside, but from the very regard to things of man which may be completely controled by an
    individual, and so happiness of man may also come from that regard. In the next paragraph
    of the Discourse quoted above, Lord Buddha affirmed: if a person regards no body, or no
    feeling, or no perception, or no activities as the self, ..., when the five aggregates
    alter and become otherwise, worried thoughts do not arise in his heart, and he does not
    come to grasp or worry about anything. Without grasping and worrying, he feels free and
    happy in the here - and - now. Such is the true way to happiness which really lies in
    oneself and in the very regard to things of a person. This regard is nothing other than
    &quot;right view&quot; factor of the Eightfold Noble Path which is the most important
    factor of the Buddhist way to the Noble Truth and Bliss, Nibbàna. It is the seeing things
    as selflessness. The regard which sees the impermanence and suffering of things will also
    bring men the same result of freedom and happiness as the following teaching shows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Body, brethren, is impermanent. Feeling...
      Perception, Activities... Consciousness... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">So seeing, brethren, the well - taught Ariyan disciple to
      repelled by body, is repelled by feeling by perception; by the activities, by
      consciousness. Being repelled by it he lusts not for it: not lusting he is set free; in
      this freedom comes insight that it is a being free. Thus he realizes; &quot;Rebirth is
      destroyed, lived is the righteous life, done is my task, for life in these conditions
      there is no here after&quot;. </i>(37) </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Ruùpam, bhikkhave, aniccam // vedanà... //
      sanna... // sankhàrà... Vinnanam aniccam // Evam passam, bhikkhave, sutavà ariyasàvako

      (38) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above mentioned regard seeing selflessness,
    impermanence and suffering of the five aggregates is called the regard seeing the
    &quot;Three Marks of Existence&quot;. This is the source of true happiness that can be
    tested and experienced by a worldly man in this life as declared by Lord Buddha: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; All forms are selfless&quot; he who knows and
      sees this truth becomes passive in pain; this is the way that leads to purity&quot;. </i>(39)
      (Dhp. 279) </font></p>

      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Sabbe sankhàrà dukkhà&quot; ti yadà pannàya
      passati, Atha nibbidanti dukkhe, esa maggo visuddhiyà&quot; )</i> (44)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, the truth of suffering and happiness and the problem
    of the Way to the Noble truth and happiness appear very simple, but human beings&#146; way
    of thinking and feeling is too complicated to accept them, then comes to doubt about them.
    In the deep of a person&#146;s mind, there is a thought that without desires, especially
    sensual and sexual desires, his life becomes empty and meaningless. In the deep of a
    person&#146;s heart (or feeling), there exists a feeling considering his Self his desires:
    If his desires are destroyed, his self has no condition to survive. These twothings hinder
    his mind from seeing and accepting the truth discussed above. These are the reasons why
    Lord Buddha hesitated before He turned &quot;the Wheel of Dhamma&quot;, and are the
    reasons requiring modern systems of education to play wonderfully their role in educating
    men to make a choice between lasting suffering and true happiness, or between taking up
    the burden and laying down the burden as Lord Buddha taught: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The burden is indeed the fivefold mass: <br>
      The seizer of the burden, man: <br>
      Taking it up is sorrow in this world: <br>
      The laying of it down is bliss. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">If a man lay this heavy burden down,<br>
      And take not any other burden up: <br>
      If he draws out that craving, root of all, <br>
      No more an - hungered, he is free&quot;. (45) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Bhàrà have pancakkhandhà // <br>
      bhàrahàro ca puggalo // <br>
      bhàràdànam dukkham loke // <br>

      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People should lay down the burden, or deal with craving
    for the five aggregates, of course, because of these two reasons: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) Because of seeing the dangers caused by the desire for
    the satisfaction of the five aggregates, such as sorrow, grief; woe, lamentation and
    despair. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) Because of seeing the profit gained from the
    restraining of craving for the five aggregates, such as a peaceful mind coming from the
    absence of sorrow, grief, woe, lamentation and despair, regardless of the change of
    things. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a very practical, existential and wise choice to
    be made. Otherwise, human beings are but shadows staggering in life without hope for
    peace. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, when people go on their ways of dealing with
    craving and grasping, they must surely face to difficulties arising from their sensual,
    sexual desire, desire for existence and desire for non - existence, then lots of doubts
    will arise in them and question: what will happen to them on a desireless way of life so
    quiet? How can they leave their intimate desires for sensuality, sexuality, existence and
    non-existence for unknown states of mind that seem to be so tasteless to them? etc- These
    are very rough questions that have made people flinch in thinking of the way to come out
    of them. The author with his determination will come to search for their solutions in the
    next part with a belief that true values will be explored somehow.</font></p>
