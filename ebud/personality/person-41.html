    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mentioning the doubts about the Existence of no-suffering
    and the desireless way of life, a thought arises in the author&#146;s mind that: just as
    questions about the Earth and the estimates made by a fish sound very strange to a person,
    it is so for the questions and estimates made by a person who has not experienced the
    operation of wisdom and the desireless way of life. That thought reminds him of the search
    for the truth of desire for things but not for the reasonable answers to those doubts </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha&#146;s teaching regards only the truth of
    suffering (dukkha), the cause of suffering that is desire for sensuality, existence and
    non-existence (samudaya), the extinction of suffering (nirodha) and the way to the
    extinction of suffering (magga) as what He taught in His first discourse of &quot;Turning
    the Wheel of Dhamma&quot; at the Deer Park. In this part of the work, the second Noble
    Truth is discussed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As introduced in (II.2.2.), in the beginning, the first
    people existed were those came into existence from the State of Abhassara Brahmà. They
    were mind - made, feeding on delight, self luminous, moving through the air, glorious....
    No male and female were discriminated. Then, after a short period of time, the greediness
    of manappeared; then desire for sensuality arose in them. They became more and more
    greedy, owing to this, their body turned coarser and coarser; the best looking human being
    was the one who desired for sensuality the least. After that, came the period of time when
    males developed male sex-organs, females developed female sex-organs, then their passions
    increased and their body burnt with lust: sexual intercourses appeared. The first
    intercourses were cursed by the masses; those who made love were thrown dust, ashes, and
    were not allowed to live together with the masses in villages for two months. When the
    phenomenon of sexual intercourse became more popular, sexual life were accepted openly by
    the masses. Human society were formed with its social organization from that time... </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above story about the formation of human society is
    recorded in the Discourse on &quot;On Knowledge of Beginnings&quot;, Dìghanikàya, sutta
    No 27. It is declared by Lord Buddha Himself through the vision of the Enlightened One.
    This is reality but not speculation. With regard to that story, sensual and sexual desire
    is not the basic instinct of human beings: it is but a degradation of human mind when the
    greediness (lobha) of man is strongly developed by the operation of ignorance (avijjà).
    Nowadays, sexual desire is being developed so strongly that it becomes a very important
    need of man, and sexual actions are being commercialized openly. This is a big problem to
    be discussed. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">IV.1.1: SENSUAL DESIRE</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sensual desire belongs to craving, which, as defined in
    (II.1.2.), includes craving for sense pleasures, for existence and for non-existence, or
    includes six groups called craving for things seen, for things heard, for odours, for
    tastes, for things tangible and for ideas. Except the sphere of ideas, the first five
    spheres are called sensual craving. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the beginning men enjoyed self-delight, the delight
    arising in their mind. Sensual pleasures came afterwards and became their need, then their
    crucial need, then appeared as the meaning of human life which controlled men&#146;s
    mental activities. Since then, men&#146;s sensual desire turned to be the chief cause of a
    culture called culture of sensuality. This culture, in its turn, has put strong influences
    on men&#146;s thoughts and feelings and brought up men&#146;s sensual desire. In another
    aspect of life, being impermanent, sensual pleasures cannot fulfill men&#146;s strong
    desire. The more men feel unsatisfied with sensual pleasures and sexual pleasures, the
    more they thirst for them. Now, men&#146;s sensual and sexual desires together with their
    culture of sensuality make up a new operation of feeling and thinking and force them to
    regard sensuality and sexuality as basic instincts without seeing the way out. For this
    operation, Lord Buddha twenty six centuries ago said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Monks, I know of no other single form by which a
      man&#146;s heart is so enslaved as it is by that of a woman. Monks, a woman&#146;s form

      heart is so enslaved as it is by the voice of a woman.Monks, a woman&#146;s voice obsesses

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, females and males are the original causes of sensual
    and sexual desires of each other. These desires existing in the condition of impermanence,
    cause their pleasures and sufferings in which nothing sacred or mysterious is present.
    Human beings from the state of life of no greediness, which is regarded as the wholesome
    way of life, came to greediness; then from greediness came to sensual and sexual desires
    which are considered as evil ones. Greediness, as discussed in the operation of Dependent
    Origination, is the result of the operation of wrong thought - which supposes that a human
    being has his own self or soul - leading to evil states of mind as Lord Buddha taught: </font></p>
    <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Monks, I know not of any other single thing of
    such power to cause the arising of evil states not yet arisen or the waning of good states
    already arisen as greediness. In him who is greedy, evil states not yet arisen do arise
    and good states arisen do wane. Monks, I know not of any other single thing of such power
    to cause the arising of good states not yet arisen or the waning of evil states already
    arisen as good states of wanting little&quot;</i>. (3)</font></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A person&#146;s thought that every existing thing has its
    own self means &quot;I am&quot;, &quot;I was&quot;, &quot;I will be&quot;, &quot;I should
    be&quot;, or &quot;May I be&quot;, etc. This thought implies the meaning of &quot;craving
    for existence&quot; therefore Lord Buddha taught there are eighteen thoughts which are
    haunted by craving concerning the inner self, and eighteen thoughts which are haunted by
    craving concerning what is eternal to self as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And of what sort, monks, is craving that
      ensnares, that floats along, that is far - flung, that clings to one, by which this world

      like a grass - rope, so that it overpasses not the Constant Round (of birth), the
      Down-fall, the way of woe, the Ruin? </font></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the above teaching, a person&#146;s thought is but
    self thought which is haunted by craving, and is operating as craving. So he is regarded
    as craving from which sensual and sexual desires arise. On the one hand, the person
    considers his desire himself and is dipped in the desire and suffering, on the other hand,
    Lord Buddha shows that that desire is not He, is not his, and is not his self: he should
    leave it for peace of mind and happiness. The abandonment of desire may happen immediately
    and effectively, or happen through a process. In the case of abandonment process, the
    person should know which sensual desire to be responded to, and how much of its
    requirement to be responded. In doing thus, he can control his mind from being embued with
    worries, and recognize clearly that the fulfilment of his sensual desire and his happiness
    are two separate things. With this attitude of life he enters into daily life and faces to
    the objects of sensual desire with a great care. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For things seen, such as forms, sights, cars, houses,
    clothes, ..., and even money, he cannot keep desiring for, because they are so attractive
    and necessary to him. Facing those things is facing two aspects of their existence: One is
    their satisfaction, another is their danger caused by impermanence which will lead him to
    suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For things heard, such as music, the voice and sound of
    his opposite sex..., they may allure him and make him lose his self - control to fall into
    troubles. These things also have two faces; one is their satisfaction, another is their
    danger caused by the change which will bring him unsatisfaction </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For good smells, good tastes and touches, they also are
    very attractive: They may give him their satisfaction that makes his mind burnt with
    thirst for pleasures: This is one side, the other side is their danger caused by their
    change and transcience that will lead him to sorrows, pain, lamentation, grief and woes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the teaching of Lord Buddha, understanding an
    existing thing means understanding its satisfaction, its danger and the way to come out of
    its bond. So, understanding sensual desire is understanding the satisfaction of form,
    sound, smell, taste, and touch of males and females, their danger, and the way to come out
    of one&#146;s attachment to them which is the Eightfold Noble Path led by &quot;right
    view&quot; and &quot;right thought&quot;. It is not the problem to come to some definition
    of sensual desire or to fulfill one&#146;s sensual desire. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Among sensual desires, sexual desires are the strongest
    that need to be discussed separately. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">IV. 1.2. SEXUAL DESIRE</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With regard to the story on &quot;On Knowledge of
    Beginnings&quot; (Aggannasuttam) as mentioned, sexual desire is but human beings&#146;
    greediness developed at its high level. This greediness influences strongly on men&#146;s
    mental, oral and bodily activities which are called volitional actions (or Kamma). It is
    grasped by the intention (or volition) of a person, so it may be controlled or destroyed
    by that intention. For a Buddhist monk whose intention is to realize a Brahmacariya life
    sexual desire is being abandoned thoroughly. For a Buddhist layman or laywoman, whose
    intention is to live a family life in sexual pleasure, sexual desire is available, except
    sexual misconduct, as the following teaching says: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; What are the four defilements of action that are
      abandoned? Taking life is one, taking what is not given is one, sexual misconduct is one,
      lying speech is one. These are the four defilements of action that he abandons. Thus Lord
      Buddha spoke&quot;. </i>(7) </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot; Katam&#146; assa cattàro kamma-kilesà
      pahìnà honti? Pànàtipàto kho, gahapati-putta, kamma-kileso, adinnàdànam
      kamma-kileso, kàmesu micchàcàro kamma-kileso, musàvàdo kamma-kileso. Imassa cattàro
      kamma- kilesà pahìnà hontì ti. Idamavoca Bhagavà&quot;.)</i> (8)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Regardless of living a Brahmacariya life or a family life,
    a Buddhist should realize the truth of sexual desire to deal with it . It is a desire of a
    very sweet feeling caused by a touch of sex - organs, so it belongs to the operation of
    &quot;ignorance&quot; leading to suffering. In other words, to the regard of wisdom it is
    suffering. No mystery exists in it, except &quot;ignorance&quot;. The change of life and
    of the sex itself is its aspect of danger, including some terrifying problems caused by
    it. The way to come out of its dangers is to come to the regard of wisdom and the
    operation of wisdom. Understanding sexual desire is such a regard of wisdom to be brought
    up. A person&#146;s regard to sexual problems and sexual desires is very important. From
    this regard his psychological reactions and his behaviours towards them arise: enjoying
    them? Controlling them? or abandoning them? and how? - So, one&#146;s behaviours towards
    sexual problems are not the &quot;I&quot;, the &quot;Mine&quot; or the &quot;My
    self&quot;. They are not either any major part of what is called personality at all. They
    exist as a dream which is present when ignorance is present, and absent from man&#146;s
    life when ignorance is absent.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">IV.1.3: DESIRE FOR EXISTENCE</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For those who are tired of desire for sensual pleasures,
    they come to the desire for existence called rupatanhà or bhavatanhà in Pàli. This is a
    higher and more delicate level of desire, i.e., desire for a state of mind abiding in the
    First Meditation (Jhàna), the Second Meditation, the Third or the Fourth Meditation. In
    thefirst meditation, their mind abides in initial thought (vitakka), sustained thought
    (vicàra), rapture (pìti), joy (sukha) and one - pointedness of mind (ekaggatà); In the
    second one, their mind abides in rapture, joy and one pointedness of mind; in the third
    one, in joy and one pointedness of mind, and in the fourth, in one-pointedness of mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When engaging in sensual pleasures, a person wishes that
    may the object causing his feeling of pleasure be permanent: this is a manifestation of
    &quot;desire for existence&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such is the arising or existing of &quot;desire for
    existence&quot;! Such is the satisfaction of &quot;desire for existence!&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Impermanence is the aspect of suffering &quot;desire for
    existence&quot; and &quot;right view&quot;, &quot;right thought&quot; which sees the truth
    of all above mentioned things open the way to come out of their bonds. Meditative thoughts
    are only mental activities belonging to aggregate of activities which is suffering,
    therefore a number of human beings may leave &quot;desire for existence&quot; for
    &quot;desire for non - existence&quot;.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">IV.1.4. DESIRE FOR NON-EXISTENCE </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who are tired of sensual desire and desire for
    existence tend to come to desire for non - existence or annihilation, because for them if
    existence is suffering, non - existence, in their belief, will be happy. And,
    psychologically when a person is tired of existence, he automatically thirsts for
    non-existence or annihilation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In reality, desire for anything is but a desire belonging
    to the aggregate of activities, and so it will leada person to suffering of some state in
    the Round of Rebirth - That state of mind is appropriate to Aruàpa states. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The satisfaction, the danger and the &quot;way out&quot;
    of the activities aggregate are those of &quot;desire for non - existence&quot;, of
    course. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short, desire is the root cause of suffering, and it
    itself is suffering as Lord Buddha declared in the Discourse on &quot;The Analysis of the
    Truths&quot; (Saccavibhangasuttam) of the Middle Length Sayings: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; And what, your reverences, is the Ariyan truth
      of the arising of anguish? Whatever craving is connected with again - becoming,
      accompanied by delight and attachment, finding delight in this and that, namely the
      craving for sense pleasures, the craving for becoming, the craving for annihilation -
      This, your reverences, is called the Ariyan truth of the arising of anguish&quot; (9)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Katamanc&#146;àvuso, dukkhasamudayam ariyasaccam?
      Yàyam tanhà ponobhavikà nandiràgasahagatà tatra tatràbhinandìni, seyyàthìdam :
      kàmatanhà, bhavatanhà vibhavatanhà idam vuccat&#146; àvuso, dukkhasamudayam
      ariyasaccam&quot;.)</i> (10) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wherefore? - As the writer discussed in &quot;the
    operation of Dependent Origination&quot;, no desire can exist by itself: its existence is
    but the existence of the twelve causes of Dependent Origination: This means suffering,
    sorrow, grief, lamentation, etc. already exist in it: or, suffering, sorrow, grief,
    lamentation, ..., and ignorance have made it up. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, &quot;desire&quot; always require the presence
    of the subject and object of desire: the subject really is the five aggregates, and the
    object also is the five aggregates which mean suffering as discussed in &quot;the
    operation of the five aggregates&quot;. If a person understands the operation of
    aggregates, he will at the same time understand the truth of &quot;desire&quot;,
    regardless of desire for whatever. He may come to the following conclusion for himself;
    the subject of desire is something empty and impermanent; the object of desire also is
    something empty and impermanent, so desire for whatever thing means an emptiness desires
    for emptiness, or impermanence desires for impermanence: this has nothing to do with him
    at all. In realizing that thing, he really comprehends what desire is, and sees the way to
    come out of its bonds. This truth can be seen by practising Insight (vipassana): in this
    case the practician sees with wisdom the selflessness or emptiness of the five aggregates;
    from this seeing, desireless thought arises in him together with thought of liberation.
    Through this experience, he realizes that desire does not exist in seeing the things with
    wisdom; it exists only in regards to things dominated by ignorance. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such is desire. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">IV.1.5. REGARD OF WISDOM </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The grasping of the five aggregates arises from the regard
    of the perception of selfness. This regard is the original cause of psychological
    reactions of a man towards things. When a person regards good - looking forms, his craving
    for them arises; when he regards bad &#150; looking forms, his discontent thought arises;
    when he regards normal forms, his illusion exists. All the above thought of craving,
    ill-will and illusion are the causes of his immediate troubles. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Similarly, when a person thinks of things, his thinking is
    considered as his regard to things: this regard is done by his thought and influences
    strongly on his mind. Let us observe the fact that a person is given a blow at his face,
    he feels painful physically in a minute, but his thought of that blow causes him to feel
    much more painful mentally. In the case of a person&#146;s partner turned unfaithful to
    him, he will feel so painful emotionally. So, for him, controlling his regard to things
    will be much better than controlling his psychological reactions. This interesting
    experience was taught several times by Lord Buddha in different teachings, especially in
    the doctrine of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness (satipathàna). This doctrine requires
    the practician to follow and just observe his breathing - in and breathing - out, his
    feelings, his thoughts and his mental objects (or the five aggregates, the five
    hindrances, the Seven Factors of Enlightenment).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For breathing - in and breathing - out, in observing and
    following them again and again, he will see directly what is called breathing - in or
    breathing - out is but the movement of his thought, his lung and a current of air. It is
    empty. And he also sees what is called a man is but mental processes and physical
    processes joining each other. There is no entity called the &quot;I&quot;, the
    &quot;Mine&quot; or the &quot;my Self&quot;, all is empty. Seeing this, the practician
    becomesfree from craving for them and experiences the peaceful state of mind regardless of
    the conception of what a man really is. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For feelings, in observing and following them again and
    again, he will see similarly: What is called a feeling also is but mental and physical
    processes: it is selfless. Nothing called the &quot;I&quot;, the &quot;Mine&quot;, or the
    &quot;my Self&quot; exists. Seeing this, he becomes tired with feeling, and becomes free
    from it. His thought abides in rapture, joy and peace then, regardless of any question
    about what happiness is, and of any answer to it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For thoughts, in observing and following them again and
    again, he will see plainly what is called thought appraising thing and creating values of
    things is but conditioned and empty. If breathing - in or breathing - out stops working by
    any reason, thoughts disappear, and a person&#146;s life and his cherished dreams of life
    turn senseless. Realizing this, he desires nothing: worries disappear and peace of mind
    appear, regardless of any point of view on life: nihilism or not nihilism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For mental objects, the practician with his peaceful mind
    analyses them and sees their emptiness: they themselves show their truth of selflessness,
    impermanence and suffering. In seeing that with Insight, he becomes detached from things,
    and starts the steps of destroying ten fetters for deep vision. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above practice of regard of wisdom is Called
    &quot;vipassana&quot;, in Pàli term, which means seeing things directly by intuition, or
    obtaining inward vision or spiritual insight (11). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That regard of insight may be trained in another way: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Look upon the world as you would on a bubble, <br>
      Look upon it as you would on a mirage, <br>
      The King of death does not see him |<br>
      Who thus looks down upon the world&quot; (12) Dhp. 170 </font></p>
      </i><p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;Evam lokam avekkhantam maccurajà na
      passati.<br>
      Yathà bubbuàlakam passe, yathà passe marìcikam&quot; (13) </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Or it is trained as the following teaching shows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; He who knows that this body is like froth, <br>
      And has learnt that it is as unsubstantial as a mirage, <br>
      Will break the flower- pointed arrow of Màra, <br>
      And never see the King of death&quot;. (14) (Dhp. 46) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Phenupamam kàyamimam viditvà<br>
      Marìcidhammam abhisambudhàno<br>
      Chettvàna màrassa papupphakàni <br>
      Adassanam maccuràjassa gacche&quot;.) (15) </font></p>
      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above verses imply similar senses that: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- regarding things as transcience, impermanence, and
      selflessness will help the practician calm down his fire of desire until the moment it is
      extinguished completely. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- regarding his own body in the same way, the practician
      will realize nothing called the &quot;I&quot;, the &quot;Mine&quot; or the &quot;my
      Self&quot; exists and will desire for nothing. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above regard going with wisdom will break the
    operation of ignorance leading to birth - and - death: This is the meaning of &quot;the
    King of death does not see him&quot;. It must be cultivated day after day without a break
    as Lord Buddha said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; ... Consider some person who abides seeing
      impermanence in all compounded things, conscious of it, aware of it at all times
      continually, without a break, marking it mentally, fathoming it by wisdom; and destroying
      the cankers, he enters and abides in the cankerless mind - emancipation...; this, monks,
      is the first gift - worthy person.</i> </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">Consider some person who abides seeing ill in all
      compounded things...; seeing no - self in all things..., seeing happiness in the cool,
      conscious of it, aware of it, at all times...; this, monks, is the first gift - worthy
      person&quot;</i>. (16) </font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot; Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo
      sabbasankhàresu aniccànupassì viharati aniccasannì anicca - patisamvedì satatam
      samitam abbokinnam cetasà adhimuccamàno pannàya pariyogàhamàno. So àsavànam
      khayà... pe... Ayam, bhikkhave, pathamo puggalo àhuneyyo pàhuneyyo dakkhineyyo
      anjalikaranìyo anuttaram punnakkhettamlokassa..... Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo
      sabbasankhàresu dukkhànupassì viharati... pe... sabbesu dhammesu anattànupassì

      samitam... So àsavànam khàyà... pe... Ayam, bhikkhave, pathamo puggalo àhuneyyo...
      pe... anuttaram punnakkhettam lokassa&quot;.)</i> (17) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Praising the person seeing suffering, impermanence and
    selflessness in all compounded things means praising his regard to things which causes the
    destruction of all sufferings. That is his regard of wisdom seeing things as they really
    are. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the here-and-now, everybody is completely free to be
    the master of his regard to things, to be the master of the train running to the station
    of peace and happiness. It is that regard of wisdom which is what human beings are
    expecting, because it shows the truth of the world, happiness of human beings, and brings
    to light all mysteries in life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, for worldly people, their regards are always
    hindered by the five hindrances (restlessness, torpor, desire, ill-will and doubt) and a
    lot of evil thoughts, such as self-pride, jealousy, anger, worry etc., Which are governed
    by self-thought and self-perception. At this stage of mind, the practician needs to
    practise bare-attention with which he is just aware of what the things really are without
    any psychological intervention. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At a higher stage of mind, a worldly man&#146;s regard
    works together with his meditative thoughts and wisdom, so his regard then is called the
    regard of clear vision, clear insight or wisdom which can see the truth of man and life
    regardless of any conception of personality or reality. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So here emerges the problem of seeing existing things as
    they really are by the regard of wisdom instead of the search for any theory of
    personality or any conception of reality. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Together with the above regard to things, a number of
    Buddhist spirits of individualized education are necessary to be introduced in the next
    chapter. </font></p>
