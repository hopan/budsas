    <h2 align="center"><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">Solutions for Current
    Crises</font></h2>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Men's thought is the root cause of their actions. Their
    wrong thoughts condition wrong actions which cause troubles and crises in individuals'
    mind and in human society, then series of troubles and crises arise and arise... The
    search for solutions for them become more and more complicated. However, with a great
    determination, the writer believes, human beings can resolve all by changing the direction
    of the operation of their thoughts. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">V.2.1. SOLUTION FOR &quot;THOUGHT
    CRISIS&quot; </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most basic crisis of individuals and society is the
    crisis of individual's thought itself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the old days men's thought has been regarded as the
    measure of existing things: It gives value to everything. It has been used as the crucial
    means for the search for truth and happiness. But, it is this which creates an imaginative
    self for things, while they have in reality no self at all. From this, men's thought
    creates a world of imaginative values full of contradictions and troubles. The more human
    beings engage in this imaginative world, the more they sink in the darkness of thought and
    in a crisiscalled &quot;thought crisis&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With self-thought, people see things as having a permanent
    self and grasp it. This seeing is called &quot;inversion of view&quot; which hinders their
    mind from reality itself. So, the way to resolve the above crisis is coming out of their
    &quot;inversion of view&quot; or coming into &quot;right view&quot; which sees the truth
    of Dependent Origination existing in everything. In seeing this, people come to realize
    that: self-thought is empty; desire is coming from self-thought; the phenomenal world of
    selfness is empty; and desire, ill-will or illusion relating to that world also is empty:
    they become free from the bondage of them. This is solution for &quot;thought-crisis&quot;
    people are expecting. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">No mystery exists in men's desire, suffering or happiness,
    etc. except their self-thought. The extinction of self-thought is the extinction of
    &quot;thought crisis&quot; indeed.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">V.2.1. SOLUTION FOR &quot;DESIRE
    CRISIS&quot;</font> </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Self-thought also causes another crisis: from it, desire
    for things arises and causes troubles in man's mind as the author discussed in (II.1.2) of
    this work. A human being exits in life as a thirsty man in the open sea drinking salty
    water. The more he drinks, the more he becomes thirsty and wants to drink again. Drinking
    salty water is not the solution for the thirsty man. It is the same for a man in life:
    desiring for senses and things is not the solution for his suffering. This is called
    &quot;desire crisis&quot;, or the &quot;inversion of mind&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Falling into that &quot;inversion&quot;, people often do
    not have any choice other than continuing desiring: their desirebecomes so strong that it
    is understood as the real meaning of life, therefore they see no way out. The Buddhist
    doctrine of Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppàda), of the five aggregates
    (Pancakkhandhà), and of the Four Noble Truths (Cattàri Aryasaccàni) say the same thing:
    &quot;desire is the cause of suffering&quot;, and the way out is the way of ceasing men's
    desire as the author discussed in (IV.1.5) and (IV.2.1) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, if self-thought ceases, &quot;desire crisis&quot;
    ceases; if non-self thought operates, &quot;desire crisis&quot; will come to destruction.
    This is the solution for &quot;desire crisis&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to the above crises, some other crises are
    present by the presence of self-thought as showed next. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">V.2.1. SOLUTION FOR &quot;HEART
    CRISIS&quot; </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Self-thought tends to give a permanent nature to every
    existing thing. To the love for parents, it gives a name called &quot;filial piety&quot;,
    and defines it as duties done by a daughter or son toward her/his parents. If these duties
    are not performed by her/him, she/he does not deserve being a human being. Such is the
    meaning of &quot;filial piety&quot; suggested by Confucianists. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To the love for a country, it gives another name called
    &quot;loyalty&quot;, and defines it as duties done by a citizen for her/his country or
    her/his King. If these duties are not realized by her/him, she/he is understood as
    &quot;unfaithful citizen&quot; who does not deserve being in life. Such is the sense of
    &quot;loyalty&quot; suggested by Confucianists. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To the love for a sweatheart, it gives a name
    called&quot;Love&quot;, and defines it as an intimate relationship which requires some
    duties done for each other. If either a husband or wife is unfaithful to the other by any
    reason, she or he is known as the evil one who does not deserve to exist in life. Such is
    the meaning given to &quot;Love&quot; by Confucianists. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, life is very complicated, people sometimes meet
    with situations in which they can do their duty either for their parents, or for their
    country/king, or just for their husband/wife; in these cases they will be either
    &quot;unfilial&quot;, or &quot;unfaithful&quot;, or &quot;unloyal&quot; and will be too
    suffering to make a choice, and too suffering to survive. These are tragedic cases caused
    by the conception of &quot;filiality&quot;, of &quot;loyalty&quot; and of
    &quot;faithfulness&quot; created by self-thought. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, in those cases - many cases happened in the history of
    the Chinese and Vietnamese the story of &quot;Le Cid&quot; in French literature also is a
    typical one - people should follow the call of their beautiful heart, but not the call of
    imaginative conceptions. No choice deserves to be made here, because it actually is full
    of tears. This is called a &quot;heart crisis&quot; caused by self-thought. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With regard to non-self thought, &quot;filiality&quot;,
    &quot;loyalty&quot; or &quot;love&quot; is conditioned and selfless; it must be redefined
    in an &quot;open sense&quot; how to be very human and very helpful to individuals and
    their happiness in the present. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to the above cases, some customs, some social
    laws, or some disciplines in schools which may bring tears to men should be revaluated too
    for happiness ofindividuals as human beings. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">V.2.1. SOLUTION FOR &quot;EMOTIONAL
    CRISIS&quot; </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Heart crisis&quot; mentioned above is caused by
    reasons outside of man. There exists another aspect of &quot;heart crisis&quot; caused by
    reasons inside of man, by sentimental habitude which is called&quot;emotional
    crisis&quot;. This crisis operates in the following manner: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- The current culture created by self-thought strongly
      influences men's mind: thinking, sensing, feeling,... It becomes so intimate to men that
      it is regarded as reality: people cannot abandon it, or part of it, even when they do
      realize it is wrong, or it is suffering, and do realize that there is a better way of life
      led by non-self thought. This event is known as an &quot;emotional inversion&quot; or
      &quot;emotional crisis&quot;. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- All values created by that culture also become very
      close to men although they may bring tears to them very often because of their inversive
      qualities. But people prefer being with them to being with the new. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- The old way of education is imperfect, but it's very
      difficult for people to think of a new way and to realize a new way. This happens owing to
      men's &quot;emotional inversion&quot; etc. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- In the case of a religious a non-Buddhist man, even when
      he realizes the truth of life, which is different from what he has believed in, he cannot
      leave his belief for that truth: this also means &quot;emotional inversion&quot;. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above &quot;emotional crisis&quot; seems simple but
    really is a dangerous hindrance of one's mind. The solution for it must be the practising
    again and again one's regard of wisdom to have new emotion replacing the old. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">V.2.1. SOLUTION FOR &quot;MORALITY
    CRISIS&quot; </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Morality is also a value of life created by man's thinking
    or self-thought. It is understood as the &quot;should do's'' and the &quot;should not
    do's&quot; for an individual, for his family, community and country which really are the
    production of man's thinking. So, when &quot;thought crisis&quot; appears, &quot;morality
    crisis&quot; comes into existence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Heart crisis&quot; as mentioned is something of
    morality, something relating to morality; when &quot;heart crisis&quot; is present,
    &quot;morality crisis&quot; must exist. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In another aspect of human society, morality is known as
    the relationship among human beings in a society; when the sphere of economy is developed
    fast, that relationship must be changed out of one's mind. It is the same, when the
    policy, or the sphere of politics, in a society is changed, the relationship among men
    cannot remain as what it is. This causes a &quot;morality crisis&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If people follow Lord Buddha's teachings on the Eightfold
    Noble Paths, and consider &quot;morals group&quot; (including right speech, right action
    and right livelihood) as morality on life, there will never be any &quot;morality
    crisis&quot; regardless of the change of life. This is a right solution for it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Morals group is a way of life wearing no label. It does
    not have any meaning of any religion at all, so itmay be applied in schools for students
    without any discrimination. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Is it right time for education to accept &quot;morals
    group&quot; as morality of modern schools ? </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">V.2.1. SOLUTION FOR &quot;ENVIRONMENTAL
    CRISIS&quot; </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Environmental crisis is a hot problem people over the
    world are concerned much about. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the author mentioned in (II.2.3), environmental crisis
    is environmental pollutions caused by ionising radiation, nuclear fission, natural dusts,
    forest fires, transportation, incineration and other minor sources. This is the result of
    the fast industrial development, as said in the beginning of this work, which is very
    harmful; it also is the result of the lack of responsibility toward environment of people
    which may bring mass-destruction to human beings in a very near future. So the protection
    of environment should be done as early as possible. For protection, a philosophy and a way
    of education for environment are needed to arrange lots of things as follows: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Educating men to recognize the close relationship between
    human beings and nature by the doctrine of Dependent Origination or/and the five
    aggregates, so that they themselves may voluntarily protect environment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Explaining to men the terrible dangers caused by
    pollutions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Showing that men's desire for advantages and powerscan
    cause suffering to people. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suggesting what to do for environmental protection.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such a philosophy and education, as the author has
    displayed through out this work, may be found from the doctrine of Dependent Origination
    and/or the five aggregates. This is solution for &quot;environmental crisis&quot; and for
    the safety of life on earth. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">V.2.1. SOLUTION FOR &quot;EDUCATIONAL
    CRISIS&quot; </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is very evident that all the above crises are present
    because of the presence of a cause called &quot;educational crisis&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If education is not based on a right concept of
    personality created by a regard of wisdom, it will lead to a wrong course of transferring
    empty knowledges and unsuitable things of education to students, and will bring sufferings
    to life. Dominated by self-thought and self-perception, all standards of value in this
    education can only create an imaginative world for men to live, but not reality itself.
    What can people expect from this world if not a fateful loss of hope ? What can people
    expect from economy, politics, competition,..., together with desires, ill-will, illusion,
    hatred, etc. if not building up on Earth a colossal market for goods, weapons of mass
    destruction, etc. bringing harms and fears ? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If education is based on non-self thought regarding a man
    as a compounded thing of depend Origination or the five aggregates, but not an entity,
    education will find a right way for &quot;what to educate&quot; and &quot;how to
    educate&quot; men: the role of education then is helping persons see what they really are,
    what the world really is, and get rid of all causes of troubles and sufferings from them
    for happiness in the here-and-now. This is a positive solution for &quot;educational
    crisis&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above are current crises of human society and
    solutions for them </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The history of human kind shows that self-thought of
    dualism has dominated human culture on Earth over thirty centuries, but the suffering of
    birth, sickness, old-age, and death caused by men's attachment and craving are still
    there, contradictions, fights, despairs, harms and fears of human beings more and more
    increase without solution. What can human beings expect from that way of culture ? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha's teachings recorded in Pàli pancanikàya
    suggest a new way of thought of non-self which is different from the point of view of
    other religions and philosophies. This way of thought does not regard a human being or the
    world as an entity having a permanent substance, but as a conditioned and conditioning
    thing, it may bring human beings happiness in the present and interesting solutions if it
    is applied in actual life. These teachings may be used in modern schools and universities
    as a major subject of a study branch of philosophy; educational philosophy, educational
    psychology, educational psychotherapy, or personality theory. Why not? -This way of
    thought, or regard to things, will helpeducation adjust personality theories which are
    unreal, adjust the educational spirit of competition which harms the spirit of
    co-operation; it will help students develop independent thought and creativeness, and
    effectively deal with their problems and troubles in daily life; lastly, it will suggest a
    standard of value based on happiness of individuals and the commonwealth but not on
    morality, based on wisdom but not on imaginative knowledge, based on human love and
    humanness but not on hatred or fighting; etc. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the reason why the author chose the topic entitled
    &quot;Concept of personality revealed through Pancanikàya&quot; as his Ph. D. thesis in
    Buddhist Studies. In choosing this topic, he realizes the difficulties in presenting
    Buddhist doctrine as a way of life and education for worldly people, and the difficulties
    in persuading others &#141;to accept that way. But, difficulty does not mean
    impossibility, so he comes to persuade himself to proceed with this research work by his
    belief in the condition of possibility. Let the work be tested, he thinks. What should
    come will come.</font></p>
