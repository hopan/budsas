    <h2 align="center"><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">A New Course of Education
    and Culture</font></h2>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From Lord Buddha&#146;s teachings recorded in the five
    collections of Paøli Suttapitaka, the author has discussed the doctrine of Dependent
    Origination and its operation, the five Aggregates and their operation, and Buddhist
    spirits of education for Individuals. He has introduced a human being as a conditioned
    being, and has not come to any personality theory in which a man is regarded as an entity
    having a permanent self. This is, to his best knowledge, a special feature very helpful to
    personality theorists and educators of the coming century in opening a new course of
    culture and education for human beings&#146; peace and happiness </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is time for them to make a choice between these two
    things: one is considering self-thought way of thinking as the basis on which all values
    in life are based, and considering the fulfilment of one&#146;s desire as a means to
    one&#146;s happiness; the other is developing non-self way of thinking as the wisdom
    regard showing a way of life, and accepting the control of one&#146;s desire as a means to
    one&#146;s happiness in the here-and-now, regardless of all difficulties one may meet with
    in life. The former has brought to life a lot of troubles and crises; only the latter is a
    belief and a hope of releasing those social troubles and crises. This is the content
    mentioned in the fifth part of this work.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The truth of life, as discussed, says that: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A man must be a man of some education and culture, and an
    education or culture must be education or culture of man. They cannot be separated from
    each other.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha&#146;s teachings for human beings on what the
    world really is, what a man really is, on individuals&#146; problems, their causes, their
    cessation, their way to their cessation, and on spirits of individualized education,
    really imply the meaning of a way of education which is going to be showed more clearly in
    the next lines. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">V.1.1 NEW COURSE OF EDUCATION </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, let us take a look into the following points of view
    on education suggested by some outstanding persons before coming to a discussion about the
    details of the educational problem. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr. E.F Schumacher, the well-known author of a very
    interesting book tittled &quot;Small is Beautiful&quot; wrote: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Education can help us only if it produces
      &quot;whole men&quot;. The truly educated man is not a man who knows a bit of everything,
      not even the man who knows all the details of all subjects (if such a thing were
      possible). The &quot;whole man&quot;, in fact, may have little detailed knowledge of facts
      and theories, he may treasure the Encyclopaedia Britanica because&quot;she knows and he
      needn&#146;t&quot;, but he will be truly in touch with the centre. He will not be in doubt
      about his basic convictions, about his view on the meaning and purpose of his life. He may
      not be able to explain these matters in words, but the conduct of his life will show a
      certain sureness of touch which stems from his inner clarity&quot;</i>. (1) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr. E.F. Schumacher defined the word &quot;centre&quot; in
    the above quotation as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; The centre, obviously is the place where he has
      to create for himself an orderly system of ideas about himself and the world, which can
      regulate the direction of his various strivings.&quot;</i> (2) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For him, the root purpose of education must be helping a
    man understand the truth of himself and the world he is living in, see his course of life,
    and be responsible for his deeds. Although he cannot say what that truth is, but his words
    sound very humanist and pratical. His point of view on education deserves to be
    considered. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a very well-known economist, journalist and
    progresssive entrepreneur, an Economic Adviser to the National Coal Board from 1950 to
    1970, in England, a Founder and Chairman of the Intermediate Technology Development Group
    Ltd., etc., his advice on problems of rural development praised by many overseas
    governments, his above mentioned book printed 34 times from 1963 to 1993, his ideas must
    be thoughtful, especially ideas on man, economy and environment. (3) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For Albert Einstein who is one of the greatest scientists
    of our modern age, he delivered some other special opinions on education which runs as
    follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; The school has always been the most important
      means of trans-fering the wealth of tradition from one generation to the next...&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Sometimes one sees in the school simply the
      instrument for transfering a certain maximum quantity knowledge to the growing generation.
      But that is not right. Knowledge is dead; the school, however, serves the living. It
      should develop in the young individuals those qualities and capabilities which are of
      value for the welfare of the commonwealth. But that does not mean that individuality
      should be destroyed and the individual become a mere tool of the community, like a bee or
      an ant. For a community of standardized individuals without personal originality and
      personal aims would be a poor community without possibilities for development. On the
      contrary, the aim must be the training of independently acting and thinking individuals,
      who, however, see in the service of the community their highest life problem...&quot; </i>(4)
      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And he added: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It is not enough to teach man a specialty.
      Through it he may become a kind of useful machine but not a harmoniously developed
      personality. It is essential that the student acquires anunderstanding of a lively feeling
      for values... He must learn to understand the motives of human beings, their illusions,
      and their sufferings in order to acquire a proper relationship to individual fellow-men
      and to the community.</i> (5) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, Einstein supposes education has a role of maintaining
    the wealth of tradition, but he doesn&#146;t emphasize the role of developing it, and
    choosing which of the traditions should be maintained, which of it should be reconsidered,
    because the root purpose of life is to live in happiness but not exactly to live with
    tradition. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He also supposes education has a role of educating men to
    be a man of power-or a social man with specialized knowledges; and a man himself who must
    know the wholeness of himself, his illusion and suffering..., and his community. This
    sounds very interesting, although it cannot say what a man himself really is. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a very outstanding scientist, Einstein&#146;s seeing
    things is so scientific and seeing human beings is so realistic that it should be brought
    into practice. His opinions on education, to the author, may suggest a good course of
    education. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For Bertrand Russel, a very well-known U.S writer and
    thinker of the second part of the twentieth century A.D., mentioning the problem of
    &quot;Education and social order&quot;, he wrote: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Three divergent theories of education all have
      their advocates in the present day. Of these the first considers that the sole purpose of
      education is toprovide opportunities of growth and to remove hampering influences. The
      second holds that the purpose of education is to give culture to the individual and to
      develop his capacities to the utmost. The third holds that education is to be considered
      rather in relation to the community than in relation to the individual, and that its
      business is to train useful citizens...</i>&quot; (6) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Russel&#146;s speech reflects rather faithfully what
    education of today is. His view is &quot;no one of the three is a adequate by
    itself&quot;, and a right system of education must apply all the above three theories.But
    all those three theories still lack of the most important thing which is the truth of a
    man and the true way to his happiness in the present. In principle, providing
    opportunities for the growth of individuals, and helping a man develop his capacities to
    the utmost are very necessary to every good course of education. For the problem of
    training useful citizens, it should be noticed that a citizen, or a social man, must come
    after a man himself; without a man himself, a citizen can never be trained. So, here
    emerges a significant realization that the truth of the world and of human beings Lord
    Buddha Gotama discovered twenty six centuries ago is an invaluable discovery for
    men&#146;s new education and culture if it is to be brought today into schools for use. It
    must be known as a way of life bringing peace and happiness for individuals as well as for
    their commonwealth, and must be regarded as a major subject of philosophy, psychology, and
    educational psychology. This new branch of education will offer people a new regard to
    values and attitude of life leading to the calm of desire and ill-will, and to the
    destruction of wrong perception and thought. This branch of education will help
    individuals analyse their own mind, behaviour and trouble to find the right way to live:
    they will come to recognize that happiness does not ask them to do anything more than
    stopping their desires, and that the very present moment of the here-and-now is when they
    really are free from troubles, because it always is completely new. At that wonderful
    moment, no one, or no power, puts any trouble into their mind. However, to abide in that
    moment a person should know how to control his self-thought and desire by the insistent
    practice of wisdom regard and of the four foundations of mindfulness. Here he only needs
    guidance, advice, encouragement, and wakefulness from his teacher and others. This means a
    helping role of education is needed, but not command, force or power; school discipline is
    still maintained for providing appropriate atmosphere for learning and opportunities for
    the development of individuals&#146; mind and capacities; and the content of teaching aims
    at transferring knowledges for understanding and cultivating individuals&#146; mind, and
    for the service society in response to the commonwealth-requirements of safety, peace and
    prosperity. Methods of teaching are also demanded for wakefulness rather than stuffing
    with senseless notions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With regard to the above way of education, the appraisal
    of learning skill of a student, award, punishment, exams, etc., must be reconsidered
    according to the new course of education. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the author&#146;s opinion, if the above things are
    adopted, a way of education for the wholeness of man, humanness and wisdom will come into
    existence and survive. Because the truth of life and man wears no label, so this way of
    education will wear no label either. Since it wears no label, it may be a way of education
    for all people of all time. Because a man is but the operation of the five aggregates, so
    no image of personality is created for any pattern of education to be followed: for
    individuals, the meaning of life is to live with what he is in the very present moment
    without attachment to it: in doing this they will realize peace and happiness in their
    mind and body; the meaning of life is not anything of thinking or wishing: thinking or
    wishing only creates an image of life which is dead. Since individuals are strongly
    influenced by their old kamma, or old habits, by environment and by culture, so education
    has another role of helping them see what influences are hindering their mind, obsessing
    them, from seeing the five aggregates as they really are, to get rid of them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the performance of all above requirements is done, that
    way of education is then regarded as education of humanness, reality, wisdom and
    creativeness. This is the meaning of a new course of education. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">V.1.2 NEW COURSE OF CULTURE </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From a new course of education, a new course of culture
    originates. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As quoted in (V.1.1), Albert Einstein, a creative
    scientist, thinks that Education plays a role of maintaining, transferring and developing
    culture from generation to generation. This culture is defined by The Random House College
    Dictionary as, &quot;The sum total of ways of living built up by a group of human beings
    transmitted from one generation to another&quot; In the author&#146;s mind, it may be
    understood as all aspects of life of a group of human beings made up by education and its
    creative works to cope suitably with nature and to be improved on. Regarding this meaning,
    a new course of culture is discussed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As mentioned before, the current culture of human beings
    is dominated by self-thought which has created the meaning of goodness, badness, gain and
    loss, success and failure; superiority and inferiority, etc. These meanings appear in life
    as a strong worldly wind that makes men&#146;s life-boat rock in the ocean of suffering:
    it is those meanings which act upon men&#146;s mind and cause troubles to arise; these
    troubles, in their turn, hinder men&#146;s regard to things from truth, and pull off their
    mind from abiding in the very present moment, and so pull off men from true life - besause
    true life only exists in the present. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That self-thought makes arise in one&#146;s mind
    perception of &quot;I am&quot;, &quot;I am this&quot; &quot;I am that&quot;, &quot;I am
    not this&quot;, &quot;I&#146;m not that&quot;, &quot;I was&quot;, &quot;I was this&quot;,
    &quot;I wasn&#146;t this&quot;, &quot;I was that&quot;, &quot;I wasn&#146;t that&quot;,
    &quot;I will be&quot;. &quot;I will be this&quot;, &quot;I will be that&quot;...,
    &quot;May I be&quot;, &quot;May I be this&quot;, &quot;May I be that&quot;, etc. These
    perceptions therefore are root causes of craving for sensual desire, craving for
    existence, cravingfor non-existence, hatred, anger, etc. They lead men to sorrow,
    lamentation, grief, suffering. Such is the operation of self-thought. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Regarding the doctrine of Dependent Origination,
    self-thought means ignorance (avijja), and its operation really is the operation of
    ignorance: this is the arising of Dependent Origination leading to suffering, and is the
    truth of this current culture. Self-thought, therefore, exists as what determines the
    fateful suffering of human beings. If all efforts of those who are searching for happiness
    are based on self-thought, happiness will always be out of their reach. Such is the
    current culture. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In fact, all efforts of human beings to build up a culture
    aim at true happiness as the final purpose of life. So, to achieve that intimate purpose,
    self-thought or ignorance must be replaced by the destruction of ignorance, or wisdom
    (vijja or pannaaø): all actions of human beings must be put into the operation of
    non-self thought as what Buddha taught. This operation will open a new culture or a new
    course of culture leading to the destruction of suffering. Here is happiness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Non-self thought will function as an intelligent architect
    who ardently constructs new aspects of life, such as: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* The most important aspect of life, called the most
    important architectural work, is love for life: love for human kind, for a country, for
    parents, for husband or wife, for children, relatives, neighbors, etc. This love led by
    wisdom (right view and right thought) comes from one&#146;sseeing the truth of
    selflessness of existing things. It can extinguish a lot of causes of suffering in life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* The next architectural work is giving the true sense to
    &quot;loyalty&quot; and &quot;justice&quot;: morals group, or right speech, right action
    and right livelihood, is the giver of the sense. If a person practises right speech, right
    action and right livelihood, he must go on the way of &quot;loyalty&quot; and
    &quot;justice&quot; faithfully: right action implies the meaning of &quot;justice&quot;
    right speech means &quot;loyalty&quot; and so on. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Morals group itself means morality and humanity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Non-self thought leading to happiness shows that:
    happiness of individuals, the commonwealth and the culture, tradition of a country are two
    separate things: in the case culture and tradition cannot bring happiness to individuals
    and the commonwealth, they must be revaluated and improved. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Non-self thought helps people see the co-existence of
    human beings and environment so that they come to protect environment from pollution and
    human beings from war. Tragedies and sufferings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Non-self thought will open a way of thinking for men,
    creating new concepts of value for the beauty, architecture, painting, etc.; serving
    happiness of men. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* All the above new aspects of life will make up a new
    culture, or new course of culture, for peace and happiness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* The world is in serious crises: social crisis and
    environmental crisis. If the course of culture is not changed, those crises cannot be
    resolved, and human beings will be drowned in that ocean of crises. It is time for the
    world to make a choice between the operation of self-thought and that of non-self thought.
    The writer&#146;s belief in the latter is clear. It will be shown next.</font></p>
