    Theories</font></h2>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As described in Part two, the truth of man and the world
    is Dependent Origination which says that a man, or the world, is conditioned, selfless,
    and belonging to nobody, it is but the operation of the five aggregates (Pancakkhandha).
    So what is called &quot;Concept of personality&quot; is just empty. The author&#146;s
    effort is not to search for any personality theory revealed through the Pancanikàya, but
    to observe individuals&#146; mental, oral and bodily activities, which he calls the
    operation of &quot;Name - and - Form&quot; element or of the five aggregates, to find out
    the way of life leading to happiness for individuals in the here - and - now. However, he
    believes some of contemporary personality theories in education remain useful in helping
    man understand others&#146; behaviours and some psychological aspects, he comes to take a
    review of them for their improvement before entering into the deep operation of the
    aggregates</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most of personality theories applied in modern schools
    were formed in the second part of nineteenth century A.D. and in the twentieth century
    A.D. All of them aiming at discovering what a man really is are relatively practical and
    useful. Here, the author only mentions the typical theories through three basic steps:
    concept of personality, features of personality and his reviews of them. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">III.1.1 CONCEPT OF PERSONALITY </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Calvin S.Hall and Gardner Lindzey in their book titled,
    &quot;Theories of Personality&quot;, wrote: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; ... Allport (1937) in an exhaustive survey of
      the literature extracted almost fifty different definitions that he classified into a
      number of broad categories. Here we will concern ourselves with only a few of these
      definitions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is important initially to distinguish between what
      Allport calls biosocial and biophysical definitions. The biosocial definition shows a
      close correspondence with the popular use of the term as it equates personality to the
      &quot;social stimulus value&quot; of the individual. It is the reaction of other
      individuals to the subject that defines the subject&#146;s personality. One may even
      assert that the individual possesses no personality but that provided by the response of
      others. Allport, ..., suggests that a biophysical difinition that the personality firmly
      in characteristics or qualities of the subject is much to be preferred. ... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Other definitions place primary emphasis upon the
      integrative or organizational function of personality... In other definitions, personality
      is equated to the unique or individual aspects of behavior... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, some theorists have considered personality to
      represent the essence of the human condition... Allport&#146;s suggestion that
      &quot;personality is what a man really is&quot; illustrates this type of definition&quot;.</i>
      (1) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the above concepts of personality come from man&#146;s
    thinking of self - thought and from the sources of information given by the six sense -
    organs of man. Both man&#146;s thought and sense - organs are unbelievable agents as the
    author discussed before, so all conclusions about personality achieved must be reviewed in
    the light of Dependent Origination. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In real life, a man is the existence of mental and
    physical processes of becoming. All personality theorists&#146; efforts to define what he
    is only means stopping those processes: This is not what he really is, and not a good way
    to understand a man himself, wherefore any research for personality as entity is always on
    the way. This point will be proved when one follows the features of personality theories
    and their reviews. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">III.1.2. FEATURES OF PERSONALITY </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From what Larry A. Hjelle and Daniel J. Ziegler wrote
    about the features of personality in their book titled &quot;Personality Theories&quot;
    (2), the following common features may be mentioned: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1.Most definitions emphasize the importance of
    individuality or distinctiveness. Personality represents those distinct qualities that
    make one person stand out from others. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2.Personality is something abstract based on inferences
    derived from behavioral observation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Personality represents an evolving process subject to a
    variety of internal and external influences, including genetic and biological
    propensities, social experiences, and changing environmental circumstances. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Personality definitions differ substantially from
    theorist to theorist. We should add that definitions of personality are not necessarily
    true or false, but are more or less useful to psychologists in pursuing research, in
    explaining regularities in human behavior... </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each definition of personality, or each personality
    theory, evolves a feature of personality. Sigmund Freud believed that human behaviour is
    determined by irrational, unconscious factors. Maslow believed most of our actions result
    from reason and free choice. Carl Gustav Jung claimed that people have two types of
    personality: introvert and extrovert. For Carl Rogers, who supposed, differently from
    Freud, that it is our present interpretation of past experiences rather than their factual
    existence that influences our current behaviour. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It may be said that psychologists, psychotherapists or
    personality theorists can discover many different features of human beings&#146;
    personality according to their points of views, or their own professional experiences.
    This fact proves that the true nature of human beings, or true personality, really is
    selfless: because of the existence of selflessness, personality may appear in various
    factual aspects as it has been viewed. Therefore, the more features of personality are
    discovered, the more knowledge of human beings can be gained. There is only one thing to
    be noticed that is a man himself appears as a river flowing on and on, and the features of
    personality mentioned here are but the river watering places it passed through. This can
    be seen plainly in the contemporary personality theories themselves. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">III.1.3. REVIEW OF TYPICAL PERSONALITY
    THEORIES </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many personality theories used in the study of
    educational psychology of today. All of them belong to either behaviorism or humanism. The
    following are some of them considered as the typical by the writer.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Sigmund Freud&#146;s theory (1856 - 1939)</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the middle of nineteenth century, in Germany,
    Psychology was understood as &quot;the analysis of consciousness in the normal adult human
    being&quot;. Freud had a different point of view. For him, the mind appears as an iceberg
    in which the smaller part showing above the surface of the water symbolizes the region of
    the activities of consciousness, and the much larger part of iceberg below the water
    symbolizes the area of the existing unconsciousness, where the urges, the passions, the
    repressed feelings and ideas strongly influencing on the individual thoughts and deeds
    exist. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Freud&#146;s opinion, the structure of personality
    includes three parts: id, ego and superego. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The id:</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">... The id cannot tolerate increases of energy that are
    experienced as uncomfortable states of tension. Consequently, when the tension level of
    the organism is raised, either as a result of external stimulation or of internally
    produced excitations, the id functions in such a manner as to discharge the tension
    immediately and return the organism to a comfortably constant and low energy level. This
    principle of tension reduction by which the id operates is called the pleasure
    principle...&quot; (3) </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The ego </font></b><i></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; The ego comes into existence because the needs of
    the organism require appropriate transactions with the objective world of reality. The ego
    is said to obey the reality principle.. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The reality principle suspends the pleasure temporarily
    although the pleasure principle is eventually served when the needed object is found and
    the tension is thereby reduced..., it decides what instincts will be satisfied and in what
    manner...&quot;</i> (4) </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The super ego: </font></b><i></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It is the internal representative of the traditional
    values and ideals of society... </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It represents the ideal rather than the real...</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The main function of the super ego are: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) To inhibit the impulses of the id, particularly those
    of a sexual or aggressive nature, since these are the impulses whose expression is most
    highly condemned by society. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) To persuade the ego to substitute moralistic goals for
    realistic ones, and </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) To strive for perfection.&quot; (5) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In concluding the introduction of the &quot;id&quot;,
    &quot;ego&quot; and the &quot;superego&quot;, Hall and Lindzey added: &quot;... They work
    together as a team under the administrative leadership of the ego&quot;. (6) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the author&#146;s opinion, the id Freud mentioned is
    the root and very important part of human personality. It exists only under the form of
    sexual instincts or sexual desires. So a man, for Freud, is but the existence of sexual
    activities: sexual desires and the response to their requirements. Such a man is nothing
    but a forever slave of the &quot;id&quot; and the &quot;superego&quot; and the
    contradictions happening between them, or he is but a slave of the inborn of the past and
    of conventional values created by speculations which is called the good or morality of
    society. If people do not want to accept such a destiny, they will never accept
    Freud&#146;s theory of personality. In reality, people are free to make every choice they
    want for their actual lives, they even can control or deal with sexual desires without
    pain or tension. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the truth of Dependent Origination, every
    thing cannot exist by itself, but it is conditioned, or it is the existence of temporary
    or immediate conditions. This shows that sexual instincts must be conditioned, so they
    cannot be regarded as the basis of what is called personality. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, with regard to the truth of life, when a thing
    exists,the opposite of it also exists. This supposes that mental states dealing with
    sexual instincts, which may be called non - sexual desires, comes into existence as well.
    This is what Sigmund Freud did not mention in his personality theory. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For Freud&#146;s principle of pleasure or the tension
    reduction principle, it is but the manifestation of making love repeatedly again and again
    in a man&#146;s life which will remove tensions or pains from him, and bring pleasures or
    happiness to him, but this result is doubted about, because in daily life people always
    are on the way to search for happiness: Searching for it says that it really does not
    exist; it still is out of the reach of men. So, how can people say the pleasure principle
    removes mental tensions ? Again, people&#146;s experiences disclose that making love may
    cause tiresome of it or cause another tension stronger, how can people explain the meaning
    of reducing tensions of it ? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In life, a man&#146;s tensions may come from other sources
    than sexual problems. In these cases, pleasure principle built up by Freud can bring
    tension reduction ?.. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the above questions, the writer comes to the
    following estimates: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Sexual drive really is important to a man, but it is not
      all; it is not the factor determining what is called personality or the wholeness of him </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Making love or pleasure principle mentioned by Freud can
      bring pleasure to a man, but it can also bring unsatisfaction. The response to its
      requirement cannot resolve the problem of suffering and happiness of men. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Freud&#146;s personality theory may be useful to modern
      schools, but a good course of education cannot be based on it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">* The discovery of unconsciousness of man by Freud may be
      accepted as the very important part of an individual to be concerned, but what a man
      really is, is another problem the writer will discuss about in (III.2.) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Carl Gustav Jung&#146;s theory: (1875 - 1961)</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Carl Gustav Jung was a young psychiatrist in Zurich. In
    1907, after his visit to Freud in Vienna, he was claimed by Freud to be Freud&#146;s
    successor. Three years later the relationship between Jung and Freud was completely
    broken, because Jung rejected Freud&#146;s pansexualism as Jung said, &quot;The immediate
    reason was that Freud identified his method with his sex theory, which I see to be
    inadmissible&quot; (7). Jung then proceeded to build his own theory of psycho-analisis and
    his own method of psychotherapy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Calvin S.Hall and Gardner Lindzey wrote: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; ... For Freud, there is only the endless
      repetition of instinctual themes until death intervenes. For Jung, there is constant and
      often creative development, the search for wholeness and competition, and the yearning for
      rebirth&quot;. (8) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; The total personality of psyche, as it is called
      by Jung, consists of a number of differentiated but interacting systems. The principal
      ones are the ego, the personal unconscious and its complexes, the collective unconscious
      and its archetypes, the persona, the anima and animus, and the shadow. In addition to
      these interdependent systems there are the attitudes of introversion and extraversion, and
      the functions of thinking, feeling, sensing and intuiting. Finally, there is the self
      which is the center of the whole personality&quot;. </i>(9) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For Jung, ego means conscious perceptions, memories,
    thoughts and feelings; the unconscious consists of experiences which were once conscious
    but have been repressed, suppressed, forgotten or ignored, and experiences too weak to
    make up conscious impression upon the person; collective unconscious means the storehouse
    of latent memory traces inherited from one&#146;s ancestral past...; the persona is a mask
    a person wears in response to the demands of social convention and tradition, and to his
    (or her) own inner archetypal needs; the anima and animus are terms showing a person as a
    bisexual animal (masculine and feminine characteristics are found in both sexes); the
    shadow archetype consists of the animal instincts that human beings inherited in their
    evolution from lower forms of their lives; and finally the self, according to Jung, means
    the total personality or the mid-point of personality, around which all of the other
    psychological elements of a person are constellated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jung&#146;s effort, the author feels, is to show the limit
    of Freud&#146;s theory of personality, but the personality theory built by him, as
    mentioned above, is also limited. It can only introduce to us the subjective and objective
    influences put on the human beings&#146; mind, but cannot say what human personality
    really is. So it cannot be considered either as an ideal personality theory or a pattern
    of education. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Alfred Adler&#146;s theory (1870 - 1937)</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Alfred Adler, born in Vienna in 1870 and died in Aberdeen,
    Scotland in 1937, was a psychiatrist, a member of the Vienna psychoanalytic Society and
    later its president. He followed Freudian Psychoanalysis then terminated his connection
    with it and formed his own group called Individual Psychology. He published over a hundred
    books, among them &quot;The Practice and Theory of Indvidual Psychology&quot; may be the
    best introduction to Adler&#146;s theory of personality. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Calvin S.Hall and Gardner Lindzey appraised that :</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; In sharp contrast to Frend&#146;s major
      assumption that human behavior is motivated by inborn instincts, Jung&#146;s principal
      axiom that human conduct is governed by inborn archetypes, Adler assumed that human beings
      are motivated primarily by social urges. Human are, according to Adler, inherently social
      beings. They relate themselves to other people, engage in cooperative social activities,
      place social welfare above selfish interest, and acquire a style of life that is
      predominantly social in orientation...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Freud emphasized sex, Jung emphasized primordial thought
      pattern, and Adler stressed social interest. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Adler&#146;s second major contribution to personality
      theory is his concept of creative self... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">A third feature of Adler&#146;s psychology that sets it
      apart from classical psychoanalysis is its emphasis upon the uniqueness of personality... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, Adler considered consciousness to be the center
      of personality, which makes him a pioneer in the development of an ego- oriented
      psychology&quot;...</i> (10) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most interesting discovery of Adler&#146;s theory of
    personality is the emphasis upon social interest, creative self and consciousness as the
    center of personality. This discovery can give a significant contribution to the sphere of
    personality theories. However, in the light of Dependent Origination as the truth of life,
    consciousness is but theresult of the operation of Ignorance (avijja) and Activities
    (Sankhaàra) elements, but not the center of personality. Somehow his theory needs to be
    adjusted as well as Freud&#146;s and Jung&#146;s. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Erich Fromn&#146;s theory (1900 - ...) </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He was born in Frankfurt, Germany in 1900. He got Ph.D.
    degree from the university of Heidenberg in 1922; then came to the United States of
    America in 1933 and taught at Chicago Psychoanalytic Institute as a lecturer. He also
    taught at a number of Universities in the U.S.A. and Mexico. His essential points of view,
    as Calvin S.Hall and Gardner Lindzey pointed out, are as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">-&quot; Any form of society that humans have fashioned
      whether it be that of Feudalism, Capitalism, Fascism, Socialism or Communism represents an
      attempt to resolve the basic contradiction of humans. This contradiction consists of a
      person being both an animal and human being. As an animal, one has certain physiological
      needs that must be satisfied. As a human being, one possesses self - awareness, reason and
      imagination. Experiences that are uniquely human are feelings of tenderness, love and
      compassion, attitudes of interest, responsibility, indentity, integrity, vulnerability,
      transcendence and freedom, and values and norms&quot;. (11)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">-&quot; One&#146;s personality develops in accordance
      with the opportunities that a particular society offers one&quot;.</i> (12)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, Erich Fromn&#146;s regard to men in a society is very
    practical and rather open. His theory just synthesizes the attitudes and ways of life of
    men that he believes they can exist in an individual. The first attitude and way of life
    to respond to physiological needs and desires requires food, water, physical comfort and
    sex and some other things relating to them, such as money, attention, affection and
    success (or good grades). The second attitude and way of life manifesting the qualities of
    a human being responds to mental requirements as the above quotation mentions. Those
    things belong to what is called Name - and - Form (Nàma - Ruøpa) following the operation
    of Ignorance (avijjaà) leading to sufferings and troubles only. Fromn cannot make any
    further steps in opening a way to true man and happiness in the here - and - now. As many
    other theorists, he really fell into troubles of individual and social problems. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Skinner&#146;s theory (1904 - ...) </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He really was a very well - known behaviorist who refused
    the existence of unconscious impulses, archetypes, traits as the presumed existence of
    internal factors determining a man&#146;s behavior, as he wrote: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; I defined theory as an effort to explain
      behavior in term of something going on in another universe, such as the mind or the
      nervous system. Theories of that sort I do not believe are essential or helpful. Besides,
      they are dangerous, they cause all kinds of trouble. But I look forward to an over all
      theory of human behavior which will bring together a lot of facts and express them in a
      more general way. That kind of theory I would be very much interested in promoting, and I
      consider myself to be a theoritician (Evans, 1968, p.88)&quot;.</i> (13) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He continues: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">-&quot;We do not need to try to discover what
      personalities, states of mind, feelings, traits of character, plans, purposes, intentions,
      or the other prerequisites of autonomous man really are in order to get on with a
      scientific analysis of behavior (Skinner, 1971, pp.12 - 13.&quot; </i>(14) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-&quot; In a behavioral analysis, a person is an
      organism... which has acquired a repertoire of behavior... [He] is not an originating
      agent; he is a locus, a point at which many genetic and environmental conditions come
      together in a joint effect (Skinner, 1974, pp. 167 - 168)&quot;. (15) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    </i><p><font face="Times New Roman">So, Skinner theory regards &quot;personality&quot; as
    nothing but a group of behavior patterns which are characteristics of an individual, and
    regards an individual behavior as a product of prior reinforcements: we do what we have
    been reinforced to do. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such is a very pratical contribution of Skinner to the
    branch of educational psychology in understanding human beings&#146; behaviours and such
    is the limit of his theory in realizing what a man really is, because a man&#146;s
    behaviours are far different from a man himself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a behaviorist, B.F. Skinner cannot do any otherbetter
    thing to help men recognize themselves, the real causes of troubles and the way to enter
    into mental peace and happiness in the here - and - now. All behaviorist theories are
    based on the philosophical point of view of Scientific Realism governed by self - thought
    and the limit of the six sense - organs of men, as what the writer can take out of the
    U.S. Educational Psychology. In this branch of study, on the other hand, all humanist
    theories of personality are based on the philosophical point of view of Existentialism and
    Phenomenology which sounds much better, but they cannot either say the truth of man, life
    and the way to happiness. Let&#146;s continue examining the latter. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Maslow&#146;s theory (1908 - ...) </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Abraham Harold Maslow was born in Brooklyn, New York, in
    1908. His parents were uneducated Jewish who had emigrated from Russia with their seven
    children, Maslow is the eldest. Maslow wrote: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With my childhood, it&#146;s a wonder I am not
      psychotic.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">I was a little Jewish boy in the non - jewish
      neighborhood. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was a little like being the first Negro enrolled in the
      all-white school. I was isolated and unhappy. I grew up in libraries and among books,
      without friends&quot; (Hall, 1968, p.37). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">There was some bitterness and animosity in the
      relationship between Maslow and his mother, while his father was considered a man who
      &quot;love whisky, women and fighting&quot; (wilson, 1972, p.131)&quot; </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He studied psychology at Wisconsin University, obtained
    B.A. degree in 1930, his M.A. in 1931 and his Ph.D. in 1934. Maslow also worte: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Life didn&#146;t really start for me until I got
      married and went to Wisconsin&quot; (Hall, 1968, p.37) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the book titled &quot;Personality Theories&quot;, Larry
    A. Hjelle and Daniel J. Ziegler wrote about Maslow that: </font></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; After receiving his Ph.D., Maslow returned to New
      York to work with the famous learning theorist E.L. Thorndike at Columbia University. He
      then moved to New York during this period... It was here that he personally encountered
      the cream of European intellectuals who were forced to flee from Hitler. Erich Fromn,
      Alfred Adler, Karen Horney, Ruth Benedict, Max Wertheimer, ... were a few of those whom
      Maslow sought out to enhance his understanding of Human behavior. The informal
      conversations and challenging experiences afforded by such distinguished scholars helped
      shape the intellectual foundations for Maslow&#146;s later humanistic views.&quot; (16)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    </i><p><font face="Times New Roman">In the world of educational psychology, if Skinner was
    known as one of the best - known behaviorist theorists of personality, Maslow was
    considered as one of the best known humanist theorists of personality whose point of view
    is based on the philosophical course of Existentialismand Phenomenology, as mentioned
    above, generally expressed as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; ...Existentialists stress the idea that
      ultimately each of us is responsible for who we are and what we become. As Sartre put it,
      &quot;Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself&quot;. Such is the first principle
      of Existentialism.&quot; (17) </font></p>
      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <i><p></i><font face="Times New Roman">And: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; The most important concept that humanistic
      psychologists have extracted from Existentialism is that of becoming. A person is never
      static; he is always in the process of becoming a new person&quot;. (18) </font></p>
      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Humanistic psychologists recognize the quest for
      a meaningful and fulfilling life is not an easy one. This is especially true in an age of
      profound cultural change and conflict, where traditional beliefs and values no longer
      provide adequate guidelines for the good life or for finding meaning in human existence.
      Finally, existentialists assert that the only &quot;reality&quot; anyone ever knows is
      subjective or personal, not objective. This outlook may be designated in a shorthand way
      as the phenomeno - logical or &quot;here - and - now&quot; perspective&quot;. </i>(19) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Hjelle&#146;s and Ziegler&#146;s regard to
    Maslow&#146;s point of view written in their book mentioned above (p.461), Maslow&#146;s
    belief is that a human being is fundamentally free and responsible in choosing a way of
    life to lead. His freedom helps him decide how and what to be. Maslow&#146;sview is
    therefore really optimistic, he did conclude that a self - actualizing person, who appears
    as a good pattern for education, manifests the following characteristics: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) More efficient perception of reality. ... <br>
      (2) Acceptance of self, others and nature. ... <br>
      (3) Spontaneity, simplicity and naturalness. ... <br>
      (4) Problem-centered. ... <br>
      (5) Detachment: need for privacy. ... <br>
      (6) Autonomy : independence of culture and environment. <br>
      (7) Continued freshness of appreciation. ... <br>
      (8) Peak or mystic experiences. ... <br>
      (9) Social interest. <br>
      (10) Profound interpersonal relations. ... <br>
      (11) Democratic character structure. ... <br>
      (12) Discrimination between means and ends.... <br>
      (13) Philosophical sense humor. ... <br>
      (14) Creativeness. <br>
      (15) Resistance to enculturation. ... (20) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Human nature or personality, according to Maslow&#146;s
    point of view, seems to be very human, existential and positive, but in fact it is just a
    concept of what is compounded by a couple of characteristics as conditions of mental
    development. It is not a man himself. Maslow cannot show the subject creating the above
    characteristics and the root cause of man&#146;s troubles and sufferings, how can an
    individual train himself for those characteristics? How can he deal with troubles ? There
    seems to exist something like fog in his theory ? In his thought ? </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Carl Ransom Rogers&#146; theory (1902 - 1987) </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Carl Ransom Rogers was born in Oak Park (a Chicago
    suburb), Illinois, in 1902. He was the fourth of six children of a family of financial
    success and happiness. In high school, he had no close friends outside his family and
    spent much of his time on reading books - any book he could find, even dictionary or
    encyclopedia. He received straight &quot;A&quot; grades in almost all his courses he
    attended. He obtained his B.A. degree in History in 1924, at Wisconsin University, then
    got married and found such happy life with his wife and lover, Helen Elliot Rogers wrote,
    &quot;I made friends, found new ideas, and fell thoroughly in love with the whole
    experience&quot; (1967, p.353)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rogers followed educational psychology courses and got his
    M.A. degree in 1928, then Ph.D. in Clinical psychology in 1931. He accepted a position as
    staff psychologist at Child Study Department in Rochester, New York, then was offered a
    Faculty appointment with the rank of full professor in the Psychology Department at Ohio
    State University in 1939. He published his book entitled &quot;The Clinical Treatment of
    the Problem Child&quot; also in 1939, his &quot;Counseling and Psychotherapy&quot; in
    1942; took a position as Professor of Psychology and Director of the University Counseling
    Center at the University of Chicago. Here, from 1945 to 1957, he completed his major work,
    &quot;Client - Centered - Therapy: Its Current Practice, Implications and Theory&quot;.
    (1951). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1957, Rogers returned to the University of Wisconsin
    and worked there in the Department of Psychology and Psychiatry. In 1964, he worked in
    Western Behavioral Sciences Institute (WBSI) in Lajolla, California. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1969, he left WBSI for working in the Center of Studies
    of Person, in Lajolla, Calif. until he died in 1987 by a heart attack. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During his lifetime Rogers received many awards: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">* In 1946, he was selected as the President of the
    American Psychological Association (APA) and was awarded the APA&#146;s First
    Distinguished Professional Contribution Award. In this occasion he gave an address, in
    which he said: &quot;I expressed an idea whose time had come, as though a pebbe was
    dropped in water and spread ripples. The idea was that the individual has vast resources
    within himself for altering his life and these resources can be mobilized given the proper
    climate&quot; (1937, p.4.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rogers published a couple of books. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">* Psychotherapy and Personality Change (1954). <br>
      * On Becoming a Person (1961). <br>
      * Person to Person: The Problem of Being Human (1967). <br>
      * Freedom to Learn: A View of what Education Might Become (1969). <br>
      * Carl Rogers on Encounter Groups (1970). <br>
      * Carl Rogers on Personal Power (1977). <br>
      * A Way of Being (1980). <br>
      * Freedom to Learn For the 80s (1983). </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As Hjelle and Ziegler (Ibid. pp. 488 - 489) appraised,
    Carl Ransom Rogers may be the best known Psychologist and Psychotherapist of the time from
    1950 to 1983. Let&#146;s follow his thoughts on human nature or personality: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">* &quot;Each person construes reality in accordance
      with his private world of experience, and this experiential world can be completely known
      only to the person&quot;. (21)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">*&quot;This expression of Rogers reflects the
      philosophical point of view of Phenomenology which holds, &quot;what is real to an
      individual is that which exists within that person&#146;s internal frame of reference, or
      subjective world, including everything in his awareness at any point of time. It follows
      that subjective perceptions and experiences not only constitute the person&#146;s private
      reality but also form the basis for his actions&quot;&quot;.</i> (22) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; For the most part, Rogers rejected Freud&#146;s
      position that historical aspects or derivatives of behavior are the primary factors
      underlying personality. Behavior is not determined by something that occurred in the past.
      Instead, Rogers emphasizes the need to understand the person&#146;s relationship to the
      environment as he now exists and perceives it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is our present interpretation of past experiences
      rather than their factual existence that influences our current behaviour&quot;.</i> (23) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above quotations proves that for Rogers, a human being
    can perceive reality through the limit of what he is, and only that reality is real to
    him. It is his subjective perceptions and experiences constructing that reality and the
    basis of his actions. Such is the world (or experiential world) and such is personality! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His point of view, on the one hand, manifests the regard
    to things of Phenomenology and Humanism which sounds very human and very impressive, on
    the other hand, indirectly recognizes the limit of that regard which is governed by the
    wrongness of man&#146;s subjective perceptions and experiences. Rogers accepts those
    perceptions and experiences as truth of life, while in reality, under the light of
    Dependent Origination, they are false and only lead human beings to sufferings. This is a
    big gap of his theory of personality. However, in the meaning of helping individuals
    reduce troubles caused by their negative regards or attitudes of life, it remains rather
    interesting when Rogers suggested a pattern of &quot;a fully functioning person&quot; in
    1980 which requires a person to follow the following factors: (24) </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) Openness to experience: &quot;To be open to
      experience is the polar opposite of defensiveness. People who are completely open to
      experience are able to listen to themselves, ..., are acutely aware of their own deepest
      thoughts and feelings...&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2)Existential living: &quot;This is the tendency to live
      fully and richly in each moment of existence as it comes. By doing so, each experience in
      the person&#146;s life is perceived as fresh and unique...&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3)Organismic trusting: &quot;Organismic trusting thus
      signifies the person&#146;s ability to consult and abide by his (or her) inner feelings as
      the major basis for making choices&quot;. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(4)Existential freedom: &quot;Existential freedom thus
      refers to the inner feeling that &quot;I am solely responsible for my own actions and
      their consequences&quot;&quot;. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(5) Creativity: &quot;For Rogers, the person who is
      involved in &quot;the good life&quot; would be the type from whom creative products
      (ideas, projects, actions) and creative living would emerge. Creative people also tend to
      live constructively and adaptively in their culture while at the same time satisfying
      their own deepest needs. They would be able, creatively to flexibly adapt to changing
      environmental conditions.&quot; </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the first attitude of life, &quot;openness to
    experience&quot;, to the author, means it always is open but not stops at or grasps
    anything. This attitude can expect an experience of emptiness of things which is the
    highest experience of thought and feeling. It needs only the right way to go, as the way
    Lord Buddha taught, that Rogers couldn&#146;t imagine.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the second attitude of life, &quot;Existential
    living&quot;, it can help a person get out of troubles caused by histhought of past and
    future, and concentrate his thought on the very present moment which is always new, fresh
    and unique. But his experience of this truth exists only when he can control completely
    his wrong thoughts and desires. Rogers couldn&#146;t show the way to do as Lord Buddha did
    introduce the Eightfold Noble Path or the Four Noble Truths to human beings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the third one, &quot;Organismic trusting&quot;, it
    means a person should make a choice for his course of actions on the basic of what he
    feels right, but not on any external source of influence or any judgment of others. This
    is a good sense. But there are various thoughts, feelings and desires arising in him, at
    first he should make a choice among them before he could make a choice for the course of
    action. What is the standard for the rightness to follow? What is the subject of making a
    choice ? - Rogers did not and could not mention these things, so his theory needs to be
    completed as well as possible. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the fourth one, it means self - responsibility. This
    is necessary for any good way of life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the last factor, it sounds truly creative, wise and
    human. It works mainly for the deepest needs of a person. But which are the deepest needs
    leading to true happiness for a person in the here - and - now ? Rogers&#146; theory lacks
    this point which will be clarified by Lord Buddha&#146;s teaching the writer will
    introduce in the Part Four of this work. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short, Rogers&#146; ideas on human nature, on his way
    of &quot;client - centered therapy&quot; and on a &quot;fully - functioningperson&quot;
    are very interesting. They could help the people in education open a course of education
    for good educational spirit for the development of individuals. But the soul of that
    course of education must be looked for in the doctrine of Dependent Origination
    (Paticcasamuppàda) and the Five Aggregates (Pàncakkhandha).</font></p>
