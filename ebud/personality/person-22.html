    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The problems often discussed in a culture are the outlook
    on life and universe, individual questions, environment and values. These problems play
    their role in determining the course of development of culture. They are going to be
    reviewed in this chapter in the light of Dependent Origination. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">II.2.1: THE OUTLOOK ON LIFE AND
    UNIVERSE </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Examining the origin or nature of life and universe is the
    main task of the sphere of metaphysics. This problem has a very important position in
    philosophy. It was examined from the dawn of Egyptian, Indian and Chinese thought. This is
    the searching for the essence of existing things relating to the problem of eternity and
    non - eternity, self and non - self, reality and annihilation, creator and creations, etc.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha Gotama, who Himself realized the Noble Truth,
    considered all metaphysical questions empty. He often kept silent and gave no answers to
    such metaphysical questions, because for Him, those questions do not realistically relate
    to the purpose a monk should aim at - that is the final freedom. This experimental
    attitude of His mind is mentioned in many discourses of the Pancanikàya. However, on the
    author&#146;s way to study universe and human beings, some philosophical problems relating
    to spirituality and materiality are necessary tobe discussed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When a man is examining universe, he is with it in the
    here - and- now. How can he know what the universe really is when he cannot understand who
    he really is? So, the practical thing for him is turning back to himself and seeing where
    and who he is so that he can come to the destruction of all hindrances to the truth of
    things. In doing this, he is to follow a practical method of phenomenology, and
    experimental method of mind by Lord Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For materiality, Lord Buddha declared that the material
    world is formed by the Four Great Elements as many Indian thinkers before Him did: they
    are Earth element, Water element, Fire element and Air element. These elements are dynamic
    and impermanent, so all existing things compounded by them must be impermanent. The
    question about the originof them is unacceptable to the truth of Dependent Origination as
    discovered by Lord Buddha; it becomes senseless. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Dependent Origination, this pheno menal world
    is conditioned, selfless and empty; human beings are but the compound of the five
    aggregates (pancakkhandha) which are selfless and empty; both the world and men co -
    exist, but cannot separate from each other. This truth was proved again by Lord
    Buddha&#146;s teaching recorded in the discourse of Mahàpunnama (Majjhimanikàya,Vol.III)
    and of Dhàtuvibhanga (Majjhimanikàya, Vol. III): Form aggregate among the five
    aggregates compounding a manincludes an inside part which is his physical body, and an
    outside part which is the physical world; this means the universe itself is a part of a
    man&#146;s body. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since men&#146;s thought is limited by self - thought and
    by the limit of men&#146;s sense organs, it cannot set its feet on the true world of
    things, so people may ask: does this universe exist as what human beings perceive? or,
    does it exist independently from what human beings perceive? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In response to the above questions, the realists claim the
    universe appears exactly as what human beings perceive; the Western idealists supposed men
    can know only the world perceived by their sense organs, but can never know the world
    itself, as Platon did; Immanuel Kant is a rationalist but he accepted that idealist point
    of view. Although there are various regards to things, Western philosophers and educators
    believe that there is an objective world independent from human beings that can never be
    known. This means to the author the root difference between Lord Buddha&#146;s teaching
    and other schools of thought, and gives him a hope to find solutions for the crises caused
    by the self - thought way. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, in the discourse of Pàtigamiya (Khuddakanikàya),
    Lord Buddha Gotama mentioned the unconditioned world (asankhàra) as the world existing
    out of the sphere of going and coming, birth and death etc., and declared that is the
    world of the destruction of suffering, or of attachment to things. This proves that the
    world people see and know is that of attachment or of inversions (mental, perceptual,
    emotional inversion andinversion of view) which is derived from ignorance (avijjà). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The true world is therefore this phenomenal world without
    men&#146;s attachment to things. Lord Buddha affirmed: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; And, I, Bhaggava, who teach this and declare
      this, am wrongly, vainly, lyingly, and falsely accused by some ascetics and Brahmins who
      say: The ascetic Gotama is on wrong track, and so are His monks. He has declared that
      whoever has attained to the stage of deliverance called &quot;the Beautiful&quot; finds
      everything repulsive&quot;. But I do not say this. What I say is that whenever anyone has
      attained to the stage of deliverance called the Beautiful he finds that it is
      beautiful&quot;. (1) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Evam - vàdim kho mam Bhaggava evam akkhàyim eke
      Samana- Bràhmanà asatà tucchà musà abhutena abbhàcikkhanti: Viparito Samano Gotamo,
      bhikkhavo, ca. Samano Gotamo evam àha: -Yasmim samaye subham vimokham upasampajja
      viharati, sabbam tasmim samaye asubhan t&#146;eva sanjànàtiìti&quot;. Na kho panàham
      Bhaggava evam vadàmi: &quot;Yasmim samaye subbam vimokham upasampajja viharati, sabbam
      tasmim samaye asubhan t&#146;eva sanjànàtiìti. Evanca kho aham Bhaggava vadàmi: Yasmim
      samaye subbham vimokham upasampajja viharati, subhan t&#146;eva tasmim samaye
      sanjànàtiìti&quot;.) (2) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above teaching also reveals Lord
    Buddha&#146;seducational point of view which is: educating men means helping them culivate
    their mind for the deliverance from all troubles and defilements. When their mind is pure,
    they will immediately see the purity of the world (or the true world): Happiness and truth
    appear at the same time to them. It is not training them according to any theory of
    personality, or any pattern of education. It is not either the searching for the origin of
    life or universe. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then another question may be asked: spirituality comes
    after materiality, or materiality comes after spirituality? - This is a problem of
    philosophy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As mentioned before, man&#146;s thinking operates on the
    basis of self - concept. Without self - concept, it cannot function. It is self - concept
    which makes up the concept of order of things, then the concept of &quot;before&quot;,
    &quot;after&quot; or &quot;the first cause&quot;. Reality itself has nothing to do with
    that self - concept. It always says that materiality or spirituality is conditioned as the
    doctrine of Dependent Origination does. If form aggregate cannot separate from other
    aggregates, materiality cannot either separate from spirituality: both co - exist.
    However, because of the emphasis of cultivating man&#146;s mind, Lord Buddha declared: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; All that we are is the result of what we have
      thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or
      acts with an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that
      draws the carriage&quot;. (3) Dhp.1. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot; Manopubbangamà dhammà manosetthà manomayà </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Manasà ce padutthena bhàsati và karoti và </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tato nam dukkhamanveti cakkam va vahato padam&quot;.) (4) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-&quot; All that we are is the result of what we have
      thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or
      acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him like shadow that never leaves
      him&quot;.(5) Dhp.2. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot; Manopubbangamà dhammà manosetthà manomayà </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Manasà ce pasannena bhàsati và karoti và </font></p>
      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">Tato nam sukhamanveti chàyà va anapàyini&quot;.) (6)
      </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Men should be sure that thought (or mind) mentioned in the
    above teachings is conditioned, even the Tibhava, or three Worlds, they are conditioned;
    and all conditioned things, as materiality and spirituality, are selfless and therefore
    empty. Only problem of suffering of man and its cessation, but not speculations, was
    considered seriously by Lord Buddha on His way of teaching. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Knowledge is another important matter to be reviewed. It
    relates to existing things and is so close to a man that he considers it something of his
    self. What is it? A knowledge of the outer world is but a synthesis of the sources of
    information given by sense - organs. But sense - organs are not believable information
    givers. For example, when a man puts his left hand in a basin of cold water, his right
    hand in a basin of pretty hot water; then right after that he puts both hands in a basin
    of warm water; his hands do not give him the same feeling. This is an error. It is the
    same for other sense organs. The above synthesis is done by the man&#146;s thinking based
    on self -thought, so it is something of ignorance. Therefore, knowledge must not belong to
    the true self of the man, or to the true world. In the light of Dependent Origination, it
    leads men just to suffering; it really is not what human beings are expecting. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A system of education, which as almost all systems of
    education of today world only offers men knowledges, will not bring happiness to them. It
    should be adjusted as early as possible. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to the above clarification, the doctrine of
    Dependent Origination, to the author&#146;s knowledge, can suggest new regards to the
    problems of individuals, society and environment that will be studied next. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">II.2.2. DEPENDENT ORIGINATION AND
    INDIVIDUAL PROBLEMS </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The big problems of a modern society with which leaders,
    educators and thinkers are concerned are individuals, individuals and society, history and
    environment, because these things have a very close relationship to individual happiness
    and survival; they seem to exist as a part of human existence, therefore they deserve to
    be observed under the light of truth- Dependent Origination. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Individuals and happiness: </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is very evident that everybody is born to be happybut
    not suffering, to serve his practical purpose of happiness but not any other purpose that
    does not relate intimately to it. It is also very evident that one is searching for truth
    of life because of his peace of mind in the here and now. So, the main object of education
    and culture must be individuals, and the root aim of education and culture must be
    happiness of individuals. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the very old days, human beings gathered together in
    groups called tribes for their survival for the improvement of their life, and for the
    coping suitably with weather, environmental conditions and nature. It is these things
    which made up what is called society, culture and civilization. Since life stream was
    flowing from change to change, human beings&#146; efforts to build up their happiness and
    society must have changed from generation to generation accordingly. Then individuals came
    to work for two inseparable purposes: one for individuals, one for their group or society.
    When these two purposes did not work, individual problems arose and needed solutions.
    However, people&#146;s regards to individuals, society and happiness are different from
    each other. This made the problems become more and more complicated, and the searching for
    solutions became the reason for religions and schools of thought to come into existence
    and to be developed. Let us follow the typical regards to them from great spheres of
    culture all over the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">P.T. Raju, in the work titled &quot;The concept of
    Man&quot; edited by him and S.Radhakrishnan, gave the following comments: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For Greek thoughts : </font></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The pre - sophist philosophies did not say much
      about man&#146;s relation to society... The sophists were more individualistic, being
      mainly devoted to training leaders of men who would influence society and use it as means
      to their own ends... Each man was the measure of things for himself, not only of things
      cognized but also of good and evil in society. But Plato and Socrates were opposed to this
      radical individualism and relativism of the sophists. Man, the measure of things, is not
      to be the particular man, but the universal man. The structure of society and the
      structure of man&#146;s soul reflect each other, and are interdependent. The essence of
      man is rearon and is found in a rationally ordered society. The modern idea that the
      individual cannot be studied apart from society and that the personality of man is formed
      by society and grows in society, is not strong in Greek thought... </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Socrates and Platon showed that society is a projection of
      human nature on a vast canvas or is a much enlarged reflection, of human nature. Man
      cannot live without society and can have full life only within it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">...Aristotle, a rationalist accepted main principles of
      Platon. Man cannot be man without society.. (7) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For Chinese thoughts: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In Chinese thought, man&#146;s concern for man is
      thestrongest and is considered to be self - sufficient... and how to have the best kind of
      state and society in which man can be virtuous is an ever - recurring question in the
      history of Chinese philosophy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Study human relationships in order to organize the
      state well is Confucian advice... When Mencius says that the universe, which is the
      universe of human relationships, is to be found within mind, he meant that this universe
      can be found within man and is not to be derived from any reality outside man. Hsun Tzu
      different from Mencius and said that man is essentially selfish and evil and therefore
      needs education and culture in order to become good... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">... Man is essentially a social creature and can live a
      virtuous life only in a society of men, whether God exists or not. (8) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For Indian thoughts, they seem to be the most interesting
    of the world as mentioned in (I.2.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For Marxist thought, P.T. Raju estimated: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Marxist philosophy proceeds from the thesis that
      the individual is a social creature... Marx and Engels considered that the individual and
      the social life of a person are not different things, even though they have different
      forms of expression... &quot;Man can settle only in society&quot;, Marx wrote, &quot;Only
      in society can his individuality be revealed in accordance with the social
      conditions&quot;. (9) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the author&#146;s opinion, Greek thoughts belong to
    dualism supposing that every existing has its own nature, regardless of the point of view
    considering individual and society interdependent or not. So, they must belong to the
    operation of ignorance (avijja) which actually leads to suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Chinese thoughts emphasize individuals as virtuous men
    living in the order of a society well - organized. They are but the production of self -
    thought, not of reality itself. These thoughts must bring troubles to individuals as
    people could see in the history of China: many tragical contradictions among human
    relationships happened. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Generally, to human beings&#146; point of views, Lord
    Buddha Gotama gave the following estimate: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; When those ascetics and Brahmins who are
      speculators about the past (the future and present), having fixed views about the past
      (the future and present), put forward views in sixty two different ways, that is merely
      the feeling of those who do not know and see, the worry and vascillation of those immersed
      in craving&quot;. (10) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Tatra, bhikkhave, ye te samanabràhmanà
      pubbantakappikà ca pubbantakappikà ca aparanta kappikà ca pubbantàparantà-

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With His perfection of wisdom, Lord Buddha did know and
    see the truth of this Universe, then explained the formation of this earth and human
    beings&#146; society that may be summarized as below: (12) </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- At the time of the contraction of this world, beings
      were mostly born in the Àbhassara Brahmà world. There they dwell, mind - made, feeding
      on delight, self - luminous, moving through the air, glorious... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- At the time of the expansion of this world, the beings
      having passed away from Àbhassara Brahmà world were mostly reborn in this world. Here
      they dwell, mind - made, feeding on delight, self - luminous, moving through the air,
      glorious... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- At that period expansion, there was just one mass of
      water; all was darkness...; night and day were not distinguished, beings being reckoned
      just as beings, no male and female were discriminated... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Then earth appeared as a skin that forms over water with
      the colour of fine ghee or butter and was very sweet like wild honey. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Then some beings of greedy nature tasted earth, attached
      the flavour; craving began to arise in them. They became more greedy, and earth became
      stuffy; they became coarser and coarser. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Among those beings, those with less greedy nature became
      more good - looking, others became ugly. The good - looking dispised the ugly; this made
      the good flavourof earth disappear. Then, a fungus cropped up, in the manner of a mushroom
      with good colour, smell and taste. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Then, beings&#146; craving increased more and more,
      earth became worse and worse, and beings became coarser and coarser. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- The rice appeared in open spaces, free from powder and
      from husks, fragrant and clean - grained. What beings had taken in the evening for supper
      had grown again and was ripe in the morning, and what they had taken in the morning for
      breakfast was ripe again by evening. At this time, beings became coarser; females
      developed female sex - organs, and males developed male - organs; passion was aroused and
      their bodies burnt with lust; then sexual intercourse appeared. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- At first times, beings cursed and swore at those who
      were making love, and threw dust and ashes at them; and did not allow them to live with
      others in villages, towns two months. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Beings became more and more lazy and wanted to gather
      rice as much as possible and keep rice in their own places for personal use..., then rice
      fields appeared... sexual life was openly acceptable. Beings started building houses to
      cover sexual activities. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Then some beings stole rice of others: stealing and
      lying appeared. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Then beings chose the best looking man and asked him to
      be the one as a lawyer or a referee to try the cases of stealing rice. This person
      received a share of rice from them; he did not have to work for rice. Thiswas the start of
      the social class of Khattiya. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Some beings kept away from a sexual life, lived in
      separate places in leaf - huts in forest, and practised meditation. They were called
      Brahmins. Some of them could not meditate in lonely places and turned to towns or villages
      to compile books; they were also considered as Brahmins. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Other beings adopted various trades and were called
      Vessas. Those who went to forests for hunting were named Suddas. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, right after this Earth was formed, the first beings
    from Àbhassara heaven appeared without need for food. Then the sweet taste of earth and
    rice attracted them and made desire for things arise and grow up in them. After that, sex
    organs appeared together with desire for sexuality. When their desire grew up, social
    needs existed requiring social organization: human society was formed then, and social
    classes came into existence according to beings&#146; conduct: society was for the
    response to the individuals&#146; requirements only. This is the first and last role of
    society. This is the reason why Lord Buddha concerned only about suffering of individuals
    in this life, and their deeds for their happiness. He therefore taught: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; One does not become an outcast by birth, one
      does not become a brahmin by birth. It is by deed that one becomes an outcast, it is by
      deed that one becomes a brahmin. (13) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Na jaccà vasalo hoti, na jaccà hoti bràhmano,
      Kammanà vasalo hoti, kammuna hoti bràhmano&quot;.) (14) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>

    individuals. In those conditions of life, individuals feel so strange to themselves that
    they are surprisingly asking about their origin while they actually are there, and the

    than accepting the fateful suffering as they are, if its course of operation is not

    grave pollution of environment which may cause disaster on Earth. There must be something

    time that the author is going to mention in (II.2.3.). In his opinion, without
    understanding the close relationship between man and nature, people cannot understand what
    a man really is; without protecting environment from pollution as protecting men&#146;s

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is environment? What is pollution of environment? Let
    us start examining it now. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Environment is a new term of nature. A new study branch on
    environment of the modern time is called ecology. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Some concepts of ecology: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ecology is relatively a new science dealing withvarious
    principles which govern the relationships between organisms and their environment.
    American ecologist Frederick Clements (1916) considered ecology to be &quot;the science of
    the community&quot;; British ecologist Charles Elton (1927) defined ecology as
    &quot;scientific natural history&quot; concerned with the &quot;sociology and economics of
    animals&quot;; Woodbury (1954) treated ecology as &quot;a science which investigates
    organisms in relation to their environment, and a philosophy in which the world of life is
    interpreted in terms of natural processes&quot;. Krebs (1972) defined it as &quot;the
    scientific approach to the study of environmental interactions which control the welfare
    of living things, regulating their distribution, abundance, reproduction and
    evolution&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">P.D. Sharma (F.N.I.E.) (Department of Botany, Univ. of
    Delhi) wrote in his book titled &quot;Ecology and Environment&quot; that: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; These days ecology has been contributing very
      much to socio- economic, political and other similar policies of the world. It is so
      common to find references of ecology in socio - economic writings, magazines, weekly and
      daily newspapers... Ecology indeed plays an important role in human welfare. This is
      primarily a field subject and modern ecology which is concerned with the functional
      interdependencies between living things and their environment&quot;. (17) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">P.D. Sharma introduced many basic concepts of ecology, in
    this part the author only quotes sometypical ones: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">*&quot;All living organisms and their environment are
      mutually reactive, affecting each other in various ways. Animal population, flora, and
      vegetation are interdependent through the environment and are mutually reactive&quot;.
      (18) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">*&quot;Environment, which is actually a complex of several
      inter-related factors and is much dynamic (i.e. varying with time and space), works as a
      sieve selecting organisms for growth from so many forms, as its one or the other factor
      becomes critical at critical stages of the life cycle of the species&quot;. (19) </font></p>
      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <i><p></i><font face="Times New Roman">And: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>*&quot;It is not only environment which influences the
      life of organisms, but organisms too modify their environment as a result of their growth,
      dispersal, reproduction, death, decay etc. Thus, the environment is caused to change due
      to organisms&#146; activities. The dynamic environment and organisms make ways for the
      development of different kinds of organisms through a process known as succession. The
      process continues till the development of a community which is now able to keep itself
      adjusted in equilibrium with the environment. This final stage of community is called
      climax&quot;. (20) </i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above three quotations prove that there is a live
    relationship between men and environment which iscontinuous, inseparabable and natural.
    This very close relationship says that violating environment means violating
    individuals&#146; life as people could see from the current environmental crisis. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Environmental crisis: </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The current environmental crisis is enviromental
    pollutions: air, water, earth pollutions. These pollutions as recorded in books,
    magazines, etc., are caused by atomic tests, chemical arms tests, by poisonous gas emitted
    from engineering factories, and by the fast increase of world population, etc. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The term pollution is defined by the Environmental
    Pollution Panel of the President&#146;s Science Advisory Committee in its report:
    &quot;Restoring the Quality of Our Environment&quot;, held in November, 1965, as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Enviromental pollution is the unfavorable
      alteration of our surroundings, wholly or largely as a by - product of man&#146;s actions,
      through direct or indirect effects of changes in energy patterns, radiation levels,
      chemical and physical constitution and abundances of organisms. These changes may affect
      man directly, or through his supplies of water and of agricultural and other biological
      products, his physical objects or possessions, or his opportunities for recreation and
      appreciation of nature&quot;. (21) </font></i></p>

      of the layman, not surprisingly, has been captured by the atom bomb, although there is at

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For water and earth pollution, E.F. Schumacher added: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No international agreement has yet been reached
      on waste disposal. The conference of the International Atomic Energy Organization at

      objections raised by the majority of countries against the American and British practice
      of disposal into the ocean. &quot;High level&quot; wastes continue to be dumped into the
      sea, while quantities of so - called &quot;intermediate&quot; and &quot;low level&quot;
      wastes are discharged into rivers or directly into the ground. An AEC report observes
      laconically that the liquid wastes work their way slowly into ground, water, leaving all
      or part (sic !) of their radioactivity held either chemically or physically in the
      soil&quot;. (23) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the above quotations, it can be imagined how
    dangerous the current environmental pollution is, how threatened human beings life on
    earth is ! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This pollution must be an evident result of the modern
    scientific civilization with its fast and uncontrolled development of industries and
    economics. This civilization, in its turn, is the result of a very high development of
    self- thought, way of thinking and enjoying pleasures of men. So, the main causes of the
    great environmental crisis which is being warned are ignorance (avijjà) and craving
    (tanhà) of men. Here, it may be asked whether Lord Buddha&#146;s teaching on the truth of
    Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppàda) can give a solution to it? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As mentioned before, the element of Name - and - Form
    (Nàma - Ruùpa) of the Dependent Origination is considered as the five aggregates of
    human beings which were defined by Lord Buddha Gotama as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; And what, brethren, are the five factors? All
      body, brethren, be it past, future, or present, inward or outward, gross or subtle, low or
      lofty, far or near, that is called &quot;the body factor&quot;. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every feeling, every perception, all activities, ...,every
      consciousness, be it past, future or present, inward or outward, etc, that is called the
      &quot;Consciousness factor&quot;. (24) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Yam kinci, bhikkhave, ruùpam
      atìtànàgatapaccuppannam ajjhattam và bahiddhà và olàrikam và sukhumam và hìnam
      và paniìtam và yam dure santike và ayam vuccati ruùpakkhandho // Yà kàci vedanà //
      yà kàci sannà // pe // ...ayam vuccati vinnànakkhandho //&quot;.) (25) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Twenty six centuries ago Lord Buddha did give human beings
    a very interesting and extremely surprising definition: the body aggregate of a man
    includes his physical body and this whole physical world. This definition affirms that
    environment or nature really is the body, or a big part of the body, of a man; without it
    he cannot come into exsistence and survive. If nature or environment is gravely polluted,
    his physical body or life will immediately come to its ruin. So, if everybody understands
    the truth of Dependent Origination, or if allmeans of communication of men introduce this
    doctrine, he will voluntarily protect environment from pollution as he can, because this
    is the meaning of protection of his happiness and survival in this life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It may be said that the science of ecology and the danger
    of the enviromental pollution are offering human beings a vision that there is no limit of
    the physical body of a man: it cannot be limited to the extent of his own body, of his
    country or of any continent: this is the real meaning of selflessness of his body. It is
    similar for his other aggregates. Does this truth say the Buddha&#146;s doctrine of
    selflessness or Dependent Origination is the solution for the environmental crisis? - In
    the author&#146;s opinion, Dependent Origination may be the solution for various problems
    of men. Let&#146;s continue examining it. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">II.2.4. INDIVIDUALS AND HUMAN VALUES </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To men, living means living with knowledges and values of
    life. As people could understand, the role of education is imparting to men knowledges
    about spheres of learning, nature and human beings. These knowledges, their values and the
    value itself, in fact, are created by men&#146;s thinking which has been discussed about
    in philosophy as well as in education. What is men&#146;s thinking? What is the meaning of
    the current values of life? The answers to these questions are what the writer must reach
    in this part of his work. These are great philosophical problems. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mentioning philosophy, P.T. Raju wrote: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Philosophy, if it is true to itself, has to be
      aphilosophy of life, not of one part of life but of the whole. This life is the life of
      man. He wants a theory of life as a guide. Other creatures do not care for any such
      theory, the drives themselves of their nature are enough for them. The aim of philosophy
      to be a guide to life is tacitly recognized by thinkers like Russel, who, speaking of
      logical analysis, says at the end of his book, &quot;A History of Western
      Philosophy&quot;, that it also is meant to suggest and inspire a way of life&quot; (26) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Chandradhar Sharma supposed: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; The etymological of the word
      &quot;philosophy&quot; is &quot;love of learning&quot; (or love of knowledge). It
      signifies a natural and a necessary urge in human beings to know themselves and the world
      in which they &quot;live and move and have their being&quot; It is impossible for man to
      live without a philosophy... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Western philosophy has remained more or less true to the
      etymological meaning of &quot;philosophy&quot;, in being essentially an intellectual quest
      for truth. Indian has been, however, intensely spritual and has always emphasized the need
      of practical realization of truth...&quot; (27) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the above expressions suggest, the author also thinks
    that the common meaning of philosophy to be concerned much about is serving human beings
    and their happiness in life, and that the western way of thinking is different from the
    Eastern way: the former emphasizes knowledges about life, the latter concerns about
    therealization of the truth of life. This difference will be clarified if we examine
    men&#146;s way of thinking, in general, expressed by Aristotle, a Greek great philosopher,
    as the following: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For Aristotle, there are three basic principles for
    men&#146;s thinking: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Principle of identity: A thing called (A) must always
    be (A). If it changes from moment to moment, men&#146;s thinking cannot operate. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Principle of no-contradiction: A thing called (A) may
    be named (A) or(&lt;&gt;A), but not sometimes (A), sometimes ( &lt;&gt;A). If it is often
    changed, men&#146;s thinking cannot work. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Principle of excluded middle: A thing may be called (A)
    now, and (B) at another time, but not (A +B) - half is A and half is B-. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If it is (A + B), men&#146;s thinking can never function.
    (28) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those principles presuppose that every existing thing has
    a fixed nature, while in life it changes from moment to moment. This is a big gap between
    men&#146;s knowledges about life and life itself that can never be filled up. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the above way of thinking which puts value on all
    things. Having no root in reality, these values only make men confused in making any
    choice between conventional values and the real life, and only brings them tragedies. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having seen this wrong view and thought, Lord Buddha
    taught the doctrine of Dependent Originationshowing that men&#146;s thinking is Activities
    element (sankhàra), or Activities aggregate of the five aggregates of Name- and - Form
    element (Nàma - Rùpa), which is of the operation of Ignorance (avijja) leading to
    suffering. So the true values of things exist only in the operation of wisdom (vijjà or
    pannà) or men&#146;s regard of wisdom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the above thinking which forces men to search for
    the first cause of life and the nature of man (or personality) which never exist in life
    as well as the conventional values. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the author&#146;s opinion any search for personality or
    any search for the essence of things is but a utopia. This problem will be discussed much
    more in the next part. </font></p>
