    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="preface"></a><font color="#000080"><strong>PREFACE</strong></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is often understood as a religion or an ethical
    way of life for the Buddhists. Not so many articles consider it as a way of education.
    Even in a very well-known educational work entitled &quot;Theories of Personality&quot; by
    Calvin S. Hall and Gardner Lindzey, published in 1991, 3rd Edition, there is only one new
    chapter on &quot;Eastern Psychology&quot; discussing Abhidhamma, in sixteen pages, as an
    Eastern personality theory. In this research work, the author has made an attempt to
    present Lord Buddha's teachings recorded in the Pali Suttapitaka as a theory of
    personality on which a new course of education or culture may be based. The author began
    his work from the starting point of the current crises of human society, then came to Lord
    Buddha's concept of personality, then to the solutions for those crises. The author was
    aware of difficulties that he would come across during the period of proceeding with the
    work, but under the kind and interesting supervision and encouragement from his
    supervisor, Dr. Bhikshu Satyapala, he worked on the chosen topic, &quot;The Concept of
    Personality revealed through the Pancanikaya&quot;, with confidence, especially after the
    topic was admitted by The Board of Research Studies for the Humanities, Delhi University,
    through its meeting held on February 16, 1994. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The author has divided his research work into five parts: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Introduction of the topic. <br>
      2. Dependent Origination as the Noble Truth. <br>
      3. The Concept of Personality revealed through the Pancanikaya. <br>
      4. Five Aggregates and Individual problems. <br>
      5. Conclusion: A new course of education or culture, and solutions for the current crises.
      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The author does not mention a human being as an entity
    having a permanent nature, but as a conditioned existence or a process of becoming. In
    doing this, the author has a hope that this research work will present something
    interesting to the world of education. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the completion of this work, the author would like to
    express his sincere gratitude to Dr. K.T.S. Sarao, Head of the Department of Buddhist
    Studies, Delhi University, who gave him kind advice, to Dr. Reader, Bhikshu Satyapala who
    kindly supervised the whole work to its completion. He would also like to express his
    sincere gratitude to other Professors, Readers and Lecturers of the Department of Buddhist
    Studies. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He is also extremely grateful to the I.C.C.R. of the
    Indian Government for granting him a scholarship for M. Phil. and Ph.D. Studies, to
    Vietnamese Government for giving him permission to go to Delhi to pursue research in
    Buddhist Studies, and to Dr. Bhikkhu THICH MINH-CHAU, the Rector of the Vietnam Buddhist
    Research Institute, who always encouraged him to think of a Buddhist way of Education. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Last but not the least, the author does not fail to
    express here his gratitude to those whose works proved very useful source of reference for
    his Thesis. </font></p>
