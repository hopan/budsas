    <h2 align="center"><font color="#800000">Is Buddhism a
    Religion?</font></h2>
    <h3 align="center"><font color="#800000"><em>Dorothy Figen</em></font></h3>
    <hr width="25%">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This is a question which is often asked. It really depends
    upon how one defines religion. If it is thought of as a
    belief in a supreme being to whom one prays for redemption,
    security, favors or relief from suffering, then, <strong><i>no</i></strong>,
    Buddhism is not a religion. </p>
    <p>The Buddha himself never claimed divinity -- only
    clear-sightedness and purity of apprehension of truth through
    deepest intuition, leading to equanimity and enlightenment.
    He was a great and rare individual but not a god. If some
    simple and mistaken few have elevated him to godship and
    worship him with requests for favors and special
    dispensations, this does not alter the situation one bit. </p>
    <p>It seems that in these troubled times, as, indeed, since
    time immemorial, man has felt the need to have a faith in a
    supreme being, one who could redeem him from &quot;sin&quot;
    and relieve his suffering. This is a great fallacy. If indeed
    there were such a being, why should he be asked to give
    redemption? Isn't it more important for man to redeem
    himself? This is what the Buddha believed. Man, he said, is
    born to suffering. Life <strong><i>is</i></strong> suffering.
    That is the first of the Four Noble Truths he enunciates --
    that there <strong><i>is</i></strong> suffering. In the
    Second Truth he points out that all suffering has its origins
    which we must learn to understand, because this is the only
    way we can arrive at the Third Truth, which is that cessation
    of this suffering <strong><i>can</i></strong> be achieved.
    His Fourth Truth clarifies the way out from suffering via the
    Eightfold Path which we will discuss later. </p>
    <p>Therefore we ask, if Buddhism is not a religion, what then
    is it? Our reply is: Buddhism is a way of life, a philosophy,
    a psychology, a way of thinking, through which we may
    ourselves take on the responsibility of determining how our
    life-bearing kamma (karma) will work out for us. Meditation
    is one of the procedures of mental discipline and
    purification through which we may begin to learn such
    responsibility. </p>
    <p>Many young people have come to me saying, &quot;How can I
    embrace Buddhism without destroying my own beliefs and
    culture?&quot; I tell the Christians among them to think
    about the precepts of Christ. Are they so totally opposed to,
    and different from, those of the Buddha? Thou shalt not kill.
    Thou shalt not steal or commit adultery. The ethical
    injunctions among the Ten Commandments -- are they not almost
    exactly the same as the precepts of the moral life laid down
    by the Buddha (the Five Precepts)? </p>
    <p>I tell them that the Dhamma, the sacred texts of Buddhism,
    are much more voluminous and explicit than those of the Old
    and New Testaments and commentaries. The Buddhist texts are,
    in fact, elevenfold as extensive and contain an enormous
    range of wise teachings, none of them derogatory to the
    faiths of other creeds. He did not deny the existence of
    deities, but he did reserve scepticism as to the infinity of
    their duration, their omnipotency, their powers to help
    mankind in every kind of urgency. Have these gods and
    messiahs, which we of Western faiths have been prone to
    believe in, been sublimely successful in the mitigation of
    human suffering, hunger, sorrow and affliction? The answer <strong><i>is</i></strong>
    open to doubt. </p>
    <p>So to these young Christians I can say, &quot;Believe in
    Christ if you wish, but remember, Jesus never claimed
    divinity either.&quot; Yes, believe in a unitary God, too, if
    you wish, but cease your imploring, pleading for personal
    dispensations, health, wealth, relief from suffering. Study
    the Eightfold Path. Seek the insights and enlightenment that
    come through meditative learnings. And find out how to
    achieve for yourself what prayer and solicitation of forces
    beyond you are unable to accomplish. </p>
    <p>There are many young people who believe that God answers
    their prayers. Does he? Is prayer-answering the purpose of a
    supreme being? A young man recently came to us asking for
    food and shelter. He was young, able-bodied, and, yes,
    intelligent. We received him, fed him and gave him a room for
    several days. When it became apparent that this fellow had no
    intention of ever leaving, we felt he should go off on his
    own. He was highly indignant! When he left we asked him if he
    intended to work and earn enough to take care of his own
    needs. He answered, &quot;No, God will provide. If I follow
    his light, that is enough. He will take care of me!&quot; </p>
    <p>If there is a God, why should he take care of able-bodied
    young men simply because they have unreserved and total faith
    in him, when there are so many really unfortunate, desolate
    people who really need help? Did God provide for the millions
    of Jews in concentration camps who were slowly gassed to
    death <strong><i>en-masse</i></strong>, their agonies of
    asphyxiation often lasting a full half-hour, before they were
    incinerated in German ovens? Is he there offering respite
    each day to the millions who are dying of cancer and other
    agonizing diseases all over the universe? Does he provide for
    all the masses of people, victims of floods, disasters and
    earthquakes, who are homeless and starving daily throughout
    the world? </p>
    <p>Yes, believe in a God, if you will, I tell them, but don't
    ask, ask and ask. Don't beg. Provide, as best you are able,
    for yourself first. Then fill your heart and mind with love,
    with metta, and help, to the fullest possible extent, in the
    relief of suffering among others. This is the answer I give
    them. But cease your petitioning, your constant solicitation
    for private preference. </p>
    <p>A Jewish girl from Israel came to meditate. She felt happy
    and calm in meditation, but she was worried. She said,
    &quot;I do not want to forget my heritage. I was born in
    Jerusalem and am steeped in Jewish tradition.&quot; I
    answered her: &quot;No problem. When you finish meditating,
    say the 'Shmah'!&quot; This is the ancient prayer of the Jews
    to be said each morning of their lives and on their
    deathbeds. It consists of the words, &quot;Hear, O Israel,
    the Lord our God, the Lord is one.&quot; This, to those of
    the Jewish faith, may be a solacing thought, one that may
    yield them comfort, I told her. There is nothing in Buddhism,
    as a matter of fact, denying the right to believe in God if
    you so wish. Yet it must be pointed out that Buddhism places
    deityship on quite a different plane than monotheistic and
    polytheistic religions do. Still, with all your beliefs
    intact, you can benefit from much that Buddhism teaches, for
    instance from Buddhist meditation. We are all inter-related
    in common suffering. Even the word <strong><i>religion</i></strong>,
    derived from Latin, means joined or linked. Just as the word <strong><i>yoga</i></strong>
    also means the same, <strong><i>united</i></strong>. Whether
    this is expressed through a belief in a deity or not is of
    less importance than the fact that we recognize and accept
    the wonder of our common interrelationship. Certainly, I told
    her, there is nothing in the practice of Judaism that denies
    man's common relationship. The young lady was satisfied. As
    far as I know she sill meditates daily and recites the
    &quot;Shmah.&quot; </p>
    <p>Sometimes it is said that the Buddhists worship idols. Why
    all the incense, oil lamps, flowers set before Buddha-images?
    You must understand, I tell these young people, that the
    Buddhists are merely expressing their reverence for a great
    man of overwhelming vision and insight, one of the wisest
    teachers that ever lived, a man who laid out a whole way of
    life an a means of alleviating sorrow, strife and suffering.
    When they bow to him with hands clasped before them they do
    so in reverence and worship. But the meaning they attach to
    &quot;worship&quot; is not that of Western religionists. They
    ask nothing for their separate selves, no intercession of
    gods, no personal favors. Why is that? Because the Buddhist,
    neither in his life practice nor his philosophy, believes
    himself to be a separate being, a singular self, apart from
    others. Therefore, lacking separate personhood, there is <strong>no
    </strong><strong><i>one</i></strong> for whom preference is
    sought. For the Buddhist &quot;worship,&quot; then mean
    praise, reverence, a desire to imitate and be like the
    Buddha, to follow his ways and show appreciation for his
    teachings. He offers them no dispensations or favors, only a
    body of wisdom contained in the Dhamma which, if they but
    apply it to themselves, amounts to self-dispensation. In
    essence this means dispensing with all vanity, clinging,
    attachments, greed and ignorance, which may yet hamper them
    from being like the Buddha and aspiring to the perfection of
    being, which he in his life attained when reaching Nibbana
    here and now! </p>
    <p>The great American statesman Thomas Paine said, &quot;My
    mind is my church.&quot; In this statement he reiterates the
    belief of the Buddha. Buddhists do not believe it is
    necessary to have a middleman intercede between them and the
    perfection of the Master they chose to emulate and be like.
    In Buddhism there is no need for priests, ministers and
    preachers to pray for them in churches or temples. The
    Buddhist monk teaches, not preaches. He teaches man to find
    his way. He teaches purity of mind, and compassion, and love
    for all beings. He does not perform marriage service, but
    devotes his life only to teaching and scholarship and study,
    and to continuing self-purification through meditation, so
    that he can be an example to others. </p>
    <p>Who may become a Buddha? And how does one become one?
    These are questions frequently asked me. The answers are that
    one has to enroll or join nothing, sign no document, be
    initiated by no baptism, nor disavow any other belief. All he
    has to do is to begin to live as Buddhists live, to find
    inspiration in the Buddha, to like and reverence his
    teachings, to begin to try to follow his Eightfold Path and,
    through meditation, to seek to gain merit and purity. To
    aspire, in fact, to become a Buddha himself! For Buddhahood
    is not a limited society. It is open to all. Many have
    attained it. Even the Buddha himself, in previous lives (so
    goes one of the legends built around him) chose to deny
    himself release through Nibbana and chose rebirth so that he
    might stay on and teach others. </p>
    <p>Now let us examine the Buddha's remedy for the ending of
    suffering. A friend of mine once said, with respect to this,
    &quot;It is all very simple: practice <strong><i>right
    thought</i></strong>,<strong> </strong><strong><i>right
    speech</i></strong> and<strong> </strong><strong><i>right
    action</i></strong>! Very good and very important. However,
    not so fast, my friend! All of the Eightfold Path is
    necessary, not just the small part of it you mention. It is
    all beautifully interrelated. There <i>must be </i><strong><i>right
    understanding</i></strong><i> with </i><strong><i>right
    speech</i></strong>. There <i>must be </i><strong><i>right
    action</i></strong>. There <i>must be </i><strong><i>right
    effort</i></strong>. And <i>with</i> the right effort must
    follow <strong><i>right livelihood</i></strong>. And for all
    of these steps to work, think of them <i>as </i><strong><i>steps</i></strong>.
    You don't get very far just moving up one step and remaining
    there. You have to combine them, join them, link them, and
    finally, climax them with still one more step to reach the
    top. And <i>that</i> step is<strong> </strong><strong><i>right
    mindfulness</i></strong>. </p>
    <p>How beautifully all these hang together like pearls on a
    necklace. But now think for a moment about what is meant by
    &quot;right&quot;: that is to say, the rightness of speech,
    thought, action. Few pause to think what &quot;right&quot;
    means within this context. Does it mean right as opposed to
    wrong? Perhaps it does. And then, again, perhaps it doesn't.
    How many of us are able to discriminate at every juncture of
    our lives what is right and what is wrong? Does right, then,
    mean appropriate? Appropriate action, appropriate speech,
    etc.? Appropriate means suitable, suitable for the occasion.
    Is <strong><i>that</i></strong> always so easy to determine?
    What, then, does the Buddha's use of the word <strong><i>right</i></strong>
    come down to? Does it not come down to the fact that he is
    pointing out that there is choice, and that <i>we</i> have
    choice, that we can go this way or go that way, and that it
    is up to us and not him, and no god or supreme being, to
    determine our way? Is he not saying that this choice or
    volition amounts to our own kamma? And that while a lot of it
    is predetermined through our past lives or genetically,
    however you want to think of it, we can still alter, correct,
    change, refine re-aim this kamma, change its course? We and
    nobody else! And does not all of this point back to such <i>qualities</i>
    of action, speech, and thought, as are characterized as
    greedy, selfish, hateful, hostile, hurtful? As <i>opposed</i>
    to such qualities as generousness, selflessness, lovingness,
    kindliness, helpfulness? Do you not see that the Buddha is
    telling us to look behind words and not to accept them for
    their face value but for their internal, shall we say
    nuclear, meanings? </p>
    <p>So we return again to the question as to whether Buddhism
    is a religion. In the sense that it offers us a moral code
    helping to conjoin us in the living together of a better
    life, yes, it <i>is</i> a religion. For that is the inner or
    nuclear meaning of religion -- <strong><i>relinking,
    rejoining</i></strong>. But if Buddhism is taken to imply
    belief in a supreme being who rules the universe and can be
    bribed to alter his decisions by our prayers and
    solicitations for personal preference, it is not a religion.
    And this Buddhism does not do. Well, then, the Christian may
    argue, man without God, without conscience, without a ruler
    of the universe, will revert to bestiality. Is this not like
    saying a being can't exist without a taskmaster? Are we then
    children? So weak that we can't exist without being
    &quot;told&quot; what we can and cannot do? How can we
    justify this? </p>
    <p>The answers should be obvious. Man <strong><i>can</i></strong>
    rely on himself. Man <strong><i>can</i></strong> train his
    mind to right thinking, not because thereby he will be saved
    by a righteous God, but because right thinking will lead him
    on to the path of final liberation from suffering, which
    consists of right moral conduct, right meditation and right
    wisdom. </p>
    <p>Now look at Buddhism. Does it not look <i>up</i> to you
    rather than down to you, treat you as an adult rather than a
    child, not demand and command, but patiently teach and
    instruct what practically amounts to the same thing? The
    Buddha states that we are heirs to our kamma, that we make
    it, form it, and that what we do in this existence does
    affect our lives in the next one. However, in Buddhism, there
    is no need of beating our breasts and heeding authoritarian
    demands that we repent. We can rise up out of our sloth and
    torpor, out of evil and ugliness, by &quot;following the
    path.&quot; If it were true that without a vengeful God man
    would be less than human, how do we justify the existence for
    thousands of years of Buddhists living in peace and love with
    each other? </p>
    <p>Christ and Buddha were alike in many ways. It is not my
    intention to disparage anyone's belief in Christ. Christ
    said, &quot;Love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot; Buddha said,
    &quot;Show compassion and loving-kindness to all
    beings.&quot; God said to the Jews, &quot;Do not unto others
    that which you would not do unto yourself.&quot; This is what
    Christ later said in reverse, positively, but with the same
    meaning. It was Moses who interpreted the words of God to his
    people, but for that reason they did not clothe him in
    divinity, nor did he do so himself. Where the Buddhists and
    Christians part company is the Christ's followers accorded
    him divinity, whereas Buddha's disciples accord him reverence
    as a great being. </p>
