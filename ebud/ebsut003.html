I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. Then Ven. Ananda went to where the Blessed One was staying and, on arriving, bowed down and sat to one side. As he was sitting there he addressed the Blessed One, saying, "Is there one quality that, when developed and pursued, brings four qualities to completion? And four qualities that, when developed and pursued, bring seven qualities to completion? And seven qualities that, when developed and pursued, bring two qualities to completion?" 
<p>    "Yes, Ananda, there is one quality that, when developed and pursued,   brings four qualities to completion; and four qualities that, when   developed and pursued, bring seven qualities to completion; and seven   qualities that, when developed and pursued, bring two qualities to   completion.  And what is the one quality that, when developed and   pursued, brings four qualities to completion?  What are the four   qualities that, when developed and pursued, bring seven qualities to   completion?  What are the seven qualities that, when developed and   pursued, bring two qualities to completion? 
<p>    "Mindfulness of in-and-out breathing, when developed and pursued, brings   the four frames of reference (foundations of mindfulness) to   completion.  The four frames of reference, when developed and pursued,   bring the seven factors of awakening to completion.  The seven factors   of awakening, when developed and pursued, bring clear knowing and release   to completion. 
<p>    "Now in what way does a monk develop and pursue mindfulness of in-and-out   breathing so that it brings the four frames of reference to   completion? 
<p>    "There is the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to the   shade of a tree, or to an empty building, sits down folding his legs   crosswise, holding his body erect, and setting mindfulness to the   fore.  Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.

<p>    "(1)  Breathing in long, he discerns that he is breathing in long; or   breathing out long, he discerns that he is breathing out long.  (2)    Or breathing in short, he discerns that he is breathing in short; or   breathing out short, he discerns that he is breathing out short.  (3)    He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the entire body, and to   breathe out sensitive to the entire body.  (4)  He trains himself to   breathe in calming the bodily processes, and to breathe out calming   the bodily processes.  
<p>    "(5)  He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to rapture, and to   breathe out sensitive to rapture.  (6)  He trains himself to breathe   in sensitive to pleasure, and to breathe out sensitive to pleasure.    (7)  He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to mental processes,   and to breathe out sensitive to mental processes.  (8)  He trains   himself to breathe in calming mental processes, and to breathe out   calming mental processes.  
<p>    "(9)  He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the mind, and to   breathe out sensitive to the mind.  (10)  He trains himself to breathe   in satisfying the mind, and to breathe out satisfying the mind.  (11)    He trains himself to breathe in steadying the mind, and to breathe out   steadying the mind.  (12)  He trains himself to breathe in releasing   the mind, and to breathe out releasing the mind. 
<p>    "(13)  He trains himself to breathe in focusing on inconstancy, and to   breathe out focusing on inconstancy.  (14)  He trains himself to   breathe in focusing on dispassion (literally, fading), and to breathe   out focusing on dispassion.  (15)  He trains himself to breathe in   focusing on cessation, and to breathe out focusing on cessation.  (16)    He trains himself to breathe in focusing on relinquishment, and to   breathe out focusing on relinquishment.

<p>    "Now, on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he   is breathing in long; or breathing out long, discerns that he is   breathing out long; or breathing in short, discerns that he is   breathing in short; or breathing out short, discerns that he is   breathing out short; trains himself to breathe in...and... out sensitive   to the entire body; trains himself to breathe in...and...out calming the   bodily processes:  On that occasion the monk remains focused on the   <i>body</i> in and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- subduing greed   and distress with reference to the world.  I tell you, monks, that this   -- the in-and-out breath -- is classed as a body among bodies, which is   why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in and of   itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress   with reference to the world. 
<p>    "On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in...and...out   sensitive to rapture; trains himself to breathe in...and...out sensitive   to pleasure; trains himself to breathe in...and...out sensitive to   mental processes; trains himself to breathe in...and...out calming   mental processes:  On that occasion the monk remains focused on   <i>feelings</i> in and of themselves -- ardent, alert, and mindful --   subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.  I tell you,   monks, that this -- close attention to in-and-out breaths -- is classed   as a feeling among feelings, which is why the monk on that occasion   remains focused on feelings in and of themselves -- ardent, alert, and   mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world. 
<p>    "On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in...and...out   sensitive to the mind; trains himself to breathe in...and...out   satisfying the mind; trains himself to breathe in...and...out steadying   the mind; trains himself to breathe in...and...out releasing the mind:    On that occasion the monk remains focused on the <i>mind</i> in and of   itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- subduing greed and distress with   reference to the world.  I don't say that there is mindfulness of   in-and-out breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness,   which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in   and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and   distress with reference to the world. 
<p>    "On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in...and...out   focusing on inconstancy; trains himself to breathe in...and...out   focusing on dispassion; trains himself to breathe in...and...out   focusing on cessation; trains himself to breathe in...and...out focusing   on relinquishment:  On that occasion the monk remains focused on   <i>mental qualities</i> in and of themselves -- ardent, alert, and mindful --   subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.  He who sees   clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed and distress is one who   oversees with equanimity, which is why the monk on that occasion   remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves -- ardent,   alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to   the world. 
<p>    "This is how developing and pursuing mindfulness of in-and-out breathing   in brings the four frames of reference to completion. 
<p>    "And how are the four frames of reference developed and pursued so that   the seven factors of awakening come to completion? 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>    "(1) On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the <i>body</i> in   and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and   distress with reference to the world, on that occasion his mindfulness   is steady and without lapse.  When his mindfulness is steady and without   lapse, then <i>mindfulness</i> as a factor of awakening becomes aroused.    He develops it, and through him it goes to the culmination of its   development. 
<p>    "(2) Remaining mindful in this way, he examines, analyzes, and comes to   a comprehension of that quality with discernment.  When he remains   mindful in this way, examining, analyzing, and coming to a comprehension   of that quality with discernment, then <i>analysis of qualities</i> as a   factor of awakening becomes aroused.  He develops it, and through him   it goes to the culmination of its development. 
<p>    "(3) In one who examines, analyzes, and comes to a comprehension of that   quality with discernment, unflagging persistence is aroused.  When   unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines, analyzes, and   comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, then   <i>persistence</i> as a factor of awakening becomes aroused.  He develops   it, and through him it goes to the culmination of its development.  
<p>    "(4) In one whose persistence is aroused, a rapture not-of-the-flesh   arises.  When a rapture not-of-the-flesh arises in one whose   persistence is aroused, then <i>rapture</i> as a factor of awakening   becomes aroused.  He develops it, and through him it goes to the   culmination of its development. 
<p>    "(5) For one who is enraptured, the body grows calm and the mind grows   calm.  When the body and mind of an enraptured monk grow calm, then   <i>serenity</i> as a factor of awakening becomes aroused.  He develops   it, and through him it goes to the culmination of its development. 
<p>    "(6) For one who is at ease -- his body calmed -- the mind becomes   concentrated.  When the mind of one who is at ease -- his body calmed   -- becomes concentrated, then <i>concentration</i> as a factor of   awakening becomes aroused.  He develops it, and through him it goes to   the culmination of its development. 
<p>    "(7) He oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity.  When he   oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity, <i>equanimity</i> as   a factor of awakening becomes aroused.  He develops it, and through   him it goes to the culmination of its development.

<p>    (Similarly with the other three frames of reference:  feelings, mind,   and mental qualities.) 
<p>    "This is how the four frames of reference, when developed and pursued,   lead to the culmination of the seven factors of awakening. 
<p>    "And how are the seven factors of awakening developed and pursued so as   to lead to the culmination of clear knowing and release?  There is the   case where a monk develops the <i>mindfulness</i> as a factor of   awakening dependent on seclusion...dispassion...cessation, resulting   in relinquishment.  He develops the <i>analysis of qualities</i> as a   factor of awakening...the <i>persistence</i> as a factor of   awakening...the <i>rapture</i> as a factor of awakening...the   <i>serenity</i> as a factor of awakening...the <i>concentration</i> as a   factor of awakening...the <i>equanimity</i> as a factor of awakening   dependent on seclusion...dispassion...cessation, resulting in   relinquishment.  
<p>    "This is how the seven factors of awakening, when developed and pursued,   lead to the culmination of clear knowing and release." 
<p>    That is what the Blessed One said.  Satisfied, Ven. Ananda delighted   in the Blessed One's words.
