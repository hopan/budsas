<i>Venerable Sujiva is a Buddhist Theravada monk who has devoted his life 
to the meditational aspects of the Buddha's teachings. He donned the robes 
shortly after his university graduation in 1975. During his monastic 
training he practised under several meditation masters, including the 
Venerable Sayadaw U Pandita. Since residing in Santisukharama (Johor, Malaysia) in the 
early 1980s he has conducted numerous Vipassana retreats. </i></p>

<BR><BR>
<p>(...) The other day we were talking about the four foundations of mindfulness in 
which the Buddha advises monks to practise mindfulness and proceed towards 
the attainment of <i>jhanas.</i> From here we will talk a bit about the <i>samatha</i> and 
<i>vipassana</i> practices and how to go about attaining insight and finally, liberation 
from <i>samsara</i>. </p>
<p>There are two approaches in the practice of meditation. The first approach is 
called <i>samatha</i> <i>yanika</i>. Those meditators who follow this approach practise 
initially by using concentration, or tranquillity, as a base. This means they 
practise pure tranquillity meditations like <i>kasinas, </i>visualisations; <i>asubhas,</i> 
meditations on loathsomeness of the body. There are forty such objects 
enumerated in the <i>Visuddhimagga</i>. They usually practise until they have 
reached an established state: At least to <i>upacara</i> <i>samadhi</i>, or to any of the 
<i>jhanas,</i> the blissful absorptions. When they are established here, they go further 
and practise <i>vipassana</i>. </p>
<p>The second type of approach is <i>suddha</i> <i>vipassana</i> <i>yanika</i>, the pure insight 
practice. Here the meditators do not go through any pure tranquillity meditation 
practices; neither going into the respective access concentration (called <i>upacara</i> 
<i>jhana</i>) nor the fixed concentration (called <i>appana</i> <i>jhana</i>). They go directly into 
the contemplation of mind and matter. From there they achieve <i>vipassana</i> 
momentary concentration which is equivalent to access concentration. 
Depending on that concentration they can also achieve <i>magga-phala</i>, 
enlightenment. </p>
<p>There is another type of approach: The practice where both concentration and 
insight are developed. The meditators are not established in either one alone but 
they practise alternatingly whenever one is more suitable. Usually people talk 
about the first two types, the pure <i>samatha</i> <i>yanika</i> and the pure <i>vipassana</i> 
<i>yanika</i>. You find that both these methods have been taught by the Buddha and 
his instructions can be found in the <i>Tipitaka</i> itself. For some the Buddha taught 
pure <i>samatha</i> methods before going to <i>vipassana</i>. Others he taught directly the 
Four Foundations of Mindfulness without going through the <i>jhanas</i>. There are 
many cases of both ways in the <i>Tipitaka</i>. </p>
<p>If you ask which one to practise, ideally it is the more you know the better. It's 
better when you know all the eight <i>jhanas,</i> as well as all the <i>magga-phala</i>s. 
But that would not always be possible. First, you have to find a suitable teacher 
who can teach you all these things. Second, of course, you need the time to do 
it. There are also different ways to approach it. Sometimes you may be 
practising <i>vipassana</i> for a period as we are doing here. After that, at a suitable 
time, one can also practise <i>samatha</i>. Some find that <i>vipassana</i> is good enough. 
That means they keep on practising and progressing and they do not need to go 
into <i>samatha</i> at all. Certain people find it necessary to go through some degree 
of <i>samatha</i> before they go into <i>vipassana</i>. But finally they will have to go to 
<i>vipassana</i> if they want to find enlightenment. In any case you have to do a lot of 
practice. And you need a lot of time. </p>
<p>Of course the emphasis of the Mahasi tradition is on <i>vipassana</i>. Not that the 
teachers are ignorant about the nature of <i>samatha</i>. From what I gather in 
Myanmar we know that many of the teachers can actually teach all the forty 
objects of <i>samatha</i>. When I was there many years ago, I asked them, &quot;Why 
don't you teach me <i>samatha</i>? I also want to learn <i>samatha</i>.&quot; They said: 
&quot;<i>Vipassana</i> is more important. After you have established <i>vipassana</i> well then 
you can do all the <i>samatha</i> you want.&quot; The reason is that most people do not 
have so much time to practise. Even if you're a monk, it doesn't mean you have 
all the time to practise. You get involved with other things. The important thing is 
that while there is the <i>sasana</i> period we learn what we can and as much as we 
can in <i>vipassana</i>. From what we understand, the concentration in an intensive 
retreat in <i>vipassana</i> is usually able to carry a person forward for a long time. 
Therefore, the emphasis here is on <i>vipassana</i>. As a lay person has even less 
time than a monk he should practise what is most important. Also according to 
our understanding, it is rather difficult to practise <i>samatha </i>successfully. 
Moreover, it may take some time if you are required to attain the <i>jhanas</i>. The 
object must be suitable and you also must have the potential. </p>
<p>Now we come to the subject of the <i>jhanas. </i>When you talk of <i>jhana,</i> it does 
not necessary mean something that occurs in <i>samatha</i>, pure tranquillity 
meditation, alone. It can also be applied to experiences of concentration within 
the <i>vipassana</i> meditation. Therefore there are such things as <b>samatha jhanas</b>, 
that means the <i>jhanas</i> or the type of absorptions that occur in pure tranquillity 
meditations, and <b>vipassana jhanas</b>, the other type of tranquillity or absorptions 
that occur in <i>vipassana</i> meditation. </p>
<p>What is the general idea behind the word <B><i>jhana</i></B> ? <i>Jhana</i> 
usually means <b>strong concentration fixed on the object</b>. Here we quote an 
excerpt from a book written by Mahasi Sayadaw, <i>The Wheel of Dhamma</i>: </p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>&quot;<i>Jhana</i> means closely observing an object with fixed 
attention. Concentrated attention given to a selected object of meditation, such as 
breathing for tranquillity concentration, gives rise to <i>samatha jhana</i>, whereas 
noting the characteristic nature of mind and body and contemplating on their 
impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and insubstantiality brings about <i>vipassana 
jhana</i>. There are two types of <i>jhanas</i> : <i>samatha jhana</i> and <i>vipassana 
jhana</i>. Fixed attention that develops into tranquillity is called <i>samatha jhana</i>. 
Contemplating on the three characteristics constitutes <i>vipassana jhana</i>. There 
are also three kinds of <i>samadhi</i> (concentration): momentary, access and 
absorption concentration.&quot; </p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>In another book, Sayadaw U Pandita refers to <i>jhana</i> as the mind sticking onto 
the object. It is like taking a wooden rod and poking through a leaf with it; or 
sticking it to something soft and then bringing it close to see what it is. So when 
the mind fixes on an object, it is like penetrating the object and going to it, 
sticking to it. This is the nature of <i>jhana</i>. It is a fixed, deep concentration. </p>
<p>Depending on how you use it, <i>jhana </i>can refer to different things. Just as when 
you say concentration, you can have wrong concentration and right 
concentration. It is still concentration. It refers to different experiences. </p>
<p>First we go into the general meaning of <i>samatha</i> concentration and how it 
occurs, as mentioned in the text. Here <i>samatha jhana</i> can be divided into two 
types. One is <i>upacara</i> <i>jhana</i> or <i>upacara</i><b> </b><i>samadhi</i>, the other one is <i>appana</i> 
<i>jhana</i> or <i>appana</i> <i>samadhi</i>. In this usage, <i>jhana</i> and <i>samadhi</i> mean the same 
thing. <i>Appana</i> means fixed concentration, that means the mind becomes unified, 
one with the object. <i>Upacara</i> means access, that means close to the fixed 
concentration. </p>
<p>We have to understand that <i>upacara</i> <i>samadhi</i> is very wide. There is a wide 
level of <i>upacara</i>, access concentration. It covers many experiences. And it 
differs with different objects. Generally, we can say a person reaches <i>upacara</i> 
<i>samadhi</i> when the five hindrances are inhibited. That means the concentration 
goes up to the level where greed, anger, sloth and torpor, worry and 
restlessness, and doubts do not arise. When the concentration has reached up 
to the level where the five hindrances are pushed aside (although they may come 
back after one comes out from the meditation) one can be said to have attained 
initial access concentration. Because the function of putting away the defilements 
or hindrances is satisfied, you can, if you want, go into the practice of 
<i>vipassana</i> and observe with a sharp and calm mind. </p>
<p>When the hindrances are put aside and are inhibited, it doesn't mean that the 
deepest form of access concentration has already been reached. At this moment 
of time you may still now and then hear sounds coming and going. At this point 
you can still have some idea of the form of the body. For example, if you are 
watching the in- and out-breaths and you come to a point where the hindrances 
are not there and the mind is very clear and calm. At this stage you still have 
some idea of the form of the body. And when sounds come, you can still hear 
them, although they may not be loud. At times they may be very loud or 
sometimes very blur. This is one lower stage of <i>upacara</i> <i>samadhi</i>. </p>
<p>But one can go further. When you say access concentration is close to 
absorption, it doesn't mean access concentration is weak. It can be very strong. 
Take for example a person, either he is watching the in- and out-breaths, or he 
is mentally chanting '<i>itipiso...</i>', or he may be doing <i>metta</i>, spreading 
loving-kindness to somebody. After some time of developing the practice with 
mindfulness, with <i>metta</i>, with awareness, his mind will become calmer and 
calmer. When it becomes calmer and calmer he forgets about everything else. 
The mind becomes very soft, very quiet and very concentrated. It will at times 
become very light. And he forgets about the body, he won't feel his body at all. 
He won't be able to hear any sounds at all. He just knows the mind is very still 
and quiet either on the breath, or on sending loving-kindness to a person, or it 
might be a visualisation, a light for example. The mind does not move. The mind 
is very still, very quiet, he cannot hear anything, he doesn't know where he is. 
But he still knows that he is concentrated on the object. And if he wants to think 
he can; if he doesn't want to think he can, too. Often, in this stage, the mind is 
like one who is floating. It is like being half-asleep. But it is not really sleep. This 
still constitutes <i>upacara</i> <i>samadhi</i>, access concentration. </p>
<p>Thus, in the process of developing concentration, after reaching <i>upacara</i> 
<i>samadhi</i> where the hindrances have been put aside, one still has to go much 
further in the concentration before attaining the actual absorption, <i>samatha</i> 
<i>jhana</i> which we call <i>appana</i> <i>jhana</i>. In certain objects, you can see very clearly 
that they become finer and finer. Take for example, <i>upacara</i> <i>samadhi</i>, access 
concentration just before going into the first <i>jhana</i> and <i>upacara</i> <i>samadhi</i> just 
before going into the second <i>jhana</i>. Both are <i>upacara</i> <i>samadhi</i> but they are 
different in experience. And when you go to the third and fourth <i>upacara</i> 
<i>samadhi,</i> just before going into third and fourth <i>jhana</i> respectively, it is again 
different. The <i>samadhi</i> is finer and more still. The object also becomes much 
finer. So there are actually different levels of <i>upacara</i> <i>samadhi</i> which can be 
experienced. </p>
<p>We take an example from the <i>kasinas </i>meditative objects like colours, earth, 
etc. Let's say someone is doing a type of <i>kasina</i>water <i>kasina</i>. Water <i>kasina</i> 
involves the visualisation of water. Before reaching absorption there arises what 
we call a <i>nimitta</i>, a mental sign, called <i>uggaha</i> <i>nimitta</i>. <i>Uggaha</i> <i>nimitta</i> is the 
'grasped object'. That means it is a direct replica of what you see as water. 
When you can do that the mind is already very calm . Usually in this state you 
cannot be thinking here and there. This is because when you're thinking here and 
there you not only see water, you see other things as well. You may see fish 
inside the water or you may even see insects moving about. Sometimes you may 
see your friend swimming in the water and if you have craving arising, you may 
even see ladies swimming in the water! You may see them very clearly. </p>
<p>When you have the <i>uggaha</i> <i>nimitta</i> you see the water very clearly but the 
water may be moving. You see the water moving and the mind becoming one 
with the water. It is as if the mind is the water and the water is the mind. And it 
can be moving. At that time it is not very close to blissful absorption yet. It is still 
some way off. But if the mind can almost be one with the water and is sticking 
to the surface of the water, you cannot think of anything else. You cannot be 
having the idea of the body or anything. You cannot be hearing what is outside, 
you cannot think where you are either. At that time the <i>nimitta</i> is called <i>uggaha</i> 
<i>nimitta</i>, grasped object. It is <i>upacara</i> <i>samadhi</i> but not the one very close to 
the <i>jhana</i> yet. From here you can understand that the <i>samatha </i>concentration 
should be deep even before getting very close to the <i>jhana</i>. </p>
<p>Now if one is doing the water <i>kasina</i> when the <i>uggaha</i> <i>nimitta</i> arises, the mind 
is one with the object as if the mind is the water and the water is the mind. As 
the mind at this moment isn't yet completely still there will be movement. That 
means the water which is the mind and the mind which is the water are still 
moving. At that time you might find that it is a bit similar to the <i>vipassana</i> 
experience, but it is not the same. Another example is when doing the wind 
<i>kasina,</i> the stage is reached where the mind is like the wind and the wind is like 
the mindthe mind could be moving as if the wind is blowing. It is a bit like 
<i>vipassana</i> rising and falling, wind going up and down. But if you're sharp 
enough you know it is not the same. </p>
<p>As you progress and the concentration deepens, any movements within the 
object will stop, it will become very still. The mind which is the water and the 
water which is the mind become very still and very clear, completely 
transparent. Very bright. At that point the mind will approach a stage which is 
extremely clear and extremely bright. When that happens excitement sometimes 
comes up and the concentration is broken. At that point the mind goes into what 
we call <b><i>patibhaga</i></b> <i>nimitta</i>, the 'mirror image', which is very purified. This is 
now much closer to blissful absorption, first <i>jhana</i>. But still it is not yet 
absorption . </p>
<p>You will find that the process of <i>upacara</i> <i>samadhi</i> just before entering the first 
<i>jhana </i>or a matter of fact, the third or fourth <i>jhana,</i> differs in its fineness. For 
example, when going to first <i>jhana</i> it is like water moving and the mind is the 
water and the water is the mind. Then just before entering the first <i>jhana,</i> the 
water may be like a very clear round pool of water. But if you go to higher 
<i>jhana</i>s it will occur in finer stages. It becomes not just water moving but very 
fine droplets, like a mist, floating about. And just before entering the absorption 
<i>(jhana)</i> the object becomes very fine, pinpoint drops and you know that those 
pinpoint drops are moisture. So it is very much finer. The mind is also much finer 
and lighter. </p>
<p>This <i>upacara</i> <i>samadhi</i> can last long. You can sit for hours. It seems that people 
can sit for days. But it is still only<i> upacara</i> <i>samadhi</i>. In <i>samatha</i> you get very 
peaceful and very good experiences. There is no doubt about that. One can 
never say anything bad about <i>samatha</i> meditations. One can only praise 
<i>samatha</i> meditations. Only that they have to be properly learned, otherwise it 
can give rise to some problems. </p>
<p>At this level of <i>upacara</i> <i>samadhi</i>, because it is so peaceful and quiet, so happy 
and joyful, many things can happen. And because it is not so fixed like in 
<i>appana</i> (fixed concentration) it can sometimes lapse. Being so peaceful, it can 
lapse into sleep. For example, once when I was doing <i>samatha</i> the mind was 
very quiet and I knew I was sitting. I thought I had sat for five minutes only and 
was aware all the time, but when I turned to look at the clock it was already a 
few hours later. Either the sitting was very peaceful or that I could have fallen 
asleep. At times it's so peaceful and the mind so subtle that there is not much 
difference being aware or not being aware. It is just like you closing your eyes 
for a while only and already a few hours could have passed. In this type of 
<i>samadhi</i> it is very easy to slip off into sleep and you actually go into very, very 
deep sleep. And when you come out, if you're not careful, you may even think 
that it was <i>nibbana</i>. Because you may say it was cessation altogether, it was 
like you've gone to a void, there was nothing there. Or, you may think it was 
<i>jhana</i>, first absorption. But actually it was sleep. There is nothing wrong with 
sleep. Only when you start getting attached to it then problems come. </p>
<p>Besides sleeping there are other things that can happen. For example, at times 
there may be very strong joy that makes you feel like you are floating. Lots of 
joy and lightness may envelope one's mind and body and make them seem to 
disappear. When you come back to your senses you may recall, 'Oh! You've 
gone to a very peaceful and blissful state'. That is not <i>jhana</i>. It is still a kind of 
<i>upacara</i>, a kind of being completely enveloped in joy or happiness. Again, if 
you're not careful, you can get attached to it as <i>nibbana</i> or as <i>jhana</i>. There is 
nothing wrong with that bliss or that peacefulness. It is only when the attachment 
arises that problems follow. And it is very easy to get attached to such things. </p>
<p>In this access concentration for certain people, and certain types of meditation, 
a lot of <i>nimittas</i> arise. There arise what we call 'visions' or 'visualised images'. It 
may be things that you have seen before. It may be just nonsense. It may be, 
what they say, things from the past lives. It may be just fantasies. But usually the 
objects are quite clear because the mind is calm and peaceful. Especially in the 
beginning, they are very clear and nice. In fact some of them may be true. But 
inexperienced persons cannot differentiate so well as the concentration is not 
really deep yet. Little, subtle defilements quickly arise with visual images. And if 
you start to get attached to it: &quot;I've psychic powers&quot;; &quot;I've divine eyes&quot;; &quot;I can 
see my past lives&quot;, &quot;in my past life I was king of India&quot;, &quot;in my past life I was 
emperor in China&quot;, then troubles arise. If you don't get attached, then they are 
just mental images that arise. There is nothing wrong with that, they will come 
and go. They may just be impressions from anywhere. But once attachment or 
fear arises, these images will not stop, they'll keep on continuing and continuing. 
Until finally you get total hallucinations. Therefore if you are into <i>samatha</i> 
meditations you are not encouraged to go into this at all until you have complete 
mastery over the mind, until you are one hundred percent sure whether these 
images are real or not. From here you may see that <i>upacara</i> <i>samadhi</i> is not 
just simple experience but actually covers a range of experiences. </p>
<p>There will come a point when the concentration is developed deep enough to 
enter what we call <i>appana</i> <i>samadhi</i>, the blissful absorptions, or fixed 
concentration. When this happens the mind changes into a different level, called 
<i>rupavacara</i>, the form-sphere. It is a <i>jhanic</i> sphere. This type of mind is totally 
cut off from what we see, hear, smell, taste and touch. In fact it also cuts off 
from the normal type of thinking and awareness. It has been described by some 
people as a kind of deep sleep. But they know very clearly how they sink into 
the object and get completely absorbed in it. Once the mind absorbed into the 
object, they are completely unconscious at that time. But when they come out 
they will know the nature of the state of mind that has just passed and also the 
object that they were attending to. So even if you enter into the first absorption 
for one second you will know that for that one second you were completely 
unconscious. Only when you come out are you aware of the blissful state of 
<i>jhana</i> during that one second. Even if you go in for half a second you will know 
that for half a second you are completely cut off from the whole sensual sphere. 
Only when you come out from this half a second of concentration will you know 
how the state of mind was. </p>
<p>When you go into absorption there occurs a completely different level of 
consciousness. Therefore if you're meditating and that you may forget the form 
of the body, no thoughts and the mind is very still and blissfulthat is still not 
<i>appana</i>not the first <i>samatha jhana</i>. But that doesn't mean it's bad, it's still a 
good and peaceful state of mind. </p>
<p>It is very clear that in the absorption you are mindful. And sooner or later you 
may know after emerging, the nature of the object as going into absorption 
means that your mind is absorbed in the object. When the mind is completely 
absorbed in the object you know what the object is! Of course there are certain 
types of <i>samatha</i> meditation where the objects are very abstract. And when 
you first enter into <i>jhana </i>they may not be very clear, because they are very 
abstract objects that last only a very short time. But when you go in constantly 
and you go up to the third and fourth <i>jhana</i> they should be clear as well. </p>
<p>In certain meditations, like the <i>kasina</i>s and also the breathing meditation, 
<i>anapana</i>, where the object before absorption is very clear and bright, the 
object in which you are absorbed in is also very clear. As in the example of the 
water <i>kasina</i> and the access concentration of water <i>kasina</i> before the first 
absorption, it may be a completely clear pool of water which is very still. When 
you are entering into the absorption, it is like sinking into the wateras if you are 
diving and finally in the water. When in the water you don't know anything. But 
once out of the water you know how the mind was, how you were while under 
water, so to speak. This is a very clear and blissful experience, but you know 
how clear and blissful only when you come out of it. </p>
<p>For these types of absorption there are four <i>rupa</i> <i>jhanas,</i> that means there are 
four levels and each is different in character. In the <i>suttas</i> it is very clearly said 
that they differ in terms of <i>jhana</i> factors, called <i>jhanangas</i>. These are 
cetasikas, certain states of mind that are present and which play an important 
part in the respective <i>jhana</i>, absorption. For example in the first <i>jhana</i> the 
factors involved are: <i>vitakka</i>, <i>vicara</i>, <i>piti</i>, <i>sukha</i>, <i>ekaggata</i>. <i>Vitakka</i> is 'initial 
application'. Initial application is the force of the mind which brings it to the 
object. This is a mental force. <i>Vicara</i>, sustained application, is the force of the 
mind that is keeping it on the object, and is again a mental force, something like 
an energy. <i>Piti</i> is joy or interest. <i>Sukha</i> is a very happy feeling. And <i>ekaggata</i> 
is one-pointedness, that means when the mind is as if one with the object. These 
mental factors which are present in the first <i>jhana</i> play an important part. </p>
<p>But it does not mean that when you have these five factors you have the first 
<i>jhana</i>. Even if you don't have any concentration these five mental factors are 
already there. When you think of food, when you miss very much your food, or 
your 'Penang Laksa' there are also these five factors present , because the mind 
keeps running to the Laksa, it stays on it thinking 'how nice if I have Laksa', and 
then after that when you think of the Laksa you have joy 'when I had Laksa it 
was so nice, I was enjoying myself' and you feel very happy also and the mind is 
actually as if you could taste the Laksa, then these five factors are there but it is 
more like wrong concentration, greed. </p>
<p>You must know what the five <i>jhana</i> factors are to understand the jhanas. You 
must know at least something about <i>Abhidhamma</i> before you can have a 
clearer idea. These five factors actually describe a type of consciousness, a type 
of mind. When you know what factors are present you know what <i>jhana</i> you 
are in. For example, in the first <i>jhana</i> you have all the five factors involved. In 
the second <i>jhana,</i> you don't have the initial and sustained application, you have 
only joy, happiness and one-pointedness. In the third <i>jhana,</i> you have only 
happiness and one-pointedness. In the fourth <i>jhana,</i> you have only equanimity 
and one-pointedness. From the description I've given on the absorptions you 
<b>definitely </b>cannot know it <b>while</b> you are in the <i>jhana</i>. While you are in these 
absorptions it is like you are in deep sleep, you are in a state <b>deeper</b> than deep 
sleepso how can you know while in it? You know it only <b>before you go in</b>, 
because before you enter it will be clear which factors are stronger and which 
are weaker and have to disappear, or <b>after</b> <b>emerging</b>, through making of 
proper resolutions to reflect on the factors present. We will not go into this 
because it is not part of our topic. </p>
<p>What I want is to give you a good idea of what access concentration and what 
actually fixed concentration is in what we call pure <i>samatha jhana</i>, when we 
talk about first, second, third and fourth <i>jhana</i> as <i>samatha jhana</i>. According 
to our experience it is important to have a certain degree of understanding. It is 
because of a lack of this type of understanding that wrong views arise. You find 
that in the <i>Brahmajala</i> <i>Sutta</i>, the discourse on wrong views, a large extent of 
wrong views do not come through thinking or philosophies, they come from 
meditative experiences. Because people hold on to their meditative experiences 
as something which is true and good but which in reality is very false, it gives rise 
to many types of wrong views. For example, one of them is <i>dittha dhamma 
nibbana dittha dhamma vada.</i> <i>Nibbana</i> you understand, <i>dittha dhamma</i> is a 
present state, <i>vada</i> is a view. This is the view regarding the present state as 
<i>nibbana</i>. For example if a person gets attached to the <i>jhana</i> as <i>nibbana</i> then 
he goes into wrong views. Of course there is nobody who can argue with him 
because he thinks &quot;I have experienced it and you not&quot;. At certain times entering 
into <i>jhana</i> is as if going into a void, the object becomes so subtle that it is very 
easy to fall into false views if one does not have a proper teacher. Even before 
going to the blissful absorptions one can experience many subtle states which 
can be misunderstood. </p>
<p>Therefore tonight's talk is to give you an idea so that you do not get attached to 
these experiences. If you cannot differentiate between <i>upacara</i> <i>samadhi</i> and 
<i>appana</i> <i>samadhi</i>, access concentration and fixed concentration, it's even easier 
for you to make a mistake between what is <i>nibbana</i> and what is not <i>nibbana</i> 
because <i>nibbana</i> is something more subtle and deeper than <i>jhana</i>. For 
example, when people are practising meditation and everybody starts saying, 
&quot;I've got first <i>jhana</i>, second <i>jhana</i>, third <i>jhana</i>, fourth <i>jhana</i>, this 
<i>magga-phala</i>, that <i>magga-phala&quot;</i>, we don't say that they are wrong because 
we don't really know what their experiences are, but the fact that they are saying 
all these things so easily and so happily makes it obvious that there are 
attachments. And you can see sometimes when they say it, they are very proud 
of it. If they are actually attached to wrong views it is even worse. We hope that 
this will not happen among the Buddhists here. </p>
<p>If a person has really gone through all these practices he will know that it is not 
easy to know whether somebody has this <i>jhana</i> or that <i>jhana</i>, this 
<i>magga-phala</i> or that <i>magga-phala</i>. One would be very reserved in making 
such statements. Therefore, if somebody says all these things too freely, we 
don't say directly that he is wrong, we say, be very careful with him, you may go 
into wrong views. </p>
