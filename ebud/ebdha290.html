      <P>D</FONT>eath is the only certain thing in life. It is also the thing 
      for which we are least prepared. We plan and prepare for various other 
      things -- examinations, weddings, business transactions, building houses 
      -- but we can never be certain whether our plans will materialize 
      according to our wish. Death, on the other hand, can come any minute, 
      sooner or later; it is the most certain event in life. Just as the 
      mushroom raises itself from the ground carrying a bit of earth on its 
      hood, so every living being brings with himself the certainty of death 
      from the moment of his birth. </P>
      <P>The Anguttara Nikaya (IV, 136) illustrates the uncertainty and the 
      evanescent nature of life with the help of a few evocative similes. Life 
      is compared to a dew drop at the tip of a blade of grass: it can drop off 
      any moment and even if it does not fall off, it evaporates as soon as the 
      sun comes up. Life is also as fleeting as a bubble of water formed by the 
      falling rain or a line drawn on the water. The text points out that life 
      rushes towards death incessantly like a mountain stream rushing down 
      without stopping. The <I>Dhammapada</I> compares the fragility of the body 
      to foam (v 46) and to a clay water pot (v 40). Thus with various similes 
      the uncertainty of life and the certainty of death are emphasized over and 
      over again in the Buddhist texts. </P>
      <P>It is accepted as a general truth that everybody fears death <I>(sabbe 
      bhayanti maccuno</I> -- Dh 129). We fear death because we crave for life 
      with all our might. It is also a fact that we fear the unknown. We know 
      least about death, therefore we fear death for a duality of reasons. It 
      seems reasonable to conjecture that the fear of death, or the fear of harm 
      to life, lurks at the root of all fear. Therefore each time we become 
      frightened we either run away from the source of fear or fight against it, 
      thus making every effort to preserve life. But we can do so only so long 
      as our body is capable of either fighting or running away from danger. But 
      when at last we are on the deathbed face to face with approaching death, 
      and the body is no longer strong enough for any protest, it is very 
      unlikely that we will accept death with a mental attitude of resignation. 
      We will mentally try hard to survive. As our yearning for life <I>(tanha)</I> 
      is so strong, we will mentally grasp <I>(upadana)</I> another viable 
      place, as our body can no longer support life. Once such a place, for 
      example the fertilized ovum in a mother&#39;s womb, has been grasped, the 
      psychological process of life <I>(bhava)</I> will continue with the newly 
      found place as its basis. Birth <I>(jati)</I> will take place in due 
      course. This seems to be the process that is explained in the chain of 
      causation as: craving conditions grasping, grasping conditions becoming or 
      the process of growth, which in turn conditions birth. Thus the average 
      man who fears death will necessarily take another birth as his ardent 
      desire is to survive. </P>
      <P>Let us probe a little further into the process of death, going from the 
      known to the unknown. We know that in normal life, when we are awake, 
      sense data keep on impinging on our sense faculties. We are kept busy 
      attending to these sense data, rejecting some, selecting some for greater 
      attention, and getting obsessed with still other things. This is an 
      ongoing process so long as we are awake. In the modern age man is reaching 
      out and seeking more and more sense stimulation. The popularity of the 
      portable radio with or without earphones, chewing gum, cosmetics and 
      television is a clear indication of the present trend for more and more 
      sense stimulation. By all this we have become alienated from ourselves; we 
      do not know our own real nature, or the real nature of our mind to be more 
      precise. Moreover, we go about our business in social life wearing masks 
      appropriate for each occasion. We often do not show our true feelings of 
      jealousy, greed, hatred, pride, or selfishness. We hide them in socially 
      accepted ways of formalized verbal expressions such as congratulations, 
      thank you, deepest sympathies. But there are times when our negative 
      emotions are so acute that they come into the open in the form of killing, 
      stealing, quarreling, backbiting, and so forth. But generally we try to 
      keep these venomous snakes of negative emotions inhibited. </P>
      <P>Now let us see what happens at the moment of death. We believe that 
      death is a process and not just a sudden instantaneous event. When the 
      senses lose their vitality one by one and they stop providing stimulation, 
      the inhibitions too fall away. The masks we have been wearing in our 
      various roles get cast off. We are at last face to face with ourselves in 
      all our nakedness. At that moment if what we see are the venomous snakes 
      of negative emotions of hatred, jealousy, etc., we would be laden with 
      guilt, remorse and grief. It is very likely that our memories too will 
      become quite sharp, as all the sensory disturbances and inhibitions which 
      kept them suppressed have fallen off. We may remember our own actions 
      committed and omitted during our lifetime with unpretentious clarity. If 
      they are morally unwholesome we would be guilty and grief stricken (S. V. 
      386), but if they are morally wholesome we would be contented and happy. 
      The <I>Abhidhammattha Sangaha</I> speaks of the presentation of <I>kamma</I> 
      or <I>kammanimitta</I> at the mind door on the advent of death. This seems 
      to be the revival in memory of an actual action or action veiled in 
      symbols at the onset of death. It is said that rebirth will be determined 
      by the quality of thoughts that surface in this manner. </P>
      <P>Death is as natural an event as nightfall; it is but one of the 
      manifestations of the law of impermanence. Though we dislike it immensely 
      we have to orient ourselves to accept its inevitability, as there is no 
      escape therefrom. The Buddhist texts advocate the cultivation of the 
      mindfulness of death often so that we are not taken unawares when the 
      event does take place. To face death peacefully one has to learn the art 
      of living peacefully with one&#39;s own self as well as with those around. One 
      method of doing so is to remember the inevitability of death, which will 
      deter one from unwholesome behavior. The practice of meditation is the 
      best technique which will enable one to live peacefully with oneself and 
      others. </P>
      <P>The practice of loving-kindness <I>(mettabhavana)</I> is an effective 
      method of meditation. One of its special advantages is the ability to face 
      death undeluded <I>(asammulho kalam karoti).</I> </P>
      <P>In one sutta (A. III, 293) the Buddha explains how to prepare for a 
      peaceful death. One has to organize one&#39;s life and cultivate an 
      appropriate attitude for this purpose. The instructions given there are as 
      follows: </P>
      <DIR>
        <P>(1) One should not be fond of a busy life involved in various 
        activities. <BR>
        (2) One should not be fond of being talkative. <BR>
        (3) One should not be fond of sleeping. <BR>
        (4) One should not be fond of having too many companions. <BR>
        (5) One should not be fond of too much social intercourse. <BR>
        (6) One should not be fond of daydreaming. </P>
      </DIR>
      <P>Another sutta (A. I, 57-8) explains that if one avoids unwholesome 
      wicked activities through body, speech and mind, one need not fear death. 
      The <I>Maha-parinibbana Sutta</I> (D. II, 85-6) categorically states that 
      those who are evil in character face death with delusion while the 
      virtuous face death free from delusion. Thus if one leads a simple 
      virtuous life one need not fear death. </P>
      <P>Once Mahanama Sakka (S. V. 369) disclosed to the Buddha that he was 
      worried where he would be reborn if he were to meet with a violent death 
      in a road accident. The Buddha explained that those who have cultivated 
      the qualities of faith, virtue, learning, generosity and wisdom for a long 
      time need not entertain such fears. To illustrate the position further the 
      Buddha employs a simile. If a pot of oil or ghee is broken in deep water 
      the potsherds will sink to the riverbed and the oil or ghee will rise to 
      the surface of the water. Similarly in such a tragic situation the body 
      would be discarded and may be devoured by vultures and jackals, but the 
      mind will rise and progress upwards. </P>
      <P>The account of the illness of Nakula&#39;s father (A. III, 295) is another 
      interesting episode regarding the Buddhist attitude to death. Once 
      Nakula&#39;s father was seriously ill and his wife noticed that he was fretful 
      and anxious. She advised him that death with anxiety is painful and is 
      denounced by the Buddha. Therefore he must compose himself. Comforting 
      him, she said that he might be worried about the family income and the 
      task of bringing up the children after his death. She assured him that she 
      was capable of spinning and weaving and thus she could provide for the 
      family and bring up the children. He may be anxious that she would remarry 
      after his death. She said that he knows just as well as she that she has 
      never been unfaithful to him ever since they were married at the age of 
      sixteen, and she pledged that she would remain loyal to him even after his 
      death. Perhaps he may worry about her spiritual development and she 
      assured him that she would continue to be earnest in her spiritual 
      welfare. Therefore he must face death, if need there be, with no anxiety. 
      Such was her advice to her husband who was fatally ill. It is said that he 
      regained self- composure and thereby good health too. The matter was later 
      reported to the Buddha, who commended Nakula&#39;s mother for her wisdom and 
      composure. </P>
      <P>The suttas also discuss the advantages of the regular contemplation of 
      death (A. IV, 46-48; S. V, 344,408). The mind gets divested from the love 
      of life, and being intoxicated with the zest of life, men commit various 
      atrocities. That can be prevented by the habit of practicing mindfulness 
      of death. If we only remember that we have not come to this world to stay 
      forever, we would take care to lead much better lives. If, when we take 
      stock, we find wicked negative emotions such as lust, hatred and jealousy 
      in us, we should immediately take steps to eradicate them as we would try 
      to put out the flames if our head were to catch fire (A. IV, 320). </P>
      <P>Thus the Buddhist texts tirelessly reiterate the positive benefits of 
      the regular contemplation of the inevitability of death. It helps one to 
      lead a more wholesome life and also to face death, the one and only 
      certain event in life, with calm composure and fearless confidence. </P>
