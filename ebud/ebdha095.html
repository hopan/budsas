  <p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">GENERAL ADVICE FOR STARTING A
  BUDDHIST ORGANIZATION</font></b></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>Following Your Intuition</i></strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Intuition is the key to establishing any organization,
  particularly Buddhist organizations. If you work for profit, you can make a plan based on
  the expected profit. With non-profit organizations, especially Buddhist organizations, you
  work to make others spiritually happy and peaceful, not for material or financial gain. It
  is your intuition that lets you know how to bring peace and harmony to people, and which
  guides you as you make plans and decisions for your organization.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You need some basis of inner support, in order to meet and
  overcome the obstacles you will face. From relying upon your intuition, you have a vision
  of what you want to accomplish. Your faith in your intuition gives you inner power to
  support your work. With that inner power, you will not budge for anything before your
  project reaches the state where it takes off the ground. Other people sense the power of
  that vision, and they come to support you, and to support your work.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You have an inner voice of confidence. It says, &quot;Ah!
  This is what I want to do, and I think that I can. If I do this, this and this -- then I <i>can</i>!&quot;
  Trust in your own ability, your own experience, based on your success in the past from
  using your intuition or inner voice. Build up more and more faith and confidence in your
  intuition.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thirty years ago I came to America, and for the first
  twenty years here I helped to develop a city temple in Washington, DC, the Washington
  Buddhist Vihara. The Washington Vihara started in the mid-1960&#146;s after a monk, Bope
  Vinita, came to Harvard from Sri Lanka to study comparative religion, and discovered an
  interest in Theravada Buddhism among the American people. A Sri Lankan organization
  sponsored him to return to Washington with a mandate to start a Buddhist society. At that
  time there was not one Theravada Buddhist organization in the United States. He lived in
  rented apartment while looking for a house. Being a popular monk he made friends with many
  people, and formed a society which he registered as &quot;Washington Buddhist Vihara
  Society.&quot; The Thai embassy helped him to locate a building, on 16th Street NW. The
  Sri Lankan government and the Sri Lankan organization which sent him to the United States
  donated one half the cost of the building; Venerable Vinita arranged to borrow the other
  half from a bank. He left Washington, and I stepped into his shoes; we bought the building
  three months later. That is how the vision of an individual began that temple. At the time
  that I stepped into the role of abbot, there were ten members of the Washington Buddhist
  Vihara; by the end of the second decade, there were 2,000 members.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sixteen years ago I began the work of founding the Bhavana
  Society, a monastery and retreat center in the forest in West Virginia. Since the time I
  had arrived in the United States, I had done a lot of traveling, giving Dhamma talks, and
  always I received many questions about how to practice meditation. So I began to dream of
  building a meditation center, to teach meditation. One student of mine received the idea
  with enthusiasm, and offered to help. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he and I started Bhavana, confidence in my intuition
  was all we had. We had no money, no place, and we did not know who would support us. Yet
  we kept thinking and thinking, making plans guided by intuition. Whenever we came across
  the slightest opportunity, we would put our thoughts forward. We would ask questions. We
  would ask people, &quot;Can you support us?&quot; We were gathering information.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">My friend and I formed the Bhavana Society in 1982; a
  lawyer told us we needed at least four people to create a society, therefore we added two
  people; then there were four of us, and a vision, and no money. But we went looking for
  some land. We found a large parcel for over a million dollars, negotiated the price down
  to below a million, and went out fund-raising. In three weeks we ended up traveling 5,000
  miles, raising $5,000, and spending $5,000, exactly. We lost the option of buying that
  land. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We continued to try to raise money, and managed to raise
  $18,000. We went looking again for some land. We planned to meet with a realtor at a
  certain restaurant in a rural area two hours outside of Washington, DC. We looked for the
  man at the restaurant, but he never showed up. Another customer asked us why we were
  looking for that man, and we told him. He offered to show us a 13-acre piece of land for
  sale. It was beautiful, and my co-founder and I decided to buy it if the price was right.
  How much? He asked for $18,000, exactly. We bought it two days later.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we followed our vision, many things like this happened.
  Right when we needed a carpenter with a certain kind of expertise, such a person would
  show up. That sort of thing. At one point, when we were raising funds in hopes of building
  more housing for our center, a neighbor offered to sell to us her house adjacent to our
  property -- and again, the asking price was exactly the amount of money that we had
  raised.</font></p>
  <i><b><font SIZE="4"><p align="left"></font><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Trust
  in the Dhamma</font></b></i></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I always go back to the Buddha&#146;s words, and trust in
  that. He said,</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Dhammo have rakkhati dhammacari<br>
      chattam mahantam yathavassakale.<br>
      Esanisanso dhamme sucinne<br>
      na duggatim gacchati dhammacari.</em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is, when you want to protect the Dhamma, the Dhamma
  protects you. Like when you protect an umbrella, it protects you from sun and rain. When
  you protect the Dhamma it protects you from going into a woeful state of affairs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The one taking initiative in starting a religious
  organization should not put his or her own personal interest before the interest of the
  organization. Do not think about how much you will get out of it, how many people will
  recognize you, and so forth. If you think of your own interest, that is a factor which
  weakens the organization. If you sacrifice personal interest that is a very powerful
  factor that people recognize. People recognize selfless work.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the beginning, in my work with Bhavana, my intentions
  have been pure. In setting up Bhavana I had no idea of making money, gaining fame, getting
  disciples. All I had in mind was to set up a place for people to experience peace, to
  relax, to meditate -- to make an exemplary community. I wanted to see monks and nuns
  everywhere, under every tree, as many trees as in the forest.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As long as we have pure intention, not personal selfish
  motives, we can trust how things will work out. So many unexpected things have happened.
  So many things that are very surprising, and who would have guessed that this or that good
  thing could come about?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, at a Board meeting some months ago, one Board
  member kept making suggestions for ways to raise funds. He wanted to form a committee to
  raise funds to buy land, and wanted to send out letters to urge people to remember us in
  their bequests, and so forth. I said no to all of these things, because I do not want
  people to talk of us as a fund-raising organization. Someone suggested a celebration
  instead, and one member of the Board came up with a marvelous idea for a Tenth Year
  Anniversary celebration, to include a special retreat and opportunity for members to take
  lifelong refuge and vows of basic moral conduct (the Eight Life-Time Precepts.) So we did
  that. It brought attention to us; it showed our members that we are awake, we are doing
  things, and gave everyone an opportunity to reflect upon our considerable accomplishments
  from having started with nothing, and also for them to grow in the Dhamma. It was greatly
  successful in every way, for many of the participants have written me that the event
  served as a turning point in their life. This all came about indirectly from our
  maintaining the integrity of refusing to change our focus from the Dhamma just to make
  money.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some times people may try to abuse our organizational
  principles, to take advantage of us for their personal interest. They get very
  disappointed in us when we refuse. Buddhist organizations should never get involved in
  that sort of thing. Following the basic precepts of not speaking falsely and so forth
  gives great protection in these sorts of situations.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We feel successful and protected because we are working
  for the Dhamma. If people here get into a quarrel, I ask them, Why? You do not quarrel for
  property, nor for positions, nor for profit. There is none of that for anyone here. So<i> </i>they<i>
  </i>have<i> </i>to<i> </i>see<i> </i>that<i> </i>it<i> </i>is<i> </i>just<i> </i>a<i> </i>useless<i>,
  </i>foolish<i> </i>fight<i> </i>just<i> </i>for<i> </i>their<i> </i>egos<i> </i>and<i> </i>they
  have to get rid of that. Our sole purpose is to practice, teach, and learn Dhamma. The
  Buddha said,</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Na tavata dhammadharo - yavata bahu bhasati<br>
    Yo ca appam pi sutavana - dhammam kayena passati,<br>
    Sa ve dhammadharo hoti - yo dhammam nappamajjati.</em></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">his means, &quot;A man is not a Dhamma scholar because he
  is talkative. But, he who lets Dhamma express itself through his behavior, even if he
  knows only a little Dhamma, is, in fact, a good Dhamma scholar.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">People see Dhamma in the behavior of the people here.
  People come and see residents are living in this way -- they can see that the Dhamma is
  doing something in peoples&#146; lives. This is part of how the visitors learn: they learn
  from books, from listening to the teachings, from discussions, and, from our example.</font></p>
  <i><b><font SIZE="4"><p align="left"></font><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Overcoming
  Criticism and Other Obstacles</font></b></i></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The creation of a Buddhist organization requires an
  individual&#146;s vision, energy, perseverance and determination, and his or her diplomacy
  in connecting people. It also takes patience to tolerate all kinds of problems.</font></p>
  <b><u><p></u><font face="Times New Roman">Criticism</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you first try to organize, perhaps starting with
  nothing but your vision, you will be criticized, because people do not know your mind and
  do not yet believe in you. You have to make a few people believe in you and your project.
  If, for example, you contact fifty people, forty-five will reject the project with
  suspicion, and five will believe -- so your initial task is to convince those five. Those
  five must convince more out of the forty-five that you are not a crook and that they have
  seen how you work, and so forth. Then maybe ten people will believe. Later you will have
  fifteen or sixteen out of the fifty people. It may take several years before you have
  another twenty people.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As your project develops, there are some supporters who
  contribute substantially. They give their work, their money, ideas, cooperation, and
  sympathy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, there are others sitting doing nothing for
  your project, who negatively criticize, and try to discourage people. Of those negative
  people, there are one or two who do all they can to destroy the effort. They use their
  time, effort and money to destroy the project. That is their enjoyment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There may be other obstacles such as competition from
  other organizations, but this may not be so bad. The worst problems may be the negative
  individuals. They may be completely ignorant of your character and the means and goals of
  the project, but out of fear and jealousy they want to destroy it. Out of 50 people you
  will find two or three people like this. They are very detrimental. It takes only one
  person to drop a bomb, and they can destroy everything. They have powerful destructive
  force: character assassination and mud slinging, all without one iota of truth, all based
  on irrational suspicion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It happens with all organizations. Even at the very start
  of your effort, some peoples&#146; suspicions may begin. You find yourself in a very
  difficult position. If you try to correct everyone&#146;s wrong ideas, you blow up the
  problem, and cause more people to question your intentions. If you just ignore them, they
  get more and more frustrated, disappointed at the lack of reaction, and they become worse.
  As you go ahead regardless of them, they become more jealous and angry. As you begin to
  show success, they feel guilty, and get upset because they lose face.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no solution to the problem of these kind of
  people. You can just consider them to be part of your project, for they are inevitable.
  You cannot prevent or escape them. It is said that every job takes four people: one to do
  the work, one to support, one to remain silent, and the other to criticize. So when you do
  the work and someone criticizes you, you can feel good, because now you know the job is
  complete. You have done your job, and the criticizer has done his job.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who take the initiative should have a vision or idea
  of &quot;This is what I&#146;m going to do,&quot; without getting disheartened by others.
  Just work, slowly, and gently. I have seen a log splitting machine at work. Each log goes
  into the machine slowly and steadily. The machine stops for nothing. Its pointed tip
  reaches the front end of the log, and with consistent and steady force it slowly pushes
  its way through, not budging for anything. It goes until -- with a great cracking noise --
  it splits the log. That is the kind of charisma the leader should have: consistent,
  steady, and not budging for anything.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, when you hear that &quot;so and so&quot; is upset
  and angry, do not get angry too! Welcome him. If he asks about the project, tell him the
  general information. However, do not irritate him by saying more than is necessary about
  your successes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Do not hold anything against the people who try to stop
  your good work. They will eventually lose interest. Some day they may become your
  supporters. Because you do not insult them and do not close the door on them, you may even
  have the chance to offer them great help in the future.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nothing is always smooth and rosy. To start anything good,
  there is rugged, dry ground to break. </font></p>
  <b><u><p></u><font face="Times New Roman">The Need for Discipline</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Religious organizations have to have discipline. They must
  at least have Five Precepts, for people to build upon. With a moral foundation of the Five
  Precepts, keeping and enforcing them, problems of various kinds can be avoided -- such as
  drunkenness or illegal activities within your organization. You avoid embarrassment and
  people losing faith in the organization. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In our organization we keep more than the Five Precepts.
  Monastics at Bhavana Society maintain monastic discipline, the rules of the Vinaya given
  by the Buddha.. Lay residents and visitors keep Eight Precepts, which are the basic Five
  Precepts with rules added such as not to engage in any sexual behavior, not to take food
  after noon, and not to indulge in certain entertainments (including watching shows and
  dancing.) This gives a solid foundation for our practice and our purpose, and helps to
  avoid even more problems than the Five Precepts help to avoid.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of the protection of the precepts, we do not get
  side-tracked by things which do not fit in with our purposes. For example, we do not get
  caught up in entertainment. We do not feel tempted to have a dance at the temple. Many
  times people try to donate a television to us. I see the advantages to having a
  television; we could watch spiritual movies, and see videos of our own events. But that is
  just the beginning. Soon we would be watching nature videos. Then the next level: a very
  beautiful movie, perhaps on the culture of another country. The standard would keep
  getting lowered. Maybe eventually we would have movies of a sort which would stun a
  visitor. Once you start, there is no control.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">No matter how pure the behavior of the group,
  misinformation and rumors can arise and spread very easily. A member of our Board of
  Directors, while visiting an Asian country, attended a meeting with other Buddhists from
  America. Various retreat centers were discussed, but he did not mention his association
  with Bhavana Society. When the name of Bhavana Society came up, a woman exclaimed,
  &quot;Oh, that is the place where they had that Japanese tea ceremony.&quot; She heard
  somewhere that this event had happened. Our member told her that he had been with Bhavana
  since its very beginning, and had never seen such a ceremony at Bhavana. Even where there
  is no basis for a story, it may spread. With even the slightest thing, people can blow it
  up. Thus it is important not to start any behavior that strays outside of your goals or
  outside of the precepts, so that there is nothing that leads to damaging talk.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">People have suggested that we allow people to stay here
  keeping only Five Precepts. That way, couples could stay here together, and we could have
  families with their children as part of our community. However, I know of a place which
  allowed this, and had couples as part of their community. One wife had an affair with
  another man, and the husband told the leader that he wanted to murder the man. The abbot
  said, &quot;There is no &#145;killer&#146; and no &#145;killed&#146;, so do what you want
  to do.&quot; So the husband killed the man, and buried him on the property. The leader was
  arrested, fined, and sent to prison; later he was released on the provision that he not
  live at the community&#146;s property. I visited the center while the leader was staying
  nearby, outside of the property.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you allow people to live together, and allow sex, you
  always have to expect jealousy and thousands of problems. At Bhavana, families can come
  for a visit, but the man and the woman cannot stay in the same room. Couples have come
  here for their honeymoons -- and stayed in separate cottages.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If people who come here do not want to discipline
  themselves in accordance with the precepts, and we insist upon it, perhaps they will not
  come. That is okay. Then we will simply have a smaller number of people. It would just
  mean that we cut down on extra activities. We do not have to relax our discipline to
  attract more people. If only monks and nuns stay here, we will continue our meditation
  practice, and follow discipline. We can convert from retreat center to monastery at any
  time. Of course, people always come. People have a tremendous respect for discipline.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">People expect discipline from their leaders. Look at what
  happened with President Clinton. As President he could have thousands of women, but he is
  expected to have discipline and not sleep with anyone he chooses. The whole nation
  expected it. Even though they themselves cannot keep discipline, there is real respect for
  it. We want to respect that respect. Even thieves, and those who break all the rules,
  respect discipline in others. When they are emotional or disturbed, they may say they do
  not care, but when they return to normal they do care. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Religious organizations especially must keep discipline.
  People look up to religious organizations, and expect higher standards from them. There
  have been a lot of problems with meditation centers in the United States, abuse of power
  by teachers who make students their victims. The students may temporarily enjoy the
  pleasure, and may even think it is a special blessing, but when they come back to their
  normal senses, they loathe it. They think, &quot;How can he be a religious person, a
  leader, if he did such &amp; such to me? . . . and what else does he do?&quot; Also,
  jealousy and other suffering happen within the community. The religious organization
  should not have lower standards, but should be a beacon. <i>Thus, you can see how
  establishing a basis for discipline plays an important role in the success of the
  organization.</i></font><b></p>

  ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES</font></b></p>
  <i><p align="left"><b><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Why a Buddhist
  Organization in the US Can Thrive</font></b></i></p>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Religious Freedom</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">America truly is a melting pot. Many early settlers came
  to this country to seek religious freedom. The forefathers of this country had great
  foresight to establish religious freedom in the Constitution. Anything can be successful
  in this country because of the unlimited freedom provided by the Constitution.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although about 80 % of Americans are Christian, and there
  are many fundamentalists and fanatics, there is great tolerance for other religions. I do
  not know of any other country in which there are so many fanatics among the majority
  religion, yet in which the law provides so much protection for diverse religions. Even if
  someone wants to start the one thing most horrifying to Christians, a devil-worshipping
  church, it can be done. The American Constitution is so generous, it allows anything.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, when a certain religious leader in another
  country drew world-wide attention by his acts of opposition to the United States, and had
  American flags publicly burned and so forth, Americans felt outraged, and patriotic
  feelings were strong. During that tense time, some students of that country in America --
  who were enjoying the benefits of living in America and receiving an education here --
  demonstrated against the United States. A proposal went before Congress to have the
  students deported. Congress decided that the students have the right to express their
  opinion, and that it would be un-American to deport them. The Representatives said,
  &quot;We don't want to bite the dog that bites us.&quot; So, they did nothing. We don't
  know what could have happened to the students in any other country.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">America has such noble principles. Thus any religious
  organization can thrive here, provided that it abides by the legal code and tax
  regulations, and<i> </i>also<i> </i>so<i> </i>long<i> </i>as<i> </i>there<i> </i>is<i> </i>not<i>
  </i>a<i> </i>language<i> </i>barrier<i> </i>preventing<i> </i>communication<i>.</i></font><b><u></p>
  <p></u><font face="Times New Roman">Curiosity</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The American people are very curious. They can afford to
  spend the money and time to investigate, to satisfy their curiosity. When something new
  comes here they want to know: What is this? The country is new relative to other countries
  in the world. It is like a teenager. The people have a lot of energy<i>. </i>Buddhism<i> </i>is<i>
  </i>new<i> </i>to<i> </i>America<i>, </i>and<i> </i>interest<i> </i>in<i> </i>Buddhism<i> </i>is<i>
  </i>strong<i>. </i>Many<i>, </i>many<i> </i>people<i> </i>are<i> </i>reading<i> </i>books<i>
  </i>and<i> </i>going<i> </i>to<i> </i>meditation<i> </i>centers<i> </i>for<i> </i>the<i> </i>first<i>
  </i>time<i>, </i>to<i> </i>find<i> </i>out<i> </i>what<i> </i>Buddhism<i> </i>is<i> </i>about<i>.</font></p>
  <b><font SIZE="4"><p align="left"></font><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Special
  Challenges When Organizing in the United States</font></b></i></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Problems with the Neighbors</b></font><font SIZE="4"></p>
  <p></font><font face="Times New Roman">Although the Constitution gives noble principles,
  not all individuals uphold these principles. In starting a Buddhist organization in
  America, which is mostly Christian, one must be very tactful. Stick to the fundamental
  Buddhist principle of peacefulness. If you cause fights and quarrels to arise, peace will
  go into &quot;pieces&quot;! If the non-Buddhists feel that we are a threat to them, they
  get upset. Buddhism is not viewed as a theistic religion, thus theist religious people may
  oppose our presence. Also, some fear that a Buddhist organization may be some kind of
  cult. Buddhism still is not viewed as mainstream, though it is slowly entering the
  mainstream. Some people fear and suspect anything they do not understand; anything new is
  a threat.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some Buddhist temples have burned down. I recall one that
  burned in Boston about ten or twelve years ago. It was a beautiful Japanese temple set on
  a hill, which the people had poured millions of dollars into building. It burned down the
  day after its opening ceremony.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is important to contact the neighbors in a friendly
  way, to make them understand what you are doing, before you build anything. Instead of
  setting up the organization all of a sudden, you must be tactful, mindful and peaceful. A
  friend of mine and co-founder of Bhavana Society has begun to set up a forest monastery in
  Virginia, in a rural and very religious area. After selecting the land, before he even
  bought it, he held public hearings about his plans to build a monastery on that site. The
  neighbors came, and they voiced some objections at first. My friend worked things out with
  the neighbors, and slowly they all agreed to accept the project.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Despite America&#146;s generosity and freedoms, people are
  still people, and have their weaknesses. At most centers I know, the closest neighbor
  remains very upset. One time when a non-Christian religious group bought five acres to set
  up a community, the nearest neighbor felt so strongly about it that he set up a butcher
  shop just to upset them (the group was strictly vegetarian.) The group did not react. Over
  time, they slowly bought up the surrounding properties and settled their followers onto
  them. When they held the surrounding 1000 acres, the man had to shut down the butcher shop
  because no buyers of meat lived close enough. He sold his land to the community. That was
  a very peaceful way of doing things. The group now holds 7000 acres in that area. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I know of a center in Florida that has a neighbor who
  starts a chainsaw or his lawnmower to disturb the meditators whenever there is a retreat.
  At a Vietnamese temple in Washington, DC, the neighbor asked them to remove their sign.
  They asked him whether he would object to the sign if it were a Christian group, and he
  said that he would not object it if they were Christian.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bhavana Society&#146;s experience has been typical. Our
  neighbors were unsure at first, but when people came to understand what this place is,
  they became friendly. Yet, like other centers, our immediate neighbor remains unfriendly.
  When we first held a retreat on the land, before the buildings were built, our unhappy
  neighbor came out and sang Christian devotional songs. She was disappointed that we
  enjoyed her beautiful voice. For our next retreat, the family beat on drums over a
  loudspeaker. We said nothing but the other neighbors complained to the Sheriff, and they
  had to stop. When the unhappy neighbor lady tried to start a petition against us, a
  friendly neighbor called all the other neighbors and asked them not to sign it, and they
  did not.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The family next door has done many things but we have
  remained peaceful. Sometimes they played rock music over loudspeakers on celebration days,
  when we had many visitors. The neighbor man used to shout &quot;Stop ringing that bloody
  durn gong!&quot; when we would ring the gong at 5:00 AM. He eventually stopped shouting.
  On a few occasions the neighbor shot a gun aimed over the head of one of our monks. Over
  time, they calmed down, and the incidents became fewer. A few months ago the
  neighbor&#146;s son, who is now in college, dropped by and apologized that he used to
  oppose us. (He used to spread rumors among the children that we were eating human flesh.)
  We used to tell our visitors not to walk on the lane between our properties, to avoid
  stirring up the neighbors. Recently we bought a house and property adjacent to the back of
  our land and also partly adjacent to our unhappy neighbor. As one of our visitors walked
  to the new house last week the lady shouted at her that we should go away. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Constitution shows America&#146;s official
  open-mindedness, and I think that the law is executed without discrimination. However,
  individuals have their weaknesses, and we have to watch out for that.</font></p>
  <b><u><p></u><font face="Times New Roman">The Legal System</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To become successful in the U S, you must abide by the
  legal code. There<i> </i>are<i> </i>federal<i> </i>rules<i>, </i>state<i> </i>rules<i>, </i>and<i>
  </i>local<i> </i>rules<i>. </i>The<i> </i>state<i> </i>and<i> </i>local<i> </i>rules<i> </i>differ<i>,
  </i>depending<i> </i>upon<i> </i>where<i> </i>you<i> </i>are<i> </i>setting<i> </i>up<i> </i>your<i>
  </i>organization<i>. </i>You<i> </i>must<i> </i>take<i> </i>the<i> </i>time<i> </i>to<i> </i>learn<i>
  </i>all<i> </i>these<i> </i>rules<i>.</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You need a lawyer at the very beginning to help you
  through the process. In forming the organization you must follow a certain paperwork
  process, step by step. Do not try to evade the legal procedure. You must draw up your
  by-laws and so forth. You must register your organization with<i> </i>the<i> </i>state<i>,
  </i>and<i> </i>you<i> </i>must<i> </i>renew<i> </i>the<i> </i>registration<i> </i>every<i>
  </i>year<i>. </i>Some<i> </i>states<i> </i>also<i> </i>require<i> </i>annual<i> </i>financial<i>
  </i>report<i>. </i>There<i> </i>are<i> </i>many<i> </i>things<i> </i>like<i> </i>this<i> </i>that<i>
  </i>you<i> </i>need<i> </i>to<i> </i>know<i>.</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a federal tax exemption for charitable
  organizations as part of U S policy -- you have to look at the various ways to get the tax
  exemption. For example, if you are completely a religious organization, you get one tax
  exemption, if educational you get another; if you are a non-profit you get a different
  exemption, and if a religious non-profit you get yet another. At<i> </i>Bhavana<i> </i>Society<i>
  </i>we<i> </i>chose<i> </i>to<i> </i>incorporate<i> </i>as<i> </i>a<i> &quot;</i>non<i>-</i>profit<i>&quot;
  </i>organization<i>, </i>but<i> </i>we<i> </i>continue<i> </i>to<i> </i>debate<i> </i>whether<i>
  </i>to<i> </i>change<i> </i>to<i> </i>a<i> &quot;</i>religious<i>&quot; </i>classification<i>.
  </i>All<i> </i>of<i> </i>these<i> </i>ways<i> </i>of<i> </i>categorizing<i> </i>your<i> </i>organization<i>
  </i>give<i> </i>different<i> </i>benefits<i>, </i>and<i> </i>may<i> </i>give<i> </i>some<i>
  </i>unexpected<i> </i>impact<i> </i>in<i> </i>the<i> </i>future<i>, </i>so<i> </i>it<i> </i>is<i>
  </i>important<i> </i>to<i> </i>get<i> </i>good<i> </i>legal<i> </i>advice<i>.</font></p>
  <p></i><font face="Times New Roman">You<i> </i>must<i> </i>file<i> </i>federal<i> </i>Income<i>
  </i>Tax<i> </i>forms<i> </i>with<i> </i>the<i> </i>IRS<i> </i>every<i> </i>year<i> -- </i>and<i>
  </i>if<i> </i>you<i> </i>fail<i> </i>to<i> </i>send<i> </i>in<i> </i>all<i> </i>of<i> </i>the<i>
  </i>proper<i> </i>forms<i>, </i>years<i> </i>later<i> </i>you<i> </i>may<i> </i>be<i> </i>hit<i>
  </i>with<i> </i>tens<i> </i>of<i> </i>thousands<i> </i>of<i> </i>dollars<i> </i>of<i> </i>penalties<i>
  (</i>even<i> </i>though<i> </i>your<i> </i>group<i> </i>did<i> </i>not<i> </i>actually<i> </i>owe<i>
  </i>taxes<i> </i>for<i> </i>those<i> </i>years<i>.) </i>Recently at Bhavana Society we
  received notice from the IRS (federal tax department) that we had failed to send in
  certain required forms for several years. I immediately contacted a lawyer, and was
  prepared to pay him for whatever work it took to clear up the problem. I did not want to
  take any risks with the taxing authority; our records should be completely clear.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you will serve food at your organization, you have to
  obey certain Health Department codes. You have to follow certain Building codes when
  putting up your buildings. You have to follow regulations in your sewer system and in
  treating your water if you are not in a city system. For example, even if your members do
  not want chlorine, you must put it into your water, because the government insists upon
  it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When choosing land to buy for your organization, find out
  about the zoning. Zoning regulations forbid or allow certain kinds of buildings
  (industrial, housing, retail business, and so forth) in certain areas. You can petition to
  get a zoning ordinance changed to allow you to build your center. Do not take the risk of
  carelessly building in violation of the zoning ordinance.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some states have more strict rules than others. Also, some
  states are more strict in enforcing<i> </i>the rules that they have<i>. </i>Hence, you
  must know what kind of state you are in. For example, in Massachusetts the building codes
  are so strict that some meditation centers are still trying to build kutis (cottages), and
  they cannot. In West Virginia we can have &quot;rustic&quot; buildings -- buildings
  lacking plumbing and electricity -- hence we were able to build our small simple, fairly
  traditional kutis (cottages) for solitary meditators. I think that &quot;rustic&quot;
  facilities are also allowed in some other states. Another example is the state property
  tax: I found in Washington, DC that the temple could get an exemption for state property
  tax, but in West Virginia, a temple cannot. Also note that in certain states you can get
  state sales tax deductions on certain items (exactly which items may depend upon how your
  group is classified in your federal tax paperwork; in West Virginia there are more
  deductions for a non-profit than for a religious group.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also<i>, </i>be<i> </i>aware<i> </i>that<i> </i>some<i> </i>cities<i>
  </i>have<i> </i>extremely<i> </i>strict<i> </i>rules<i>, </i>especially<i> </i>when<i> </i>it<i>
  </i>comes<i> </i>to<i> </i>putting<i> </i>up<i> </i>buildings<i>.</i></font><b><u></p>
  <p></u><font face="Times New Roman">The Complex Society</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Everything is more difficult at the beginning than it is,
  say, ten years later. At first you must contact the correct people at the correct time,
  accepting and making use of their kindness and generosity to start things, and getting
  used to the new system. Through trial and error we learn to find easy ways of doing
  things. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It<i> </i>is<i> </i>especially<i> </i>confusing<i> </i>at<i>
  </i>first<i> </i>in<i> </i>a<i> </i>competitive<i> </i>society<i>, </i>for<i> </i>there<i>
  </i>are<i> </i>so<i> </i>many<i> </i>choices<i> </i>on<i> </i>how<i> </i>to<i> </i>do<i> </i>things<i>.</i>
  For example, choosing a telephone long distance service company. One company approaches
  you and offers certain terms, rates and services, and you accept that company. Then
  another company approaches you and offers some kind of custom service and useful options.
  Perhaps its services seem more convenient than the other company. So, you have to choose.
  Perhaps you decide to change to the second company. Then the first company does something
  to try to get you back as a customer, such as offering better rates. There<i> </i>are<i> </i>endless<i>
  </i>administrative<i> </i>decisions<i> </i>such<i> </i>as<i> </i>these<i> </i>to<i> </i>make<i>,
  </i>to<i> </i>try<i> </i>to<i> </i>save<i> </i>money<i> </i>and<i> </i>make<i> </i>things<i>
  </i>convenient<i>.</i> Also, you need make sure that sales people do not take advantage of
  your lack of knowledge and charge you far more than they would another customer.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When coming to a new country and trying to start your
  organization, you do not know much about these things. You have to contact someone who is
  knowledgeable of these things. Get advice; find out how other organizations do things.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In your initial search, gathering information, you must
  learn the right questions to ask, to get the right answers. For example, you need to know
  about insurance: auto insurance, health insurance, buildings insurance (against fire and
  other damage), premises<i> </i>liability<i> (</i>in<i> </i>case<i> </i>someone<i> </i>falls<i>
  </i>down<i> </i>and<i> </i>sues<i> </i>you<i>), </i>and coverage for the Board of
  Directors. Then you have to contact the insurance companies, and maybe later change the
  company if the policies are not good. At Bhavana, ten years after opening, we are still
  readjusting these things.</font></p>
  <b><u><p></u><font face="Times New Roman">Less Support in America</font></b><font SIZE="4"></p>
  <p></font><font face="Times New Roman">In Asian Buddhist countries the lay people take
  care of much of the work in the temples. Lay people are always there to offer support.
  They bring food, cook, offer goods, pay the bills, sponsor buildings, make repairs, and so
  forth. In the temple in which I lived for years in Malaysia, lay people did work all day
  long. Whenever a monk wanted to go somewhere, a lay person drove him, or the monk would
  use a taxi which was paid monthly by the temple&#146;s supporting organization. It was
  very easy and convenient.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This kind of physical support is hard to find in America.
  Americans offer support in the form of money. I was not completely surprised by this, for
  I saw money offered in temples in other countries before I came to America, and I know
  this is the trend around the world. However, I see four strong reasons for this to happen
  in America. The first reason is Americans&#146; lack of time. Although they may be able to
  take nice, long vacations, on a day-to-day basis they are rushed just trying to survive.
  They spend more time driving on the road and working in the office than they spend at
  home; volunteering their time at the temple usually means sacrificing time at home with
  their families. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second reason is the lack of a Buddhist tradition in
  America. Unless the temple is located in the heart of an ethnic Buddhist community, it
  will not serve as the local community center the way it may in countries with a long
  Buddhist tradition. There is no such thing as a Buddhist temple serving an American
  village. Almost everywhere in America, most local people are Christian. Supporters of the
  Buddhist organization are spread out over great distances. Most of the supporters must
  travel a long way to come to the temple. At Bhavana, many of our supporters come from out
  of the state, even hundreds of miles, to visit Bhavana. Many of my students keep in touch
  with me as a teacher, by E-mail, fax, letter, or telephone, and by seeing me when I visit
  their cities. Dropping in regularly to help with the upkeep of the temple is impossible
  for many of the devout Buddhists.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third reason comes from a cultural difference between
  American people and Asian people. Americans prefer to plan everything in advance,
  including who will be responsible for certain chores. They have difficulty adapting to the
  flexible approach taken in a traditional temple, where people will come and see a job
  needing to be done, and take care of it. The American needs to be invited to do the task,
  because the American is afraid of annoying someone who had a particular plan for doing
  that task. However, monks are supposed to discipline themselves not to ask for things on
  their own behalf, and there is the problem. The American will not work without being
  asked, and the monk will not ask.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth reason is that Americans have enough money to
  offer money to the temple. Hence, they offer money. In some ways this turns the tradition
  on its head. Traditionally, lay people come to the temples to support the meditative life
  of the monks and nuns. Here, the monks and nuns use lay peoples&#146; donated money for
  purchasing groceries and other necessities, but they themselves do the work of the temple.
  Then --when they have time -- the lay people come and enjoy meditation practice at the
  temple -- supported by the work of the monks and nuns. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To start the Washington Vihara, we monks had to do things
  by ourselves. After we bought the building, it had to be repaired. It was run down, with
  bad plumbing, broken window, broken walls, broken roof, everything broken. We asked for
  building materials -- nobody brought them. We asked people to help -- nobody came to help.
  We had to buy things. We had to clean, cook, get groceries, and do office work. I had to
  walk nearly an hour to get to the lumber store, and then I had to carry the wood back on
  my shoulder. We had to mow the lawn, or the neighbors would complain. We had to collect
  money for the mortgage. We did not have enough money to hire people; we had to do all by
  ourselves.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We monks were not trained in administrative work,
  secretarial work, carpentry, cooking, and such things. We had to do what we could,
  learning by trial and error. Volunteers did not come.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In setting up Bhavana Society, the situation was the same:
  most of the work, including designing and setting up the buildings, has been done by the
  monks. However, in recent years we have been able to hire men to do a few building
  projects. In the last several years much of the housekeeping work has been done by lay
  residents who planned to ordain.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You may wonder how the Theravada monks can do all these
  things, because we believe in strictly following the Vinaya. We did these things only to
  get the temple started, and the rules we broke were only the rules that do not hurt
  anybody, such as not handling money and not to drive a car. Actually, there was never any
  rule against driving a car, of course; the Buddha told the monks not to ride animals or be
  pulled in a cart by animals, out of compassion, because they are living beings. With the
  modern car, you are the only animal.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some of the rules are just tools of etiquette. So among
  these <u>minor </u>rules, it may be acceptable. These must not be rules which concern our
  main principles of non-harm, non-greed, and non-hatred. For example, in Buddhist
  countries, in the public eye it seems inappropriate for a monk to drive a car. In Western
  society, it does not seem inappropriate to people. They would criticize if we used an
  expensive car, or if we used it just for pleasure. If we use a car just to get important
  things done, and provided we use it without clinging or craving for it, there is no
  problem. I personally approve of these kinds of adaptations.</font></p>
  <b><u><p></u><font face="Times New Roman">Turnover</font></b><i></p>
  <p></i><font face="Times New Roman">In<i> </i>Asian<i> </i>Buddhist<i> </i>countries<i>, </i>the<i>
  </i>same<i> </i>people<i> </i>will<i> </i>support<i> </i>a<i> </i>temple<i> </i>for<i> </i>many<i>
  </i>years<i>. </i>A<i> </i>person<i> </i>will<i> </i>stay<i> </i>with<i> </i>one<i> </i>organization<i>
  </i>or<i> </i>one<i> </i>temple<i> </i>unless<i> </i>something<i> </i>drastic<i> </i>happens<i>.
  </i>In<i> </i>America<i>, </i>people<i> </i>do<i> </i>not<i> </i>stay<i> </i>involved<i> </i>with<i>
  </i>the<i> </i>temple<i> </i>for<i> </i>a<i> </i>long<i> </i>period<i> </i>of<i> </i>time.
  They either move away, or they lose interest. American peoples&#146; interest dwindles
  after about two years. They may be very deeply involved, but after about two years they
  slowly withdraw. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have noticed that in the last thirty or so years
  Americans have become &quot;spiritual shoppers&quot;. They like to shop around for a
  spiritual taste. They are like tea tasters, specialists who taste tea at the factory. The
  tea taster does not smoke or drink and so forth, and he tastes tiny amounts of tea all
  day, comparing the flavors. Americans are like that. They keep tasting spiritual
  experiences.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Americans always look for new things: new ground, new
  people, new food, new fashion, new cars, new friends. It is like the American dynamic,
  disposable economy. This also happens among the schools of Buddhism; there are lots of
  Buddhist organizations. People go to one organization which is perhaps more traditional,
  then to another which is more ritualistic, and so forth. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Temples traditionally do not keep mailing lists,
  membership lists, donation lists -- these things are typical of the West. In Asian
  countries people do not think about whether they are a &quot;member&quot; of the temple.
  They just happen to go there, and keep going, and feel that this is the temple to which
  they belong. If you ask a visitor whether he is a &quot;member&quot; of the temple, he
  will be offended. The temple is open to everyone; if you can bring food or money to offer,
  you take it there, or if you decide to participate in some way, you do so. You do not give
  dues, or receive membership cards, and you do not receive &quot;reminders&quot; to donate
  money.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because the supporters constantly change, Buddhist
  organizations in America have to adapt to doing things in a Western way. When new people
  come, the Buddhist organization will put them onto the mailing list, and send them a
  newsletter, and will encourage them to send in money to become a &quot;member&quot; (or
  &quot;supporter&quot; or &quot;patron&quot; depending on the amount of money). Once a
  member, most organizations will send them the reminders to &quot;keep up their dues.&quot;
  Also, the mailing list must be continually updated. Every time we send out our newsletter,
  we receive a dozen of them back as undeliverable because people have moved -- and the
  Postal Service charges us a fee for the inconvenience.</font></p>
  <b><u><p></u><font face="Times New Roman">An American Monastic Retreat Center</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because Buddhism is so new to America, American Buddhist
  organizations are primarily: temples established by Buddhist immigrants to serve as ethnic
  cultural centers, and meditation centers that dispense with traditional customs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The temples usually are run solely by ethnic groups to
  meet their cultural needs. They conduct religious services and give Dhamma talks in their
  own native languages, and even answer the telephone in their native language. Everything
  revolves around their traditional customs, in their rituals and chanting, food, manners
  and behavior patterns. These temples will import monks from their home countries, and do
  not have much interest in ordaining local people.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Developing a Buddhist organization in a multicultural
  society is more difficult than it is in my home country. The community starting a temple
  may wish to have an ethnic community center, and feel disappointed or threatened when
  other groups of people change the atmosphere of the temple. These tensions call for great
  diplomacy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of requirements of the legal system, the Board of
  Directors of a charitable organization has a lot of control over that organization. Thus
  struggles for power in the organization may take place among groups trying to get their
  preferred people onto the Board of Directors. I have seen the ethnic composition of
  temples&#146; Boards of Directors change to reflect the group that has the most influence
  in the temple. One temple&#146;s Board of Directors at one time was composed of one-third
  Americans, one-third Burmese, and one-third Sri Lankans; in recent years it has been
  completely of one ethnic group.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most American meditation centers are run by either local
  American Buddhist organizations or immigrants. They conduct their meditation retreats in
  English or their native languages and the participants come from all races and countries. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are very few Buddhist monastic organizations, which
  are established in order to help people interested in getting ordained as monks and nuns
  and live monastic lives. Since coming to this country three decades ago, I have been
  fortunate in getting involved in two such organizations. One, the Washington Vihara, was a
  city temple; the other, Bhavana Society, is a very unusual combination of both monastery
  and retreat center. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At Bhavana Society, we maintain monastic discipline and
  ordain and train Westerners as monks and nuns. We also hold formal retreats open to the
  public. In creating the Bhavana Society, I made it very clear from the start that this
  would not be any ethnic community center or cultural center. Much of the cultural
  trappings cannot be found here. I wanted it to be a place that people of all traditions
  and countries feel comfortable coming to visit. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I am the only Sinhalese monk in residence. Our eight monks
  and two nuns come from seven different countries; three of us are Asian people and seven
  of us are Westerners. Still, all the residents here must be very careful, very sensitive,
  because visitors are sometimes very quick to feel that they are being discriminated
  against. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The cooperation of the various communities offers great
  strength to Bhavana Society. The majority of daily visitors and retreatants are Americans.
  Because of the presence of monks and nuns, although we do not engage much in Asian
  cultural trappings, we attract visitors who grew up in Theravada Buddhist countries, who
  come for the traditional observances and rituals of their home countries.</font></p>
  <i><p></i><font face="Times New Roman">In<i> </i>some<i> </i>ways<i> </i>a<i> </i>retreat<i>
  </i>center<i> </i>is<i> </i>easier<i> </i>than<i> </i>a<i> </i>temple<i>. </i>Temples
  serve the role of a community center. Many Asian visitors to temples in America will visit
  the temple in order to connect with people and symbols of their homeland; thus the temples
  also serve as a cultural center.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A retreat center can have more structure than a temple.
  The people who come are mostly serious meditators, who like to discipline themselves to
  meditate and keep silence. They follow whatever structure you give them for the day: when
  to meditate, when to eat, when to practice yoga, when to work, and so forth. They do not
  try to express their opinions about things. In a ritualistic temple, there is not much of
  a schedule. With no organized activities, and without any attempt at keeping silence, it
  becomes very noisy, like a congested center of a city. Hundreds of people assemble and
  each talk. They have come for socializing -- to see friends and acquaintances, and to make
  new friends, so they keep talking. It is the very nature of a cultural center. The
  visitors are very emotionally charged, and boisterous. One staying there cannot even read
  quietly, much less meditate. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have dispensed with much cultural trapping and most of
  our daily visitors and retreatants are American. However, because there are monks here, we
  do occasionally experience cultural flavor. People from Buddhist countries will come on
  full-moon days, or to offer lunch to dedicate the merit to someone who has died, and so
  forth. During silent retreats some visitors may show up who want to follow some particular
  custom from their home country. Occasionally during a silent retreat the dining hall is
  filled with completely silent American meditators who are eating slowly and mindfully,
  while in the adjoining hall several families of people from an Asian country sit
  boisterously chatting, with their children running around. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These visitors never make an appointment to go to the
  temple; such a thing is not done in their home country. They just pack up things to
  donate, and go. They assume monks and nuns will be there, and they want to see them,
  perhaps to get advice from them, or to give dana (donations). If no monks or nuns are
  present, they will wait a while, and return home, and try again later. When we ask people
  to call in advance to make sure we will be here, they say that they never did such a thing
  in their home country. They want to maintain that cultural source of comfort. They expect
  the temple to be completely open with volunteers coming and going, not with set office
  hours, times to sign up for appointments, rest periods and scheduled times of silence.
  Even if they are coming from 100 miles away, especially if they have a visitor from the
  home country, they will plan to come to visit Bhavana, and it will not even occur to them
  to call first.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is not easy to stop that, and I do not want to stop
  that, because there is no way to do it! Because of their sense of devotion, the visitors
  want to cook by their own hands and serve to the monks by their own hands. The American
  lay residents working in the kitchen have to develop a flexible mind, because the
  unannounced visitors will take over the kitchen. The residents learn to develop
  appreciation and gratitude for the good intentions of our visitors.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have heard it said many times that Americans do not
  offer money unless a specific amount is required of them; for example, it is said that
  they will not pay anything for a retreat unless there is an admission fee. That is not
  what I have seen.<u> </u>I am very happy to report that Buddhist centers in the U S can
  operate successfully on a completely dana (donation) basis. There are thriving centers
  which do not charge money for anything.<u> </u></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At Bhavana Society, we do not charge money for anything. I
  want to do things, myself, in the spirit of dana. I want to give without charging
  anything. People recognize this, so they also want to give. If you ask them to pay you,
  they will want you to pay them back. Then, at times when you cannot do anything for them,
  they will not want to do anything for you. They will see giving to you as being
  unproductive. That is the result of a materialistic, capitalistic system, a system in
  which old people are pushed aside as being unproductive. It is better to never mix the
  teaching of the Buddha&#146;s message with these strong forces --<u> </u>especially in
  America. Relying on dana, on peoples&#146; generosity, is so rare and special here, that
  it opens up peoples&#146; hearts and minds. It makes a very powerful statement in this
  country. People respond almost with awe that we would operate with such faith and
  devotion. They feel more trusting because we clearly are not trying to take something from
  them. Thus their minds become more receptive to the Dhamma.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Do all, give everything you have, free. Then, when you
  cannot do something, people will still want to give in return. They will remember ever
  after you are dead: &quot;this is how he worked and this is how we want to work, to follow
  this principle.&quot; Dana is a way to express self-lessness. On this basis, I work.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have heard some complaints about a temple, that when
  visitors first step inside they hear about money. They hear, &quot;We have this project,
  and that project. . .&quot; People feel embarrassed. At many, many places, on days when
  there is a special function, they will have tables out waiting for people to come. When
  the visitor gives some money at the table, it is announced loudly, &quot;So-and-So donated
  such-and-such (amount of money).&quot; Those who hear it feel embarrassed and feel they
  must give something to get their names announced. They think, &quot;He gave five dollars,
  so I will give <u>six</u> dollars.&quot; This is manipulating peoples&#146; greed and ego.
  One time I saw a head monk take the mike and read the list of donors and the amount each
  had given, and then publicly question those present whose names had not made it to the
  list.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I find the American people to be generous. Even if they
  just stop in to look around, they will at least put a dollar into the donation box. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, keep in mind the effects of the economy. If the
  economy is good, that is the time that people give the most donations. If people can
  hardly make ends meet, how can they make donations? Donations will be the last things of
  the list of their priorities. It is a phenomenon of the American economic system.</font></p>
