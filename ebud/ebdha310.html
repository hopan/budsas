      <I>Dipavamsa</I> (<I>Chronicle of the Island</I>, 4th century A.C.), <I>
      Mahavamsa</I> (<I>Great Chronicle</I>, 5th century A.C.) and the <I>

      &#39;Theravada,&#39; &#39;Teriya&#39; or &#39;Therika&#39; were for the first time introduced into 
      the history of Buddhism after the first Council (Synod) held at Rajagaha 
      (Rajagriha) three months after the Buddha&#39;s Parinirvana. At this Council, 
      attended by five hundred Arahants who were immediate disciples of the 
      Buddha and presided over by Mahakassapa Thera, all the teachings of the 
      Buddha, both the Dhamma and the Vinaya, were recited during seven months 
      and unanimously accepted as the genuine teaching of the Master. What was 
      approved and agree upon at this Council was designated as &#39;Theravada&#39; 
      (&#39;Orthodoxy of the Elders&#39;) or &#39;Theriya&#39; or &#39;Therika&#39; (&#39;Tradition of the 
      Elders&#39;).<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><A NAME="5"></A><A HREF="#05">[5]</A></FONT>
      </P>
      <P>Mahayana came into being several centuries later, about beginning of 
      the Christian Era, and most of the early Mahayana Scripture were composed 
      during the following few centuries. But Mahayana was elaborated and 
      formulated as a system of Buddhist philosophy by two great Masters who 
      might be considered as the founders of the two principal Mahayana schools: 
      Nagarjuna (second century A.C.) established the Madhyamika system with his 
      famous <I>Mulamadhymaka-karika</I> in which sunyata (voidness) philosophy 
      is discussed and his enormous commentary on the <I>Prajnaparamita</I> is 
      found. Asanga (fourth century A.C.) established the Yogacara-vijnanavada 
      system with this monumental work <I>Yogacarabhumisastra</I>, consisting of 
      17 books. </P>
      <P>Here a clarification of the terms Theravada (Orthodoxy of the Elders), 
      Hinayana (Small Vehicle) and Mahayana (Great Vehicle) may be desirable and 
      helpful. Hinayana and Mahayana are not known in the Theravada Pali 
      literature. They are not found in the Pali Canon (<I>Tipitaka</I>) nor in 
      the Commentaries on the <I>Tipitaka</I>, not even in the Pali Chronicles 
      of Sri Lanka, the <I>Dipavamsa</I> and the <I>Mahavamsa</I>. </P>
      <P>It is universally accepted by scholars that the terms Hinayana and 
      Mahayana are later inventions by Mahayanists. Theravada cannot be included 
      in either of these divisions. Historically speaking Theravada already 
      existed long before these two terms came into being. This same Theravada, 
      considered to be the original teaching of the Buddha, was introduced to 
      Sri Lanka and firmly established there in the third century B.C. during 
      the time of Emperor Asoka of India. At that time there was nothing called 
      Mahayana. This appeared several centuries later. Without Mahayana there 
      could be no Hinayana. The Buddhism that went to Sri Lanka, with its <I>
      Tipitaka</I> and Commentaries approved and accepted by the Third Council 
      in the third century B.C., remained there intact as Theravada, and did not 
      enter the scene of the Hinayana-Mahayana dispute that developed later in 
      India. It seems therefore illegitimate to include Theravada in either of 
      these two categories. However, after the inauguration of the World 
      Fellowship of Buddhists in Sri Lanka in 1950, well-informed people, both 
      in the East and in the West, use the term Theravada, and not the term 
      Hinayana, with reference to the form of Buddhism prevalent in Southeast 
      Asian countries like Burma, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. There are 
      still some outmoded people who use the term Hinayana. In fact, no Hinayana 
      sect as a distinct community is known to be existing today anywhere in the 
      world. </P>
      <P>At the First International Congress of the World Buddhist Sangha 
      Council held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in January 1967, at the request of the 
      founder Secretary-General, the late Venerable Pandita Pimbure Sorata 
      Thera, I presented a concise formula for the unification of Theravada and 
      Mahayana, which was unanimously accepted. (This formula is now printed as 
      Appendix IV in my <I>Heritage of the Bhikkhu</I>, Grove Press, New York, 
      1974). </P>
      <P>This formula may be restated as follows: </P>
      <OL>
        <LI>Whatever our sects, denominations or systems, as Buddhists we all 
        accept the Buddha as our Master who gave us the Teaching. </LI>
        <LI>We all take refuge in the Triple Jewel: the Buddha, our Teacher; the 
        Dhamma, his teaching; and the Sangha, the Community of holy ones. In 
        other words, we take refuge in the Teacher, the Teaching and the Taught.
        </LI>
        <LI>Whether Theravada or Mahayana, we do not believe that this world is 
        created and ruled by a god at his will. </LI>
        <LI>Following the example of the Buddha, our Teacher, who is embodiment 
        of Great Compassion (maha-karuna) and Great Wisdom (maha-prajna), we 
        consider that the purpose of life is to develop compassion for all 
        living beings without discrimination and to work for their good, 
        happiness and peace; and to develop wisdom leading to the realization of 
        Ultimate Truth. </LI>
        <LI>We accept the Four Noble Truths taught by the Buddha, namely, <I>
        Dukkha</I>, the fact that our existence in this world is in predicament, 
        is impermanent, imperfect, unsatisfactory, full of conflict; <I>Samudaya</I>, 
        the fact that this state of affairs is due to our egoistic selfishness 
        based on the false idea of self; <I>Nirodha</I>, the fact that there is 
        definitely the possibility of deliverance, liberation, freedom from this 
        predicament by the total eradication of the egoistic selfishness; and <I>
        Magga</I>, the fact that this liberation can be achieved through the 
        Middle Path which is eight-fold, leading to the perfection of ethical 
        conduct (sila), mental discipline (samadhi) and wisdom (panna). </LI>
        <LI>We accept the universal law of cause and effect taught in the 
        Paticcasamuppada (Skt. pratityasamutpada; Conditioned Genesis or 
        Dependent Origination), and accordingly we accept that everything is 
        relative, interdependent and interrelated and nothing is absolute, 
        permanent and everlasting in this universe. </LI>
        <LI>We understand, according to the teaching of the Buddha, that all 
        conditioned things (samkhara) are impermanent (anicca) and imperfect and 
        unsatisfactory (dukkha), and all conditioned and unconditioned things 
        (dhamma) are without self (anatta). </LI>

      <OL START="9">
        <LI>There are three ways of attaining Bodhi or Enlightenment according 
        to the ability and capacity of each individual: namely, as a Sravaka 
        (disciple), as a Pratyekabuddha (Individual Buddha) and as a 
        Samyaksambuddha (Perfectly and Fully Enlightened Buddha). We accept if 
        as the highest, noblest and most heroic to follow the career of a 
        Boddhisattva and to become a Samyksambuddha in order to save others. But 
        these three states are on the same Path, not on different paths. In 
        fact, the <I>Sandhinirmocana-sutra</I>, a well-known important Mahayana 
        sutra, clearly and emphatically says that those who follow the line of 
        Sravaka-yana (Vehicle of Disciples) or the line of Pratyekabuddha-yana 
        (Vehicle of Individual Buddhas) or the line of Tathagatas (Mahayana) 
        attain the supreme Nirvana by the same Path, and that for all of them 
        there is only one Path of Purification (visuddhi-marga) and only one 
        Purification (visuddhi) and no second one, and that they are not 
        different paths and different purifications, and that Sravakayana and 
        Mahayana constitute One Vehicle One Yana (eka-yana) and not distinct and 
        different vehicles or yanas.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><A NAME="6"></A><A HREF="#06">[6]</A></FONT>
        </LI>
        <LI>We admit that in different countries there are differences with 
        regard to the ways of life of Buddhist monks, popular Buddhist beliefs 
        and practices, rites and rituals, ceremonies, customs and habits. These 
        external forms and expressions should not be confused with the essential 
        teachings of the Buddha. </LI>
      </OL>
      <P>But to the masses of less instructed and less advanced people, 
      superficial beliefs, external forms, practices and observances are part of 
      their religion. Those beliefs and practices should be appreciated 
      sympathetically according to their relative value. Attachment to external 
      observances and rituals (silabbata-paramasa) is a weakness, a bondage, a 
      fetter (samyojana) from which one frees oneself as one progresses along 
      the Path leading to the realization of Ultimate Truth, Nirvana. Not only 
      attachment to observances, rites and rituals, but also attachment to 
      ideas, concepts, beliefs, theories (dhamma-tanha) obstructs one&#39;s mind 
      from seeing things as they are (yathabhuta). This is a hindrance not only 
      to the realization of Truth, but also to achieving harmony and peace among 
      peoples. </P>
      <P>Buddhism is not an ethnocentric religion. It transcends all ethnic, 
      tribal or national boundaries and limits. It does not carry with it any 
      ethnic customs, habits or practices from one country or one nation to 
      another. Buddhism, while exercising a profound influence over those 
      countries throughout Asia where it spread and was established, naturally 
      and graciously adapted itself to the cultures of those countries and 
      nations. Hence the varieties of Buddhist culture - varieties of art and 
      architecture, varieties of the statue of the Buddha, varieties of the garb 
      of the members of the Sangha, varieties observances and ceremonies - from 
      Tibet in the north to Sri Lanka in the south, from India in the west to 
      Japan in the east. Yet the unity of the essential Dharma runs through all 
      these external varieties linking them together like a silk thread running 
      through the beads of different colors of a necklace. The Dharma, Truth, is 
      one and the same. External forms are many and different. </P>
      <P>The members of the Buddhist Sangha should not be influenced by 
      aggressive, fanatical tendencies prevailing in some parts of the world 
      today. The Sangha should preserve with dignity and courage the long 
      established glorious tradition of Buddhist understanding and tolerance. In 
      the long history of 2,500 years of Buddhism there has never been any war 
      or persecution to convert people. Buddhist monks propagated the teaching 
      of the Buddha throughout Asia, and now they do it in other parts of the 
      world as well, always peacefully, through the force of their teaching, 
      tolerance, inoffensive benevolent gentle attitude. The members of the 
      Sangha can set an example to the world in this respect. </P>
      <P>Today humanity is threatened with the possibility of a nuclear war, 
      that means unimaginable and unprecedented destruction and suffering 
      throughout the world. Two super-powers are threatening each other and are 
      brandishing the latest weapons of annihilation. Those who wield power in 
      the world seem to be devoid of mental health. Only the voice of the 
      well-organized masses of people across the world may bring them back to 
      sanity. There are more than one million members of the Buddhist Sangha in 
      the world today, both Theravada and Mahayana. They have a tremendous 
      influence over the masses. It is the bounden duty of the Buddhist Sangha 
      to spread the message of compassion and wisdom among all peoples in order 
      to achieve world peace. The greatest religious service is to promote 
      understanding, harmony, peace and happiness among people, and not to fix 
      labels of religion on each other&#39;s backs. </P>
