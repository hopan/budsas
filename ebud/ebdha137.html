  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><strong>WHAT IS BUDDHISM?</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the year 563B.C. on the border of modern day Nepal and
  India, a son was born to a chieftain of the Sakya clan. His name was Siddhartha Gotama and
  at the age of thirty-five, he attained, after six years of struggle and through his own
  insight, full enlightenment or Buddhahood. The term 'Buddha' is not a name of a god or an
  incarnation of a god, despite later Hindu claims to the contrary, but is a title for one
  who has realised through good conduct, mental cultivation, and wisdom the cause of life's
  vicissitudes and the way to overcome them. Buddhism is perhaps. unique amongst the world's
  religions in that it does not place reliance for salvation on some external power, such as
  a god or even a Buddha, but places the responsibility for life's frustrations squarely on
  the individual. The Buddha said: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>By oneself, indeed, is evil done; By oneself is
    one defiled. <br>
    By oneself is evil left undone; By oneself indeed is one purified. <br>
    Purity and impurity depend on oneself. No one purifies another.</i> </strong></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">His teaching can be summarised as: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>Not to do any evil, <br>
    To cultivate good, <br>
    To purify one's mind,<br>
    This is the Teaching of the Buddhas.</i> </strong></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To many people of other faiths the term 'Buddha' conjures
  up ideas of idol worship and concepts, such as, that Buddhists are atheists, such concepts
  being an anathema to the followers 'of the, so called 'religions of the book&#146;.
  Buddhism, certainly, is very different from the Semitic religions, but it may surprise
  many of its critics to know that the Buddha condemned idolatry. When, just prior to his
  passing away, he was asked how he could be remembered he replied that those who practised
  his teachings would remember him best. Prior to the arrival on the Indian sub-continent of
  the Bactrian-Greeks, Buddha images were unknown. The Buddha foresaw that worship of him in
  any form would result in his deification with its consequent emphasis on seeking salvation
  from an external power rather than identifying Nirvana, the eradication of greed anger and
  delusion, as being solely within one's own power. Indeed, he was right. For many ethnic
  Buddhists, he is a God from whom they ask favours. We must recognise that the world&#146;s
  major religions are different and we should accept those differences with respect and
  appreciation. For example, Buddhists feel uncomfortable in acknowledging a Creator of the
  world, however Buddhists do accept that there is a transcendental state possible of
  realisation by each and every one of us. We certainly do not accept the concept of an
  anthropomorphic god but many Christians, Jews and Muslims would join us in such a
  rejection. Buddhists, generally, are uncomfortable in using the term &quot;God&quot;,
  because there is no clear definition of to what such a term refers. In the case of the
  Buddhists, too, before they criticise other faiths for their belief in &quot;God&quot;,
  they should ascertain what the person from the other faith means by &quot;God&quot;. Too
  often, arguments are purely semantic. What one calls &quot;God&quot; may be covered by
  another term by your opposite number. A fundamentalist Christian, for example, would view
  God in an anthropomorphic way which is totally different to that of a mainstream
  Christian. A Jew or a Muslim would view God in a totally different sense to the average
  Christian. Indeed, an anthropomorphic view of God would be considered by Jews and Muslims
  to be idolatrous. If, as is the case with many modern theologians, one holds the
  Tillichian view that God is the &quot;Ground of Being&quot; - the very fact of existence -
  then no Buddhist could argue with this. However, a Buddhist would be hesitant in using the
  term &#145;God&#146;. The Buddhist concept of Nirvana, the highest state attainable is
  described in the Itivuttaka, one of the books of the Buddhist canon thus: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&#145;Monks, there is an unborn, a not-become, a
    not-made, a not-compounded. Monks, if that unborn, not-become, not-made, not-compounded
    were not, there would be apparent no escape from this that here is born, become, made,
    compounded. But, monks, since there is an unborn, not-become, not-made, not-compounded,
    therefore the escape from this that here is born, become, made and compounded is
    apparent.&#146; </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Indonesia, for example, where five religions are
  officially recognised on condition that they express a belief in God, the above definition
  from the Itivuttaka is accepted as the Buddhist definition of God. This to a Buddhist is
  the ultimate reality - and is not the ultimate reality to most religious people an unborn,
  uncreated, not-made and not compounded, which is beyond description. To a Christian, a Jew
  and a Muslim, this may be termed &#145;God&#146;, whereas a Buddhist would use the term
  &#145;Nirvana&#146;. I feel that we are talking about a similar concept. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><strong>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MAJOR
  SCHOOLS </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The essential teachings of the Buddha are accepted as
  pivotal to all schools of Buddhism, however, they differ mainly on the emphasis that they
  place on certain aspects of the teaching and in their interpretation of the rules (Vinaya)
  governing the conduct of the clergy (Sangha). The Theravada school claims to adhere
  strictly to the original teachings of the Buddha as contained in the Pali cannon
  (scriptures) and it emphasises the goal of personal salvation (Arahant ideal) for the
  individual follower. The Sangha of the Theravada is expected to observe to the letter the
  227 rules laid down in a collection of books called the Vinaya, which includes such rules
  as eating only prior to midday and refraining from handling money. Four of these 227
  rules, if broken, entail expulsion of the transgressor from the monastic order. They are:
  killing a human being, sexual intercourse, stealing and falsely claiming supernormal
  powers. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Mahayana school is less rigid in its interpretation of
  the Teachings and emphasises the importance of the follower's becoming a Buddha for the
  salvation of all living beings (Bodhisattva ideal). The Sangha observes strict
  vegetarianism (unlike the Theravada where vegetarianism is optional) but they will eat in
  the evening. This change of eating rules became necessary when the Teaching spread to
  colder climates. The post-midday meals are regarded as medicine. The rule prohibiting the
  handling of money has been seen by the Mahayana Sangha as impractical in today's world,
  and it has been reinterpreted as not amassing wealth, whilst a transgression of the
  celibacy rule entails only demotion in some sects of the Mahayana. Other Mahayana sects,
  notably in Korea and Japan, admit married priests. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Vajrayana school is essentially the same in its
  interpretation of the Teachings as the Mahayana but it stresses the importance of the
  acceptance of a personal Guru (teacher) who initiates his followers into the, so-called,
  secret teachings (Tantra). Neither the Theravada nor the mainstream Mahayana schools
  accept that there are such things as 'secret teachings' in Buddhism. The Gelugpa sect of
  the Vajrayana is the only Tibetan sect that insists on the celibacy of its clergy.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><strong>CENTRAL TEACHING</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The central teaching of all schools of Buddhism is
  grounded in the &quot;<strong>Four Noble Truths</strong>&quot;. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first truth is that life is subject to Dukkha. Dukkha
  is often translated as &#145;suffering&#146; but it is much more than that. It certainly
  means physical and mental suffering but it also means that life is full of frustrations -
  we would always prefer things to be other than the way they are. As we grow old, we wish
  we could remain young. If we are poor, we wish we could be rich. When we are separated
  from our friends and loved ones, we are saddened. Dukkha is birth sickness, old age, pain
  and despair, separation from those whom we like and association with those whom we
  dislike. All of these are examples of Dukkha and that is the First Noble Truth. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Second Noble Truth states that the Cause of Dukkha can
  be attributed to three things - greed, anger and a deluded mind. We tend to be attached to
  people and material things and when we are separated from them, we suffer regret. We cling
  to these things as if they will last forever and we find it hard to accept the fact that
  they don&#146;t. We get angry or have aversions to those things that we do not like.
  Buddhism teaches that anger harms the one who is angry more than the object to which this
  anger is directed. Anger causes heating of the blood and an unpleasant appearance. The
  more we get angry with someone and they react to our anger the more this anger increases.
  Anger is unproductive - it doesn&#146;t solve the problem. Our minds are deluded because
  we do not see things as they really are - that is, subject to impermanence (anicca, Pali),
  frustrating (dukkha, Pali) and devoid of a permanent self or substance (anatta, Pali).
  Everything, material or immaterial, is subject to change or impermanence. Perhaps you are
  sitting in a comfortable chair listening to this talk. If you remain in that chair for the
  next three hours, without moving, do you still think you could regard the chair as
  comfortable? Believe me, I do not intend to keep you here for the next three hours. If you
  remained fixed in that chair for a month, you would probably find that you are crippled
  and unable to move. If you remain in that chair for a hundred years, you will probably be
  a skeleton and the chair will be fairly seedy too. What starts as being regarded as
  &#145;comfortable&#146; can soon change to being uncomfortable. Everything is relative.
  The way we see things depends on the time, place and current situation. We, ourselves, are
  subject to this change. Every cell in our body is constantly ageing and dying and being
  replaced. Our thoughts and ideas are constantly changing or being modified. Your thoughts
  and ideas, since you arrived here today, are different. They have changed considerably. Is
  there anything in you which is not subject to change? This is why Buddhists say, in the
  ultimate sense, there is no &#145;you&#146; or unchanging self entity. This change and
  this &quot;no self&#146; is difficult to accept and is, therefore, Dukkha.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third Noble Truth concerns the overcoming of Dukkha,
  that is, overcoming the greed anger and delusion that are the source of Dukkha. Accepting
  change as a characteristic of life and not becoming angry or frustrated about it is part
  of the way to overcoming Dukkha. The overcoming of Dukkha is termed &quot;Nirvana&quot;.
  Nirvana is not a place but a state of mind - a mind that sees things as they really are
  and not clouded by delusion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Fourth Noble Truth is the method taught by the Buddha
  for attaining the state of Nirvana. It is the <strong>Noble Eightfold Path</strong>. You
  may be wondering why the term &#145;Noble&#146;(Ariya) is used for the Path. One who walks
  the Path is considered to be a noble person.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The eight steps of the Path are: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Right Understanding</b> is knowledge that the Four
    Noble Truths lead to the overcoming of Dukkha. It does not imply a total understanding of
    these Truths but a confidence that, by following the Path, the result will be attained. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Right Thought</b> is to be constantly aware of
    one&#146;s thoughts and actions and thereby avoiding harm to any living creature. Right
    Speech is awareness of one&#146;s speech so that, what one says, is beneficial to the
    hearer. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Right Action</b> is to be aware of one&#146;s actions
    and observe the five precepts so that one does not cause harm to oneself or any other
    living creature. The five precepts are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>To undertake the training to avoid taking the life of
      beings.</i> This precept applies to all living beings not just to humans. All beings have
      a right to their lives and that right should be respected. This would include the unborn,
      so abortion is not an acceptable alternative for controlling the population, however,
      contraception is not an issue as far as Buddhists are concerned. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>To undertake the training to avoid taking things not
      given. </i>This precept goes further than mere stealing. One should avoid taking anything
      unless one can be sure that is intended for you. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>To undertake the training to avoid sensual misconduct.</i>
      This precept is often mistranslated or misinterpreted as relating only to sexual
      misconduct but it covers any overindulgence in any sensual pleasure such as gluttony as
      well as misconduct of a sexual nature. A Buddhist should be mindful of the possible
      effects on themselves and on others of improper sexual activity. This precept would
      include adultery because this also breaches the precept of not taking what is not freely
      given. A relationship with someone who is committed to another is stealing. Similarly in
      cases of rape and child abuse, one is stealing the dignity and self respect of another.
      One is also the cause of mental pain, not to mention physical pain so one is causing harm
      to another living being. Therefore, such behaviour is breaking several precepts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>To undertake the training to refrain from false speech.</i>
      As well as avoiding lying and deceiving, this precept covers slander as well as speech
      which is not beneficial to the welfare of others. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>To undertake the training to abstain from substances
      which cause intoxication and heedlessness. </i>This precept is in a special category as it
      does not infer any intrinsic evil in, say, alcohol itself, but indulgence in such a
      substance could be the cause of breaking the other four precepts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are the basic precepts expected as a day to day
      training of any lay Buddhist. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Right Livelihood</b> is to earn one&#146;s living in a
    way that does not cause harm or suffering. Such occupations as the selling of intoxicants,
    firearms or animals for slaughter would be considered inappropriate for Buddhists. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Right Effort</b> is the avoiding of evil which has not
    already arisen, rejecting evil which has already arisen, the acquiring of wholesome things
    which have not yet been acquired and the stabilising of those wholesome characteristics
    that have already been acquired. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Right Mindfulness</b><font size="4"> </font>is training
    in constant awareness of the effects of one&#146;s actions, whether of body, speech or
    mind, and thus avoiding harmful actions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Right Concentration</b> is cultivating the mind through
    concentration and meditation so that one attains intuitive insight.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most Buddhists believe that, upon the dissolution of the
  body, rebirth may take place in a state consistent with the qualities of the consciousness
  energy, or resultant of past actions (karma) at the time of death. This rebirth may occur
  in human form, animal form, as a ghost (preta), in a blissful state (deva) or in a woeful
  state. Each of these states is impermanent and lasts as long as the karmic energy, which
  was the cause of rebirth, sustains it. In other words, we are subject to a constant round
  of rebirths (Samsara) until Nirvana, or the release from rebirth is attained. The
  Theravada tradition believes that rebirth is instantaneous upon the death of the
  individual, whereas the Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions believe in an intermediate state
  (antarabhava), which can last until the right conditions for rebirth prevail. Three
  conditions are necessary for conception in the womb of either a human or animal to occur,
  that is, male sperm, female ovum and the karmic energy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Karma is not a reward or punishment for past actions but
  rather a natural result or outcome of them. Buddhists do not accept the concept of a
  creator god who sits in judgement on his creation. We are our own creator by our past
  actions. We are what we have done and we will be what we are now doing is what the Law of
  Karma states. On a popular level as taught in institutionalised Buddhism, whenever
  misfortune or happiness befalls us, it is due to our past karma. This tends to imply a
  punisher or rewarder, in other words a judging god, an idea which Buddhists reject. That
  is why many modern Buddhist scholars interpret Karma as a psychological phenomenon. Bad
  actions cause remorse, regrets and feelings of guilt which disturb our peace of mind,
  whereas good actions bring joy and happiness and peace of mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another important doctrine is that of the Heavenly States
  (Brahma Vihara) which all Buddhists should cultivate. They are Boundless Loving-kindness
  (Maitri, Sanskrit - Metta, Pali), Boundless Compassion (Karuna), Boundless Joy (Mudita)
  and Boundless Equanimity (Upekkha). The practice of these four should be directed towards
  all living beings. The Buddha describes &quot;Boundless Loving-kindness&quot; as that
  unconditional, selfless love that a mother has for her only child. Boundless Compassion is
  the feeling of wishing to take onto oneself the sufferings and sorrows of others. This
  compassion is especially emphasised in the Mahayana school where followers will take the
  Bodhisattva Vow which promises to postpone the attainment of Enlightenment until all
  suffering creatures may be saved. Boundless Joy is rejoicing in the good fortune of
  others. It is the opposite of envy or covetousness. Boundless Equanimity is the
  cultivation of an even mind - one that is unmoved by either happiness or misfortune.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><strong>PRACTICE</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists of all schools regularly perform the action of
  &#145;<strong>Taking Refuge</strong>&#146;. A refuge is a shelter or safe haven and
  similarly, in Buddhism, taking refuge is considered to be a protection. The refuges are:-
  The Buddha - the teacher, is referred to in the scriptures as &quot;Teacher of gods and
  men&quot;. The Dharma (Sanskrit) or Dhamma (Pali) - his teaching. Before the Buddha passed
  away, he told Ananda, his chief disciple, that after his passing, the Dharma would be the
  teacher. The Sangha - is the community of followers. More specifically, it refers to those
  who have left home to follow the spiritual life, the Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis. In the
  broader sense, it includes those who are following his teachings whether they be monastic
  or lay. The initial recitation of the &quot;Three Refuges&quot;, before a member of the
  monastic Sangha, constitutes formally becoming a Buddhist. In the Tibetan tradition, an
  additional refuge is added, that of taking refuge in the Guru (teacher), who initiates the
  Cela (student).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another important devotional practice is the recitation of
  the five precepts, known as the &#145;<strong>Panca Sila</strong>&#146; (Pali) or Panca
  Shila (Sanskrit). These are training rules and, unlike, say, the Ten Commandments in
  Christianity, they are not based on fear and feelings of guilt. A Buddhist should
  undertake training to try to observe these precepts but, if a precept is broken, one
  should analyse one&#146;s action and try to avoid breaking it in the future. This is not
  to suggest that the consequences of this unwholesome action (Karma) will be avoided - the
  admonition in the Christian Bible, &quot;as ye sow, so shall ye also reap&quot; applies to
  Buddhists as well as to Christians. The emphasis in Buddhism is to train one&#146;s
  self-awareness of one&#146;s actions and their effects on both one&#146;s self and others
  and to avoid unwholesome actions and cultivate beneficial ones. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A <strong>Buddhist ceremony</strong> will usually start
  with the offerings of lights, incense and flowers on the shrine. Occasionally, fruit,
  cakes and drinks will also be offered but the lights, incense and flowers have very
  special significance.. The lighting of a candle symbolises the teaching (Dharma) which
  lights up the darkness of ignorance. The incense symbolises the good conduct which
  permeates the atmosphere with pleasantness, whilst the flowers remind us of impermanence.
  What is beautiful today, fades with time and eventually becomes ugly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Other important devotional practices are the <strong>chanting
  of sutras</strong> (sermons of the Buddha or other great teachers), prostrations before a
  Buddha image, and, most importantly, practising meditation. The chanting of sutras is
  often, mistakenly, referred to as Buddhist prayers. Buddhists do not pray to a god,
  however, Buddhists from the Mahayana tradition will sometimes pray to Bodhisattvas for
  assistance and blessings. Prostrations are considered a means of paying respect to the
  teacher in a similar way to people respecting those who have passed away by placing
  flowers on a grave. Prostrations also are a means of cultivating humility. The Buddha
  condemned &#145;rites and rituals&#146; as being useless and not conducive to salvation.
  The practice of prostrating before images is more a part of institutionalised Buddhism
  rather than being a part of the Teaching itself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Meditation (Bhavana)</strong> is a central part of
  Buddhist practice. In the Theravadin tradition, two forms of meditation, calm (Samatha)
  and insight (Vipassana) are recognised as essential practice in achieving spiritual
  progress. Calming the mind is achieved by concentration on a specific object and excluding
  all extraneous thoughts. Often, the breath or the movement of the diaphragm is used as a
  suitable object for concentration. At other times, objects, such as coloured discs
  (Kasinas) or meditation beads (Mala) or even counting the breaths are used to fix the mind
  during this preliminary practice. Once the mind has been trained in concentration, the
  meditator can then reflect on the feelings and sensations of the body, noting them as they
  arise and pass away. This practice is known as Vipassana and is the means of cultivating
  insight or mindfulness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Cha&#146;n (Zen, Japanese) tradition, two
  techniques are employed. One method is to concentrate on the breath and then try to clear
  the mind of all thoughts whatsoever. This method eliminates the constant chatter of the
  mind and results in an awakening (satori). Another Cha&#146;an technique is to ponder a
  question (Kung-an, Chinese, Koan, Japanese), which has no rational answer. Typical koans
  are, &quot;what was your face before you were born?&quot; &quot;what is the sound of one
  hand clapping?&quot; or the word &quot;Mu&quot;. These techniques are aimed at pushing the
  mind beyond rational thought in order to experience the ultimate awakening.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A technique used by the Pure Land Sect of the Mahayana is
  to constantly recite the name (nien-fo, Chinese, nembutsu, Japanese) of the Buddha of
  infinite light, Amitabha Buddha (Omi t&#146;o-Fo, Chinese, Amida Butsu, Japanese). This,
  again, is a means of fixing the mind on one object and not dissimilar to repetitions of
  prayers used by many Christians. The result is a calmed mind, and, according to Pure Land
  Buddhism, rebirth in the Pure Land where enlightenment may be attained by listening to the
  teaching of Buddha Amitabha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The foregoing is by no means a comprehensive introduction
  to the teachings of the Buddha and such a short introduction can hardly do the teaching
  justice, however I hope that it inspires you to investigate the teachings further.
  Buddhism is not a belief system but a practice which will result in a more harmonious
  society.</font></p>
