      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="6">A</FONT> quick glance 
      through the pages of the Pali Text Society's publications catalogue should 
      be enough to convince anyone that there is much more to classical Pali 
      literature than the Tipitaka alone. Intermingled with the familiar 
      Nikayas, Vinaya texts, and Abhidhamma are scores of titles with long, 
      scarcely-pronounceable Pali names. Although many western students of 
      Buddhism may be unacquainted with these works (indeed, most have never 
      been translated into English), these books have for centuries played a 
      crucial role in the development of Buddhist thought and practice across 
      Asia and, ultimately, the West. In fact, in some countries they are as 
      deeply treasured as the suttas themselves. But what are these ancient 
      books, and what relevance do they have to the western student of Buddhism 
      in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century? Although complete answers to these 
      questions lie well beyond the range of my abilities, I hope that this 
      short document will provide enough of a road map to help orient the 
      interested student as he or she sets out to explore this vast corpus of 
      Buddhist literature. </FONT></P>

      origins of the post-canonical texts</A></FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The
      Tipitaka (Pali Canon) 
      assumed its final form at the
      Third Buddhist 
      Council (ca.&nbsp;250 BCE) and was first committed to writing sometime in 
      the 1<SUP>st</SUP>&nbsp;c. BCE. Shortly thereafter Buddhist scholar-monks in 
      Sri Lanka and southern India began to amass a body of secondary 
      literature: commentaries on the Tipitaka itself, historical chronicles, 
      textbooks, Pali grammars, articles by learned scholars of the past, and so 
      on. Most of these texts were written in Sinhala, the language of Sri 
      Lanka, but because Pali -- not Sinhala -- was the <I>lingua franca</I> of 
      Theravada, few Buddhist scholars outside Sri Lanka could study them. It 
      wasn't until the 5<SUP>th</SUP>&nbsp;c. CE, when the Indian monk Buddhaghosa 
      began the laborious task of collating the ancient Sinhala commentaries and 
      translating them into Pali, that these books first became accessible to 
      non-Sinhala speakers around the Buddhist world. These commentaries (<A HREF="#Atthakatha">Atthakatha</A>) 
      offer meticulously detailed explanations and analyses -- phrase-by-phrase 
      and word-by-word -- of the corresponding passages in the Tipitaka. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After Buddhaghosa the catalogue of 
      post-canonical Pali literature continued to grow with the addition of 
      commentaries by both Buddhadatta (5<SUP>th</SUP>&nbsp;c.) and Dhammapala (6<SUP>th</SUP>&nbsp;c.), 
      and sub-commentaries (<A HREF="#Atthakatha">Tika</A>) by Dhammapala on 
      several of Buddhaghosa's Atthakathas. During this time, and in the 
      centuries that followed, other writers prepared Pali translations of 
      additional early Sinhala texts. These ranged from <A HREF="#buddha">poetic 
      hymns in celebration of the Buddha</A>, to <A HREF="#chron">chronicles</A> 
      tracing the first millennium of Buddhist history, to detailed
      <A HREF="#abhi">Abhidhamma textbooks</A>. Most of the major post-canonical 
      works, including the sub-commentaries, were completed by the 12<SUP>th</SUP>&nbsp;c.
      </FONT></P>
      <P></P>
      <H3 ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080"><A NAME="matter">Why these 
      texts matter</A></FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Post-canonical Pali literature supplements 
      the Tipitaka in several important ways. First, the chronicles and 
      commentaries provide a vital thread of temporal continuity that links us, 
      via the persons and historical events of the intervening centuries, to the 
      Tipitaka's world of ancient India. A Tipitaka without this accompanying 
      historical thread would forever be an isolated anachronism to us, its 
      message lost in clouds of myth and fable, its pages left to gather dust in 
      museum display cases alongside ancient Egyptian mummies. These texts 
      remind us that the Dhamma is not an artifact but a <I>practice,</I> and 
      that we belong to a long line of seekers who have endeavored, through 
      patient practice, to keep these teachings alive. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Second, almost everything we know today 
      about the early years of Buddhism comes to us from these post-canonical 
      books. Though the archaeological evidence from that era is scant and the 
      Tipitaka itself contains only a handful of passages describing events that 
      followed the Buddha's death[<A HREF="#n1" NAME="1">1</A>], the
      <A HREF="#Atthakatha">commentaries</A> and <A HREF="#chron">chronicles</A> 
      contain a wealth of historical information with which we are able to 
      partially reconstruct the early history of Buddhism. The texts illuminate 
      a host of important historical events and trends: how the Tipitaka came to 
      be preserved orally; when it was first written down, and why; how the 
      Tipitaka came close to extinction; how the Buddha's teachings spread 
      across south Asia; how and when the various schools and factions within 
      Buddhism arose; and so on. But these are not just idle concerns for the 
      amusement of academicians. Any practitioner, of any century, stands to 
      benefit from understanding how the early Buddhists lived, how they put the 
      Buddha's teachings into practice, what challenges they faced; we stand to 
      learn from those who have gone before. And there are other lessons to be 
      learned from history. For example, knowing that it was the actions of just 
      a few individuals that averted the extinction of the Tipitaka[<A HREF="#n2" NAME="2">2</A>] 
      reminds us that it is ultimately up to individuals like ourselves to 
      safeguard the teachings today. Without the post-canonical texts important 
      lessons like these -- if not the Tipitaka itself -- might have been lost 
      forever in the mists of time. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Third, these texts -- particularly the 
      commentaries -- help us make sense of the suttas and give us clues about 
      their context that we might otherwise miss. For example, the famous 
      Satipatthana Sutta (MN 10) is popularly cited today as evidence that all one needs to achieve 
      Awakening is a week or two of unrelenting mindfulness practice. But the 
      commentary (Papañcasudani) suggests another viewpoint. It explains that 
      the Buddha's audience for this particular discourse (the villagers of 
      Kammasadammam) were already well established in their practice of 
      mindfulness and virtue. They were not coming to meditation practice &quot;cold&quot; 
      but were, in fact, unusually well prepared to receive this deep teaching 
      -- a point not apparent from the text of the sutta itself. The commentary 
      thus reminds us that there are some important fundamentals to be developed 
      before one undertakes intensive meditation practice. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Finally, the commentaries often contain 
      magnificent stories to illustrate and amplify upon points of Dhamma that 
      are made in the suttas. For example,
      Dhp 114 takes on a much richer meaning in light of the commentary's background 
      story -- the famous parable of Kisagotami and the mustard seed.[<A HREF="#n3" NAME="3">3</A>] 
      Commentarial stories like this one (and there are many more) offer 
      valuable Dhamma teachings in their own right. </FONT></P>
      <H3 ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080"><A NAME="authority">The 
      authority of the texts</A></FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One might reasonably wonder: how can a 
      collection of texts written a thousand years after the Buddha's death 
      possibly represent his teachings reliably? How can we be sure they aren't 
      simply derivative works, colored by a host of irrelevant cultural 
      accretions? First of all, although many of these texts were indeed first 
      written in Pali a thousand years after the Buddha, most Sinhala versions 
      upon which they were based were written much earlier, having themselves 
      been passed down via an ancient and reliable oral tradition. But (one 
      might object) mustn't those early texts themselves be suspect, since they 
      are based only on hearsay? Perhaps, but by this argument we should reject 
      the entire oral tradition -- and hence the entire Tipitaka itself, which 
      similarly emerged from an oral tradition long after the Buddha's death. 
      Surely that is taking things too far. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But what of the credentials of the 
      commentators themselves: can their words be trusted? In addition to living 
      a monastic life immersed in Dhamma, the compilers of the commentaries 
      possessed unimpeachable literary credentials: intimate acquaintance with 
      the Tipitaka, mastery of the Pali and Sinhala languages, and expert skill 
      in the art of careful scholarship. We have no reason to doubt either their 
      abilities or the sincerity of their intentions. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And what of their first-hand understanding 
      of Dhamma: if the commentators were scholars first and foremost, would 
      they have had sufficient meditative experience to write with authority on 
      the subject of meditation? This is more problematic. Perhaps commentators 
      like Buddhaghosa had enough time (and accumulated merit) both for 
      mastering meditation and for their impressive scholarly pursuits; we will 
      never know. But it is noteworthy that the most significant discrepancies 
      between the Canon and its commentaries concern meditation -- in 
      particular, the relationship between concentration meditation and 
      insight.[<A HREF="#n4" NAME="4">4</A>] The question of the authority of 
      the post-canonical texts thus remains a point of controversy within 
      Theravada Buddhism. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is important to remember that the 
      ultimate function of the post-canonical texts is -- like that of the 
      Tipitaka itself -- to assist the student in the quest for
      nibbana, the highest 
      goal of Buddhist practice. Concerns about authorship and authority recede 
      when the texts are subjected to the same healthy skeptical attitude and 
      empirical approach that should be familiar to every student of the suttas. 
      If a commentary sheds light on a murky corner of a sutta or helps us 
      understand a subtle point of Vinaya or of Abhidhamma, or if the chronicles 
      remind us that we hold the future history of Dhamma in our hands, then to 
      that extent they help us clear the path ahead. And if they can do even 
      that much, then -- no matter who wrote them and from whence they came -- 
      these texts will have demonstrated an authority beyond reproach.[<A HREF="#n5" NAME="5">5</A>]

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><A NAME="n2">2</A>.</B> In the early 
      decades of the 1<SUP>st</SUP> c. BCE in Sri Lanka -- then the hub of 
      Theravada Buddhist scholarship and monastic training -- several forces 
      combined that would threaten the continuity of the ancient oral tradition 
      by which the Pali Tipitaka had been passed down from one generation of 
      monks to the next. A rebellion against the king and invasions from south 
      India forced many monks to flee the island. At the same time a famine of 
      unprecedented proportions descended on the island for a dozen years. The 
      commentaries recount heroic stories of monks who, fearing that the 
      treasure of the Tipitaka might forever be lost, retreated to the relative 
      safety of the south coast, where they survived only on roots and leaves, 
      reciting the texts amongst themselves day and night. The continuity of the 
      Tipitaka hung by a thread: at one point only one monk was able to recite 
      the <A HREF="#Niddesa">Niddesa</A>. <SMALL>{PLL p.&nbsp;76}</SMALL>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><A NAME="n3">3</A>.</B> The commentary 
      tells how Kisagotami, distraught by the death of her son, wandered in vain 
      from door to door with his corpse in her arms, in search of a cure for his 
      ailment. Finally she met the Buddha, who promised a cure if she would 
      simply bring back a few mustard seeds from any household that had never 
      been touched by death. Unable to find any such household, she soon came to 
      her senses, understood the inevitability of death, and was at last able to 
      let go of both the corpse and her grief. (The full story of Kisagotami's 
      life is retold in <I>Great Disciples of the Buddha,</I> Bhikkhu Bodhi, ed. 
      (Boston: Wisdom Publications, 1997).)
