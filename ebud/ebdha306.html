        <P>The poison of ignorance is spread through desire, passion and 
        ill-will. One who abandons the arrow of craving and expels the poison of 
        ignorance is one rightly intent on Nibbana</I></B><I>. -- Majjhima 
        Nikaya, 105 </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      </I>
      <P><FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT>t is hard to think of fighting the forces of 
      greed, hatred and delusion &quot;out there&quot; when they are very much within us. 
      We march for peace and attend rallies and vigils but true peace in the 
      world must begin with personal disarmament. It is an interior work that 
      each of us can nurture through moral vigilance and spiritual discipleship 
      and its hiddenness does not make it any less powerful.</P>
      <P>We can see how this inner turmoil is ever present, how the world 
      assaults us day by day, bombarding the six sense media from all 
      directions. We are pierced by the arrow of craving and wounded with the 
      poison of ignorance. Mara&#39;s well-disguised messengers continue to crowd 
      into our consciousness. Beguiled, we welcome them. &quot;Come in, take over, 
      it&#39;s OK.&quot; As always, they fail to keep their promises.</P>
      <P>We thirst and cling and grasp, trying to prop up the body, succumbing 
      again and again to the tyranny of the senses, to desire and aversion, the 
      lust for things and the escape from them. We live on the precipice of 
      fear, in dread of waking up, of seeing how, repeatedly, we make ourselves 
      ill or empower other people to make us ill, or how an insidious unrest 
      touches everything around us.</P>
      <P>Still we are ignorant about the nature of our suffering, oblivious to 
      the cause of the poison in our hearts. We try many kinds of remedies and 
      antidotes, making choices and organising our lives in futile attempts to 
      gain control. We may become addicted to pills and outside therapies, even 
      retreats, to calm down. There is nothing wrong with these. But they are 
      just placebos. They give temporary relief from our pain or disquiet 
      without ministering to the illness itself.</P>
      <P>Under the veneer of contentment, we are too busy to see what we are 
      doing, too restless to stop or to keep our minds still. It isn&#39;t just a 
      shifting around so that we can find the right posture or the right set of 
      conditions in life; it&#39;s a deep inner angst.</P>
      <P>At first this sense of disquiet manifests as nascent feelings that we 
      would never have allowed ourselves to feel before and that expose how 
      wounded we are, how tired, how ill. We begin to recognise our 
      entanglement, the stress we are holding, how disappointed or angry we are 
      - at ourselves or our friends, at our children or our parents, our loved 
      ones or our ex-loved ones, the world, our jobs, our bodies, our lives.</P>
      <P>Actually, this restlessness is a cry of urgency, of samvega. It is the 
      first glimmering, an unconscious step towards waking up to our 
      vulnerability and the immanent danger we are in. Intuitively, we realise 
      that if we carry on in this way, we are like ghosts, robots. We may be 
      very busy, rushing from one important activity to another, but we are not 
      really living our lives - we are not consciously in our bodies, nor can we 
      authentically connect to what we are feeling.</P>
      <P>This is living like a cardboard cut-out of a human being, swaddled in 
      cotton wool and well-concealed and disguised so that we don&#39;t have to feel 
      our fear, or acknowledge how angry we are, or touch our grief. We cope. 
      And the more unskilful the ways of coping we adopt, the worse our 
      condition becomes - until the mind gives up, or wakes up.</P>
      <P>This is a rare and redemptive insight. It is a gift of intuitive wisdom 
      revealed in the most simple act - contemplating or sitting quietly in the 
      forest, listening to the birds, feeling a sense of wonder and stillness. 
      Unexpectedly, the whirlwind of mental passions and habitual thoughts that 
      spin us around on the ferris wheel of samsara - the desires, craving and 
      unrest, the opinions we have about ourselves and others - fall silent. For 
      a moment, we are not thinking.</P>
      <P>At that moment, what is it that we experience for the first time? Maybe 
      we notice the delightful song of a bell bird dissolving all the incessant 
      chatter in the mind. Or we stop to witness, with rapt awe, the setting of 
      the sun or rejoice at the sight of a butterfly poised on a leaf. In these 
      acts of pure listening or pure seeing, we relinquish all thoughts of past 
      and future and we enter the silence of the heart.</P>
      <P>That silence protects the cittaviveka or seclusion of the mind. We are 
      able to see or hear and know what truly is seen, heard and known with 
      unsullied attention, curiosity and reverence. Such a moment may be 
      recaptured in the exquisite purity of a mother tenderly gazing at her 
      newborn child. It is to approach Kuan Yin, Mother of Compassion herself, 
      and light the flame on her shrine. When it doesn&#39;t light, we don&#39;t grab it 
      and say, &quot;Come on, you, light, hurry up!&quot;</P>
      <P>Pure unconditional love is not like that. It has an attitude of caring 
      for the moment. We sit with the interior candle. We devote ourselves to it 
      patiently. All the resources that we need, all the ingredients for 
      illumination are already there - the wax, the wick and the match; 
      mindfulness and discernment, our experience of the world, and clear 
      perception of it in sense-consciousness. When these come together in the 
      right way, the flame of wisdom ignites.</P>
      <P>Each of us can manifest this quality, but we have to sit very still and 
      be so patient, mindful and all-forgiving as the moment unfolds. The Buddha 
      sits in our own hearts - the true, uncontaminated, untainted energy of 
      enlightenment that is available to each of us if we are able to rest in 
      it, open to it, feel it, taste it, offer ourselves to it, surrender to it.</P>
      <P>But even as we experience this quality of mind, disquiet, discomfort 
      and dis-ease can easily compel us yet again to wander in pursuit and even 
      worship of pleasant experience; and to run from and resist what is true. 
      We find ourselves caught in the snare of samsara - not feeling, not daring 
      to see what we really need to see in order to extract the poison of 
      ignorance from our hearts.</P>
      <P>We resolve to be vigilant and hugely compassionate to ourselves - 
      applying our mental skills, the power of mindfulness and clear seeing, and 
      the ability to navigate with them, especially in difficult moments. We 
      return again and again to simplicity and stillness. And with faith and 
      courage, we undertake to study ourselves, to let go the identification 
      with &#39;self&#39; as we look at, investigate and feel our stuff. We invite it in 
      without resistance. We make it welcome.</P>
      <P>This is our mandate - to be disciples of the moment, to approach our 
      pain with compassionate honesty, to sit with patient resolution facing 
      whatever destructive emotions may arise - self-pity, regret, negativity, 
      boredom, anxiety. We won&#39;t die of any of these. But they can destroy us 
      and they do - each time we are driven out of present-moment awareness, 
      prised away from a direct experience of truth by our &#39;need&#39; to get up and 
      go somewhere, do something else, talk to someone, start a project, surf 
      the net, have a cup of tea.</P>
      <P>Each time, we return and begin again. We reaffirm our willingness to 
      remain attentive, with pure intention and mindfulness, close to the 
      silence and solitude long enough to enter deeply into the moment. We 
      tenderly approach and touch what is present - fear or despair or 
      restlessness or joy and excitement - and we begin to see the peril of the 
      corrosive mind that keeps toppling into the past and spilling into the 
      future. Even the joy is dissolving, and disappointment follows on its 
      heels. Until we see this, we remain disconnected from what is true, 
      believing that what is impermanent and disintegrating almost imperceptibly 
      within and all around us is stable, that the festering wound will heal by 
      itself.</P>
      <P>We have the power to meditate and observe the seasons of our hearts 
      until right view matures enough for us to see that we are not our 
      thoughts; to develop a calm abiding through the worst tempests of fear or 
      despair until light illumines our consciousness and enables us to come 
      face to face with all the internal monsters. We can feel them, not in our 
      heads - but here, in the body, and, in this way, reach the very centre of 
      that burning. We sit in the flames and burn!</P>
      <P>Being still enough to witness the origin of our suffering helps us to 
      understand how each one of us is its very architect, and how we serve the 
      unwholesome energies of the mind. At first, we are so afraid of that 
      burning - until we discover that it is actually the fire of enlightenment, 
      unveiling the truth of our own purity, our true nature.</P>
      <P>We dare to peel away the layers of perception, to see the instability 
      of everything of this world and its inherent emptiness. We watch the 
      relentless currents of empty phenomena arising and ceasing in a river of 
      impermanence, the memories and projections, fantasies and moods, judgments 
      and obsessions, and how our habitual reactions to them - grasping, 
      clinging, denial or rejection - overwhelm us. Giving way to them brings us 
      greater harm and undermines the possibility of purifying the mind. Giving 
      way to anxiety takes us to more anxiety, anger to more anger, grief to 
      more grief and so on.</P>
      <P>But when we feel distress or rage and consciously experience the 
      quality of its energy without judgment, we disempower it, we tame and 
      transform it with compassion. When we allow ourselves to open and be with 
      it, penetrating through to the pure experience of it, perseveringly, and 
      resolve to see it for what it really is, then we awaken.</P>
      <P>Ask, &quot;How can I heal? How can I extract the poison arrow?&quot; To avoid 
      getting caught again, we can let go the wanting to know why it is there, 
      let go the &#39;because&#39;, let go the blaming mind, the guilty mind, all those 
      aimless or negative thoughts and self-obsessed habits of mind. They will 
      never free us. They are the chains that imprison us and keep us from 
      experiencing true happiness and wisdom.</P>
      <P>Knowing the thoughts and moods of the mind enables us to extract the 
      arrow, apply the antidote to the poison within us with compassionate 
      understanding, and face whatever demon arises in the heart and say, &quot;I 
      know what you are&quot;. We witness it without hostility or negativity and name 
      it: anger, aggression, loneliness, despair, depression, resentment, 
      bitterness, jealousy, fear, blame, self-disparagement, excitement. We 
      allow it to be and wait without waiting, without wanting or demanding it 
      to be other than it is. Finally, each form of the mind&#39;s energy, in its 
      turn, will change or dissolve. It is empty. The only power it has is our 
      belief in it.</P>
      <P>But this process hurts. Why? Because we are seeing the impostors - what 
      we know or think we know - begin to collapse. What is familiar is no 
      longer secure and must be given up. But to allow ourselves to sit with 
      what is unknown, risk uncertainty and enter into those dark unexplored 
      caverns of the heart - we would rather die in the ruins of our fear than 
      brave the refining fire of truth.</P>
      <P>Viktor Frankl wrote, &quot;What is to give light must endure burning.&quot; We 
      want to give light but we&#39;re afraid to suffer. We&#39;re afraid of pain when 
      our very freedom lies in the middle of that pain. Our very quenching of 
      thirst lies in the middle of thirst; just like the very healing of our 
      wound lies in probing into the wound itself and removing the arrow. 
      Mindfulness is the probe, but the awakened surgeon of our wisdom mind must 
      also take urgent action. We can&#39;t remove the arrow simply by looking at it 
      and saying, &quot;What a nice wound, what a deep wound, oh look at my wonderful 
      wound!&quot;</P>
      <P>We can&#39;t light the candle of discernment on the altar of life until we 
      burn through to clear insight of the way things are. This is radical 
      simplicity. It is an act of pure love, pure awareness. It is gratitude 
      itself and great compassion. This is caring for ourselves, tending to 
      dukkha.</P>
      <P>With assiduous mindfulness and right view, we see clearly how suffering 
      arises in this moment and how we perpetuate that suffering through fear of 
      change and our unwillingness to trust, to accept what is real. Faith 
      summons us to go towards what we fear, to turn away from the craving mind, 
      to create the conditions for the heart to grow still and powerful, even to 
      hold pain of impossible depth and remain unshaken.</P>
      <P>Such one-pointedness leads to the energy of illumination. In that 
      awakening, there is a holocaust. It is that refining fire that liberates 
      us from the poisons of the internal media of the senses as well as the 
      external media &quot;out there&quot; - the attractions and addictions of samsara. It 
      is a heroic disarmament that takes us to the emptiness of transcendent 
      knowledge.</P>
      <P>Let us consider this our entry into the lineage of the Noble Ones, to 
      understand the truth of impermanence, suffering and not-self. It is the 
      pure knowing of our natural energy with the eye of Dhamma. We are that 
      energy, not separate from it. And as our vision is purified, we are no 
      longer ransomed to the aggressions of lust or anger or fear or neurotic 
      thought that excite and exhaust the helpless mind.</P>
      <P>Such clear seeing is the catalyst for rescue, an operation to remove 
      the poison arrow, a commitment to transformation. It compels us to make 
      dramatic changes in our lives and that can be terrifying in itself. Our 
      ways of seeing life, our fundamental values, lifestyle, work and 
      friendships may change. Change is frightening because it is unknown. But 
      what can really be known beyond this moment?</P>
      <P>Why live in darkness? If we want to be true and to know truth, we have 
      to come from the shadows and live in truth. And to live in Truth, we have 
      to light that candle. We light it and we endure the burning, the holocaust 
      that will purify our hearts from the poisons that have infected us for 
      lifetimes.</P>
      <P>Until we do this work, we are stooped from the weight of misery, bent 
      by the burdens of our mind, collapsing in upon ourselves. That&#39;s not old 
      age. That is the physical dimension of mental suffering. We may be young 
      but we are already defeated by worry, stress, frustration and guilt.</P>
      <P>Look at the cramped tightness around your heart area - this chakra. 
      Just feel what that feels like. How much armour are we carrying? It is not 
      an armour of patience and strength but an impenetrable wall to keep 
      feelings out, a shield that we hold over our hearts. &quot;Don&#39;t come near me, 
      gulp!&quot; This is a natural outcome of having learned to respond to pain from 
      unwholesome mental habit and spiritual malnutrition. Any time the truth 
      gets too close, we revert to a posture of defendedness to separate or 
      freeze ourselves and, at some level, we unconsciously shut down. We feed 
      the inner violence.</P>
      <P>This is my process too. I am resolved to live in kindness, to live in 
      purity, to surrender to this holocaust. It&#39;s not the Holocaust my parents 
      lived through, but the cleansing fire in the midst of my own heart. I am 
      willing to endure that burning because I see the results in myself, in the 
      bright quality of my being and energy shaped through the bearing of pain, 
      humiliation and surrender.</P>
      <P>It&#39;s not as if we ordain and renounce and that&#39;s the end of it. Every 
      day is a profound renunciation that is unknown: I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going 
      to come up, I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m going to have to let go pride, let go 
      this security that I hang on to which is unreal anyway, let go unconscious 
      living and wake up, let go defending myself from my own fear and anger and 
      illusion and the desire to be somebody, to be something when I know it&#39;s 
      just a deception. So the holocaust here in my own heart must happen if I 
      am to learn to see what is true - and if I am to live in truth.</P>
      <P>The fruit of this practice is an invisible growing, a deep interior 
      ripening, a gradual unfurling as our eyes open and the dust of lifetimes 
      begins to clear. It may seem as if nothing significant is happening, but 
      that doesn&#39;t matter - we keep going. The more we train our minds and 
      retrain our habits, the more we go to the places that terrify us, the more 
      we disarm the terrorist who dwells in there. Finally, we stand alone, free 
      from fear, free from danger.</P>
      <P>No longer are we dazzled and intoxicated by the sense media, the 
      sights, tastes, distractions and exotic pleasures, the riches, power, fame 
      and success of society, all the false delights of samsara. We give them up 
      for a simple, humble diet of clear pure presence, compassionate wisdom, 
      patient endurance. We are radiant, serene, able to live in joy, gratitude, 
      harmlessness and inner peace.</P>
      <P>Lighting the candle of discernment is not just for us. It&#39;s for the 
      whole world. As long as our asylum is cowardice, complacency and 
      mediocrity, we live only for ourselves. The quality of our life is 
      cheapened and we carry on as slaves to death and decay.</P>
      <P>It&#39;s time to abandon poverty, time to walk out of the ghetto of 
      illusion and artifice and take refuge in fearlessness. This is the way of 
      the Buddhas: to know the diamond purity of our Buddha nature - not through 
      fear and self-effacement, nor desire and arrogance, nor through the 
      plundering of and flight from the samsaric rounds of pleasure and pain, 
      but to know it in silent witness to and awareness of their inherent 
      emptiness - in the flame of no flame, in the cooling of the last ember. 
      This is right refuge, this is freedom.</P>
