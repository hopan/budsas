<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A recurring misunderstanding standing among some lay
    Buddhist is that a monk may practise as a doctor to the
    laity. Some monks do become skilled in herbal medicine and
    other traditional therapies but when, if ever, are they
    allowed by their precepts to behave as a doctor?</p>
    <p>The Lord Buddha once said &quot;Whoever, monks, would tend
    me, he should tend the sick&quot; and this well known saying
    has often used to justify a monk acting as a doctor. However,
    the saying is taken out of context as will soon be clear. The
    full passage, found in that section of the Vinayapitaka
    called the Mahavagga, chapter 8, verse 26, relates to the
    story of the Lord Buddha coming across a fellow monk who was
    suffering dysentery. With the help of Ven. Ananda, the Lord
    Buddha cleaned and settled the sick monk. Shortly afterwards,
    the Lord Buddha addressed the Sangha:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>&quot;Monks, you have not a mother, you have not a
        father who might tend you. If you, monks, do not tend one
        another, then who is there to tend you? Whoever, monks,
        would tend me, he should tend the sick.&quot; </i>(From
        the Pali Text Society&#146;s translation, Book of the
        Discipline, Vol 4 p 432)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The full passage makes it abundantly clear that when the
    Lord Buddha said &quot;Whoever would tend me should tend the
    sick&quot;, His meaning was for monks to look after fellow
    monks who were sick. He was not referring to monks acting as
    doctors to the laity. </p>
    <p>In fact, the Lord Buddha said several times that acting as
    a doctor to lay people is, for a monk, <b>Wrong Livelihood</b>
    (miccha-ajiva) directly contrary to the fifth factor of the
    Noble Eightfold Path and a Debased Art (tiracchana-vijja).
    For example, in the very first Sutta in the first collection
    of Suttas, being the <b><i>Brahmajala Sutta</i></b> of the
    Digha Nikaya, the Lord Buddha said:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>27. &quot;Whereas some recluses and brahmins while
        living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their
        living by a wrong means of livelihood (miccha-ajiva), by
        such debased arts (tiracchana-vijja) as: promising gifts
        to deities in return for favours; fulfilling such
        promises; demonology; reciting spells after entering an
        earthen house; inducing virility and impotence; preparing
        and consecrating sites for a house; giving ceremonial
        mouthwashes and bathing; offering sacrificial fires;
        administering emetics, purgatives, expectorants and
        phlemagogues; administering ear medicine, eye medicine,
        nose medicine, collyrium and counter ointments; curing
        cataracts, practising surgery, practising as a
        children&#146;s doctor; administering medicines to cure
        bodily diseases and balms to counter their after effects
        -- the recluse Gotama (the Lord Buddha) abstains from
        such wrong means of livelihood, from such debased
        arts.&quot; </i>(From <b><i>The Discourse on the
        All-Embracing Net Views</i></b><i> , </i>p 61, being the
        Buddhist Publication Society of Kandy&#146;s English
        edition of the Brahmajala Sutta)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Thus the Lord Buddha clearly condemned any monk who makes
    his living by behaving as a doctor to the laity.</p>
    <p>The tradition that has come down to all Theravada Buddhist
    monks is that described in the Samantapasadika, the great
    commentary on the Vinayapitaka compiled by Buddhaghosa in Sri
    Lanka in the 5th century C.E. This authoritative work states
    that a monk may prescribe and supply medicines to his fellow
    monastics (monks and nuns), to his parents or to those
    looking after his parents, and to any laypeople staying in
    the monastery of Vihara either preparing to go forth as monks
    of just staying to help the monks. Also, a monk may prescribe
    but not buy medicines to his brothers and sisters, aunts and
    uncles, grandparents and to whatever travellers, bandits,
    people wounded in battle and those without relatives who come
    to the monastery of Vihara for emergency help. Should a monk
    prescribe or supply medicines beyond his allowance, he
    commits an offence against his precepts (a <b>dukkata</b>
    offence). Further, if he prescribes of supplies a medicine to
    a layperson for a material gift in return, then he incurs
    another offence against his precepts for &quot;corrupting
    families&quot; (<b>kuladusaka</b>). That is what is stated in
    the Samantapasadika Vinaya Commentary, respected in all
    Theravada Buddhist countries. The passage may be found in the
    Pali Text Society&#146;s edition of the Samantapasadika page
    469f (unfortunately this work is in Pali and no English
    translation is available yet.</p>
    <p>This answer from the authoritative texts to the question
    &quot;May a monk act as a doctor?&quot; shows a wise balance
    which recognises a monk&#146;s duty to his parents, his
    responsibilities to those monks and laypeople staying with
    him in his monastery, and his compassion to all those
    visiting his monastery for emergency help. It prevents in any
    circumstances receiving any material reward for such
    services. Moreover, it remembers that the role of a Buddhist
    monk towards the laity is not to act as a doctor to the body
    but to act as a kind sage, a doctor to the mind.</p>
