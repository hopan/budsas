      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">Y</FONT>ou may have heard that you should 
      be mindful all the time, whether you are at home or in the office, or on 
      the bus or in your car or in somebody else’s car, etc. You may interpret 
      this advice to mean that you should keep your mind focused all the time on 
      your breath. While driving, if you simply keep your mind on the breath you 
      probably will get into some problems, such as losing your attention to 
      your driving or forgetting your driving and you may have an accidents.
      <P>Sometimes you may think &quot;to be mindful all the time&quot; means to pay 
      attention only to what ever you are doing at that particular time. This, 
      of course, is what any person who is serious enough in his/her work 
      normally does. An artist, painter, writer, singer, composer, thinking, 
      speaker, shooter, cook, etc. must pay attention to whatever they do at any 
      time they are engaged in their work. </P>
      <P>Not only human beings do this. You may have noticed cats paying total 
      attention to their prey in order to catch them without disturbing their 
      prey by making any mistakes. Tigers, lions and crocodiles pay total 
      attention to what they are going to catch. You may have noticed cranes 
      standing on one single spot for a long time to catch a fish. Sheep dogs 
      pay total attention to the movements of sheep so they can run very quickly 
      to direct the herd in the right direction. Unfortunately neither cat, 
      crane, nor sheep dog can remove their greed, lust etc., or cultivate an 
      iota of insight by merely paying total attention to their objects. </P>
      <P>Paying attention to whatever you are doing at any time is not going to 
      eliminate your greed, hatred, and ignorance. This, in fact, is exactly 
      what you do in tranquillity meditation or concentration meditation. By 
      paying attention to one thing at a time you cannot get rid of your psychic 
      irritation. You may focus your mind on one single object for fifty years 
      and still your psychic irritation will remain unchanged in your mind. One 
      person may observe all the moral rules. Another may learn all the texts by 
      heart. Someone else may gain concentration. Another may spend his/her 
      entire life in solitude. All of them might think that they can experience 
      supreme liberation from all psychic irritation, which no ordinary person 
      can attain. But none of them can have that experience without destroying 
      all the psychic irritation. Therefore in addition to all they practice 
      they also must remove all their psychic impurities in order to experience 
      the bliss of emancipation from all kinds of pain. </P>
      <P>What is missing in focusing total attention to one single object all 
      the time is wisdom. Your total attention should be coupled with wise 
      attention. What is wise attention? It is attention accompanied by the 
      three wholesome roots. What are the wholesome roots? They are generosity, 
      loving-kindness and wisdom. This means that when you pay attention to 
      something always attempt to pay attention without greed, hatred or 
      delusion, but with the thought of generosity, loving-kindness and wisdom. 
      These three are called wholesome roots; greed, hatred and delusion are 
      called unwholesome roots. Don’t let your mind be affected by unwholesome 
      roots when you pay attention to something. Let the thought of generosity, 
      loving-kindness and wisdom dominate your mind while paying attention to 
      anything. </P>
      <P>When you pay attention to pots and pans as you wash, you may not need 
      any loving-kindness, generosity or wisdom towards them. You are 
      cultivating mindfulness not for pots and pans, but for living beings. You 
      should pay attention to any thought regarding yourself, or any other 
      living beings. Have mindful reflection while wearing your clothes, eating 
      your food, drinking your water, talking to someone, listening to sound, 
      seeing an object, and walking or driving. </P>
      <P>When you pay total attention with wise consideration or mindful 
      reflection, your greed, hatred and delusion fade away, because in your 
      wise attention generosity, loving-kindness and wisdom are active. Your 
      thoughts of generosity, loving-kindness and wisdom have the power of 
      minimizing your greed, hatred and delusion while you are engaged in any 
      activity. While paying attention to something, without wise consideration 
      or wise attention, you may inadvertently develop greed, hatred and 
      confusion. You may see an object, for instance. That object may happen to 
      be attractive, beautiful or pleasing to your eyes or it may be 
      unattractive. At that time if you do not have wise attention, you may then 
      end up cultivating greed or resentment for the object or you may get 
      utterly confused ideas about the object. Or you may think that the object 
      is permanent instead of realizing that it is impermanent, satisfactory 
      instead of unsatisfactory, or having a self instead of being selfless. </P>
      <P>You may then ask how your generous thoughts can get rid of your greedy 
      thoughts, because the greedy thoughts want to cling to the object, or 
      grasp it. When you perceive the object with greed, your mind will cling to 
      it and not open to any thought of letting go of greed. You may not want to 
      take your eyes away from the object. In fact, at that time your mind 
      temporarily becomes blind to any thought of generosity. Even if you wish 
      to let go of the attachment to it you may do so with great reluctance. You 
      may feel that you are generous. But your generosity is only to fulfill 
      your greedy purpose, like gaining something in return, or gaining 
      recognition or becoming famous by being generous. Greed has very strong 
      super glue in it. At the very first contact with the desirable object the 
      mind sticks fast to it. Letting go of that object is as painful as cutting 
      off of a limb or some flesh of your body, and you cannot let go of that 
      object from your mind. </P>
      <P>This is where you really need your wise attention. This is where you 
      must learn to see impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and selflessness in the 
      object you are watching. Your wise consideration indicates that neither 
      the object you perceive nor your feeling or sensation regarding the object 
      remains the same even for two consecutive moments. You will not have the 
      same sensation later on. You change, the object you perceive changes. With 
      wise attention you will see that everything is impermanent. This knowledge 
      of impermanence allows you to let go of your resentment. When you see with 
      wisdom that everything that is unsatisfactory is impermanent, then you see 
      the connection between unsatisfactoriness and greed. As you are attached 
      to an impermanent object you will be disappointed with the change of the 
      object that you are so attached to. When you have wise consideration you 
      see that which is impermanent and unsatisfactory is without self. </P>
      <P>Then you might think &quot;Ah! Since this object is going to change, I must 
      be quick and smart to take the advantage of this object right now and 
      enjoy myself as quickly as possible before it disappears. Tomorrow it 
      won’t be there&quot;. Here you must remember haste makes waste. If you make a 
      hasty decision and do something foolish, you will regret it later on. 
      Sometimes you are attracted to a person, for instance, and grab hold of 
      him/her without giving much consideration to him/her, and later on you 
      will find many faults in that person. In any such hasty decision there is 
      no mindfulness. You cannot beat the change nor can you stop it by making 
      any foolish attempt. </P>
      <P>When your mindfulness is well developed, then even in haste you make a 
      right decision. The only thing that makes sense in rushing to beat 
      impermanence is to step back and check your own mind and see whether or 
      not you make the decision with wise consideration. When you are mindful 
      you will know how to take the advantage of the current moment so that you 
      will not regret it later on. Any mindful decision you make will make you 
      happy and peaceful and never make you regret it later on. </P>
      <P>Always remember that <I><B>mindfulness is the state of mind full of 
      generosity, loving-kindness, and wisdom together with compassion, 
      appreciative joy, and equanimity. Any time you pay attention to anything 
      you must ask whether your mind is full of these factors. If not you are 
      not mindful. </P>
      </B></I>
      <P>When you have generosity in the mind you will let go of any attractive 
      sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and thought without any hesitation. You 
      should certainly recognize them to be attractive in the conventional 
      sense. Know that it is because of their attractiveness that people become 
      attached to them and get involved in them. The deeper they get involved in 
      them the deeper is their suffering. When you have loving-kindness in your 
      mind you will not try to reject any sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and 
      thought if they happen to be unattractive. Mindfully perceive them with 
      the thought of impermanence. When any sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or 
      thought appears to be identical with self, look at it as an unreal concept 
      inculcated in your mind by conditioning through generations of wrong 
      notions and look at it with wisdom. </P>
      <P>Mindfulness is not carefulness. It is not smartness. Anybody can be 
      careful and smart. A man walking on a wire three hundred feet above ground 
      is careful. Remember those gymnasts performing all kinds of balancing 
      feats. Numerous daredevils who climb very steep mountains, across rocks, 
      slippery places, rivers, and so on are very careful. Many thieves are very 
      smart and outwit the police. Many drug dealers, bank robbers, criminals 
      are very smart. None of them can be considered to be mindful. </P>
      <I><B>
      <P>Mindfulness is that state of mind which reflects upon itself not to get 
      caught in greed, hatred and ignorance, which cause suffering to yourself, 
      to others or to both.</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>When we ask people not to cultivate resentment some people ask us how 
      can you live without resentment? This is the miracle of mindfulness. When 
      you practice mindfulness you can learn to do most difficult things easily. 
      Not becoming resentful, lustful, or confused is very difficult. Through 
      constant training in mindfulness you learn to live without resentment, 
      lust or confusion. Moreover to be mindful is more difficult than to be 
      unmindful, and you learn to do that more difficult one more easily than 
      the easier one. For this reason the Buddha said: </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><I>&quot;For the good to do what is good is easy <BR>
        For the bad to do what is bad is easy <BR>
        For the bad to do what is good is difficult<BR>
        For the noble to do what is bad is difficult.&quot; (Ud. 84) </I></P>
        <P>and: </P>
        <P><I>&quot;Which is most difficult at the beginning becomes easy through 
        constant practice&quot; (Ud 61). </I></P>
