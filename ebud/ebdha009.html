An Exclusive Interview on his 99th Birthday in London, <BR>
Tilak S. Fernando spoke to Ven.  Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Mahanayake 
Thera. <P>
<HR>

<P>
The 99th birthday of the Most Ven. Aggamahapanditha Balangoda 
Anandamaitreya Mahanayake Thera was celebrated at The Saddhatissa 
International Buddhist Centre, Kingsbury, North West London on 23 
August 1994. The Ven. Mahanayake was observing the lent of Rainy 
Season (Vassna Retreat) in London at the time. Addressing the large 
gathering on this occasion Ven. Thera said : ' <I>You are celebrating my 
birthday and I am reaching my 99th year. That means my life span is 
fast coming to an end. Is this a thing to celebrate ? Well ! as for 
me, it is a thing for celebration, because nearer I go towards death 
happier I feel, as I know nearing my death means I am moving towards a 
new birth. My humble wish is to be reborn over and over again among 
human beings for the service of the Buddha Dhamma. In this life I 
could not fulfil my wish to its pristine purity. But I know in my next 
life I will be more influential, better learned, much stronger and 
capable of carrying out my service to propagate Buddhism in the world. 
It is common knowledge in Sri Lanka that my aspiration is to attain 
Buddha hood some day in the distant future. 
Perhaps it will be decided when I see Lord Maitreya</I>'. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
Q. I am sure people in Sri Lanka would like to know something about 
your life prior to your priesthood . Would you like to talk about 
it?<P>
<P>
A. I was born on 23 August 1896 to Heenmenike and Mathies Appuhamy.
Fourteen days after I was born, my mother had died and my saddened 
father had left the village altogether. It was my uncle Dingirihamy 
Mudalali ( father's brother) and his wife Yasohamine who brought me 
up. To me they were my parents.<P>
<P>
Q. What were you called in your childhood, and what made you to enter 
priesthood?<P>
<P>
A. My  ( gihi)  name was Punchi Mahattaya. At the age of 9 an eminent 
figure from the Mahabodhi Society, Brahmacharya Walisinghe 
Harrischandra visited my school, Kumara Vidyalaya,  in 1905, and 
delivered a speech on Buddhist way of life. Having listened to his 
talk, I thought I should follow the true Buddhist path and be a model 
like the gentleman himself.  Those days  everyone respected and 
honoured monks. At the age of 15,  after a ' battle' with my 
'parents' to obtain their blessing to take up robes,  I received  their 
consent in 1911. Finally I was ordained as a 'Samanera', at 
Nandaramaya, Balangoda Udumulla Temple, which was also built by my 
uncle Dingiri  Mudalali.<P>
<P>
Q. In a spiritual context, how would you explain the moral decadence 
of the people in Sri Lanka over the years ?<P>
<P>
A. Towards the latter part of the British rule Sri Lankans lived a 
happy and  a pious life. Their aim was to uphold their  culture and 
religion. When foreign influence was encroaching upon the Lankan 
society people like Anagarika Dharmapala  fought against such tide 
waves . They foresaw the  impact and the damage  the foreign influence 
was going to have on  the Country. That was the main  purpose set 
forth to oust the British and seek Independence. But once  we received 
our Independence, our National leaders, in my opinion,  did not 
understand the very purpose of achieving that freedom. Therefore, they 
carried on as before, and the result was that the country went from 
bad to worse.<P>
<P>
Q. We didn't really reap the benefits out of our Independence , is 
that what you mean ?<P>
<P>
A. During the British rule, at least the Europeans listened to our 
peoples' claims and their agitation, but our  leaders turned a  deaf 
ear to any public outcry. By Sri Lanka becoming more liberalised, it 
caused a steep decline in cultural and religious values. Soon, people 
started to divide themselves  into various political groups, whereas 
during the Colonial regime there was complete unity among the people. 
That unity was associated with preserving Buddhism and  our cultural 
values, but today's deterioration on moral cultural, economical and 
spiritual  values are due to this division of our own people. They are 
only interested in competing against each other and  promoting  their 
own political parties  and not religion or cultural values.<P>
<P>
Q. In the light of reference to ' Devas' ( Gods) in Buddhist  ' 
prayers' such as in ' Ethipiso Bagawa...., Eththa Watcha Chamhehi 
..... Swakhato Bhagawatho..etc...' can you reconcile such references 
with the concept of an Omnipresent God, as referred to in Hinduism ?
<P>
<P>
A. Buddhists don't believe in an Omnipresent or Omnipotent God. <P>
Every man , according to Buddhist philosophy, has the opportunity to 
be born in one of six Deva Worlds as a Deva, if one  lives a morally 
good clean life. In other words, there are people who have ascended to 
higher worlds due to their good Karma. There are some earth bound 
Devas too, who are very near us. Humans  can  transfer merit to some 
Devas, but  not to every Deva.  Merely  repeating like a parrot gathas 
such as ' Aaaka satt tarta bhummatta or Ethha Watha Chamhehi',   out 
of habit , or offering alms,  for the sake of name and fame , there is 
nothing to transfer as merit to Devas,  and people cannot expect 
protection from Devas in such circumstances. Today  when they want to 
give alms to priests some go in search of Nayaka Theros, famous 
priests ( ' big guns'... with an infectious laugh ) and  forget the 
poor monks who lead religious and secluded lives. Out of such alms 
giving people cannot expect any help from Devas!  It is my personal 
belief  that Devas have forgotten our country, unfortunately !<P>
<P>
Q. Today Lord Buddha's message is being interpreted to the  world in 
various forms, such as Hinayana, Mahayana and Vagirayana. Do you agree 
that these different interpretations tend to blur Buddha's basic 
message ?<P>
<P>
A. There may be different schools of thought, different rituals and 
rites among  various sects, but  the underlined factor is that 
Buddhists are all united in Lord Buddha's  ' Attangika Magga'  ( 8 
fold path). <P>
Rituals and ceremonies are unimportant but what matters is the quality 
of life one leads  and whether it is pure and  unblemished. Then you 
will find  you are on the way to progress, in Lord Buddha's point of 
view.<P>
<P>
Q. How would you analyse the terms 'Soul' and 'Athma' ? Lord Buddha 
taught that the word 'soul' had no meaning .   How would you account 
for the cycle of rebirth taking the concept of soul as interpreted  by 
other religions?<P>
<P>
A. There are two ways of explaining  this if we take the Sun as a 
simple example. A teacher, who takes a class of young children, may 
use the conventional language to tell his students that  the Sun is 
rising and setting, although there is no such thing , but the 
phenomena take place due to the rotation of the earth. When the same 
teacher takes an advanced class he has to use  'deeper' language and 
use scientific examples and perhaps  be more philosophical. Likewise, 
Buddha's teachings varied according to the level of inteligence of the 
seekers of the truth and he used  the words such as 'Soul'  and 
'Athma' as appropriate. But to those aspirants who had opened up their 
intelligence,  Lord Buddha taught the Vipassana Meditation -  dealing 
with  topics such as 'what is life? What is man ( matter + mind)?';  
Mind is a series of impermanent occurrences to be taken  as unchanging 
essence or 'soul';  Physical body is also a stream of material state 
subject to momentary change and there is nothing  to be taken as ego, 
entity or 'soul'. This practice of understanding one's own nature, 
Buddha said, was not practicable to use in the ' ordinary world'.<P>
<P>
Q. The subject of paranormal phenomena is being explored in depth 
today in the Western world. In the University of Edinburgh, a Chair 
has been set up for the sake of Parapsychology which involves the 
study of Ghosts. What  are your views on Ghosts or Bhuthayas as we 
call them?<P>
<P>
A. Well!  when a man dies, sometimes  he is born in a different world 
with a subtle body due to his attachment to his family. In that subtle 
(astral) body form the dead person can live for some time till he 
ascends to a higher world with the help of meritorious deeds done by 
his relatives. In that body  such a person can travel faster than 
light because it moves with the mind.<P>
<P>
Q. How is that only some people can  see such subtle bodies and others 
not ?<P>
<P>
A. Some dead persons in that state can make their astral bodies become 
solid so that others may see it. Others  are not able to do it and,  
therefore,  they cannot show themselves.<P>
<P>
Q. There is a belief in Sri Lanka that people are always born under 
various 'Ganas' such as Rakksa, Deva and Manussa Gana. Is it a fact? 
<P>
<P>
A. It is only an astrological interpretation. Now, I belong to Raksa 
Gana but I am not cruel at all ( highly tickled with laughter ).<P>
<P>
Q. Today a lot of Buddhists are becoming Sai Baba devotees. In view of 
the confused state of mind in certain Buddhist quarters, could you 
throw some light on the subject ?<P>
<P>
A. I also visited Sai Baba some 20 years or so ago when I was nearly 
going blind with Cataract. Everyone advised me against an operation 
and, I was very confused. Suddenly a Dayaka in our temple, who  could 
not speak English paid my travelling expenses and invited me to 
accompany him to India , as an interpreter, to see Sai Baba. When I 
saw Sai Baba at Whitefield, Bangalore, he came to me straight, out of 
the crowd, and blessed me with his usual gesture of waving his right 
hand and  walked away from me. After taking  a few yards,  suddenly he 
turned back and walked towards me again. Next, he put both his hands 
on my shoulders, smiled and said ' Get your eyes operated,  it will be 
successful'.  I told Sai Baba, that was exactly I was contemplating in 
my mind to ask him. He simply smiled again and repeated, 'Don't you 
worry, operation will be successful' and went away.<P>
<P>
Q. What was your instant reaction ?<P>
<P>
A. I was stunned because even without having to ask the question Sai 
Baba knew  exactly my thoughts. According to me,  He is a very 
powerful person with some wonderful psychic powers. He is regarded as 
incarnation of Lord Vishnu,  a world teacher, coming Messiah, advanced 
yogi etc., by various people. But to me,  he is one who has tremendous 
powers and highly  spirutually elevated personality.<P>
<P>
Q. So, then,  as a Buddhist there is no harm in following Sai Baba ? 
<P>
<P>
A. Well! supposing if you  were to visit a Harley Street specialist 
for a consultation or to get some treatment, is it harmful to your 
religion ? (smilingly) . Likewise,  people go to Sai Baba to clear  
their doubts, seek help for various forms of  mental, psychical 
psychological etc.  There is no harm at all in doing so.
<P>
I will tell you another story. In Anguttra Nikaya,  Lord Buddha 
referred to six great teachers who were  true believers in a creator 
God called Brahmma. These teachers taught people how to follow a 
morally good path in life to develop their jhanas ( spiritual 
knowledge). Those who practised such disciplines were  later born in 
Brahma world. So,  The Buddha said, the  pupils were not even 
Buddhists but  followers of Brahmma God,  yet  they  listened to their 
teachers with open minds, respected their masters' teaching  and 
followed their good advice and led pure and moral lives which helped 
them to earn much merit. They were consequently  reborn in Deva and 
Brahmma worlds.<P>
<P>
Q. What happened to your sight after you met Sai Baba ?<P>
<P>
A. Two weeks after I returned back to Sri Lanka I  went completely 
blind in both my eyes. Immediately I entered the general hospital and 
got my right eye operated. It was successful. Later  the left eye was 
operated on. Now I can read big letters even without having to wear 
spectacles.<P>
<P>
Q. Do you think that Sai Baba helped you and encouraged to undergo 
your eye operations ?<P>
<P>
A. Yes ! Yes !  His blessings on me also have  helped me a great deal. 
<P>
<P>
Q. How would you categorise Buddhists in Sri Lanka today - Average, 
Deep or just ritualistic ?<P>
<P>
A. People in every village and town are now becoming more and more 
interested in the practice of meditation. Specially it is encouraging 
to see  mostly the youth , both male and female ,  becoming interested 
in Vippassana meditation. In my  view, the uneducated are getting 
caught up in  ritualistic practices which was not found some 50 years 
ago. But on the whole,  Buddhism is  now improving among the educated 
classes and it is  a very good sign.<P>
<P>
Q. In Sri Lanka you are regarded as one of the most respected and holy 
monks  who has  reached spiritual enlightenment to a very high degree. 
Yet in some sections of the society  there were subtle criticism about 
your close association with the late President Premadasa , who was  a 
politician.  What are your comments?<P>
<P>
A. I am not a politician and I do not belong to any political party . 
<P>
People have totally misunderstood me. I knew Mr. Premadasa as a young 
boy who came to  our temple to read my Dhamma School books.  I was 
very much familiar with him long before he entered politics. Later 
when I was in the USA he had named a new village in my  home town 
Balangoda , under his Gam Udawa project. He called it the  Ananda 
Maitreya Gama, and I  did not even know about it as I was in the USA 
at the time. When I returned to Sri Lanka I went to thank him. He 
asked me whether it was not a good idea to live close to Colombo , at 
my age, as  it was tiresome for me to travel to and from Balangoda. 
Within a week he showed me a video film of a plot of land and asked 
me, 'Hamuduruwane  do you like this place?' It was a calm place near a 
river and ideal for my meditation,  I told him so.  When I was in 
England two years later, he phoned me and asked me return to Sri Lanka 
to  take over the new temple which he had already built without my 
knowledge. He had already named it  Battaramulla Chitta Viveka 
Asramaya .  When I saw him in Colombo again he told me, ' 
Hamuduruwane,  this is my religious obligation as I have a great 
regard for you, and this  has nothing to do with politics. I  do not 
want you to get involved in politics or become a UNP supporter.' It is 
true that I went to see some of his Gam Udawa programmes, and that was 
purely  out of my own accord  to see what they were like. Even Mrs. 
Bandranaiyke has told me the same thing , not to get involved in 
politics, when she was the Prime Minister. Late Dr. N.M.Perera had 
made a request in his last will for me to perform his funeral rites . 
The moment I heard about it I went  and did everything to fulfill his 
last wishes.<P>
<P>
Q. Looking back at your past,  would you comment on the lax discipline  
of some of the modern monks. Do you agree that Vinaya Council in Sri 
Lanka has not pulled its weight to cleanse the Sangha of such 
deviants? Some years ago the Vinaya Council exercised stringent powers 
of discipline. Why has it failed to deliver?<P>
<P>
A. Some years ago Bhikkus were much engrossed in keeping to Vinaya. 
Even now in most temples there are many disciplined monks. If there 
was a lax in discipline I can only think of the  new University 
education, followed by monks taking up teaching careers. Even among 
them  I know quite a few who are trying to maintain highly disciplined 
Orders. <P>
Here and there you will always find a black sheep, you can't avoid it. 
Even during Lord Buddha's time there were 250 bhikkus who were living 
in a monastery  misbehaving. They were dancing with women and sleeping 
with women . Women were singing and playing the harp, and they were 
entertaining  the monks  etc.  Ultimately Lord Buddha had to send Ven. 
Sariputta to chase the undisciplined monks away ( laughter....)  . My 
advice  is, if you come across a undisciplined monk try and explain to 
him the purpose of his becoming a bhikku, in a loving and caring 
manner, otherwise if you condemn him he will become incorrigible.<P>
<P>
Q. What are you future plans?<P>
<P>
A. To do some service to  Dhamma whenever I get an opportunity. But 
the problem is that I never get a free moment,  whether I am  in Sri 
Lanka , England or  in the USA,  people are gathering to see me and 
they seek advice.  I suppose it is also a form   of service .  My main 
aim is to attain to a higher level of mind development.  I will do it. 
My conscience says that I am going to do it. I do not want to be born 
in heavenly worlds when I am dead. I would like to be born in Sri 
Lanka as a human being to develop Buddhism further and propagate Lord 
Buddha's philosophy throughout the world in its pristine purity. I 
have this strong feeling and urge within me. Apart from that, as many 
people are aware,  my aspiration is to attain Buddhahood in the 
distant future someday. Perhaps it will be decided when I see Lord 
Maitreya.<P>
