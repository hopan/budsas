    <p align="left"><em>A life-affirming Buddhism that teaches us
    to find happiness by opening to the richness of our everyday
    lives. </em></p>
    <p>That's what we want -- or so we're told by the people who
    try to sell us a mainstreamlined Buddhism. But is it what we
    need? And is it Buddhism? </p>
    <p>Think back for a moment on the story of the young Prince
    Siddhartha and his first encounters with aging, illness,
    death, and a wandering contemplative. It's one of the most
    accessible chapters in the Buddhist tradition, largely
    because of the direct, true-to-the-heart quality of the young
    prince's emotions. He saw aging, illness, and death as an
    absolute terror, and pinned all his hopes on the
    contemplative forest life as his only escape. As Asvaghosa,
    the great Buddhist poet, depicts the story, the young prince
    had no lack of friends and family members who tried to talk
    him out of those perceptions, and Asvaghosa was wise enough
    to show their life-affirming advice in a very appealing
    light. Still, the prince realized that if he were to give in
    to their advice, he would be betraying his heart. Only by
    remaining true to his honest emotions was he able to embark
    on the path that led away from the ordinary values of his
    society and toward an unsurpassed Awakening into the
    Deathless. </p>
    <p>This is hardly a life-affirming story in the ordinary
    sense of the term, but it does affirm something more
    important than life: the truth of the heart when it aspires
    to a happiness absolutely pure. The power of this aspiration
    depends on two emotions, called in Pali <strong><i>samvega</i></strong>
    and <strong><i>pasada</i></strong><i>. </i>Very few of us
    have heard of them, but they're the emotions most basic to
    the Buddhist tradition. Not only did they inspire the young
    prince in his quest for Awakening, but even after he became
    the Buddha he advised his followers to cultivate them on a
    daily basis. In fact, the way he handled these emotions is so
    distinctive that it may be one of the most important
    contributions his teachings have to offer to American culture
    today. </p>
    <p><strong><i>Samvega</i></strong> was what the young Prince
    Siddhartha felt on his first exposure to aging, illness, and
    death. It's a hard word to translate because it covers such a
    complex range -- at least three clusters of feelings at once:
    the oppressive sense of shock, dismay, and alienation that
    come with realizing the futility and meaninglessness of life
    as it's normally lived; a chastening sense of our own
    complacency and foolishness in having let ourselves live so
    blindly; and an anxious sense of urgency in trying to find a
    way out of the meaningless cycle. This is a cluster of
    feelings that we've all experienced at one time or another in
    the process of growing up, but I don't know of a single
    English term that adequately covers all three. It would be
    useful to have such a term, and maybe that's reason enough
    for simply adopting the word <strong><i>samvega</i></strong>
    into our language. </p>
    <p>But more than providing a useful term, Buddhism also
    offers an effective strategy for dealing with the feelings
    behind it -- feelings that our own culture finds threatening
    and handles very poorly. Ours, of course, is not the only
    culture threatened by feelings of <em><strong>samvega</strong></em>.
    In the Siddhartha story, the father's reaction to the young
    prince's discovery stands for the way most cultures try to
    deal with these feelings: He tried to convince the prince
    that his standards for happiness were impossibly high, at the
    same time trying to distract him with relationships and every
    sensual pleasure imaginable. To put it simply, the strategy
    was to get the prince to lower his aims and to find
    satisfaction in a happiness that was less than absolute and
    not especially pure. </p>
    <p>If the young prince were living in America today, the
    father would have other tools for dealing with the prince's
    dissatisfaction, but the basic strategy would be essentially
    the same. We can easily imagine him taking the prince to a
    religious counselor who would teach him to believe that God's
    creation is basically good and not to focus on any aspects of
    life that would cast doubt on that belief. Or he might take
    him to a psychotherapist who would treat feelings of <em><strong>samvega</strong></em>
    as an inability to accept reality. If talking therapies
    didn't get results, the therapist would probably prescribe
    mood-altering drugs to dull the feeling out of the young
    man's system so that he could become a productive,
    well-adjusted member of society. </p>
    <p>If the father were really up on current trends, he might
    find a Dharma teacher who would counsel the prince to find
    happiness in life's little miraculous pleasures -- a cup of
    tea, a walk in the woods, social activism, easing another
    person's pain. Never mind that these forms of happiness would
    still be cut short by aging, illness, and death, he would be
    told. The present moment is all we have, so we should try to
    appreciate the bittersweet opportunity of relishing but not
    holding on to brief joys as they pass. </p>
    <p>It's unlikely that the lion-hearted prince we know from
    the story would take to any of this well-meant advice. He'd
    see it as propaganda for a life of quiet desperation, asking
    him to be a traitor to his heart. But if he found no solace
    from these sources, where in our society would he go? Unlike
    the India of his time, we don't have any well-established,
    socially accepted alternatives to being economically
    productive members of society. Even our contemplative
    religious orders are prized for their ability to provide
    bread, honey, and wine for the marketplace. So the prince
    would probably find no alternative but to join the drifters
    and dropouts, the radicals and revolutionaries, the
    subsistence hunters and survivalists consigned to the social
    fringe. </p>
    <p>He'd discover many fine minds and sensitive spirits in
    these groups, but no accumulated body of proven and profound
    alternative wisdom to draw on. Someone might give him a book
    by Thoreau or Muir, but their writings would offer him no
    satisfactory analysis of aging, illness, and death, and no
    recommendations for how to go beyond them. And because
    there's hardly any safety net for people on the fringe, he'd
    find himself putting an inordinate amount of his energy into
    issues of basic survival, with little time or energy left
    over to find his own solution to the problem of <em><strong>samvega</strong></em>.
    He would end up disappearing, his Buddhahood aborted --
    perhaps in the Utah canyon country, perhaps in a Yukon forest
    -- without trace. </p>
    <p>Fortunately for us, however, the prince was born in a
    society that <i>did</i> provide support and respect for its
    dropouts. This was what gave him the opportunity to find a
    solution to the problem of <em><strong>samvega</strong></em>
    that did justice to the truths of his heart. </p>
    <p>The first step in that solution is symbolized in the
    Siddhartha story by the prince's reaction to the fourth
    person he saw on his travels outside of the palace: the
    wandering forest contemplative. The emotion he felt at this
    point is termed <em><strong>pasada</strong></em><i>, </i>another
    complex set of feelings usually translated as &quot;clarity
    and serene confidence.&quot; It's what keeps <em><strong>samvega</strong></em>
    from turning into despair. In the prince's case, he gained a
    clear sense of his predicament and of the way out of it,
    leading to something beyond aging, illness, and death, at the
    same time feeling confident that the way would work. </p>
    <p>As the early Buddhist teachings freely admit, the
    predicament is that the cycle of birth, aging, and death <i>is</i>
    meaningless. They don't try to deny this fact and so don't
    ask us to be dishonest with ourselves or to close our eyes to
    reality. As one teacher has put it, the Buddhist recognition
    of the reality of suffering -- so important that suffering is
    honored as the first noble truth -- is a gift, in that it
    confirms our most sensitive and direct experience of things,
    an experience that many other traditions try to deny. </p>
    <p>From there, the early teachings ask us to become even more
    sensitive, to the point where we see that the true cause of
    suffering is not <strong><i>out there</i></strong> -- in
    society or some outside being -- but <strong><i>in here</i></strong><i>,</i>
    in the craving present in each individual mind. They then
    confirm that there is an end to suffering, a release from the
    cycle. And they show the way to that release, through
    developing noble qualities already latent in the mind to the
    point where they cast craving aside and open onto
    Deathlessness. Thus the predicament has a practical solution,
    a solution within the powers of every human being. </p>
    <p>It's also a solution open to critical scrutiny and testing
    -- an indication of how confident the Buddha was in the
    solution he found to the problem of <em><strong>samvega</strong></em>.
    This is one of the aspects of authentic Buddhism that most
    inspires confidence in people who are accustomed to being
    told that they should try to put the insights that inspired
    their sense of <em><strong>samvega</strong></em> out of their
    minds. </p>
    <p>In fact, early Buddhism is not only confident that it can
    handle feelings of <em><strong>samvega</strong></em> but it's
    one of the few religions that actively cultivates them to a
    radical extent. Its solution to the problems of life demand
    so much dedicated effort that only strong <em><strong>samvega</strong></em>
    will keep the practicing Buddhist from slipping back into his
    or her old ways. Hence the recommendation that all Buddhists,
    both men and women, lay or ordained, should reflect daily on
    the facts of aging, illness, separation, and death -- to
    develop feelings of <em><strong>samvega</strong></em> -- and
    on the power of one's own actions, to take <em><strong>samvega</strong></em>
    one step further, to <em><strong>pasada</strong></em>. </p>
    <p>For people whose sense of <em><strong>samvega</strong></em>
    is so strong that they want to abandon any social ties that
    prevent them from following the path to the end of suffering,
    Buddhism offers both a long-proven body of wisdom for them to
    draw from, as well as a safety net: the monastic sangha, an
    institution that enables them to leave lay society without
    having to waste time worrying about basic survival. For those
    who can't leave their social ties, Buddhist teaching offers a
    way to live in the world without being overcome by the world,
    following a life of generosity, virtue, and meditation to
    strengthen the noble qualities of the mind that will lead to
    the end of suffering. </p>
    <p>The symbiotic relationship designed for these two branches
    of the Buddhist <strong><i>parisa</i></strong><i>, </i>or
    community, guarantees that each will benefit from contact
    with the other. The support of the laity guarantees that the
    monastics will not need to be overly concerned about food,
    clothing, and shelter; the gratitude that the monastics
    inevitably feel for the freely-offered generosity of the
    laity helps to keep them from turning into misfits and
    misanthropes. At the same time, contact with the monastics
    helps the laity foster the proper perspective on life that
    nurtures the energy of <em><strong>samvega</strong></em> and <em><strong>pasada</strong></em>
    they need to keep from becoming dulled and numbed by the
    materialistic propaganda of the mainstream economy. </p>
    <p>So the Buddhist attitude toward life cultivates <em><strong>samvega</strong></em>
    -- a clear acceptance of the meaninglessness of the cycle of
    birth, aging, and death -- and develops it into <em><strong>pasada</strong></em>:
    a confident path to the Deathless. That path includes not
    only time-proven guidance, but also a social institution that
    nurtures it and keeps it alive. These are all things that our
    society desperately needs. It's a shame that, in our current
    efforts at mainstreaming Buddhism, they are aspects of the
    Buddhist tradition usually ignored. We keep forgetting that
    one source of Buddhism's strength is its ability to keep one
    foot out of the mainstream, and that the traditional metaphor
    for the practice is that it crosses <i>over</i> the stream to
    the further shore. My hope is that we will begin calling
    these things to mind and taking them to heart, so that in our
    drive to find a Buddhism that sells, we don't end up selling
    ourselves short. </p>
