<BLOCKQUOTE><p>I am delighted to be able to share this important occasion with you,

the centenary of the publication of the book, &quot;Philosophy of the Teachings

of Islam&quot;. I am dealing with one of the themes of the book, &quot;The

Object of Life and the Means of its Attainment&quot;. </p>



<p>What, then, is the object of life? To this question people will give

diverse answers. Some may say - to make a lot of money. Why do people want

money? Because they believe that this will bring them many material posessions

which, they imagine, will bring them happiness. Can material posessions

bring happiness? To a limited extent, they can, but is one really satisfied?

Usually it’s the case that no matter what you have you can always envisage

having something better or bigger. These posessions can also be the cause

of anxiety for fear of losing them. A story from the Buddha’s time tells

of the Buddha sitting by the side of the road with some of his monks when

a farmer came by looking very distressed. &quot;Did you see a herd of cows

pass this way?&quot; he asked. &quot;No!&quot; said the Buddha. &quot;Oh

dear!&quot; said the farmer, &quot; I have lost all of my cows and last

year there was no rain and my crops failed. I’m so unhappy. My life is

ruined&quot;. After he had gone, the Buddha turned to his monks and said,

&quot; Monks, aren’t you fortunate that you don’t own any cows?&quot;.

There is always present a craving or attachment. This craving or attachment,

whether it be for material things, friends or family can be a source of

sorrow - the opposite of happiness. This sorrow or unsatisfactoriness is

described in the Buddha’s teachings as ‘dukkha’, whereas happiness, which

most people seek is called ‘sukkha’. The Buddha taught that the nature

of life is dukkha. Most of us would prefer to experience sukkha but the

very fact that our happy states don’t last, makes them, in effect, unsatisfying

or sorrowful. The object of life, for most of us, then is to find happiness

- a lasting happiness, but, life by its very nature is full of sorrow.

</p>



<p>The essence of the Buddha’s teaching is contained in the Four Noble

Truths, the first of which states that &quot;Life is, by its very nature,

dukkha, unsatisfying or frustrating&quot;. Dukkha is often translated as

‘suffering’ but it is much more than that. It certainly means physical

and mental suffering but it also means that life is full of frustrations

- we would always prefer things to be other than the way they are. As we

grow old, we wish we could remain young. If we are poor, we wish we could

be rich. When we are separated from our friends and loved ones, or, in

the case of the farmer, our possessions, we are saddened. Dukkha includes

birth, sickness, old age, pain and despair, separation from those whom

we like and association with those whom we dislike. All of these are examples

of Dukkha and that is the First Noble Truth. No matter what is the nature

of things in life, we always crave for them to be other than the way they

are. We don’t want to face the fact that life is unsatisfactory or frustrating.

We always seek to relieve this unsatisfactoriness by craving for more of

this or more of that. </p>



<p>This brings us to the second of the Four Noble Truths which tells us

that the cause of dukkha is rooted in what are known as the three poisons,

greed or attachment, anger or hatred and a deluded mind. We tend to be

attached to people and material things and when we are separated from them,

we suffer regret. We cling to these things as if they will last forever

and we find it hard to accept the fact that they don’t. We get angry or

have aversions to those things that we do not like. Buddhism teaches that

anger harms the one who is angry more than the object to which this anger

is directed. Anger causes heating of the blood and an unpleasant appearance.

The more we get angry with someone and they react to our anger the more

this anger increases. Anger is unproductive - it doesn’t solve any problems.

Our minds are deluded because we do not see things as they really are -

that is, subject to impermanence (anicca, Pali), frustrating (dukkha, Pali)

and devoid of a permanent self or substance (anatta, Pali). Everything,

material or immaterial, is subject to change or impermanence. Perhaps you

are sitting comfortably in your chairs at the moment. If you remain in

that chair for the next three hours, without moving, do you still think

you could regard the chair as comfortable? If you remained fixed in that

chair for a month, you would probably find that you are crippled and unable

to move. If you remain in that chair for a hundred years, you will probably

be a skeleton and the chair will be fairly seedy too. What starts as being

regarded as ‘comfortable’ can soon change to being uncomfortable. Everything

is relative. The way we see things depends on the time, place and current

situation. We, ourselves, are subject to this change. Every cell in our

body is constantly aging and dying and being replaced. Our thoughts and

ideas are constantly changing or being modified. Your thoughts and ideas,

since you arrived in this beautiful mosque, are different from before you

arrived. They have changed considerably. Is there anything in you, which

is not subject to this change? I don’t think so. This is why Buddhists

say, in the ultimate sense, there is no ‘you’ or unchanging self entity.

There is no ghost in the machine pressing the buttons. This concept of

change and the comprehension of the idea of &quot;no self’ is difficult

to accept and is, therefore, Dukkha. </p>



<p>The third Noble Truth concerns the overcoming of Dukka, that is, overcoming

the greed, anger and delusion that are the source of Dukkha. Accepting

change as a characteristic of life and not becoming angry or frustrated

about it is part of the way to overcoming Dukkha. This overcoming of Dukkha

is termed &quot;Nirvana&quot;. Nirvana is not a place but could be described

as a state of mind - a mind that sees things as they really are and not

clouded by delusion. Yet it is more than just a state of mind. It transcends

speculation and description. The Buddha spoke of it thus: ‘Monks, there

is an unborn, a not-become, a not-made, a not-compounded. Monks, if that

unborn, not-become, not-made, not-compounded were not, there would be apparent

no escape from this that here is born, become, made, compounded. But, monks,

since there is an unborn, not-become, not-made, not-compounded, therefore

the escape from this that here is born, become, made and compounded is

apparent.’ Some may refer to this unborn, not-become, not-made, not compounded

as God. Buddhists, however, are reluctant to use the term &quot;God&quot;.

God means different things to different people. Some will say that it refers

to an anthropomorphic being like ourselves who created the world whilst

others, such as the Christian Philosopher of Religion, Paul Tillich, suggests

that God is the ‘ground of being’ - the very fact of existence, whereas

others prefer not to define God because such things as descriptions are

inadequate when speaking of the transcendental. It is because of the confusion

surrounding meaning of the term &quot;God&quot; that Buddhists avoid using

the term altogether. Buddhists speak of Nirvana - that which is unborn,

not-become, not-made, and not-compounded. Nirvana is not anihilation, as

many non-Buddhists claim but is a state beyond becoming - a transcendental

state. It is beyond comparison with anything that we can know in the world

so how can we define it? All descriptions are inadequate. </p>



<p>The Fourth Noble Truth is the method taught by the Buddha for attaining

this state of Nirvana. It is the Noble Eightfold Path. You may be wondering

why the term ‘Noble’(Ariya) is used for the Path. One who walks the Path

is considered to be a noble or worthy person. The eight steps of the Path

are: Right Understanding, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right

Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration. Right

Understanding is knowledge that the Four Noble Truths lead to the overcoming

of Dukkha. It does not imply a total understanding of these Truths but

a confidence that, by following the Path, the result, Nirvana, will be

attained. Right Thought is to be constantly aware of one’s thoughts and

actions and thereby avoiding harm to any living creature. Right Speech

is awareness of one’s speech so that, what one says, is beneficial to the

hearer. Right Action is to be aware of one’s actions and observe the five

precepts of avoiding the taking of life, taking what is not given to you,

sexual misconduct, lying and deceiving and the partaking of alcohol and

drugs which tend to distort the mind. Essentially one should avoid any

action which may cause harm to oneself or any other living creature. Right

Livelihood is to earn one’s living in a way that does not cause harm or

suffering. Such occupations as the selling of intoxicants, firearms or

animals for slaughter would be considered inappropriate for Buddhists.

Right Effort is the avoiding of evil which has not already arisen, rejecting

evil which has already arisen, the acquiring of wholesome things which

have not yet been acquired and the stabilising of those wholesome characteristics

that have already been acquired. Right Mindfulness is training in constant

awareness of the effects of one’s actions, whether of body, speech or mind,

and thus avoiding harmful actions. Right Concentration is cultivating the

mind through concentration and meditation so that one attains intuitive

insight. </p>



<p>Meditation (Bhavana) is a central part of Buddhist practice. In the

Theravadin tradition, two forms of meditation, calm (Samatha) and insight

(Vipassana) are recognised as essential practice in achieving spiritual

progress. Calming the mind is achieved by concentration on a specific object

and excluding all extraneous thoughts. Often, the breath or the movement

of the diaphragm is used as a suitable object for concentration. At other

times, objects, such as coloured discs (Kasinas) or meditation beads (Mala)

or even counting the breaths are used to fix the mind during this preliminary

practice. This concentration practice, calms the mind and induces a feeling

of well-being. It is also a necessary practice for gaining one-pointedness

of mind or full concentration. Once the mind has been trained in concentration,

the meditator can then reflect on the feelings and sensations of the body,

noting them as they arise and pass away. This latter practice is known

as Vipassana and is the means of cultivating insight or mindfulness.</p>



<p>In the Cha’n (Zen, Japanese) tradition, two techniques are employed.

One method is to concentrate on the breath and then try to clear the mind

of all thoughts whatsoever. This method eliminates the constant chatter

of the mind and results in an awakening (satori). Another Cha’an technique

is to ponder a question (Kung-an, Chinese, Koan, Japanese), which has no

rational answer. Typical koans are, &quot;what was your face before you

were born?&quot; &quot;what is the sound of one hand clapping?&quot; or

the word &quot;Mu&quot;. These techniques are aimed at pushing the mind

beyond rational thought in order to experience the ultimate awakening.

</p>



<p>A technique used by the Pure Land Sect of the Mahayana is to constantly

recite the name (nien-fo, Chinese, nembutsu, Japanese) of the Buddha of

infinite light, Amitabha Buddha (Omi t’o-Fo, Chinese, Amida Butsu, Japanese).

This, again, is a means of fixing the mind on one object and not dissimilar

to repetitions of prayers used by many Christians. The result is a calmed

mind, and, according to Pure Land Buddhism, rebirth in the Pure Land where

enlightenment may be attained by listening to the teaching of Buddha Amitabha.

</p>



<p>Most Buddhists believe that, upon the disolution of the body, rebirth

may take place in a state consistent with the qualities of the consciousness

energy, or resultant of past actions (karma) at the time of death. This

rebirth may occur in human form, animal form, as a ghost (preta), in a

blissful state (deva) or in a woeful state. Each of these states is impermanent

and lasts as long as the karmic energy, which resulted in that rebirth

state, sustains it. In other words, we are subject to a constant round

of rebirths (Samsara) until Nirvana, or the release from rebirth is attained.

</p>



<p>In summary, then, the object of the Buddhist life is the overcoming

of Dukkha or the unsatisfactory nature of life. In the process of overcoming

this Dukkha, one empathises with the Dukkha of others and identifies with

them. By this means we tend to see all creatures as one in this sea of

suffering and thus we cultivate compassion for all living creatures. All

have the potential, the seed of enlightenment or Buddha nature within them

so we see each living creature as a potential Buddha. Once we see that

all creatures have Buddha nature, we can overcome anger and aversion -

two of the poisons that are the source of Dukkha. By following the Noble

Eightfold Path, we have a tried and proven means of overcoming our deluded

minds and attaining the wisdom to realise the bliss of Nirvana. May you

all be well and happy. </p>
