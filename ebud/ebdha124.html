        <p><i>ABSTRACT- Buddhist egology concurs with the
        Husserlian claim that the empirical ego is 'constituted'.
        The Buddhist 'deconstruction' of the ego will not,
        however, pace Husserl, permit the pronoun 'I' to refer to
        a purported extra-linguistic entity. The insights here
        distilled from the unique mode of self-reference
        functional within the Vietnamese language secure for us
        an unmistakable confirmation of the Buddhist thesis and
        have profound consequences for the philosophical problems
        surrounding the existence and nature of the self and the
        existence of other minds.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>o my knowledge, the Vietnamese language is utterly unique
    among languages in its mode of self-reference. I wish to
    explore self-reference in Vietnamese, but neither for its
    intrinsic linguistic interest alone, nor solely for the sake
    of illuminating a significant aspect of a rich cultural
    heritage. The mode of self-reference operative within the
    Vietnamese language has a decidedly philosophical import, and
    can be generalised to extend our contemporary understanding
    of self-reference. Moreover, as I hope to &quot;how, the
    Vietnamese-or more generally, a Vietnamese-like-use of
    self-reference may have profound consequences for the
    philosophical problems surrounding the existence and nature
    of the self and the existence of other minds. In particular,
    the insights which we shall glean from our investigation of
    self-reference in Vietnamese will secure for us a clear and
    solid confirmation of the Husserlian doctrine that the
    empirical ego does not by any means comprise an ultimately
    founding stratum of sense, but is itself 'constituted'
    (functions, that is, as the selfsame identity revealed
    throughout a potentially endless manifold of profiles). [1]
    This confirmation can be purchased, however, only at the
    expense of rejecting certain early reflections of Husserl's
    regarding the logico-linguistic function of 'I'. We shall
    see, pace Husserl, that 'I' cannot serve as a referring
    expression. But this surface disagreement permits a more
    profound agreement of substance. It is precisely because 'I'
    does not refer to a purported extra-linguistic 'ego' that we
    can draw from Vietnamese the appropriate confirmation of its
    constituted character.</p>
    <p>For Husserl, the empirical ego, the 'I' which we take,
    pre-reflectively and naively, to be immersed in the world
    alongside the objects which it confronts, [2] is, of course,
    phenomenal. But though I welcome certain aspects of Husserl's
    theory of ego-constitution, my own Buddhist predilections
    prevent acceptance of this phenomenon as benefundata, as
    founded, that is, in a unitary and basal stratum of lived
    subjectivity. [3] For at least a significant strand of
    Buddhist thought, the ego is 'empty', not merely
    'constituted', but ontologically dependent upon an array of
    conditions external to itself. Its very being is 'borrowed',
    as it were, from these conditions, and there remains to it
    nothing which is properly 'its own'. There remains, that is,
    no 'own-being' (svabhava), no self-existence. [4] With only
    apparent paradox, we can say that the self 'itself' has no
    'self'. Buddhist egology (or 'anti-egology' if you prefer) is
    vitally concerned to 'deconstruct' any notion of a unitary,
    language-independent self or ego (atman) which subtends or
    directs the flow of our conscious life. And while the
    Vietnamese language predates the reception of Buddhism, and
    cannot, then, be said to exhibit, in its structure, a
    pre-existing (anti-)egology, it is all the more remarkable,
    as I hope to demonstrate, that the Vietnamese mode of
    self-reference mirrors this deconstruction. The Buddha did
    not, of course, speak Vietnamese. And it would be hopelessly
    arrogant (if not irrepressibly comical) to suppose that the
    profound message of egolessness (Pali: anatta; sanskrit:
    anatman) could only be formulated in a language which the
    Tathagata did not speak. English, Pali and Vietnamese are
    equally efficient vehicles for expressing the ontology of
    egolessness. The uniqueness of Vietnamese lies, not in its
    capacity to articulate Buddhist doctrine, not, that is, in
    what it can say, but in the fact that egolessness is
    reflected in the semantic conditions for its 'saying'
    anything at all.</p>
    <p><b>Vietnamese Self-Referential Pronouns</b></p>
    <p>Remarkably, there is no self-referential expression in
    Vietnamese (no 'V-expression', as I shall affectionately call
    them) which can be translated (into English), without serious
    distortion, as 'I'. This is because, whereas the English
    pronoun, 'I' (along with its counterparts in the various
    Indo-European languages) is, as we might say,
    'transcontextually invariant', the numerous self-referential
    expressions of Vietnamese depend, for the semantic
    correctness of their application, upon features of the
    context of utterance other than those determined by the
    English 'I'.</p>
    <p>In Corless' priceless quip, &quot;Descartes said, 'I think
    therefore I am,' but Buddhism replies, 'Think again.'&quot;
    [5] Following the Buddhist advice, let us begin this
    rethinking by considering the Vietnamese counterparts of the
    Cartesian cogito. Each of the Vietnamese sentences,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Bo suy-nghi (spoken by a father) <br>
        Me suy-nghi (spoken by a mother) <br>
        Con suy-nghi (spoken by a child) <br>
        Anh suy-nghi (spoken by an elder brother) <br>
        Chi suy-nghi (spoken by an elder sister) <br>
        Em suy-nghi (spoken by a younger sibling)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>in company with numerous similar variants, has its
    counterpart either in the English sentence, 'I think (am
    thinking)' or in 'You think (are thinking)', depending upon
    whether the first word of the sentence is used to refer to
    the speaker or to the person addressed. The word 'suy-nghi',
    (think) offers little resistance to translation. The words
    'bo', 'me', 'anh', 'chi', 'em', etc., are particularly
    recalcitrant. Each is used self-referentially by the present
    speaker. Thus, each has its counterpart in the English 'I'.
    Yet each 'refers' [6] to the present speaker only within a
    certain delimited context in which speaker and interlocutor
    stand in a given familial relation.</p>
    <p>This, of course, contrast vividly with the impoverished
    English 'I', which may be employed self-referentially with no
    more knowledge of the speaker's relationship to the person
    addressed than that the person addressed is, indeed, the
    person addressed. 'I' has a use in soliloquy, and may, it
    might be claimed, be gainfully employed even by the most
    rigorous of solipsists (were any extant). In Vietnamese, on
    the contrary, the self-referential use of 'me' by a child in
    addressing a parent is not merely an insufferable breach of
    etiquette, but a violation of semantic proprieties as well.
    While it is not a condition of the truth of a sentence such
    as 'me suy-nghi' (very roughly: 'I-as-your mother think')
    that the speaker is the addressee's mother, it is, as we
    shall see, an entailment of its use.</p>
    <p>The Vietnamese language displays within its system of
    self-reference and address (loi xung-ho) a profoundly
    Confucian influence. For every type of familial relation
    which figures significantly in the Confucian scheme of things
    (e.g. being-the-father-of, being-the-mother-of,
    being-the-elder-brother-of, being-the-elder-sister-of, etc.),
    and its converse (being-a-child-of,
    being-a-younger-sibling-of, etc.), there exists a unique pair
    of self-referential/addressive expressions.</p>
    <p>Nozick's unlikely &quot;child who thinks his name is
    'I'&quot; [7] might, were he or she sufficiently precocious,
    take part in the following dialogue:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A: I'm thinking about the Cartesian cogito.</p>
        <p>B: (the child): What makes you think I'm thinking
        about the cogito? I'm doing no such thing!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>V-expressions are not, of course, proper names. [8] But
    our brief dialogue equally illustrates a principle which does
    govern the use of V-expressions: If speaker A uses a given
    V-expression for self-reference within a particular
    dialogical context, B cannot use the same V-expression for
    self-reference within that context (and conversely). One
    could imagine a comic variant of English purged of the
    second-personal pronoun, 'you', and employing 'I' to serve
    double duty as both a first-and a second-personal pronoun. We
    need go no farther than 'I love I' to appreciate the abundant
    confusions which such an 'English' would engender. Vietnamese
    first- and second-personal pronouns can, as in this fanciful
    variant of English, be used to refer to the speaker of the
    particular sentence in which they are embedded, as well as to
    the individual to whom the sentence is addressed. This, of
    course, stands in sharp contrast to the English 'I' which
    never refers--indeed, cannot refer--to anyone but the present
    speaker (or writer). Vietnamese escapes the perplexities
    caused by the employment of the same expression for both
    first-and second-personal reference, not by dividing personal
    pronouns into those used for first-, second-, and
    third-personal reference (as does English), but by
    prohibiting participants in a given dialogue from using the
    same self-referential expression and sorting personal
    pronouns into speaker/addressee pairs. Thus, for example, a
    mother speaking to one of her children would refer to herself
    by using 'me' (or one of several alternatives: 'ma', 'me',
    etc.) and would refer to the child by using 'con'.
    Symmetrically, the child would use 'con' for self-reference,
    and 'me' (etc.) to refer to the mother. Thus, the ordered
    pairs (me, con) and (con, me) determine unique familial
    relations. [9]</p>
    <p>Accuracy demands some qualification of the claims thus far
    put forward. It might reasonably be suggested that Vietnamese
    does, in fact, contain several self-referential expressions
    (such as 'toi', 'ta' and 'minh') which offer considerably
    less resistance to straightforward translation as 'I', which
    do not imply that a given familial relation obtains between
    speaker and the person addressed, and which have an
    appropriate use within monologue and private musing. Indeed,
    the English 'I', employed within a wide range of contexts, is
    almost invariably rendered in Vietnamese as 'toi', and the
    two words thus seem, in some respects, likely candidates for
    synonymy. However, self-referential expressions such as
    'toi', 'ta' and 'minh', while promising in the ways noted,
    nonetheless lack the crucial property of transcontextual
    invariance. 'Toi', for example, was originally used
    self-referentially by a subject in addressing the king. [10]
    Similarly, 'ta', suggesting a 'royal' plurality, is used by a
    superior in addressing an inferior. While the correct use of
    such expressions does not imply that the speaker bears a
    given familial relation to the person addressed, it does bear
    the implication that the speaker is not related to the person
    addressed via familial bonds. Thus, since there are contexts
    in which such expressions cannot be appropriately used in
    self-reference, they are not transcontextually invariant, and
    cannot be translated, without serious distortion, as 'I'.</p>
    <p>There are, moreover, expressions in Viemamese signifying
    'self' - 'ban-nga' usually translates 'ego' or the Vedantic
    'atman'; 'vo-ban-nga' translates the Buddhist
    'egolessness'--but nothing which corresponds precisely to
    'myself'. Letting 'v' vary over V-expressions, the closest we
    can get to a literal translation of 'myself' into Viemamese is
    either 'chinh v' ('the very v'or 'v itself') or 'ban-nga cua
    v' ('the self of v'). But then there are as many senses of
    'myself' in Viemamese as there are V-expressions.</p>
    <p><b>The 'Reference' of Self-Reference</b></p>
    <p>There is, it seems, no more fundamental epistemic
    principle governing analysis in general, and the analysis of
    self-referential expressions in particular, than that which
    demands that, in knowing the analysans, I thereby know
    precisely what I know in knowing the original pre-analytic
    analysandum. If:</p>
    <p>(1) A am thinking is the correct analysis of (2) I am
    thinking (where 'A' represents an expression introduced by
    the analysis to replace 'I'), then surely, in knowing that
    (1), I thereby know that (2), and conversely. If not, (1)
    cannot be a correct analysis. However, the substitution of a
    referential term or phrase of any type whatever for 'A' in
    (1) will, I submit, cause the analysis straightforwardly to
    fail the epistemic exam.</p>
    <p>On this issue, if not on others, I firmly endorse Zemach's
    pellucid argument:</p>
    <p>Reference can be achieved by descriptions, names, or
    demonstratives. A purely qualitative definite description
    will never do, since one may fail to believe it applies to
    the object it denotes. It may also fail the uniqueness
    condition, and denote nothing. A name will not do either:
    although it may refer to the right object, the believer may
    not know, or forget, what this name denotes. An indexical
    will not do at all: although a semantic rule may determine
    its reference, the believer may not know this rule or confuse
    it with another. [11]</p>
    <p>A somewhat livelier and certainly more concrete
    appreciation of the non-referential character of
    (purportedly) self-'referential' expressions may be elicited
    by reflection upon the imaginary tragedy which Nozick
    describes:</p>
    <p>Imagine that you and two other persons have been in an
    accident and are lying completely bandaged on three beds in a
    hospital, all suffering from amnesia. The doctor comes in and
    tells what has happened, that examinations have been made,
    and that (where the three persons boringly are named X, Y and
    Z) person X will live, Y will die, and Z has a 50/50 chance.
    [12]</p>
    <p>Clearly, as this sombre scenario illustrates,
    self-reference cannot be achieved in virtue of a definite
    description.</p>
    <p>The situation is not helped if the doctor gives the full
    life histories of each of the three. Nor are you helped if
    she says the person closest to the window will live, to the
    door will die, for being completely bandaged, you still do
    not know which of these people you are. [13]</p>
    <p>Nor is a proper name of any avail. &quot;Since you are
    suffering from amnesia you do not remember your own name, so
    there is something important you don't know yet, namely what
    is going to happen to you.&quot; [14] Nor, finally, perhaps
    most surprisingly and most poignantly for our own present
    purposes, can self-reference be accomplished by means of a
    demonstrative or indexical expression. &quot;It will not help
    if the doctor points you out and says 'here is what is going
    to happen to you'; for you won't know she pointed to
    you.&quot; [15] As Nozick ruminates, &quot;it seems we each
    must have a kind of access to ourselves which is not via a
    term or referring expression, not via knowing that a term
    holds true (of something or other).&quot; [16] 'I' cannot,
    then, function as a description, name, or, crucially, as an
    indexical. In short, 'I' cannot function referentially. [17]</p>
    <p>The case at issue is, of course, Husserl's insistence that
    the word 'I' is an 'essentially occasional' expression, an
    indexical, referring to a given individual in virtue of
    certain information embedded in the context of utterance
    present on the 'occasion' of its utterance. In the Logical
    Investigations, the indexical, 'I', is governed by a semantic
    rule (or 'role', as Perry would have it [18]), the latter
    conceived as a function from occasional context to referent.
    Much later, in the Fonnal and Transcendental Logic, we learn
    that the 'occasion' of dialogue offers sufficient 'cues' to
    pin an indexical's reference to a particular individual. The
    later work offers a theory of 'constituting
    horizon-intentionality' which 'essentially determines the
    sense of occasional judgments-always, and far beyond what at
    any time is, or can be, said expressly and determinately in
    the words themselves'. [19] Indexicals refer, of necessity,
    only to items within the horizon of consciousness. Indexical
    reference to a given 'text' is specified by features of
    context. And the indexical reference to such contextual
    features may require, in turn, specification by features of a
    more encompassing context. The final fixation of indexical
    reference seems, thus, to be rooted in the pre-articulate
    fringe of intelligible richness delimited by the outermost
    context of conscious reference: the 'world-horizon'.</p>
    <p>The precise specification of how the indexical 'I'
    functions attends, however, the recognition that, for
    Husserl, 'I' is a referring expression. And this, we have
    seen, is simply unacceptable. And, again, 'although a
    semantic rule may determine its reference, the believer may
    not know this rule or confuse it with another'. On the basis
    of no sentence of the form 'A am thinking', may I be said
    thereby to know that I am thinking. I must know significantly
    more than 'A am thinking' in order legitimately to infer that
    I am thinking (namely, that, given the present context, 'A'
    refers to me). And this, quite patently, I may, for whatever
    reason, fail to know while still knowing that I am thinking.</p>
    <p><b>The Presentation of the Ego</b></p>
    <p>Husserl finds that although self-reference is achieved by
    the individual ego, its expression is universally
    comprehensible, and thus distinguishes between the 'universal
    semantic function' [20] of the indexical, 'I', and the
    individual to whom it refers on any particular occasion,
    between its anzeigende Bedeutung and its angezeigte
    Bedeutung, [21] or again, as Tyler Burge would have it,
    between the 'sense' of the indexical and its (linguistic)
    'meaning'. [22]</p>
    <p>This segregation of the 'sense' and the 'reference' of 'I'
    is, of course, powerfully reminiscent of Frege's parallel
    distinction. It is not surprising, therefore, that Husserl
    also echoes Frege's view that the unique sense of 'I' is
    utterly incommunicable. [23] The 'echo', however, is not a
    straightforward reproduction. For it is vital to see that, in
    place of Frege's notion of the unique 'sense' that 'I' has
    for a given individual, Husserl substitutes the notion of a
    unique 'I-presentation': &quot;Each man has his own
    I-presentation (and with it his individual notion of
    I).&quot; [24] The language suggests that, whatever an
    'I-presentation' might be, it may be accompanied by, but is
    not entailed by, a unique 'I-sense'. Thus, Husserl claims
    that the indexical, 'I', &quot;has not itself directly the
    power to arouse the specific I-presentation&quot;. [25] As
    Mohanty speculates, it may well be that Husserl intends, by
    'I-presentation', &quot;an unvarying, non-conceptual,
    inarticulate self-understanding&quot;. [26] And perhaps,
    indeed, some such pre-conceptual self-understanding is
    precisely what Husserl means by 'individual notion of I'. If
    I might carry the speculation forward yet another small step,
    perhaps, despite Husserl's untoward commitment to the
    doctrine that 'I' is an indexical, and thus, a referring
    expression, one might envision Husserl as labouring to
    articulate, within the most useful logico-linguistic
    framework available to him, the insight that self-reference,
    while linguistically expressible, is itself pre-linguistic.
    And thus, perhaps, the pre-articulate self-understanding, the
    'I-presentation' of which Husserl speaks, is best understood
    precisely as the self itself revealed in self-referential
    sentence. [27] ' is not a referring expression, we part
    company at precisely that corner at which his view is most
    saliently akin to that of Husserl. Zemach takes his cue from
    Strawson's discussion, in 'On Referring', of the sign, posted
    at a particularly ill-supported bridge, reading 'Unsafe for
    Lorries'. For both Strawson and Zemach it is the bridge
    itself, not some submerged linguistic item referring to it,
    which is the subject of this apparently truncated sentence.
    &quot;The entity of which the referential part of the
    sentence is predicated is present in the sentence, so to
    speak, 'in person'. The grammatical subject of this sentence
    is the bridge itself.&quot; [28] A sentence of this sort, in
    which the subject is 'displayed', not 'referred to', is not
    inappropriately termed by Zemach a 'display sentence'.
    Self-referential sentences are display sentences. 'I' is
    either semantically pleonastic or functions merely to mark
    the pre-linguistic presence of the self to itself. The self
    is, then, a self-referential 'mental term' [29] which, as it
    were, displays itself to itself. [30] It is, more
    specifically, a 'mental description' which picks itself out.
    [31] Like 'Unsafe for Lorries', '[I] am thinking' displays
    its subject. The self (itself) is the very subject of the
    sentence. [32] And Zemach records a remarkable virtue of this
    ploy: &quot;Display propositions cannot be erroneously
    believed, or disbelieved, due to misidentification of the
    subject.&quot; [33]</p>
    <p>It is striking to find among the lucid and penetrating
    insights of the Neo-Vedantist, K. C. Bhattacharyya,
    commitments which run parallel to that of Zemach. And it is
    important to note that Buddhist 'anti-egology' grows in, but
    grows, nonetheless, from, the rich humus of accumulated
    insights represented by Bhattacharyya's remarks. For
    Bhattacharyya,</p>
    <p>The &quot;I&quot; is not unmeanable nor is it meant-meant
    even as unmeanable ... Meaning is the thinnest presentation
    of the object, as existing apart from introspection. I has no
    meaning in this sense: it has not even the meaning of being
    unmeant or unmeanable... [34]</p>
    <p>And we find here a distinctive resonance with the
    Husserlian notion of 'an unvarying, non-conceptual,
    inarticulate self-understanding': an introspective
    'I-presentation'. Indeed, the word 'I' does not refer to the
    self, but rather expresses the self's qown reference to
    itself &quot;The word&quot;, Bhattacharyya tells us,
    &quot;has a meaning function but not a meaning: it is the
    expression of introspection or what may be called the
    I-function.&quot; [35] And remarkably akin to Zemach's
    self-referential 'mental term' is Bhattacharyya's
    understanding of the use of 'a word like I': &quot;...
    which is like a pointing gesture at once self-evidencing and
    self-evident. My self-consciousness is not the understanding
    of the meaning of the word I: the word only reveals it to
    another.&quot; [36] Indeed, &quot;The word may be said at
    once to symbolize and to be symbolized by my introspective
    self.... I, the speaker, symbolize it by myself or in a sense
    ... incarnate myself in it.&quot; [37]</p>
    <p>One should expect, then, assuming the cogency of the
    Zemach/Bhattacharyya rendering, that precisely the same
    considerations would apply in the case of V-expressions. The
    replacement of a given V-expression by a description, name,
    or indexical straightforwardly violates our fundamental
    epistemic condition. Yet if '[me] suy-nghi, is, as the
    Zemachian-Bhattacharyyan analysis would have it, a display
    sentence, it cannot be the self which is displayed. For we
    would then have no way of distinguishing the two
    propositions, 'I am thinking' and 'me suy-nghi.' Whatever
    might be displayed in the Vietnamese sentence must be able to
    account for the fact that 'me suy-nghi, presupposes, as a
    condition of assertability that, if speaking candidly, the
    speaker believes herself to be the mother of the
    interlocutor, while 'I am thinking' is not supported by this
    condition. Does 'Me suy-nghi' display, then, the fact (or
    state-of-affairs) represented by this statement-condition?
    This, of course, will not do. It is not a fact, but a
    concrete individual person, who is thinking. Perhaps a more
    reasonable response to this quandary would be to suggest that
    what is displayed is not the-self's-being-your-mother (the
    fact), but rather the-self-as-your-mother. In vivid contrast
    to their English cousin, the statement-conditions presupposed
    by the Vietnamese mode of self-reference would seem to assume
    an ontology of 'ego-profiles', each revealing the self in one
    of its relational aspects. [38]</p>
    <p>Yet again, Vietnamese has no pronoun which could represent
    the display of the ego itself in self-referential sentences.
    And it may therefore seem implausible that a Vietnamese
    ontology of self-reference could, by itself, accommodate the
    Husserlian insight that ego-profiles are the various manners
    in which a single ego exhibits itself to itself. And lacking
    any pronoun which could represent the ego simpliciter, the
    only sense of 'ego' accessible to speakers of Vietnamese
    might seem to be that of a mere collection, a mere bundle, of
    ego-profiles. The self appears to fragment into a
    multiplicity of externally related shards. [39] But in fact
    the typical Vietnamese has no difficulty at all in
    recognising the identity of a single self as given through
    the manifold of disparate ego-profiles.
    The-self-as-your-mother and the-self-as-your-child are not
    experienced as distinct selves, but as disparate modes of
    presentation of a single self. The unity of all is a unity
    present in each. Vietnamese stands in no need of a
    self-referential expression representing this unity as such,
    for the unity as such is an internal component of each
    ego-profile. The English 'I' (or Husserl's 'Ich') is
    lamentably impoverished. An ontology of ego-profiles entails
    an ontology of the ego, but the converse does not hold. The
    Vietnamese self-referential ontology thus enjoys a richness
    of content which vastly exceeds that of English.</p>
    <p>Vietnamese does not allow a direct and undifferentiated
    access to the self, but requires rather that the self itself
    be variously presentable to itself. The Vietnamese ontology
    of self-reference features a type of self-referential act
    which is essentially 'mediated'. A significant footnote of
    Husserl's logical Investigations advances the insight that
    the self (ego) is as much an instance of transcendence as a
    table or a chair. [40] For Husserl, the empirical ego is a
    'pole' of reflexive intentional reference, an 'object' (or
    objectivity), that is, constituted as an identity across a
    manifold of alternative manners of appearing. Yet though the
    Vietnamese language provides powerful confirmation of a
    certain egological unity laced through the manifold manners
    of its appearing, it is not clear that the pole-model of
    transcendence is adequate to account for it. The 'pole',
    stolid, uncompromised, indifferent to its modes of appearing,
    is an ideal candidate as a purported referent for the
    transcontextually invariant 'I'. I submit, however, that the
    unitary sense of self enjoyed by Vietnamese, no less than by
    speakers of English, cannot be accounted for by a 'maypole'
    which tethers the coloured streamers of alternative
    ego-appearances. Nor is the ego a mere button-collection of
    ego-profiles. It is, rather, their Gestalt: Each ego-profile
    discloses, not a pole, but rather the organically unified
    whole of ego-profiles itself.</p>
    <p>The English 'I' and the self-referential expressions of
    Vietnamese are 'referential' only in a derivative and
    secondary sense. Neither 'I' nor 'me' refers, in the strict
    and proper sense. Such expressions serve rather to 'reveal'
    or 'mirror' the self's reference to itself. The Vietnamese
    mode of self-reference illustrates the self's capacity, not
    merely to refer to itself simpliciter, but to refer to itself
    as ... Were it possible for 'reference-as' to be construed in
    terms of simple reference, the V-expressions might be
    absorbed without remainder into English with the simple
    deployment of disjunction. And if so, then V-expressions
    would present no philosophical quandaries for self-reference
    beyond those that surround the analysis of 'I'.</p>
    <p>'Me suy-nghi' does (propositionally) imply that I am
    thinking and, in the real-world context, that I believe
    myself to be your mother. It is the converse that we must
    reject as untenable. For what could account for the severance
    of what is, in appearance at least, a single Viemamese
    proposition into two English propositions? The predicate,
    'suy-nghi' goes over without a complaint into the English 'am
    thinking'. Nothing about the meaning-content of the
    Vietnamese predicate could account for this curious episode
    of propositional mitosis. We must, then, look directly at the
    pronoun, 'me', for the answer. 'Me', however, if it were to
    refer (simpliciter) at all, could refer only to what 'I'
    refers to: my self. Without invoking 'reference-as', it is
    extremely difficult to see what basis might remain for the
    bifurcation, if not that 'I' and 'me' reveal different modes
    of self-reference. It is not that the two pronouns reveal
    different selves. The one rather purports to reveal the see
    and the other, the self-as. And this, of course, runs counter
    to an extensionalist concern to rid the discourse of
    self-reference of 'as'-talk. Yet in what could the difference
    of presentational mode consist if not in the fact that 'I'
    presents the self to itself 'as such', tout entier, whereas
    'me' presents the self to itself as a single 'ray' of
    illumination, as it were, within an entire effulgence of
    'ego-profiles'. There is, then, no more reason for regarding
    'Me suy-nghi' as a single sentential mask concealing a diptych
    of propositional conjuncts than for the converse view whereby
    'I am thinking' and 'I am your mother' are regarded as an
    illusory duality of sentences united in the mysterious depths
    by a single (Vietnamese) proposition. The English and
    Vietnamese self-referential expressions are simply
    irreducible to one another. [41]</p>
    <p><b>Assertability and the Real World</b></p>
    <p>We find, to be sure, a rough second-personal analogue of
    the V-expressions in German and in the romance languages.
    French, to take a familiar example, generally employs 'tu' in
    addressing familiars, and 'vous' in addressing those with
    whom a more formal and distant relationship is maintained. Do
    the sentences, 'tu penses' and 'vous pensez', express
    different propositions? Were this so, we should expect them
    to differ in truth-conditions. However, it would seem not to
    be a condition of the truth of 'tu penses', for example, that
    the interlocutor is a close friend or member of the speaker's
    family. It is entirely possible for 'tu penses' to be true
    while the individual addressed stands beyond the range of
    social familiarity. Thus, it would be inappropriate for the
    interlocutor to retort, 'What you say is false, because I do
    not know you'.</p>
    <p>But if 'tu penses' does not of itself support the
    implication of familiarity, what does account for the offense
    which might be taken when one is addressed in the 'tu' form
    by a perfect stranger? Why do we assume a 'suggestion' of
    contempt or belittlement? Something, it seems, conveys to us
    the distinct impression that the other is 'saying': 'You are
    my social familiar'. And this we may find audacious and
    offensive. What, then, delivers the suggestion? It is neither
    the sentence, 'tu penses' nor the proposition expressed by it
    which bears the implication of familiarity, but rather
    certain propositions articulating features of the speech-act
    environment, analysable, perhaps, in terms of Grice's notion
    of the 'conversational implicature'. We must leave for others
    the presentation and defence of a thoroughly nuanced account.
    But it would not be out of place to nod to the obvious. If
    the offending suggestion is not implied by the proposition
    (or sentence) 'tu penses', we must find it in the 'assertion'
    (the use of the sentence in expressing the proposition) or in
    the contextual conditions of assertability. The relevance of
    these considerations to the V-indexicals is immediate. 'Me
    suy-nghi', and 'Con suy-nghi' have precisely the same
    propositional entailments, but differ sharply in
    'assertion-entailment'.</p>
    <p>Indeed, assertion-entailment is particularly relevant to
    self-reference. It is a condition of the assertion of 'I am
    thinking' that I produce (and can produce) the token, 'I', in
    the sentence (not, it would seem, an implication of the
    proposition). 'I can produce the token, &quot;I&quot;,' is
    not logically tautologous, but pragmatically required. And 'I
    cannot produce the token &quot;I&quot;' does not represent a
    logical contradiction, but rather a pragmatic self-refutation
    analogous, perhaps, to the sentence 'Nothing is written on
    the blackboard' written on the blackboard. Though we do not
    accept the token-reflexive analysis of 'I' (as a theory of
    reference), [42] token-reflexivity does seem to be an
    assertion-condition.</p>
    <p>Of course, there is more to the assertion-conditions of
    the V-indexicals than tokening capacity. At first thought,
    one might, for example, assume it to be a straightforward
    condition of the stating of 'me suy-nghi that the speaker
    actually be the addressee's mother. Yet there are contexts
    (such as that of make-believe) in which a statement of this
    sort does not require that 'me' be tokened by the mother. A
    Vietnamese child, for example, could always throw protocol to
    the winds and perversely use 'me' for self-reference in
    addressing a parent. The mere use of a given V-expressions
    such as 'me' for self-reference does not thereby guarantee
    that the speaker is the mother of the addressee.</p>
    <p>Nothing about the Vietnamese mode of self-reference
    detracts in the least from the possibility of make-believe,
    imaginary conversations, role-playing, language-acquisition
    dialogues, etc. A Vietnamese child may, for example, address
    her doll as 'con' and refer to herself as 'me' implying only
    that, within this particular context of make-believe, the
    child is playing the role of mother, not that the child is,
    in the real-world context, quite literally the mother of the
    doll. Thus, we must recognise that the use of a V-expression
    determines a context, C, such that, in C, the speaker bears a
    given relationship to the addressee. And where 'C' designates
    the real world, the use of such an expression implies that,
    in reality, the speaker stands in that relationship.</p>
    <p>Semantic correctness for real-world use involves, among
    other things, a belief on the part of the speaker that the
    implied relationship really obtains. 'Me' for example, cannot
    achieve self-reference in the real-world context unless the
    speaker believes that she is the mother of the person
    addressed. Without such a belief, the context of use becomes
    that of make-believe, imagination, insult, prevarication,
    etc. Yet it remains a strict condition of assertion that
    whenever the speaker believes herself to be speaking in the
    'real world' context, she also believes herself to be the
    mother. The real world context is thus 'privileged'. One
    simply cannot believe oneself to be making the statement, 'me
    suy-nghi', in the real world context without holding the
    appropriate belief about oneself. In this sense, the real
    world context specifies, for each V-indexical, a certain
    range of beliefs concerning the speaker's identity.
    Vietnamese thus establishes determinate 'sincerity
    conditions' for certain of the assertion-entailments
    associated with its self-referential expressions. English
    does not.</p>
    <p><b>The Impossibility of Solipsism</b></p>
    <p>In the Fifth Meditation, Husserl confronts the question of
    the constitution of other minds within one's own
    subjectivity. To be sure &quot;... if what belongs to the
    other's own essence were directly accessible, it would be
    merely a moment of my own essence, and ultimately he himself
    and I myself would be the same&quot;. [43] Husserl's problem
    is not that of how we know what the other is experiencing. He
    seeks, rather, to articulate the intuitively given conditions
    without which awareness of the other would be impossible. In
    order to bring these conditions to light, Husserl first
    limits his attention to the 'sphere of ownness' brought about
    by the 'egological reduction':</p>
    <p>If I 'abstract' (in the usual sense) from others, I
    'alone' remain. But such abstraction is not radical; such
    aloneness in no respect alters the natural world-sense,
    'experienceable by everyone', which attaches to the naturally
    understood Ego and would not be lost, even if a universal
    plague had left only me. [44]</p>
    <p>The 'sphere of ownness' leaves experience untouched. But
    the methodological exclusion of any pre-reductive reference
    to the other enables the phenomenologist to discover the
    constitutive conditions for our awareness of the other
    precisely within the residual field of experience thus
    disclosed. Husserl is now prepared to pose the question to
    which the Vietnamese ontology of ego-profiles provides an
    admirably feasible response: &quot;How can appresentation of
    another original sphere, and thereby the sense 'someone
    else', be motivated in my original sphere and, in fact,
    motivated as experience ...?&quot; [45] The theory of
    appresentational 'pairing' developed in the Cartesian
    Meditations is, and has frequently been argued to be,
    unsuccessful. [46] This is not the place to expand on that
    issue. But I do want to suggest that the theory of
    ego-profiles meets a crucial desideratum implicit in
    Husserl's description of pairing as involving an 'intentional
    overreaching' [47] conceived as 'a living mutual awakening
    and an overlaying of each with the objective sense of the
    other'. [48] We shall see that the Vietnamese mode of
    self-reference requires a surprisingly intimate, and
    surprisingly significant, 'overlaying' of the senses of self
    and other.</p>
    <p>We have thus far presented the various V-expressions as
    representing ego-profiles of the form, 'the-self-as-your...'
    this formulation is, in fact, elliptical. For as noted
    earlier in passing, there are as many addressive expressions
    in Vietnamese as self-referential expressions. And any
    expression used for self-reference can be used for address.
    There is, in Vietnamese, no word which can be
    straightforwardly translated as 'you'. And thus, to
    characterise 'me', for example, as referring to
    the-self-as-your-mother, while harmless given our earlier
    purposes, is nonetheless misleading. Just as Vietnamese
    self-referential expressions represent the various ways in
    which a given ego presents itself to itself, Vietnamese
    addressive expressions represent the various ways in which a
    given alterior ego appears to oneself 'Me', used
    addressively, represents the-other-as-my-mother.</p>
    <p>But a curious difficulty arises at this point. 'My', of
    course, means 'of, or belonging to 'me'' and 'me' differs
    from 'I' only in grammatical case. Despite the grammatical
    awkwardness, and ignoring whatever contribution the case may
    make to the meaning of the expression, 'my' can quite
    legitimately be said to mean 'of, or belonging to, I'.
    Vietnamese, in fact, does not distinguish cases, and, for
    every V-expression, there is a distinct and corresponding
    expression for 'my'. For 'me' there is 'cua me'; for 'con'
    there is 'cua con', etc., 'cua' being unproblematically
    translatable as 'of' or 'belonging to'. Now the problem is
    this: We have claimed that 'me' represents
    'the-self-as-your-mother' and must now substitute for 'your'
    an expression representing an 'other-profile'. Suppose, then,
    that for 'your' we substitute 'the-other-as-my-child'. 'Me'
    thus represents the self as the mother of
    the-other-as-my-child. But now 'my' has not yet been
    accommodated. Suppose, then, that for 'my' we substitute 'of
    the-self-as-your-mother'. 'Me' then represents the self as
    the mother of the-other-as-the-child of
    the-self-as-your-mother. We need not proceed much farther to
    see that we have thus initiated an infinite regress.</p>
    <p>The runaway regress is unavoidable so long as we insist
    upon surreptitiously concealing 'I' within 'me', as patently
    we have done by (1) formulating 'me' as
    the-self-as-yourmother, and then (2) substituting for the
    transcontextually invariant 'your' an expression representing
    the-other-as-my-child (i.e. with apologies to grammarians,
    the other as the child of I). We can respond to the regress
    in one of two ways: First, we might insist that there exists,
    concealed within the dark and hidden tissue of the
    V-expression's meaning, a meaning-component semantically
    equivalent to 'I'. But we have already seen that this
    supposal leads to its own regress problems. Thus, second, it
    seems that we are compelled to acknowledge once again that
    V-expressions are primitive, logically indefinable in terms
    of the semantic resources of English.</p>
    <p>'Me' and 'con' (in company with the numerous other
    self-referential/addressive pairs of Vietnamese) are,
    however, interdefinable expressions. 'Me' represents
    the-self-as-the-mother-of-con; and 'Con' represents
    the-other-as-the-child-of-me. It is impossible, in the
    real-world context, to refer to oneself as 'me' without
    assuming the existence of a 'con'. And this curious feature
    of V-expressions has decided relevance to the problem of
    other minds. It might, of course, be claimed that something
    similar holds in the case of the English 'I' and 'you'. The
    English expressions are conceptually linked in such a way
    that it is impossible to understand the one without
    understanding the other. While this is undeniably true, the
    point I wish to make cuts deeper. The well-bred solipsist
    could assuredly maintain that, while 'I' and 'you' are
    necessarily interdefined, this is merely a consideration of
    language or of conceptual scheme, and not a consideration of
    existential status. The self, regardless of the semantic
    connections among terms invoked to denote it and its
    purported complement, may nonetheless exist while the other
    fails to exist. The conceptual connections obtain, that is,
    between the 'mental representations' of self and other which
    enter into self-referential and addressive propositions. They
    may not obtain between the self and other themselves which
    are displayed 'in person' in self-referential and addressive
    sentences. And if not, there is no reason to suppose that the
    existence of the one entails the existence of the other. The
    case of Vietnamese ego-profiles is radically different. What
    is displayed 'in person' in the sentence, 'Me suy-nghi,, is
    the-self-as-the-mother-of-con. The connection with the other
    is not merely a matter of semantic relationships which hover
    over the heads of me and con. In her very being, me is
    inseparable from con. What we have called an 'ego-profile'
    cannot be conceived on the order of a monadic property
    exemplified by an ego, but must, rather, be understood as a
    relational entity capable of being considered in two
    alternative ways, or possessing a duality of aspects or
    'nuances'. The self, then, in Buddhist terms, arises
    dependently as a certain node in a complex tapestry the
    filaments of which we have called 'ego-profiles', but might
    now more appropriately consider as modes of intersubjective
    relatedness. The interpersonal precedes the personal. The ego
    is a derivative construct presupposing a network of
    intersubjective filaments.</p>
    <p>In referring to the ill-fated 'pairing' theory of the
    Cartesian Meditations, Fink objects that &quot;Husserl's
    analysis remains caught in the reduplication of the
    ego&quot;. [49] The problem is that Husserl there fails to
    see that self and other are ontologically integral, assuming
    rather an ontological chasm between one monadic ego and the
    next. As the Vietnamese mode of self-reference makes plain,
    however, the-self-as-the-mother-of-con is not entitatively
    distinct from the-other-as-the-child-of-me. The empirical
    ego, then, as an ideal 'pole' unifying the manifold of
    ego-profiles, embraces the other within itself in a
    strikingly intimate way. In presenting itself to itself in a
    given manner, it thereby inescapably presents the other to
    itself. It is only fair to point out that the theory of the
    Cartesian Meditations is not Husserl's final word on the
    constitution of the other. In the posthumous
    intersubjectivity texts Husserl reverses his earlier
    disposition to consider self and other as ontologically
    distinct. He there speaks of a primordial intersubjective
    impulse, analogous to the sexual impulse. &quot;A relation to
    the other as other is found in the impulse per se and to its
    correlative impulse.&quot; [50] In its &quot;primal
    fulfillment we do not have two fulfillments that must be
    separated into the one and the other primordialities, but a
    unity of both primordialities which produces itself through
    the interpenetration of fulfillments.&quot; [51] The unitary
    'primordiality' of which Husserl here speaks can be
    illustrated by that single relational entity indifferently
    nuanced as 'the-self-as-the-mother-of-con' or
    'the-self-as-the-child-of-me'.</p>
    <p>If, within Vietnamese every reference to oneself within
    the real-world context involves not only a reference to the
    interlocutor, but a belief in his or her existence, the
    question of the mother's existence cannot arise in the
    real-world context. Since self-reference via the English 'I'
    does not, in virtue of its very logic, involve belief in the
    existence of the person addressed, one is free in English
    (though not in Viemamese) to entertain the possibility that
    solipsism might be true of the real world. The Vietnamese
    child, speaking to an imaginary playmate, certainly need not
    believe in this playmate's existence. But the same child, in
    addressing her parents, cannot escape belief in their
    existence. Solipsistic doubts can arise, for the speaker, in
    the very presence of the (apparent) Other. Such doubts can
    arise, for the speaker of Vietnamese only in a context other
    than that of the real world. Solipsism, then, cannot be taken
    seriously by the Vietnamese speaker (as such). It is not, of
    course, that speakers of Vietnamese are endowed with
    insufficient imaginative or conceptual power. Surely, any
    Vietnamese can conceive the possibility that the individual
    addressed is merely fictional. But an address to the
    fictional other is, in principle, an address within a
    fictional, not the real-world, context. Nor are speakers of
    Vietnamese afflicted with a curious psychological inability
    to believe that the individual presently addressed fails to
    exist. An address to an individual whom one does not believe
    to exist, however, may involve make-believe, role-playing,
    etc., but assuredly cannot take place within the real-world
    context. The possibility that others might not exist is, for
    the Vietnamese, both conceivable and believable (though, as
    it is for the speaker of English, implausible). Yet the
    addressive employment of a V-indexical as in 'me do not
    exist' cannot occur within the real-world context. By
    definition, the real-world context is such that 'me do not
    exist', if believed, is semantically excluded. Solipsism thus
    appears to be a language-relative philosophical problem.</p>
    <p><b>NOTES</b></p>
    <p>[1] An initial caveat regarding the Husserlian notion of
    'constitution' is called for here. While the etymological
    overtones of this term may seem irresistible, constitution,
    in the phenomenological sense, is by no means to be conceived
    by analogy with the construction of a house out of boards. In
    its strict application, the constitution of an object through
    its 'profiles' signifies no more than the evident fact that a
    single and selfsame object is variously presented, that its
    'look' is different from here than from there, but that one
    and the same object is presented throughout the manifold of
    alternative 'looks'. In its strict application, the notion of
    constitution is ontologically neutral.</p>

    <p>[6] Later we shall see that no expression can, in any
    straightforward, literal sense, refer to oneself. As employed
    in this context, the 'reference' of an expression to the self
    is more accurately understood as the 'representation' (or, as
    we shall say, 'revelation') of pre-linguistic self-reference.
    In this connection, let me invoke the wisdom of Fa-yen Wen-I
    (885-958) concerning reference in general:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A monk asked, &quot;As for the finger, I will not ask
        you about it. But what is the moon?&quot; The Master
        said, &quot;Where is the finger that you do not ask
        about?&quot; So the monk asked, &quot;As for the moon, I
        will not ask you about it. But what is the finger?&quot;
        The Master said, &quot;The moon!&quot; The monk
        challenged him, &quot;I asked about the finger; why
        should you answer me, 'the moon'?&quot; The Master
        replied, &quot;Because you asked about the finger.&quot;</p>

    <p>[8] The hunchback, Igor, refers to himself as 'Igor'. And
    thus, according to Lycan and Boer, could all of us follow
    suit, dropping the word 'I' from our disparate ideolects, and
    replacing it with our own proper name. Cf. BOER, S. E. &amp;
    LYCAN, W. G. (1990) 'Who Me?', The Philosophical Review, 89,
    pp. 427-466. The proposal, while intriguing in certain
    respects, is, nonetheless, unacceptable. My own name,
    'Steve', is almost embarrassingly common. (I have, on
    occasion, wished that at least my name were logically
    proper.) Suppose, however, that we lived in a world in which
    'Steves' did not so exuberantly proliferate. Suppose, in
    fact, that am the only 'Steve'. On the Lycan-Boer account
    this latter supposal permits the elimination of the word 'I'
    in favor of my name: Steve is (uniquely) named 'Steve'. In a
    'logically perfect language', this sentence is, of course, a
    tautology. But 'I am (uniquely) named &quot;Steve&quot; ' is
    far from tautological-a disparity which of itself entails a
    negative assessment of the Lycan-Boer proposal.</p>

    <p>[17] I am indebted to Professor William Vallicella for his
    very helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.
    Vallicella formulates the implicit assumption of this
    argument thus: 'I' is a referring term only if it can be
    replaced salva significatione by a referring term. To negate
    this assumption, however, one must assert that 'I' is a
    referring term and that 'I' cannot be replaced salva
    significatione by a referring term. Needless to say, I reject
    the first conjunct. And I think there is good reason to
    reject the second as well. I must say, paraphrasing Voltaire,
    that if a synonym for 'I' does not exist, we shall have to
    invent one. Let it be 'J'. If 'I' refers, so does 'J', and
    conversely. I see no reason to frown upon this
    supplementation. Surely, I have not thereby shifted to a
    different language (an 'English*'). Thus, 'I' can be replaced
    salva significatione with 'J'. If 'I' refers (and thus, if'J'
    refers), it cannot be impossible to replace 'I' by a
    referring expression. Of course, it might be countered that
    'J' is no more than an orthographical variant of 'I', or
    simply an alternative acoustical or inscriptional realisation
    possessing precisely the same meaning as 'I'. But what else
    could synonymy amount to? If we replace 'I' with any
    expression salva significatione, surely that expression must
    be a synonym. The denial of my assumption would thus seem to
    entail an intriguing, but patently untenable, theory of the
    relationship between meaning and realisation. If synonymy is
    impossible for 'I', it would seem to be so because the
    inscriptional/acoustical realisation is taken to be essential
    to the meaning.</p>

    <p>[30] Rather than positing, with Husserl and with Zemach,
    an extra-linguistic ego as the locus of self-reference,
    Merleau-Ponty, concurring in the language-relative character
    of the self, rather discloses, at the heart of consciousness,
    a certain ineliminable anonymity:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I read, let us say, the Second Meditation. It has
        indeed to do with me, but a me in idea, an idea which is,
        strictly speaking, neither mine nor, for that matter,
        Descartes', but that of any reflecting man. By following
        the meaning of the words and the argument, I reach the
        conclusion that indeed because I think, I am; but this is
        merely a verbal cogito, for I have grasped my thought and
        my existence only through the medium of language, and the
        true formula of this cogito should be: 'One thinks,
        therefore one is.'</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>[31] Consider, in contrast to Zemach's self-displaying
    thought, the structurally similar, but phenomenologically
    quite different, self-feeling thought of Merleau-Ponty:
    &quot;I am not simply a constituted happening; I am not a
    universal thinker [naturant]. I am a thought which recaptures
    itself as already possessing an ideal of truth (which it
    cannot at each moment wholly account for) and which is the
    horizon of its operations. This thought, which feels itself
    rather than sees itself, which searches after clarity rather
    than possesses it, and which creates truth rather than finds
    it ...&quot; MERLEAU-PONTY, MAURICE (1964) The Primacy of
    Perception (Evanston, MI, Northwestern University Press) p.

    &quot;as for myself, I have always kept one quotation mark to
    my left and another to my right.&quot; LISPECTOR, op. cit.,
    note 2, p. 23. She speaks, accordingly, of &quot;the
    quotation marks that made me a reference to myself&quot;.
    Ibid., p. 34.</p>
    <p>[32] Nozick articulates a view substantially similar to
    that Zemach:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If a nonlinguistic item can be used to refer, then,
        why cannot the self place itself into the blank [of, e.g.
        '-- is (am) tired'[, and in so doing refer to itself? The
        word &quot;I&quot; might be the marker for the blank,
        holding space in which the self can appear. The self
        would thus be part of a reflexively self-referring
        thought; it, not another mental item, refers to the self.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>NOZICK, op. cit., note 7, p. 83.</p>
    <p>[33] Ibid., p. 196. Zemach's 'display sentence' seems akin
    to and may simply coincide with what is sometimes called a
    'concrete proposition', i.e. a sequence containing an object
    and a property attributed to that object. To circumvent
    possible confusion from the outset, it is important to
    distinguish the display sentence from the display
    proposition. In the Zemachian view:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The meaning of a sentence is a proposition. Now if the
        meaning of a display sentence includes such hefty items
        as bridges, how can we understand it? Surely we cannot
        take it, so to speak, into our heads: There is not enough
        room there for a bridge, a cereal box, or even for
        written words. Instead, we do as Strawson suggested: the
        subject of the display sentence is
        &quot;understood&quot;; i.e., we make a &quot;mental
        word&quot; or &quot;mental picture&quot; to represent it
        in a certain way. Thus the proposition we understand and
        believe when we encounter most display sentences is
        usually not the meaning of the displayed sentence itself,
        but a counterpart proposition: a proxy which includes the
        sense of some mental representation of the bridge,
        instead of the bridge itself.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>ZEMACH, op. cit., note 11, p. 196. Accordingly, we
        should, perhaps, speak of 'I' as representing the self,
        not as referring to it, meaning by this that the word 'I'
        serves as a 'proxy' bearing the sense of a mental
        representation of the self.</p>

    <p>[38] Casteneda, with his doctrince of 'I-guises', seems,
    at least prima facie, to approximate a recognition of
    ego-profiles. 'I', on each occasion of its use, refers to a
    distinct 'I-guise', an ontological constituent of the 'I'
    (the self) canonically designated by a definite description.
    Thus, for example, Jocasta's son and Jocasta's second husband
    are distinct, but 'consubstantiated', guises ontologically
    comprising Oedipus. 'I' could, on a given occasion, refer to
    the father of the addressee--surely a viable candidate for
    I-guise status. Or, on another occasion, 'I' might refer to
    the child of the addressee (yet another I-guise). Setting
    aside whatever differences we might have with Casteneda's
    account of self-reference (including the problem of who a
    self composed of such consubstantiated I-guises might be), we
    might initially be tempted to identify I-guises and
    ego-profiles. After all, 'the father of the addressee' and
    'the-self-as-your-father' seem, at the level of surface
    grammar, remarkably similar. But this turns out to be
    illusory. 'Bo', of course, is an expression which represents
    the 'display' of the self-as-your-father. Were we to identify
    this ego-profile with its associated I-guise, 'Bo' would then
    function, within Casteneda's scheme of things, as a name, or
    covert description, denoting a given I-guise. Barring
    Casteneda's theory of 'consubstantiation', we seem to be
    faced with the dissolution of the self into fragments. But
    even should such shards be consubstantiated to comprise a
    single self, the resultant 'self' would be the product of a
    peculiar logical or ontological operation, not the principle
    whereby such 'pieces' of the self are gathered in attendance
    upon this operation. If 'Bo' 'represents, as Casteneda's view
    itself would seem to demand, an item of 'grist' for the
    consubstantial 'mill', then ego-profiles can be identified
    which I-guises only at the cost of forfeiting the very
    pre-operative unity which would deliver them from the
    unfortunate status of a rattling assemblage of extensionally
    denotable, externally related items. If ego-profiles are
    conceived as merely analytically atomic 'bricks' which lend
    themselves to certain manipulations, the resultant 'brick
    wall' patency does not possess the integral internal unity of
    the Husserlian empirical ego. And, despite our tentative
    expectations to the contrary, Casteneda has not, then,
    embraced an ontology of ego-profiles. Cf. CASTENEDA,

    Though Sartre is often credited as the original exponent of
    this thesis, it is interesting to find chat Husserl gave
    voice to this view over a decade before the publication of
    The Transcendence of the Ego.</p>
    <p>[41] Analogously, Vietnamese uses a single word, 'xanh',
    to refer to the range of colour which English would denote by
    'green' and 'blue'. Yet it is simply untenable to suppose
    that, in referring to the 'xanh' of a given object, a
    Vietnamese means 'either green or blue'. Disjunction does not
    enter in any way into the sense that 'xanh' has for the
    Vietnamese.</p>
    <p>[42] In the sentence, 'I'm dirty', etched in the dust on
    the back of a truck by some furtive would-be calligrapher,
    the 'I' represents, not the tokener of 'I', but the truck.
    Thus, of course, derives the humour of the sentence.
    Moreover, if the voice-synthesiser at the local supermarket
    can produce a token of 'thank you for shopping with us',
    after tallying the cost of groceries, there would seem to be
    no special difficulty in its announcing: 'I hope to see you
    again soon'. A significant lesson to be drawn from
    illustrations such as these is that we can quite readily
    understand a self-referential sentence even though there is,
    properly speaking, no self to be referred to. The meaning of
    'I' cannot, then, coincide with its (purported) referent.
