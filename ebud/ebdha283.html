      <TD WIDTH="100%"><B></B><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>he Great Sariputta had his 
      final passing away on the Kattika Full Moon Day according to the solar 
      calendar which is Il Full Moon Day.
      <P>Born into a very wealthy Brahmin family in the village called Nalaka 
      (probably or close to modern Nalanda) he was named Upatissa on the 
      name-giving day as the son of the foremost family in the village. His 
      father's and mother's names were Vaganta and Sari respectively. </P>
      <P>On the very same day of his birth in the adjoining village called 
      Kolita, another Brahmin lady named Moggali also bore a son, who for the 
      same reason, was given the name Kolita. </P>
      <P>The two youths on growing up received a good education and acquired 
      mastery in all the then sciences. From early childhood they became 
      inseparable friends, perhaps due to similar links in previous lives. </P>
      <P>On the occasion of a hill-top festival which was then held annually in 
      Rajagaha called Giragga Samajja, the two youths enjoyed the fun and frolic 
      of the celebrations consummately for two consecutive days. </P>
      <P>On the third day however, they attended it completely disillusioned and 
      in a mood of utter disgust and could no longer enjoy themselves as they 
      did on the two previous day, for their understanding in the meanwhile had 
      been awakened to realise the utter futility of all what they saw and 
      enjoyed. </P>
      <P>The minds of both were filled with thoughts such as these that together 
      they decided to renounce wordly pleasures and seek a Teaching of 
      Deliverance. </P>
      <P>At that time there lived at Rajargaha a wandering ascetic by name of 
      Sanjaya who had a great following of pupils. </P>
      <P>The two youths received ordination under him and before long learned 
      and mastered his entire doctrine; but were not satisfied as this teaching 
      did not proceed beyond the cosmic laws of change and becoming which 
      entailed sufferings and finally death. </P>
      <P>Their quest being for a complete deliverance from these, they took 
      leave of him and wandered through villages, towns and cities of whole 
      India in search of a teacher who would show the teaching they desired. </P>
      <P>Having thus travelled and found none, they returned to their respective 
      villages having agreed between them that he who finds such a teaching 
      first would inform the other. </P>
      <B>
      <P>Search ends </P>
      </B>
      <P>One day when Upatissa was journeying towards the monastery of the 
      wandering Ascetics he espied a person bearing a dignified and calm 
      disposition, clad in yellow robe and carrying a begging-bowl, walking with 
      measured steps and eyes cast down doing his alms-round. </P>
      <P>He was so struck by his radiant countenance and saintly deportment that 
      within him arose the thought: &quot;Never before I have seen such a monk. He 
      must be one who has attained the deathless State, Arahantship. </P>
      <P>This great personality was Elder Assaji, one of the five ascetics of 
      Gautama Samma-Sambuddha's erstwhile companions who deserted him before his 
      enlightenment and now one among the sixty disciples who had attained 
      Arahantship. </P>
      <P>After the Elder had finished his meal, Upatissa asked him: &quot;Friend, who 
      is your teacher and whose doctrine are you professing? to which the former 
      replied: &quot;There is, Oh, Friend, the great Being who has gone forth and it 
      is His Teaching that I profess. &quot;Thereupon Upatissa asked him: &quot;What does 
      your Teacher, your Master, the Venerable One proclaim?&quot; </P>
      <P>The reply that Elder Assaji gave to this question of Upatissa in a 
      stanza of just four lines revealing very subtlety through its course the 
      Truth of Suffering and its Cause, brought out very vividly the Law of 
      Causality (Dependant Origination and Cessation - an aspect of great 
      profundity in Buddha's Teaching). </P>
      <P>It was, indeed, a masterpiece in brevity of a fundamental law of the 
      universe born of a deep and clear insight into the true nature of 
      phenomena. It runs thus: </P>
      <I>
      <P>&quot;Of all things that from a cause arise, <BR>
      Tathagatha the cause thereof has told; <BR>
      And how they cease to be, that too He tells, <BR>
      This is the doctrine of the Great Recluse.&quot; </P>
      </I>
      <P>Upon hearing only the first two lines of it Upatissa was established in 
      the Path of Stream entry (the Path of Real Sainthood) and on ending the 
      last he had become a Stream-Winner, one attained to the Fruit (phala) of 
      the first stage of Sainthood - Sotapanna. </P>
      <P>After ascertaining where the Buddha was sojourning and saying that he 
      would follow him with a friend with whom he had agreed that he who first 
      finds the deathless State shall make it known to the other, he took leave 
      of the Elder worshipping him prostrating at his feet. </P>
      <B>
      <P>Fulfils pledge </P>
      </B>
      <P>Upatissa as one who had cultivated virtuous qualities over an aeon and 
      hundred thousand kalpas, never failed to fulfil the promises he had made. 
      Remembering the pact with his friend Kolita, he betook himself immediately 
      to where he was. </P>
      <P>Kolita on seeing a change in his friend's appearance, said to himself: 
      &quot;Surely my friend must have found the deathless State&quot; and enquired of him 
      whether it was so. Upatissa replied in the affirmative and recited the 
      stanza said by Elder Assaji, at the end of which Kolita, too, attained to 
      the fruition of the first stage of sainthood. </P>
      <P>Before proceeding to the Bamboo Grove Monastery (Veluvanaramaya) where 
      the Buddha was, Upatissa thought of their one-time teacher too, the 
      wandering ascetic Sanjaya, and together they left to tell him that a 
      Samma-Sambuddha has arisen in the world and persuade him to join them. </P>
      <P>In spite of all their entreaties however, he refused to join them as he 
      was not prepared to revert to the state of a disciple. Having thus failed 
      in their attempt they left him, saying: &quot;You will realise your mistake, Oh 
      teacher&quot; out of compassion for him and wended to the Monastery to meet 
      Buddha. </P>
      <B>
      <P>Meets the Buddha </P>
      </B>
      <P>The Blessed One, on seeing the two approaching addressed the monks, 
      saying &quot;These two friends, Upatissa and Kolita, who are coming hither will 
      be two excellent disciplies of mine, a blessed pair.&quot; </P>
      <P>Having approached the Master, they reverentially prostrated at His 
      feet, worshipped Him and sought ordination of the 'Going Forth' 
      (Renunciation and Discipleship) under Him. </P>
      <P>Both were ordained personally by the Buddha pronouncing the well-known 
      formula &quot;Come O Bhikkhu! Well proclaimed is the Dhamma. Now live the life 
      of purity to make an end of suffering.&quot; Upatissa was given the religious 
      name Sariputta and Kolita Moggalana, after the names of their respective 
      mothers'. </P>
      <P>Half a month of his ordination, Venerable Sariputta, reached the acme 
      of knowledge pertaining to a disciple's Perfection and attained 
      Arahantship together with the fourfold Analytical Knowledge, viz: 
      Knowledge as to the Dhamma (Law) its Meaning, Language and Perspicuity 
      (ability to expound the Dhamma lucidly - Patisambhida Nana). </P>
      <P>On the evening of the same day Venerable Sariputta and Moggalana were 
      conferred with the rank of Chief Disciples by the Blessed One which the 
      two had aspired for many ages ago during the time of Samma-Sambuddha 
      Anomadassi when born as Brahmin youths named Sarada and the Landowner 
      Sirivaddaka, respectively. </P>
      <B>
      <P>Foremost disciple </P>
      </B>
      <P>Sariputta became the foremost disciple of the Buddha. His ability to 
      expound the Dhamma in many diverse ways, both in scope and aspects, in a 
      lucid manner taking into consideration the temperaments of the listeners, 
      enable him to be ranked second to the Buddha in his respect and earn for 
      himself the title of 'General of the Dhamma'. </P>
      <B>
      <P>Noble qualities </P>
      </B>
      <P>Sariputta reputed for his virtuous qualities, cultivated over an 
      incalculable period of time and which found their utmost fulfilment in 
      this his last birth. </P>
      <P>As much as he was patient and unresentful, he possessed also the 
      admirable quality of gratitude which he unfailingly expressed, whenever 
      the occasion arose, to who so had helped him in whatever way or degree. To 
      quote: </P>
      <P>Whenever his first Dhamma teacher, the Elder Assaji, was living in the 
      same monastery as he, never did he fail to pay obeisance to him daily 
      immediately after his having done so to the Buddha. </P>
      <P>On occasions when he was not present, he faced the direction that he 
      was and did so prostrating on the ground and touching it at five places 
      with his head and joined palms. </P>
      <P>On another occasion when a poor brahmin youth who was performing minor 
      services at the monastery in Savatthi was seen by the Buddha in His daily 
      survey of the worlds to be karmically matured for Arhantship and on 
      enquiring of the monks present whether anyone among them could remember 
      receiving at anytime help in some sort from him, it was Sariputta who said 
      that one day when he was on his alms-round the brahmin youth gave him a 
      laddle full of alms-food he had begged and collected for himself. On 
      hearing it, the Blessed One asked Sariputta to ordain him. </P>
      <P>Humility was yet another outstanding trait of his character. Once a 
      seven year old novice noticing a corner of Sariputta's under-robe trailing 
      aground, he drew his attention to it. Venerable Sariputta stepped aside at 
      once and arranged the garment in the proper way. After that, he stood 
      before the young novice and with joined palms, said: &quot;Now it is correct, 
      teacher!&quot; </P>
      <B>
      <P>Prior knowledge of Passing away, etc. </P>
      </B>
      <P>While Sariputta was once sojourning at Jetvanaramaya, he adverted his 
      mind for knowledge as to where and when his Final Passing Away would take 
      place and to whom he could be of spiritual help before it occures. </P>
      <P>Accordingly, knowledge arose that he would pass away a week hence in 
      his birth-chamber at Nalaka and his mother, the staunch believer in Brahma 
      as the Creater of the World and Heavens the person who could be helped; 
      and that too by no other than himself. </P>
      <P>Deciding, therefore, to leave for Nalaka that same day, he gathered 
      together the five hundred pupils who were under his tutelage and betook 
      himself to the Buddha. </P>
      <P>The Blessed One perhaps having known earlier of Sariputta's impending 
      passing away, merely asked him: &quot;sariputta, where have you decided to have 
      your Final Passing Away&quot; to which he replied: &quot;In Magadha District, in the 
      village of Nalaka, in my birth chamber I shall pass away.&quot; </P>
      <P>The Blessed One, thereupon said: &quot;Sariputta, do what is timely&quot; and 
      requested him to give a discourse on the Dhamma for the last time for the 
      benefit of the younger members of the Sanga who will have no chance of 
      seeing him again. At the end of the discourse, for the second time 
      sariputta fell at the Master's feet and asked the Blessed One forgiveness 
      for any word or deed of his that would have displeased Him. </P>
      <B>
      <P>Pays last debt </P>
      </B>
      <P>On the evening of the sixth day of his departure from Jethavanaramaya 
      Sariputta arrived at Nalaka. Having entered and seated on the bed of his 
      birth-chamber he fell gravelly ill, stricken with dysentery. His brother, 
      Cunda, was ministering to him. </P>
      <P>His mother, who was leaning on the side of the door of her room, saw 
      four persons of godly appearance, illuminating the whole area with their 
      radiance and brilliance, entering Sariputta's chamber, worshipping him, 
      then standing awhile and again worshipping him and leaving. </P>
      <P>After they had left she saw another, more godly looking and radiant and 
      a brilliance of a higher intensity, entering and leaving in the same 
      manner. Soon after, she saw yet another, outshining all others in every 
      respect, entering and leaving similarly. </P>
      <P>The Brahmin lady wondered as to who they could be and after the last 
      had left entered Sariputta's room and Sariputta seeing her asked what she 
      has come for at so unusual an hour, to which she replied: &quot;To see you, 
      dear and enquire as to who that came, worshipped you and left.&quot; </P>
      <P>Sariputta said the four that came first were the Four Great Kings of 
      Catummaharajika Devaloka who, like temple attendants, stand guard over his 
      Master ever since His birth with swords in hand; second was Sakka, King of 
      the God who, like a novice, carried his Master's bowl and robe and 
      descended to earth with Him daily after His preaching to the gods of the 
      Tavatimsa Devaloka; and the third that came was her Lord and Master, the 
      Great Brahma, who was one of the four Great Brahmans that received his 
      Master in a golden net when he was born. </P>
      <P>Upon hearing these there arose in the Brahmin lady the thought: &quot;If my 
      son is so great as that, what must be the majestic power of his Master and 
      Lord.&quot; While she was thinking thus, suddenly the fivefold rapture arose in 
      her suffusing her entire body. </P>
      <P>Sariputta being aware of it asked her: &quot;Upasika, what were you thinking 
      about?&quot; and after she told him what it was. </P>
      <P>Sariputta then declared,as a prelude, the great events that took place 
      at the Master's Birth, Renunciation, Enlightenment, etc, at each of which 
      the ten thousand world systems quaked and shook; and that there is no one 
      anywhere to equal Him in Virtue, Wisdom, Deliverence and Vision of 
      Deliverance. </P>
      <P>Thereafter he gave a discourse on the virtues of the Buddha, at the end 
      of which the Brahmin lady, mother of seven Arhants and once very hostile 
      to the Buddha and a staunch devotee of Maha Brahma as the Creator of the 
      World, attained to the fruition of the first stage of sainthood which, for 
      sure, will enable her to reach the goal of Nibbana in seven more births 
      the very most. </P>
      <P>Thus did Sariputta pay his mother the nursing - fee for bringing him up 
      - his last debt in the world! </P>
      <B>
      <P>Parinibbana </P>
      </B>
      <P>After dismissing his mother, Sariputta addressed the monks who 
      accompanied him to the village. &quot;For forty years I have lived and 
      travelled with you, my bretheren. </P>
      <P>If any deed or word of mine was unpleasant to you forgive me, 
      bretheren,&quot; and they replied: </P>
      <P>&quot;Venerable Sir, not the least displeasure have you caused us, who 
      followed you inseperably like your shadow, but may you forgive us if we 
      had done any wrong to you&quot;. </P>
      <P>Immediately after that he gathered his robe around him and covering the 
      face laid on the right side. Just at the moment the sun appeared on the 
      horizon he passed away into the Element of Nibbana. </P>
