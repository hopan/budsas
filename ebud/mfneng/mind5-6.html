Although there are many subjects of meditation, we strongly
recommend you start with focusing your total undivided attention
on your breathing to gain some degree of shallow concentration. 
Remember that you are not practicing a deep absorption or pure
concentration technique.  You are practicing mindfulness for
which you need only a certain degree of shallow concentration. 
You want to cultivate mindfulness culminating in insight and
wisdom to realize the truth as it is.  You want to know the
working of your body-mind complex exactly as it is.  You want to
get rid of all psychological annoyance to make your life really
peaceful and happy.  
<P>
The mind cannot be purified without seeing things as they really
are.  "Seeing things as they really are" is such a heavily loaded
and ambiguous phrase.  Many beginning meditators wonder what we
mean, for anyone who has clear eye sight can see objects as they
are.
<P>
When we use this phrase in reference to insight gained from our
meditation, what we mean is not seeing things superficially with
our regular eyes, but seeing things with wisdom as they are in
themselves.  Seeing with wisdom means seeing things within the
framework of our body/mind complex without prejudices or biases
springing from our greed, hatred and delusion.  Ordinarily when
we watch the working of our mind/body complex, we tend to hide or
ignore things which are not pleasant to us and to hold onto
things which are pleasant.  This is because our minds are
generally influenced by our desires, resentment and delusion. 
Our ego, self or opinions get in our way and color our judgment.
<P>
When we mindfully watch our bodily sensations, we should not
confuse them with mental formations, for bodily sensations can
arise without anything to do with the mind.  For instance, we sit
comfortably.  After a while, there can arise some uncomfortable
feeling on our back or in our legs.  Our mind immediately
experiences that discomfort and forms numerous thoughts around
the feeling.  At that point, without trying to confuse the
feeling with the mental formations, we should isolate the feeling
as feeling and watch it mindfully.  Feeling is one of the seven
universal mental factors.  The other six are contact, perception,
mental formations, concentration, life force, and awareness.
<P>
At another time, we may have a certain emotion such as,
resentment, fear, or lust.  Then we should watch the emotion
exactly as it is without trying to confuse it with anything else. 
When we bundle our form, feeling, perceptions, mental formations
and consciousness up into one and try to watch all of them as
feeling, we get confused, as we will not be able to see the
source of feeling.  If we simply dwell upon the feeling alone,
ignoring other mental factors, our realization of truth becomes
very difficult.  We want to gain the insight into the experience
of impermanence to over come our resentment; our deeper knowledge
of unhappiness overcomes our greed which causes our unhappiness;
our realization of selflessness overcomes ignorance arising from
the notion of self.  We should see the mind and body separately
first.  Having comprehended them separately, we should see their
essential interconnectedness.  As our insight becomes sharp, we
become more and more aware of the fact that all the aggregates
are cooperating to work together.  None can exist without the
other.  We can see the real meaning of the famous metaphor of the
blind man who has a healthy body to walk and the disabled person
who has very good eyes to see.  Neither of them alone can do much
for himself.  But when the disabled person climbs on the
shoulders of the blind man, together they can travel and achieve
their goals easily.  Similarly, the body alone can do nothing for
itself.  It is like a log unable to move or do anything by itself
except to become a subject of impermanence, decay and death.  The
mind itself can do nothing without the support of the body.  When
we mindfully watch both body and mind, we can see how many
wonderful things they do together.
<P>
As long as we are sitting in one place we may gain some degree of
mindfulness.  Going to a retreat and spending several days or
several months watching our feelings, perceptions, countless
thoughts and various states of consciousness may make us
eventually calm and peaceful.  Normally we do not have that much
time to spend in one place meditating all the time.  Therefore,
we should find a way to apply our mindfulness to our daily life
in order for us to be able to handle daily unforeseeable
eventualities.  What we face every day is unpredictable.  Things
happen due to multiple causes and conditions, as we are living in
a conditional and impermanent world.  Mindfulness is our
emergency kit, readily available at our service at any time. 
When we face a situation where we feel indignation, if we
mindfully investigate our own mind, we will discover bitter
truths in ourselves.  That is we are selfish; we are egocentric;
we are attached to our ego; we hold on to our opinions; we think
we are right and everybody else is wrong; we are prejudices; we
are biased; and at the bottom of all of this, we do not really
love ourselves.  This discovery, though bitter, is a most
rewarding experience.  And in the long run, this discovery
delivers us from deeply rooted psychological and spiritual
suffering.  
<P>
Mindfulness practice is the practice of one hundred percent
honesty with ourselves.  When we watch our own mind and body, we
notice certain things that are unpleasant to realize.  As we do
not like them, we try to reject them.  What are the things we do
not like?  We do not like to detach ourselves from loved ones or
to live with unloved ones.  We include not only people, places
and material things into our likes and dislikes, but opinions,
ideas, beliefs and decisions as well.  We do not like what
naturally happens to us.  We do not like, for instance, growing
old, becoming sick, becoming weak or showing our age, for we have
a great desire to preserve our appearance.  We do not like
someone pointing out our faults, for we take great pride in
ourselves.  We do not like someone to be wiser than we are, for
we are deluded about ourselves.  These are but a few examples of
our personal experience of greed, hatred and ignorance.
<P>
When greed, hatred and ignorance reveal themselves in our daily
lives, we use our mindfulness to track them down and comprehend
their roots.  The root of each of these mental states in within
ourselves.  If we do not, for instance, have the root of hatred,
nobody can make us angry, for it is the root of our anger that
reacts to somebody's actions or words or behavior.  If we are
mindful, we will diligently use our wisdom to look into our own
mind.  If we do not have hatred in us we will not be concerned
when someone points out our shortcomings.  Rather, we will be
thankful to the person who draws our attention to our faults.  We
have to be extremely wise and mindful to thank the person who
explicates our faults so we will be able to tread the upward path
toward improving ourselves.  We all have blind spots.  The other
person is our mirror for us to see our faults with wisdom.  We
should consider the person who shows our shortcomings as one who
excavates a hidden treasure in us that we were unaware of.  It is
by knowing the existence of our deficiencies that we can improve
ourselves.  Improving ourselves is the unswerving path to the
perfection which is our goal in life.  Only by overcoming
weaknesses can we cultivate noble qualities hidden deep down in
our subconscious mind.  Before we try to surmount our defects, we
should what they are.
<P>
If we are sick, we must find out the cause of our sickness.  Only
then can we get treatment.  If we pretend that we do not have
sickness even though we are suffering, we will never get
treatment.  Similarly, if we think that we don't have these
faults, we will never clear our spiritual path.  If we are blind
to our own flaws, we need someone to point them out to us.  When
they point out our faults, we should be grateful to them like the
Venerable Sariputta, who said: "Even if a seven-year-old novice
monk points out my mistakes, I will accept them with utmost
respect for him."  Ven. Sariputta was an Arahant who was one
hundred percent mindful and had no fault in him.  But since he
did not have any pride, he was able to maintain this position. 
Although we are not Arahants, we should determine to emulate his
example, for our goal in life also is to attain what he attained.
<P>
Of course the person pointing out our mistakes himself may not be
totally free from defects, but he can see our problems as we can
see his faults, which he does not notice until we point them out
to him.
<P>
Both pointing out shortcomings and responding to them should be
done mindfully.  If someone becomes unmindful in indicating
faults and uses unkind and harsh language, he might do more harm
than good to himself as well as to the person whose shortcomings
he points out.  One who speaks with resentment cannot be mindful
and is unable to express himself clearly.  One who feels hurt
while listening to harsh language may lose his mindfulness and
not hear what the other person is really saying.  We should speak
mindfully and listen mindfully to be benefitted by talking and
listening.  When we listen and talk mindfully, our minds are free
from greed, selfishness, hatred and delusion.  
<P>

<B><FONT COLOR=#800080>Our Goal</FONT></B>
<P>
As meditators, we all must have a goal, for if we do not have a
goal, we will simply be groping in the dark blindly following
somebody's instructions on meditation.  There must certainly be a
goal for whatever we do consciously and willingly.  It is not the
Vipassana meditator's goal to become enlightened before other
people or to have more power or to make more profit than others,
for mindfulness meditators are not in competition with each
other.
<P>
Our goal is to reach the perfection of all the noble and
wholesome qualities latent in our subconscious mind.  This goal
has five elements to it: Purification of mind, overcoming sorrow
and lamentation, overcoming pain and grief, treading the right
path leading to attainment of eternal peace, and attaining
happiness by following that path.  Keeping this fivefold goal in
mind, we can advance with hope and confidence to reach the goal.
<P>

<B><FONT COLOR=#800080>Practice</FONT></B>
<P>
Once you sit, do not change the position again until the end of
the time you determined at the beginning.  Suppose you change
your original position because it is uncomfortable, and assume
another position.  What happens after a while is that the new
position becomes uncomfortable.  Then you want another and after
a while, it too becomes uncomfortable.  So you may go on
shifting, moving, changing one position to another the whole time
you are on your mediation cushion and you may not gain a deep and
meaningful level of concentration.  Therefore, do not change your
original position, no matter how painful it is.
<P>
To avoid changing your position, determine at the beginning of
meditation how long you are going to meditate.  If you have never
meditated before, sit motionless not longer than twenty minutes. 
As you repeat your practice, you can increase your sitting time. 
The length of sitting depends on how much time you have for
sitting meditation practice and how long you can sit without
excruciating pain.
<P>
We should not have a time schedule to attain the goal, for our
attainment depends on how we progress in our practice based on
our understanding and development of our spiritual faculties.  We
must work diligently and mindfully towards the goal without
setting any particular time schedule to reach it.  When we are
ready, we get there.  All we have to do is to prepare ourselves
for that attainment.
<P>
After sitting motionless, close your eyes.  Our mind is analogous
to a cup of muddy water.  The longer you keep a cup of muddy
water still, the more mud settles down and the water will be seen
clearly.  Similarly, if you keep quiet without moving you body,
focusing your entire undivided attention on the subject of your
meditation, your mind settles down and begins to experience the
bliss of meditation.
<P>
To prepare for this attainment, we should keep our mind in the
present moment.  The present moment is changing so fast that the
casual observer does not seem to notice its existence at all. 
Every moment is a moment of events and no moment passes by
without noticing events taking place in that moment.  Therefore,
the moment we try to pay bare attention to is the present moment. 
Our mind goes through a series of events like a series of
pictures passing through a projector.  Some of these pictures are
coming from our past experiences and others are our imaginations
of things that we plan to do in the future.  
<P>
The mind can never be focused without a mental object.  Therefore
we must give our mind an object which is readily available every
present moment.  What is present every moment is our breath.  The
mind does not have to make a great effort to find the breath, for
every moment the breath is flowing in and out through our
nostrils.  As our practice of insight meditation is taking place
every waking moment, our mind finds it very easy to focus itself
on the breath, for it is more conspicuous and constant than any
other object.
<P>
After sitting in the manner explained earlier and having shared
your loving-kindness with everybody, take three deep breaths. 
After taking three deep breaths, breathe normally, letting your
breath flow in and out freely, effortlessly and begin focusing
your attention on the rims of your nostrils.  Simply notice the
feeling of breath going in and out.  When one inhalation is
complete and before exhaling begins, there is a brief pause. 
Notice it and notice the beginning of exhaling.  When the
exhalation is complete, there is another brief pause before
inhaling begins.  Notice this brief pause, too.  This means that
there are two brief pauses of breath--one at the end of inhaling,
and the other at the end of exhaling.  The two pauses occur in
such a brief moment you may not be aware of their occurrence. 
But when you are mindful, you can notice them.
<P>
Do not verbalize or conceptualize anything.  Simply notice the
in-coming and out-going breath without saying, "I breathe in", or
"I breathe out."  When you focus your attention on the breath
ignore any thought, memory, sound, smell, taste, etc., and focus
your attention exclusively on the breath, nothing else.
<P>
At the beginning, both the inhalations and exhalations are short
because the body and mind are not calm and relaxed.  Notice the
feeling of that short inhaling and short exhaling as they occur
without  saying "short inhaling" or "short exhaling".  As you
remain noticing the felling of short inhaling and short exhaling,
your body and mind become relatively calm.  Then your breath
becomes long.  Notice the feeling of that long breath as it is
without saying "Long breath".  Then notice the entire breathing
process from the beginning to the end.  Subsequently the breath
becomes subtle, and the mind and body become calmer than before. 
Notice this calm and peaceful feeling of your breathing.
<P>

<B><FONT COLOR=#800080>What To Do When the Mind Wanders Away?</FONT></B>
<P>
In spite of your concerted effort to keep the mind on your
breathing, the mind may wander away.  It may go to past
experiences and suddenly you may find yourself remembering places
you've visited, people you met, friends not seen for a long time,
a book you read long ago, the taste of food you ate yesterday,
and so on.  As soon as you notice that you mind is no longer on
your breath, mindfully bring it back to it and anchor it there. 
However, in a few moments you may be caught up again thinking how
to pay your bills, to make a telephone call to you friend, write
a letter to someone, do your laundry, buy your groceries, go to a
party, plan your next vacation, and so forth.  As soon as you
notice that your mind is not on your subject, bring it back
mindfully.  Following are some suggestions to help you gain the
concentration necessary for the practice of mindfulness.
<P>

<B>1.  Counting</B>
<P>
In a situation like this, counting may help.  The purpose of
counting is simply to focus the mind on the breath.  Once you
mind is focused on the breath, give up counting.  This is a
device for gaining concentration.  There are numerous ways of
counting.  Any counting should be done mentally.  Do not make any
sound when you count.  Following are some of the ways of
counting.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
a) While breathing in count "one, one, one, one..." until the
lungs are full of fresh air.  While breathing out count "two,
two, two, two..." until the lungs are empty of fresh air.  Then
while breathing in again count "three, three, three, three..."
until the lungs are full again and while breathing out count
again "four, four, four, four..." until the lungs are empty of
fresh air.  Count up to ten and repeat as many times as necessary
to keep the mind focused on the breath.
<P>
b) The second method of counting is counting rapidly up to ten. 
While counting "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine and ten" breathe in and again while counting "one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten" breathe out. 
This means in one inhaling you should count up to ten and in one
exhaling you should count up to ten.  Repeat this way of counting
as many times as necessary to focus the mind on the breath.
<P>
c) The third method of counting is to counting secession up to
ten.  At this time count "one, two, three, four, five" (only up
to five) while inhaling and then count "one, two, three, four,
five, six" (up to six) while exhaling.  Again count "one, two,
three, four fire, six seven" (only up to seven) while inhaling. 
Then count "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight" while
exhaling.  Count up to nine while inhaling and count up to ten
while exhaling.  Repeat this way of counting as many times as
necessary to focus the mind on the breath.
<P>
d) The fourth method is to take a long breath.  When the lungs are
full, mentally count "one" and breath out completely until the
lungs are empty of fresh air.  Then count mentally "two".  Take a
long breath again and count "three" and breath completely out as
before.  When the lungs are empty of fresh air, count mentally
"four".  Count your breath in this manner up to ten.  Then count
backward from ten to one.  Count again from one to ten and then
ten to one.
<P>
e) The fifth method is to join inhaling and exhaling.  When the
lungs are empty of fresh air, count mentally "one".  This time
you should count both inhalation and exhalation as one.  Again
inhale, exhale, and mentally count "two".  This way of counting
should be done only up to five and repeated from five to one. 
Repeat this method until you breathing becomes refined and quiet.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Remember that you are not supposed to continue your counting all
the time.  As soon as your mind is locked at the nostrils-tip
where the inhaling breath and exhaling breath touch and begin to
feel that you breathing is so refined and quiet that you cannot
notice inhalation and exhalation separately, you should give up
counting.  Counting is used only to train the mind to concentrate
on one point.  
<P>
<B>2.  Connecting</B>
<P>
After inhaling do not wait to notice the brief pause before
exhaling but connect the inhaling and exhaling, so you can notice
both inhaling and exhaling as one continuous breath.
<P>
<B>3.  Fixing</B>
<P>
After joining inhaling and exhaling, fix your mind on the point
where you feel you inhaling and exhaling breath touching.  Inhale
and exhale as on single breath moving in and out touching or
rubbing the rims of your nostrils.
<P>
<B>4.  Focus you mind like a carpenter</B>
<P>
A carpenter draws a straight line on a board and that he wants to
cut.  Then he cuts the board with his handsaw along the straight
line he drew.  He does not look at the teeth of his saw as they
move in and out of the board.  Rather he focuses his entire
attention on the line he drew so he can cut the board straight. 
Similarly keep your mind straight on the point where you feel the
breath at the rims of your nostrils.  
<P>
<B>5.  Make you mind like a gate-keeper</B>
<P>
A gate-keeper does not take into account any detail of the people
entering a house.  All he does is notice people entering the
house and leaving the house through the gate.  Similarly, when
you concentrate you should not take into account any detail of
your experiences.  Simply notice the feeling of your inhaling and
exhaling breath as it goes in and out right at the rims of your
nostrils.
<P>
As you continue your practice you mind and body becomes so light
that you may feel as if you are floating in the air or on water. 
You may even feel that your body is springing up into the sky. 
When the grossness of your in-and-out breathing has ceased,
subtle  in-and-out breathing arises.  This very subtle breath is
your objective focus of the mind.  This is the sign of
concentration.  This first appearance of a sign-object will be
replaced by more and more subtle sign-object.  This subtlety of
the sign can be compared to the sound of a bell.  When a bell is
struck with a big iron rod, you hear a gross sound at first.  As
the sound faces away, the sound becomes very subtle.  Similarly
the in-and-out breath appears at first as a gross sign.  As you
keep paying bare attention to it, this sign becomes very subtle. 
But the consciousness remains totally focused on the rims of the
nostrils.  Other meditation objects become clearer and clearer,
as the sign develops.  But the breath becomes subtler and subtler
as the sign develops.  Because of this subtlety, you may not
notice the presence of your breath.  Don't get disappointed
thinking that you lost your breath or that nothing is happening
to your meditation practice.  Don't worry.  Be mindful and
determined to bring your feeling of breath back to the rims of
your nostrils.  This is the time you should practice more
vigorously, balancing your energy, faith, mindfulness,
concentration and wisdom.
<P>

<B><FONT COLOR=#800080> Farmer's simile</FONT></B> 
<P>
Suppose there is a farmer who uses buffaloes for plowing his rice
field.  As he is tired in the middle of the day, he unfastens his
buffaloes and takes a rest under the cool shade of a tree.  When
he wakes up, he does not find his animals.  He does not worry,
but simply walks to the water place where all the animals gather
for drinking in the hot mid-day and he finds his buffaloes there. 
Without any problem he brings them back and ties them to the yoke
again and starts plowing his field.  
<P>
Similarly as you continue this exercise, your breath becomes so
subtle and refined that you might not be able to notice the
feeling of breath at all.  When this happens, do not worry.  It
has not disappeared.  It is still where it was before-right at
the nostril-tips.  Take a few quick breaths and you will notice
the feeling of breathing again.  Continue to pay bare attention
to the feeling of the touch of breath at the rims of your
nostrils.
<P>
As you keep your mind focused on the rims of your nostrils, you
will be able to notice the sign of the development of meditation. 
You will feel the pleasant sensation of sign.  Different
meditators feel this differently.  It will be like a star, or a
peg made of heartwood, or a long string, or a wreath of flowers,
or a puff of smoke, or a cob-web, or a film of cloud, or a lotus
flower, or the disc of the moon or the disc of the sun.
<P>
Earlier in your practice you had inhaling and exhaling as objects
of meditation.  Now you have the sign as the third object of
meditation.  When you focus your mind on this third object, your
mind reaches a stage of concentration sufficient for your
practice of insight meditation.  This sign is strongly present at
the rims of the nostrils.  Master it and gain full control of it
so that whenever you want, it should be available.  Unite the
mind with this sign which is available in the present moment and
let the mind flow with every succeeding moment.  As you pay bare
attention to it, you will see the sign itself is changing every
moment.  Keep your mind with the changing moments.  Also notice
that your mind can be concentrated only on the present moment. 
This unity of the mind with the present moment is called
<B>momentary concentration</B>.  As moments are incessantly passing away
one after another, the mind keeps pace with them.  Changing with
them, appearing and disappearing with them without clinging to
any of them.  If we try to stop the mind at one moment, we end up
in frustration because the mind cannot be held fast.  It must
keep up with what is happening in the new moment.  As the present
moment can be found any moment, every waking moment can be made a
concentrated moment.
<P>
To unite the mind with the present moment, we must find something
happening in that moment.  However, you cannot focus your mind on
every changing moment without a certain degree of concentration
to keep pace with the moment.  Once you gain this degree of
concentration, you can use it for focusing your attention on
anything you experience--the rising and falling of your abdomen,
the rising and falling of the chest area, the rising and falling
of any feeling, or the rising and falling of your breath or
thoughts and so on.
<P>
To make any progress in insight meditation you need this kind of
momentary concentration.  That is all you need for the insight
meditation practice because everything in your experience lives
only for one moment.  When you focus this concentrated state of
mind on the changes taking place in your mind and body, you will
notice that your breath is the physical part and the feeling of
breath, consciousness of the feeling and the consciousness of the
sign are the mental parts.  As you notice them you can notice
that they are changing all the time.  You may have various types
of sensations, other than the feeling of breathing, taking place
in your body.  Watch them all over your body.  Don't try to
create any feeling which is not naturally present in any part of
your body.  When thought arises notice it, too.  All you should
notice in all these occurrences is the impermanent,
unsatisfactory and selfless nature of all your experiences
whether mental or physical.
<P>
As your mindfulness develops, your resentment for the change,
your dislike for the unpleasant experiences, your greet for the
pleasant experiences and the notion of self hood will be replaced
by the deeper insight of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and
selflessness.  This knowledge of reality in your experience helps
you to foster a more calm, peaceful and mature attitude towards
your life.  You will see what you thought in the past to be
permanent is changing with such an inconceivable rapidity that
even your mind cannot keep up with these changes.  Somehow you
will be able to notice many of the changes.  You will see the
subtlety of impermanence and the subtlety of selflessness.  This
insight will show you the way to peace, happiness and give you
the wisdom to handle your daily problems in life.
<P>
When the mind is united with the breath flowing all the time, we
will naturally be able to focus the mind on the present moment. 
We can notice the feeling arising from contact of breath with the
rim of our nostrils.  As the earth element of the air that we
breathe in and out touches the earth element of our nostrils, the
mind feels the flow of air in and out.  The warm feeling arises
at the nostrils or any other part of the body from the contact of
the heat element generated by the breathing process.  The feeling
of impermanence of breath arises when the earth element of
flowing breath touches the nostrils.  Although the water element
is present in the breath, the mind cannot feel it.
<P>
Also we feel the expansion and contraction of our lungs, abdomen
and low abdomen, as the fresh air is pumped in and out of the
lungs.  The expansion and contraction of the abdomen, lower
abdomen and chest are parts of the universal rhythm.  Everything
in the universe has the same rhythm of expansion and contraction
just like our breath and body.  All of them are rising and
falling.  However, our primary concern is the rising and falling
phenomena of the breath and minute parts of our minds and bodies.
<P>
Along with the inhaling breath, we experience a small degree of
calmness.  This little degree of tension-free calmness turns into
tension if we don't breathe out in a few moments.  As we breathe
out this tension is released.  After breathing out, we experience
discomfort if we wait too long before having fresh brought in
again.  This means that every time our lings are full we must
breathe out and every time our lungs are empty we must breathe
in.  As we breathe in, we experience a small degree of calmness,
and as we breathe out, we experience a small degree of calmness. 
We desire calmness and relief of tension and do not like the
tension and feeling resulting from the lack of breath.  We wish
that the calmness would stay longer and the tension disappear
more quickly that it normally does.  But neither will the tension
go away as fast as we wish not the calmness stay as long as we
wish.  And again we get agitated or irritated, for we desire the
calmness to return and stay longer and the tension to go away
quickly and not to return again.  Here we see how even a small
degree of desire for permanency in an impermanent situation
causes pain or unhappiness.  Since there is no self-entity to
control this situation, we will become more disappointed.
<P>
However, if we watch our breathing without desiring calmness and
without resenting tension arising from the breathing in and out,
but experience only the impermanence, the unsatisfactoriness and
selflessness of our breath, our mind becomes peaceful and calm.
<P>
Also, the mind does not stay all the time with the feeling of
breath.  It goes to sounds, memories, emotions, perceptions,
consciousness and mental formations as well.  When we experience
these states, we should forget about the feeling of breath and
immediately focus our attention on these states--one at a time,
not all of them at one time.  As they fade away, we let our mind
return to the breath which is the home base the mind can return
to from quick or long journey to various states of mind and body. 
We must remember that all these mental journeys are made within
the mind itself.
<P>
Every time the mind returns to the breath, it comes back with a
deeper insight into impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and
selflessness.  The mind becomes more insightful from the
impartial and unbiased watching of these occurrences.  The mind
gains insight into the fact that this body, these feelings,
various states of consciousness and numerous mental formations
are to be used only for the purpose of gaining deeper insight
into the reality of this mind/body complex.

<H2>What To Do With Your Body</H2></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The practice of meditation has been going on for several thousand
years.  That is quite a bit of time for experimentation, and the
procedure has been very, very thoroughly refined.  Buddhist
practice has always recognized that the mind and body are tightly
linked and that each influences the other.  Thus there are
certain recommended physical practices which will greatly assist
you to master your skill.  And these practices should be
followed.  Keep in mind, however, that these postures are
practice aids.  Don't confuse the two.  Meditation does not mean
sitting in the lotus position.  It is a mental skill.  It can be
practiced anywhere you wish.  But these postures will help you
learn this skill and they speed your progress and development. 
So use them.
<P>

<B><FONT COLOR=#800080>General Rules</FONT></B>
<P>
The purpose of the various postures is threefold.  First, they
provide a stable feeling in the body.  This allows you to remove
your attention from such issues as balance and muscular fatigue,
so that you can then center your concentration upon the formal
object of meditation.  Second, they promote physical immobility
which is then reflected by an immobility of mind.  This creates a
deeply settled and tranquil concentration.  Third, they give you
the ability to sit for a long period of time without yielding to
the meditator's three main enemies--pain, muscular tension and
falling asleep.  The most essential thing is to sit with your
back straight.  The spine should be erect with the spinal
vertebrae held like a stack of coins, one on top of the other. 
Your head should be held in line with the rest of the spine.  All
of this is done in a relaxed manner.  No Stiffness.  You are not
a wooden soldier, and there is no drill sergeant.  There should
be no muscular tension involved in keeping the back straight. 
Sit light and easy.  The spine should be like a firm young tree
growing out of soft ground.  The rest of the body just hangs from
it in a loose, relaxed manner.  This is going to require a bit of
experimentation on your part.  We generally sit in tight, guarded
postures when we are walking or talking and in sprawling postures
when we are relaxing.  Neither of those will do.  But they are
cultural habits and they can be re-learned.  
<P>
Your objective is to achieve a posture in which you can sit for
the entire session without moving at all.  In the beginning, you
will probably feel a bit odd to sit with the straight back.  But
you will get used to it.  It takes practice, and an erect posture
is very important.  This is what is known in physiology as a
position of arousal, and with it goes mental alertness.  If you
slouch, you are inviting drowsiness.  What you sit on is equally
important.  You are going to need a chair or a cushion, depending
on the posture you choose, and the firmness of the seat must be
chosen with some care.  Too soft a seat can put you right to
sleep.  Too hard can promote pain.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#800080><B>Clothing</B></FONT>
<P>
The clothes you wear for meditation should be loose and soft.  If
they restrict blood flow or put pressure on nerves, the result
will be pain and/or that tingling numbness which we normally
refer to as our 'legs going to sleep'.  If you are wearing a
belt, loosen it.  Don't wear tight pants or pants made of thick
material.  Long skirts are a good choice for women.  Loose pants
made of thin or elastic material are fine for anybody.  Soft,
flowing robes are the traditional garb in Asia and they come in
an enormous variety of styles such as sarongs and kimonos.  Take
your shoes off and if your stockings are thick and binding, take
them off, too.
<P>

<B><FONT COLOR=#800080>Traditional Postures</FONT></B>
<P>
When you are sitting on the floor in the traditional Asian
manner, you need a cushion to elevate your spine.  Choose one
that is relatively firm and at least three inches thick when
compressed.  Sit close to the front edge of the cushion and let
your crossed legs rest on the floor in front of you.  If the
floor is carpeted, that may be enough to protect your shins and
ankles from pressure.  If it is not, you will probably need some
sort of padding for your legs.  A folded blanket will do nicely. 
Don't sit all the way back on the cushion.  This position causes
its front edge to press into the underside of your thigh, causing
nerves to pinch.  The result will be leg pain.
<P>
There are a number of ways you can fold your legs.  We will list
four in ascending order of preference.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1.  American indian style.  Your right foot is tucked under the
left knee and left foot is tucked under your right knee.
<P>
2.  Burmese style.  Both of your legs lie flat on the floor from
knee to foot.  They are parallel with each other and one in front
of the other.
<P>
3.  Half lotus.  Both knees touch the floor.  One leg and foot
lie flat along the calf of the other leg.
<P>
4.  Full lotus.  Both knees touch the floor, and your legs are
crossed at the calf.  Your left foot rests on the right thigh,
and your right foot rests on the left thigh.  Both soles turn
upward.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
In these postures, your hands are cupped one on the other, and
they rest on your lap with the palms turned upward.  The hands
lie just below the navel with the bend of each wrist pressed
against the thigh.  This arm position provides firm bracing for
the upper body.  Don't tighten your neck muscles.  Relax your
arms.  Your diaphragm is held relaxed, expanded to maximum
fullness.  Don't let tension build up in the stomach area.  Your
chin is up.  Your eyes can be open or closed.  If you keep them
open, fix them on the tip of your nose or in the middle distance
straight in front.  You are not looking at anything.  You are
just putting your eyes in some arbitrary direction where there is
nothing in particular to see, so that you can forget about
vision.  Don't strain.  Don't stiffen and don't be rigid.  Relax;
let the body be natural and supple.  Let it hang from the erect
spine like a rag doll.
<P>
Half and full lotus positions are the traditional meditation
postures in asia.  And the full lotus is considered the best.  It
is the most solid by far.  Once you are locked into this
position, you can be completely immovable for a very long period. 
Since it requires a considerable flexibility in the legs, not
everybody can do it.  Besides, the main criterion by which you
choose a posture for yourself is not what others say about it. 
It is your own comfort.  Choose a position which allows you to
sit the longest without pain, without moving.  Experiment with
different postures.  The tendons will loosen with practice.  And
then you can work gradually towards the full lotus.
<P>

<B><FONT COLOR=#800080>Using A Chair</FONT></B>
<P>
Sitting on the floor may not be feasible for you because of pain
or some other reason.  No problem.  You can always use a chair
instead.  Pick one that has a level seat, a straight back and no
arms.  It is best to sit in such a way that your back does not
lean against the back of the chair.  The front of the seat should
not dig into the underside of your thighs.  Place your legs side
by side,feet flat on the floor.  As with the traditional
postures, place both hands on your lap, cupped one upon the
other.  Don't tighten your neck or shoulder muscles, and relax
your arms.  Your eyes can be open or closed.
<P>
In all the above postures, remember your objectives.  You want to
achieve a state of complete physical stillness, yet you don't
want to fall asleep.  Recall the analogy of the muddy water.  You
want to promote a totally settled state of the body which will
engender a corresponding mental settling.  There must also be a
state of physical alertness which can induce the kind of mental
clarity you seek.  So experiment.  Your body is a tool for
creating desired mental states.  Use it judiciously.
