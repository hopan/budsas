Everything up to this point has been theory.  Now let's dive into
the actual practice.  Just how do we go about this thing called
meditation.
<P>
First of all, you need to establish a formal practice schedule, a
specific period when you will do Vipassana meditation and nothing
else.  When you were a baby, you did not know how to walk. 
Somebody went to a lot of trouble to teach you that skill.  They
dragged you by the arms.  They gave you lots of encouragement. 
Made you put one foot in front of the other until you could do it
by yourself.  Those periods of instruction constituted a formal
practice in the art of walking.
<P>
In meditation, we follow the same basic procedure.  We set aside
a certain time, specifically devoted to developing this mental
skill called mindfulness.  We devote these times exclusively to
that activity, and we structure our environment so there will be
a minimum of distraction.  This is not the easiest skill in the
world to learn.  We have spent our entire life developing mental
habits that are really quite contrary to the ideal of
uninterrupted mindfulness.  Extricating ourselves from those
habits requires a bit of strategy.  As we said earlier, our minds
are like cups of muddy water.  The object of meditation is to
clarify this sludge so that we can see what is going on in there. 
The best way to do that is just let it sit.  Give it enough time
and it will settle down.  You wind up with clear water.  In
meditation, we set aside a specific time for this clarifying
process.  When viewed from the outside, it looks utterly useless. 
We sit there apparently as productive as a stone gargoyle. 
Inside, however, quite a bit is happening.  The mental soup
settles down, and we are left with a clarity of mind that
prepares us to cope with the upcoming events of our lives.
<P>
That does not mean that we have to do anything to force this
settling.  It is a natural process that happens by itself.  The
very act of sitting still being mindful causes this settling.  In
fact, any effort on our part to force this settling is
counterproductive.  That is repression, and it does not work. 
Try to force things out of the mind and you merely add energy to
them  You may succeed temporarily, but in the long run you will
only have made them stronger.  They will hide in the unconscious
until you are not watching, then they will leap out and leave you
helpless to fight them off.
<P>
The best way to clarify the mental fluid is to just let it settle
all by itself.  Don't add any energy to the situation.  Just
mindfully watch the mud swirl, without any involvement in the
process.  Then, when it settles at last, it will stay settled. 
We exert energy in meditation, but not force.  Our only effort is
gently, patient mindfulness.
<P>
The meditation period is like a cross-section of your whole day. 
Everything that happens to you is stored away in the mind in some
form, mental or emotional.  During normal activity, you get so
caught up in the press of events that the basic issues with which
you are dealing are seldom thoroughly handled.  They become
buried in the unconscious, where they seethe and foam and fester. 
Then you wonder where all that tension came from.  All of this
material comes forth in one form or another during your
meditation.  You get a chance to look at it, see it for what it
is, and let it go.  We set up a formal meditation period in order
to create a conducive environment for this release.  We re-
establish our mindfulness at regular intervals.  We withdraw from
those events which constantly stimulate the mind.  We back out of
all the activity that prods the emotions.  We go off to a quiet
place and we sit still, and it all comes bubbling out.  Then it
goes away.  The net effect is like recharging a battery. 
Meditation recharges your mindfulness.
<P>

<B><FONT COLOR=#800080>Where To Sit</FONT></B>
<P>
Find yourself a quiet place, a secluded place, a place where you
will be alone.  It doesn't have to be some ideal spot in the
middle of a forest.  That's nearly impossible for most of us, but
it should be a pace where you feel comfortable, and where you
won't be disturbed.  It should also be a place where you won't
feel on display.  You want all of your attention free for
meditation, not wasted on worries about how you look to others. 
Try to pick a spot that is as quiet as possible.  It doesn't have
to be a soundproof room, but there are certain noises that are
highly distracting, and they should be avoided.  Music and
talking are about the worst.  The mind tends to be sucked in by
these sounds in an uncontrollable manner, and there goes your
concentration.
<P>
There are certain traditional aids that you can employ to set the
proper mood.  A darkened room with a candle is nice.  Incense is
nice.  A little bell to start and end your sessions is nice. 
These are paraphernalia, though.  They provide encouragement to
some people, but they are by no means essential to the practice. 
<P>
You will probably find it helpful to sit in the same place each
time.  A special spot reserved for meditation and nothing else is
an aid for most people.  You soon come to associate that spot
with the tranquility of deep concentration, and that association
helps you to reach deep states more quickly.  The main thing is
to sit in a place that you feel is conductive to your own
practice.  That requires a bit of experimentation.  Try several
spots until you find one where you feel comfortable.  You only
need to find a place where you don't feel self-conscious, and
where you can meditate without undue distraction.
<P>
Many people find it helpful and supportive to sit with a group of
other meditators.  The discipline of regular practice is
essential, and most people find it easier to sit regularly if
they are bolstered by a commitment to a group sitting schedule. 
You've given your word, and you know you are expected.  Thus the
'I'm too busy' syndrome is cleverly skirted.  You may be able to
locate a group of practicing meditators in your area.  It doesn't
matter if they practice a different form of meditation, so long
as it's one of the silent forms.  On the other hand, you also
should try to be self-sufficient in your practice.  Don't rely on
the presence of a group as your sole motivation to sit.  Properly
done, sitting is a pleasure.  Use the group as an aid, not as a
crutch.
<P>

<B><FONT COLOR=#800080>When To Sit</FONT></B>
<P>
The most important rule here is this: When it comes to sitting,
the description of Buddhism as the Middle Way applies.  Don't
overdo it.  Don't underdo it.  This doesn't mean you just sit
whenever the whim strikes you.  It means you set up a practice
schedule and keep to it with a gently, patient tenacity.  Setting
up a schedule acts as an encouragement.  If, however, you find
that your schedule has ceased to be an encouragement and become a
burden, then something is wrong.  Meditation is not a duty, nor
an obligation.
<P>
Meditation is psychological activity.  You will be dealing with
the raw stuff of feelings and emotions.  Consequently, it is an
activity which is very sensitive to the attitude with which you
approach each session.  What you expect is what you are most
likely to get.  Your practice will therefore go best when you are
looking forward to sitting.  If you sit down expecting grinding
drudgery, that is probably what will occur.  So set up a daily
pattern that you can live with.  Make it reasonable.  Make it fit
with the rest of your life.  And if it starts to feel like you're
on an uphill treadmill toward liberation, then change something.
<P>
First thing in the morning is a great time to meditate.  Your
mind is fresh then, before you've gotten yourself buried in
responsibilities.  Morning meditation is a fine way to start the
day.  It tunes you up and gets you ready to deal with things
efficiently.  You cruise through the rest of the day just a bit
more lightly.  Be sure you are thoroughly awake, though.  You
won't make much progress if you are sitting there nodding off, so
get enough sleep.  Wash your face, or shower before you begin. 
You may want to do a bit of exercise beforehand to get the
circulation flowing.  Do whatever you need to do in order to wake
up fully, then sit down to meditate.  Do not, however, let
yourself get hung up in the day's activities.  It's just too easy
to forget to sit.  Make meditation the first major thing you do
in the morning.
<P>
The evening is another good time for practice.  Your mind is full
of all the mental rubbish that you have accumulated during the
day, and it is great to get rid of the burden before you sleep. 
Your meditation will cleanse and rejuvenate your mind.  Re-
establish your mindfulness and your sleep will be real sleep.
When you first start meditation, once a day is enough.  If you
feel like meditating more, that's fine, but don't overdo it. 
There's a burn-out phenomenon we often see in new meditators. 
They dive right into the practice fifteen hours a day for a couple
of weeks, and then the real world catches up with them.  They
decide that this meditation business just takes too much time. 
Too many sacrifices are required.  They haven't got time for all
of this.  Don't fall into that trap.  Don't burn yourself out the
first week.  Make haste slowly.  Make your effort consistent and
steady.  Give yourself time to incorporate the meditation
practice into your life, and let your practice grow gradually and
gently.
<P>
As your interest in meditation grows, you'll find yourself making
more room in your schedule for practice.  It's a spontaneous
phenomenon, and it happens pretty much by itself--no force
necessary.
<P>
Seasoned meditators manage three or four hours of practice a day. 
They live ordinary lives in the day-to-day world, and they still
squeeze it all in.  And they enjoy it.  It comes naturally.
<P>

<B><FONT COLOR=#800080>How Long To Sit</FONT></B>
<P>
A similar rule applies here: Sit as long as you can, but don't
overdo.  Most beginners start with twenty or thirty minutes. 
Initially, it's difficult to sit longer than that with profit. 
The posture is unfamiliar to Westerners, and it takes a bit of
time for the body to adjust.  The mental skills are equally
unfamiliar, and that adjustment takes time, too.
<P>
As you grow accustomed to procedure, you can extend your
meditation little by little.  We recommend that after a year or
so of steady practice you should be sitting comfortable for an
hour at a time.
<P>
Here is an important point, though: Vipassana meditation is not a
form of asceticism.  Self-mortification is not the goal.  We are
trying to cultivate mindfulness, not pain.  Some pain is
inevitable, especially in the legs.  We will thoroughly cover
pain, and how to handle it, in Chapter 10.  There are special
techniques and attitudes which you will learn for dealing with
discomfort.  The point to be made here is this: This is not a
grim endurance contest.  You don't need to prove anything to
anybody.  So don't force yourself to sit with excruciating pain
just to be able to say that you sat for an hour.  That is a
useless exercise in ego.  And don't overdo it in the beginning. 
Know your limitations, and don't condemn yourself for not being
able to sit forever, like a rock.
<P>
As meditation becomes more and more a part of your life, you can
extend your sessions beyond an hour.  As a general rule, just
determine what is a comfortable length of time for you at this
point in your life.  Then sit five minutes longer than that.
There is no hard and fast rule about length of time for sitting. 
Even if you have established a firm minimum, there may be days
when it is physically impossible for you to sit that long.  That
doesn't mean that you should just cancel the whole idea for that
day.  It's crucial to sit regularly.  Even ten minutes of
meditation can be very beneficial.  
<P>
Incidentally, you decide on the length of your session before you
meditate.  Don't do it while you are meditating.  It's too easy
to give in to restlessness that way, and restlessness is one of
the main items that we want to learn to mindfully observe.  So
choose a realistic length of time, and then stick to it.
<P>
You can use a watch to time you sessions, but don't peek at it
every two minutes to see how you are doing.  Your concentration
will be completely lost, and agitation will set in.  You'll find
your self hoping to get up before the session is over.  That's
not meditation--that's clock watching.  Don;t look at the clock
until you think the whole meditation period has passed. 
Actually, you don't need to consult the clock at all, at least
not every time you meditate.  In general, you should be sitting
for as long as you want to sit.  There is no magic length of
time.  It is best, though, to set yourself a minimum length of
time.  If you haven't predetermined a minimum, you'll find
yourself prone to short sessions.  You'll bolt every time
something unpleasant comes up or whenever you feel restless. 
That's not good.  These experiences are some of the most
profitable a meditator can face, but only if you sit through
them.  You've got to learn to observe them calmly and clearly. 
Look at them mindfully.  When you've done that enough time, they
lose their hold on you.  You see them for what they are: just
impulses, arising and passing away, just part of the passing
show.  Your life smoothes out beautifully as a consequence.
<P>
'Discipline' is a difficult word for most of us.  It conjures up
images of somebody standing over you with a stick, telling you
that you're wrong.  But self-discipline is different.  It's the
skill of seeing through the hollow shouting of your own impulses
and piercing their secret.  They have no power over you.  It's
all a show, a deception.  Your urges scream and bluster at you;
they cajole; they coax; they threaten; but they really carry no
stick at all.  You give in out of habit.  You give in because you
never really bother to look beyond the threat.  It is all empty
back there.  There is only one way to learn this lesson, though. 
The words on this page won't do it.  But look within and watch
the stuff coming up--restlessness, anxiety, impatience, pain--
just watch it come up and don't get involved.  Much to your
surprise, it will simply go away.  It rises, it passes away.  As
simple as that.  There is another word for 'self-discipline'. It
is 'Patience'.
