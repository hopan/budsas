      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The present volume, in its original Thai 
      version, is a part of a large volume entitled &quot;Buddhadhamma&quot;, occupying 21 
      out of 1,145 pages (approximately a 55th) of the whole work. The 
      &quot;Buddhadhamma&quot; is divided into two main parts, namely Part I on the Middle 
      Teaching expounding the knowledge of nature and the natural law, and Part 
      II on the Middle Way dealing with the Buddhist practice which consists in 
      the application of that knowledge to the creation of the Noble Life. The 
      Middle Way or the practice as described in Part II is defined as the Noble 
      Eightfold Path. Of the eight factors of the Noble Path, <EM>Sammasati</EM> 
      or Right Mindfulness is the seventh one. It is this seventh factor of the 
      Noble Eightfold Path that is the subject matter of the present 
      translation, as evidenced in its title, <EM>Sammasati:</EM> An Exposition 
      of Right Mindfulness.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Thai version of <EM>Sammasati </EM>was 
      published separately as a booklet by the Dhamma Study-and-Practice Group 
      towards the end of B.E. 2528 (1985 C.E.). &quot;Dhamma-Vijaya&quot;, the present 
      translator, read the original Thai version. He found it interesting and 
      helpful to the practitioner of Buddhism, and took upon himself the task of 
      translating it into English. It is, consequently, through the efforts of
      <EM>Dhamma-Vijaya</EM> that the English version of <EM>Sammasati</EM> has 
      come into being.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Not only encouraging the translation of 
      the work into English, Khun Panita Angchandrpen has but also been 
      enthusiastically urging the publication of the translation and has 
      intently overseen the book through the printing process. It is through her 
      zealous and active goodwill that this English version has come to appear 
      in the present book form.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In place of a compositor, Phra Maha Insorn 
      Cintapañño Duangkid has relentlessly managed to get through the whole task 
      of word processing. His increasing mastery of desktop publishing on a 
      microprocessor has rendered the production of the book labour-saving, 
      time-saving and money-saving.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;What is <EM>sammasati</EM>? <EM>Sati</EM> 
        means to bear in mind or bring to mind. <EM>Sati</EM> is the state of

        state of non-forgetting. <EM>Sati</EM> means the <EM>sati</EM> that is a

        Sammasati</EM>, the <EM>Sati</EM> that is an Enlightenment Factor, that 
        which is a Path Factor and that which is related to the Path. This is

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM>Sammasati</EM>, as defined in the

      abbreviated names of:</FONT> </P>

      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM>Sati</EM> is most simply rendered as 
      &#39;recollection&#39;, but such a translation may convey the idea that it is 
      simply an aspect of memory. While memory is certainly a valid element of
      <EM>sati&#39;s</EM> function, it does not do full justice to the essential 
      meaning of the term. For to speak in the negative vein, apart from its 
      meaning of &#39;non-forgetting&#39; (the direct counterpart of the positive term 
      &#39;recollection&#39;), <EM>sati</EM> also refers to &#39;non-carelessness&#39;, 
      &#39;non-distraction&#39;, &#39;non-fuzziness and confusion&#39;. These negatively 
      expressed meanings of <EM>sati</EM> point to the positive qualities of 
      care, circumspection, alertness to one&#39;s duties and the condition of being 
      constantly present in the awareness of the various things which come into 
      contact with one and responding to them appropriately.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Particularly when speaking of ethical 
      conduct, the functioning of <EM>sati</EM> is often compared to that of a 
      gatekeeper, whose job is to keep his eyes on the people passing in and 
      out, regulating affairs by permitting entrance and egress to those for 
      whom it is proper and forbidding it to those for whom it is not. Thus <EM>
      sati</EM> is of major importance in the field of ethics. It oversees us in 
      the performance of our duties and guards and restrains us by preventing 
      our taking foolish pleasure in the bad and by preventing badness from 
      sneaking into the mind. Put in simple terms, <EM>sati</EM> reminds us to 
      do good and to give no ground to the bad.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Buddhadhamma strongly emphasizes the 
      importance of <EM>sati</EM> at every level of ethical conduct. Conducting 
      one&#39;s life or one&#39;s Dhamma practice constantly governed by <EM>sati</EM> 
      is called &#39;<EM>appamada</EM>&#39;, or heedfulness. <EM>Appamada</EM> is of 
      central importance to progress in a system of ethics, and is usually 
      defined as non-separation from <EM>sati</EM>. This may be expanded on as 
      implying constant care and circumspection, not allowing oneself to stumble 
      into harmful ways; not allowing oneself to miss any opportunity for 
      betterment; a clear awareness of what things need to be done and what left 
      undone; non-negligence; and performing one&#39;s daily tasks with sincerity 
      and with unbending effort towards improvement. It may be said that <EM>
      appamada</EM> is the Buddhist sense of responsibility.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">From the point of view of its 
      significance, <EM>appamada</EM> is classified as an &#39;internal factor&#39;, as 
      is <EM>yoniso-manasikara</EM> (skilful reflection), and forms a pair with 
      its external counterpart, <EM>kalyanamittata</EM> (association with good 
      and noble friends). The Buddha&#39;s words describing the significance of <EM>
      appamada</EM> sometimes overlap those describing that of <EM>
      yoniso-manasikara</EM>, for these two <EM>dhammas</EM> are of equal 
      importance, though differing in application. <EM>Yoniso-manasikara</EM> is 
      a member of the <EM>Pañña</EM> Section; it is a tool to be used. <EM>
      Appamada</EM>, on the other hand, is a member of the <EM>Samadhi</EM> 
      Section; it is that which governs the use of the tool of <EM>
      yoniso-manasikara</EM>, urges its employment and constantly inspires one 
      to further progress.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The importance and extent of the 
      application of <EM>appamada</EM> at various levels of practice of ethical 
      conduct may be seen from the Buddha&#39;s own words in the following examples:</FONT>

      the Buddhist attitude towards life in its social dimension. It testifies 
      that Buddhadhamma sees the internal life of the individual as intimately

      <A NAME="Role">Role</A> of Sati in the Process of Wisdom-Development<BR>
      <EM>or</EM> the Eradication of Defilements</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM>Appamada</EM>, or heedfulness, refers 
      to the uninterrupted presence of <EM>sati</EM> in one&#39;s life and the 
      constant use of it in one&#39;s daily tasks. <EM>Appamada</EM> makes one 
      careful and prudent; it prevents one from falling, through error, into bad 
      or harmful ways. It restrains; it reminds one not to become fascinated by 
      enjoyable things and mindlessly indulge in them. It urges one not to 
      become complacent, and stimulates one to make earnest efforts to 
      continually push on. It makes one constantly conscious of one&#39;s duties, by 
      providing a clear awareness of what needs to be done and what does not, 
      what has been done already and what remains to be done. It helps one to 
      perform one&#39;s various tasks with circumspection and precision. Thus, as 
      has been stated before, <EM>appamada</EM> is of major significance in a 
      system of ethics.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At any rate, it may be seen that <EM>
      appamada</EM> has a wide-ranging ethical significance in regard to one&#39;s 
      general conduct in life. It is called for in increasing degrees from the 
      stage of keeping precepts right up to that of <EM>samadhi</EM>. It infuses 
      these activities at every level in association with a large number of 
      other <EM>dhammas</EM>, particularly <EM>vayama</EM> (effort), with which 
      it is combined at all times. Looked at, however, solely in terms of the 
      mind during the process of wisdom-development (the use of wisdom to 
      cleanse the mind), <EM>appamada</EM> becomes that which gives devoted 
      support and encouragement from without. At this level, attention is 
      confined to the workings of the mind, and finely discriminates between the 
      various phenomena present in a moment-by-moment analysis. It is at this 
      stage that <EM>sati</EM> clearly fulfills its true function and plays the 
      prominent role implied by its name.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">An understanding of the essential meaning 
      of <EM>sati</EM> may be gained by contemplating its function on those 
      occasions when its role is clearly distinguishable from that of other <EM>
      dhammas</EM>, most notably in the practice called <EM>satipatthana</EM>. 
      On such occasions the function of <EM>sati</EM> may be summarized as 
      follows:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The primary feature of the working of <EM>
      sati</EM> is that it prevents the mind from drifting. It does not allow 
      mental states to pass by unheeded. It prevents the mind from becoming 
      agitated and restless. It is attentive, as if keeping its eyes on each 
      impression that passes into consciousness and then bearing down on it. 
      When one wishes to concentrate on a particular object, it maintains one&#39;s 
      attention fixedly upon it, not allowing the object to drift away or 
      disappear. By means of <EM>sati</EM>, one keeps placing the mind on the 
      object, or recollecting it, not allowing oneself to let it slip from the 
      mind. There is a simile likening it to a pillar, because it is firmly 
      embedded in its object, or to a gate-keeper, because it watches over the 
      various sense-doors through which sense-data pass, inspecting all that 
      enters. The proximate cause for the arising of <EM>sati</EM> is a firm and 
      clear perception of the object, or any of the different sorts of <EM>
      satipatthana</EM> that will be spoken of below.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Looking at it from the point of view of 
      ethics, one will discern both negative and positive aspects of the 
      functioning of <EM>sati</EM>. Negatively, <EM>sati</EM> is a guardian. It 
      restrains the mind from agitation, protects one from error, and prevents 
      one from stumbling into undesirable mental states or situations. It allows 
      no opportunity for unwholesomeness to enter the mind and prevents the 
      misuse of thought.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On the positive side, <EM>sati</EM> is the 
      controller and inspector of the stream of sense-consciousness, mentality 
      and all one&#39;s actions, ensuring that they all lie within desired 
      parameters. It keeps the mind harnessed to its chosen object. It is thus 
      the tool for laying hold of or clasping onto an object, and its action is 
      rather like placing the object in front of the mind for consideration.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the Buddhist path of practice, there is 
      great emphasis on the importance of <EM>sati</EM> as evidenced in the 
      Buddha&#39;s saying that <EM>sati</EM> is required (i.e. should be employed) 
      in every situation. <EM>Sati</EM> is also compared to salt, which must be 
      used in every curry, and to a prime minister, who must be involved in 
      every branch of government. <EM>Sati</EM> may either restrain the mind or 
      support and sustain it, depending on the needs of the situation.[Vism.130, 
      162, 464]</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When considering in toto the features of
      <EM>sati&#39;s</EM> functioning as mentioned above, one will see the benefits 
      aimed at in training in <EM>sati</EM> to be as follows:</FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. The maintenance of the mind in a

        thought-stream, facilitating the attainment of samadhi.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2. The enabling of the body and mind to 
        dwell in a state which might be called &#39;self-sufficient&#39; by virtue of

        regardless of external circumstances -- a state wherein one is prepared 
        to face any experience that might occur and to deal effectively with all 
        of one&#39;s affairs.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">3. The ability, in the state of <EM>

        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">4. The ability to take hold of a 
        meditation object and, as it were, to lay it down in front of the mind

      rendered as &#39;There is clear comprehension (<EM>sampajañña</EM>)&#39;. <EM>
      Sampajañña</EM> is a dhamma which usually appears coupled with <EM>sati</EM>.
      <EM>Sampajañña</EM> is the wisdom-faculty (<EM>pañña</EM>). Thus the 
      training in <EM>sati</EM> is one element in the process of wisdom 
      development. <EM>Sampajañña</EM> (<EM>pañña</EM>) is the clear and 
      penetrative understanding of the object or action fixed upon by <EM>sati</EM> 
      in regard to its purpose, its nature and the way to proceed in relation to 
      it, free from delusion and misunderstanding.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The subsequent phrase, &quot;... eradicating 
      covetousness and distress with regard to the world ...&quot;, demonstrates the 
      attitude that results from the possession of <EM>sati-sampajañña</EM> as 
      being one of equanimity and freedom, a state unbound by defilements, 
      whether rooted in attachment or in aversion.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The phrase, shared by every clause, &quot;... 
      he sees arising and dissolution ...&quot;, points to the contemplative 
      understanding of those things in terms of the Three Characteristics, 
      resulting in a perception and experience of them as they actually exist. 
      The phrase, &quot;... mindfulness of the existence of the body ...&quot;, for 
      example, refers to an awareness of the body in its actuality, without 
      clothing it in conceptualizations, interpretations, or attachments, not 
      labelling it as a person or as self, as &#39;him&#39; or &#39;her&#39; or &#39;me&#39; or &#39;my 
      body&#39;. This attitude is thus one of freedom, independent, in that it is 
      untied to any external condition, and is without any grasping at the 
      things of the world with craving and clinging.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To further elucidate this matter, a few 
      important phrases from the Pali text will here be translated and briefly 
      explained:</FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. <EM><A NAME="Kaye">Kaye</A> 
        kayanupassi</EM> (contemplating the body in the body).<BR>
        This phrase refers to seeing the body simply as a body, or as a meeting 
        place or assembly point for the various organs which are its component 
        parts. It means not seeing the body as being &#39;him&#39; or &#39;her&#39; or &#39;me&#39; or 
        &#39;this person&#39; or &#39;that person&#39;, nor as belonging to anyone; not seeing a 
        man or a woman, for example, in hair of the head or hair of the body or 
        a face. In other words, one sees directly in accordance with the truth, 
        in agreement with the actual state of the body; what one sees 
        corresponds to what one is looking at, i.e. one looks at a body and sees 
        a body, rather than looking at a body and seeing &#39;Mr. Smith&#39; or someone 
        hateful or someone attractive. This accords with the saying of the old 
        masters, &quot;One does not (usually) see what one is looking at. One sees, 
        on the contrary, what one has truly not seen. Not seeing truly, one 
        becomes attached; and, when one is attached to something, there is no 
        liberation.&quot;[<A HREF="#8">8</A>]</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2. <EM><A NAME="Atapi">Atapi</A> 
        sampajano satima</EM> (there is effort, clear comprehension and

        In other words, there is <EM>Samma Vayama</EM> (Right Effort), <EM>Samma 
        Ditthi</EM> (Right View) and <EM>Samma Sati</EM> (Right Mindfulness), 
        the three factors of the Noble Eightfold Path which must always be

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(a) Effort (<EM>vayama</EM>) energizes 
          the mind. It prevents the mind from becoming discouraged or depressed, 
          from dilly-dallying or regressing, and so gives no opportunity for 
          unwholesome <EM>dhammas</EM> to arise. It is a force which urges the 
          mind to press on, and which encourages the growth of the various 
          wholesome <EM>dhammas</EM>.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(b) Clear comprehension (<EM>sampajañña</EM>) 
          is the wisdom-faculty which contemplates and fully comprehends the 
          object brought into focus by <EM>sati</EM> and prevents delusion from 
          arising in regard to it. It correctly understands the way in which the 
          object actually exists.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(c) Mindfulness (<EM>sati</EM>) is 
          that which fixes onto the object, enabling one to keep abreast of it 
          at every moment, not allowing it to slip from the mind or to become 
          unclear or confused.</FONT></P>

        When one practises in this way, the mind becomes spacious and bright, 
        and neither desire and attachment nor sorrow and aversion can overwhelm 
        it.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">4. <EM>Atthi kayoti panassa sati 
        paccupatthita hoti yavadava nanamattaya patissatimattaya</EM> (he has 
        clear mindfulness of the existence of the body only to extent that will 
        serve to make it an object of gnosis (<EM>ñana</EM>) and recollection).<BR>
        <EM>Sati</EM> focuses clearly and directly on the truth that the body is 
        merely the body, that no being, person, man, or woman is implied by it. 
        There is perception of the body merely for the sake of the development 
        and enhancement of <EM>sati-sampajañña</EM>, not in order to indulge in 
        fanciful daydreams or senseless proliferations. The same applies in the

        His mind is free, not tied to any condition. He does not give his heart 
        away to any thing or person. Speaking technically, he doesn&#39;t rely on 
        craving and views as a support; he is unaffected by them. When 
        encountering some experience, for example, he is directly aware of the 
        thing being experienced in its actuality, without resorting to craving 
        and views to colour and embellish it and to lull him into indulgence. In 
        short, he doesn&#39;t entrust his powers of thought, his imagination, or his 
        happiness to craving and views.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">6. <EM>Na ca kiñci loke upadiyati</EM> 
        (clinging to naught in the world).<BR>
        He does not grasp at or attach to anything at all, whether form, 
        feeling, perception, volitional formation, or consciousness as being 
        self or belonging to self.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">7. <EM><A NAME="Ajjhattam">Ajjhattam</A> 
        va ... bahiddha va</EM> (internally ... externally).<BR>
        Teachers have differed in their explanations of this phrase, but the 
        consensus of opinion in the Commentaries is that &#39;internal&#39; refers to 
        oneself and &#39;external&#39; refers to others.[<A HREF="#10">10</A>] Such an 
        interpretation agrees with the Abhidhamma texts, which elucidate the 
        meaning of the term clearly, e.g., &quot;And how does a bhikkhu see the mind 
        in the mind externally? Here, when the mind of another person is 
        lustful, he clearly perceives that that is so, etc.&quot;[<A HREF="#11">11</A>] 
        Some people might wonder at this point whether it is proper to go prying 
        into the affairs of other people&#39;s bodies and minds, and how in fact one 
        could see the truth of them anyway. As for this, we take it quite simply 
        to be that the aim of the training is to use <EM>sati</EM> with all of 
        the things with which we must have dealings, and to perceive in them no 
        more than what is actually there. In our daily lives it is inevitable 
        that we will have to have dealings with other people, and those dealings 
        should be mindful ones. Our perceptions of others should accord with the 
        way they are and be based only on direct personal experience, not 
        exceeding what has been discerned by us in the course of our dealings 
        with them. (If one possesses the gnosis (<EM>ñana</EM>) enabling one to 
        read others&#39; minds, then one&#39;s &#39;knowledge&#39; should not exceed the bounds 
        of that gnosis. If one does not possess that gnosis, there is no need to 
        be inquisitive.) In that way, one will not proliferate and work oneself 
        into a turmoil regarding other people, and give birth to such <EM>
        dhammas</EM> as greed and aversion. If one doesn&#39;t know the mental 
        states of others, or lives alone, it doesn&#39;t matter; it is not an 
        essential part of the practice. There is no question of being required 
        to monitor other people&#39;s behaviour in order to detect the states of 
        their bodies and minds.</FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One way of summarizing the above would be 
      to say that the development of <EM>satipatthana</EM> entails a dwelling 
      with <EM>sati</EM> and <EM>sampajañña</EM> which ensures that the image of 
      self which the mind of Ignorance creates and fashions can find no gap 
      through which it can insinuate itself into one&#39;s thoughts and create 
      problems.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><A NAME="Some">Some</A> scholars in the 
      West have looked at comparisons of <EM>satipatthana</EM> with contemporary 
      methods of psychotherapy. In their assessment of the relative merits of 
      the two systems, they have come to the conclusion that <EM>satipatthana</EM> 
      provides better results. Moreover, in that it is a method which may 
      feasibly be practised by anyone by himself, and, as its value is not 
      restricted to times of mental abnormality but may normally be employed for 
      good mental health, it is of wider application.[<A HREF="#12">12</A>] 
      However, these views will not be discussed here; instead, there will be a 
      further summary of the prominent features of <EM>satipatthana</EM>, this 
      time in terms of contemporary modes of thought.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><A NAME="Practice">
      <FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="4" FACE="Times New Roman">Practice</FONT></A>
      <FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="4" FACE="Times New Roman">as Process</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The constituent factors in this process of 
      practice are two-fold: the passive (that which is focused on, observed, 
      concentrated on, contemplated), and the active (focusing, observation, 
      concentration, contemplation).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The passive constituents are those 
      ordinary, mundane things common to all of us: the body and its movements, 
      thoughts, feelings and so on as they occur (only those existing at the 
      present moment are valid objects of contemplation).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The active constituents of focusing, 
      concentration, observation and contemplation form the basic agents of <EM>
      satipatthana</EM> and are functions of <EM>sati</EM> and <EM>sampajañña</EM>.
      <EM>Sati</EM> is that which keeps hold of the chosen object. <EM>
      Sampajañña</EM> is the wisdom-faculty which realizes the nature and 
      purpose of the thing or state being contemplated, as, for example, when 
      focusing one&#39;s contemplation on the movements of the body when walking, 
      one has a comprehension of such things as the reason for walking and the 
      intended destination. <EM>Sampajañña</EM> understands the object or the 
      action as it is, without coating it with feelings and so on.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is a point to be wary of which 
      should be stressed here, concerning a wrong understanding that may lead to 
      misguided and fruitless practice. Some people misconstrue the meaning of 
      the common translation of <EM>sati</EM> as &#39;recollection&#39; and of <EM>
      sampajañña</EM> as &#39;self-awareness&#39;. They establish <EM>sati</EM> on the 
      sense of self and then feel aware of themselves as the agents of the 
      various actions, &#39;I am doing this, I am doing that&#39;; their practice thus 
      becoming a creation or strengthening of the concept of self. The mind 
      becomes absorbed on that self-concept and develops a rigidity, or if not, 
      at the very least, it strays from its task, thus spoiling the results of 
      the work being undertaken. One who has formed such a wrong understanding 
      should look at the meaning of <EM>sati</EM> in its sense of &#39;bearing in 
      mind&#39;, maintaining the mind on its object, on the task being performed, or 
      in the flow of action. He or she should look at the meaning of <EM>
      sampajañña</EM> in its sense of clear comprehension of that which <EM>sati</EM> 
      is bearing in mind. In other words, it is not a matter of using <EM>sati</EM> 
      to focus on the sense of self, &#39;I am doing this, I am doing that&#39;; it 
      implies bearing the task itself in mind, rather than the &#39;performer&#39; of 
      the task. <EM>Sati</EM> should pay attention to the action being performed 
      or to the state that is presently occurring to the extent that there is no 
      room to think of oneself, or the &#39;actor&#39;. The heart must abide with the 
      action until the feeling of &#39;I&#39; or agency is made redundant.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The essential feature of focused 
      contemplation lies in the accurate, undistorted perception of its object, 
      i.e. looking, seeing and understanding what that object is, its 
      characteristics and the effects of its presence. It entails facing up to, 
      acknowledging, considering and understanding. Bare attention is maintained 
      on the object at every moment, without reacting to it in any way; without 
      evaluation, criticism, or judgement of it as being good or bad, right or 
      wrong, etc. There is no interpretation of the object in the light of one&#39;s 
      emotions, prejudices or attachments as being agreeable or disagreeable, 
      pleasant or unpleasant. One merely understands the way that thing, that 
      state, that aspect is, without supplementing one&#39;s perception of it with 
      such thoughts as &#39;mine&#39;, &#39;his&#39;, &#39;me&#39;, &#39;her&#39;, &#39;Mr. A.&#39;, &#39;Ms. B.&#39;, etc. To 
      take the example of contemplation of the feelings in one&#39;s heart: at the 
      moment that a painful feeling arises, one knows that a painful feeling is 
      arising, the way in which it has come about, and the way in which it is 
      presently dissipating. In the contemplation of mental phenomena, as the 
      example when anxiety or depression occurs in the mind, one lays hold of 
      that anxiety or depression and contemplates how it has come about and how 
      it has developed. At a time when anger arises, and, on becoming the object 
      of awareness, subsides, then one takes up that past anger as an object of 
      contemplation and considers its benefits and ill effects, the cause for 
      its arising and the way in which it disappears. It can become enjoyable to 
      study, reflect on and analyse one&#39;s suffering! When it is purely suffering 
      that is presently arising and passing away, and is not &#39;my suffering&#39; or 
      &#39;I am suffering&#39;, then that suffering is robbed of all its power to harm 
      the one who contemplates it. Whatever form of goodness or unwholesomeness 
      appears or is present in the mind, one faces up to it, without any effort 
      at avoidance. One cognizes it and pays attention to it as it is, from the 
      moment of its occurrence until it meets its natural end, and then switches 
      attention to something else. It is similar to watching actors perform a 
      play, or to being a bystander at some event. It is an attitude that is 
      comparable to that of a doctor performing an autopsy, or that of a 
      scientist observing the subject of his study, rather than that of a judge 
      listening to evidence in a trail. It is an objective rather than a 
      subjective approach.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">An important characteristic of the state 
      that is informed at all times by <EM>sati-sampajañña</EM> is that of 
      dwelling in the present moment. <EM>Sati</EM> is mindful at each moment of 
      what is arising, what is happening, or what one is doing and does not 
      allow the mind to wander off. There is no attachment to, or lingering on, 
      any past experience, and no floating off into the future in search of 
      things that have not yet happened or do not yet exist. There is no 
      straying back into the past or forward into the future. If some unresolved 
      matter from the past or some future obligation is to be considered, then
      <EM>sati</EM> lays hold of the relevant details, and the wisdom-faculty 
      reflects on them in a purposeful way, so that every matter becomes a 
      present object of mind. There is no aimless or superfluous drifting into 
      past or future. Dwelling in the present moment means freedom from 
      subjection to craving. The mind not seduced or motivated by selfish desire 
      exists with a wisdom which liberated it from the various expressions of
      <EM>dukkha</EM>, such as grief and regret, agitation, anxiety and 
      depression, and gives rise to an awareness that is accompanied by 
      spaciousness, clarity and ease.</FONT></P>

      is fixed exclusively on the object on which one desires to focus and <EM>

      of consciousness and thought will be naturally maintained in purity, for 
      there will be no room for the various defilements to arise. When examining 
      and analysing phenomena simply as they are, without appending emotions and 
      conceptualizations based on subjective prejudices and preferences, then 
      there will be no clinging. It is a method of eradicating existing cankers 
      (<EM>asava</EM>[<A HREF="#13">13</A>]) and protecting the mind from the 
      occurrence of those that are as-yet unarisen.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Freedom: The pure state of mind spoken of 
      above will also be blessed with freedom, being unperturbed by the various 
      sense-impressions which impinge upon it, through utilizing every one of 
      them as material for objective study. When sense-data is not interpreted 
      in line with the dictates of the cankers, it exerts no subjective 
      influence over the one who experiences it. That person&#39;s behaviour will be 
      liberated from the defilements that act as unconscious drives or 
      motivations. This is what is referred to in the text as &#39;dwelling 
      independently (i.e. not being the servant of craving and views) and 
      clinging to naught in the world&#39;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Wisdom: In the train of such a mental 
      process, the wisdom-faculty will function with maximum effectiveness. The 
      absence of obfuscation or diversion by emotions, proclivities and 
      prejudices ensures a perception of things as they actually exist, an 
      authentic awareness.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Liberation from <EM>dukkha</EM>: When the 
      mind dwells in a state of wakefulness, understanding things in their 
      actuality and able to maintain such a vision, those positive and negative 
      inclinations in relation to things which are unfounded on a purified logic 
      will be unable to arise. Thus there will be an absence of states rooted in 
      covetousness (<EM>abhijjha</EM>) or in distress (<EM>domanassa</EM>), and 
      freedom from the various expressions of anxiety. This is the state of mind 
      which is called &#39;released&#39;. It is experienced as a light spaciousness, 
      relaxation, serenity and independence.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; <A NAME="In">In</A> fact, all 
      of the fruits of practice mentioned above are different, related aspects 
      of a single whole. To summarize in terms of Dependent Origination[<A HREF="#14">14</A>] 
      and the Three Characteristics: At first, human beings are ignorant of the 
      fact that the self they cling to it ultimately non-existent, that is 
      merely a flux, consisting of a great number of interrelated material and 
      immaterial phenomena, constantly arising and degenerating in accordance 
      with complex causal and conditioning processes. When one is unaware of 
      this truth, one clings to the feelings, thoughts, desires, habits, 
      attitudes, beliefs, opinions and sense-consciousness that arise at each 
      moment as being one&#39;s self and feels that that one&#39;s self is continually 
      changing: &#39;I was that, now I am this, I felt that way, and now I feel this 
      way&#39;, etc. In perceiving an &#39;I&#39; as a subject who has likes and dislikes, 
      one is simply being deceived by such things as thoughts and feelings. This 
      deluded condition of the mind is the source of wrong thinking. As a 
      consequence of it, one&#39;s thoughts, feelings and actions are all held in 
      subjection to the exigencies of whatever is being clung to as self at the 
      moment. In coming to practise according to the principles of <EM>
      satipatthana</EM>, every kind of material and immaterial phenomenon 
      contained within the mental continuum is seen to be arising and ceasing in 
      accordance with its nature. When analysing the various constituents of 
      this flux by segregating them in terms of content or temporal sequence, 
      and thus perceiving a continuity of change, the process-nature of our 
      existence, one is no longer deceived into clinging onto anything as being 
      one&#39;s self, and phenomena lose their power to coerce.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If this insight attains an optimum 
      profundity and clarity, there is realization of the state of liberation. 
      It establishes the mind in a new mode of being, as a light, bright stream, 
      free of inner knots, proclivities and attachments. It is the birth of a 
      new personality. To put it another way, it is the state of perfect mental 
      health, comparable to a body which is said to be in perfect health when, 
      in the absence of any disturbing illness, all of its organs function 
      smoothly at their full, normal capacity. In this simile, the practice of
      <EM>satipatthana</EM> is viewed as a method of eradicating the various 
      malignancies of the mind, eliminating all those things which form knots 
      and obstructions to its smooth working. <EM>Satipatthana</EM> creates a 
      spaciousness in the mind. One becomes ready to conduct one&#39;s life, to face 
      up to and deal with everything in one&#39;s world with resolution and good

        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;O Bhikkhus, there are two kinds of 
        disease: physical disease and spiritual disease (literally &#39;mental 
        disease&#39;). Those beings who may assert that they have been without 
        physical disease for a whole year are to be found in the world. Those 
        people who may assert that they have been without physical disease for 
        two years ... three years ... four years ... five years ... ten years 
        ... twenty years ... thirty years ... forty years ... fifty years ... a 
        hundred years are to be found. But hard to find in this world are those 
        beings who may assert that they have been free from spiritual disease, 
        even for a single moment, apart from those in whom the cankers have been 
        destroyed.&quot; [A.II.142-143]</FONT></P>

      <A NAME="Reason">Reason</A> is the Sati Which Keeps Abreast of the Present 
      Moment an Important Foundation of Vipassana?</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Our most ordinary, mundane activity, one 
      that is going on constantly in our daily lives, is the cognition of 
      sense-impressions through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind. 
      Sense-consciousness is always accompanied by a feeling -- either of 
      pleasure and ease, of pain and discomfort, or else of indifference. In the 
      presence of feeling, a reaction takes place in the mind; if pleasure and 
      ease are evoked by an object, there is liking and attachment. If pain and 
      discomfort are evoked, there will be dislike and aversion. When there is 
      liking of something, there arises the desire to experience more of it, to 
      repeat the enjoyment, to obtain or possess. When there is dislike of 
      something, there arises the desire to escape from it, to rid oneself of it 
      or destroy it. This process is continuing all the time, both on subtle 
      levels which tend to remain unobserved, and, on occasion, with an 
      intensity which is plainly recognizable and which inflicts clearly 
      discernible and lasting effects on the mind. Whenever the process displays 
      this intensity, or is so strikingly evident, it will usually induce long 
      and involved mental proliferations, and, if the matter finds no resolution 
      in the heart, it will then intrude into the whole range of one&#39;s speech 
      and actions. Thus people&#39;s lives, their roles in the world and the ways in 
      which they relate to each other all issue principally from this incessant 
      flow of mental phenomena which is present in every moment of our 
      existence.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Heedlessly abandoning the mind to the 
      conditioned process described above, i.e. liking and attaching to feelings 
      of sensual pleasure and comfort, or disliking and resisting feelings of 
      sensual pain and discomfort, will serve to thwart and impede the 
      development of wisdom. One will be prevented from seeing things as they 
      are and accurately perceiving the true nature of their existence.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus the following impediments to wisdom 
      may be seen:</FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM>The mind falls into the power of 
        liking and disliking and is held fast by it.</EM> The mind&#39;s vision is 
        obscured by that like or dislike and inclines away from an accurate 
        perception of the actual nature of phenomena.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM>The mind falls into the past or the 
        future.</EM> Having cognized an object and aroused liking or disliking 
        towards it, the mind will stick to or oppose the particular part, point, 
        or aspect of that object which calls forth that like or dislike. It will 
        take up an image of that aspect as if implying the whole, feed it and 
        proliferate on it until the overall truth of the matter is almost 
        completely obscured. This dwelling on one particular aspect of a 
        phenomenon due to like or dislike, then grasping onto the concept or 
        mental image of it appearing in one&#39;s mind, is a slip into the past. The 
        ensuing mental proliferations regarding that image are a drift into the 
        future. One&#39;s knowledge and understanding of an object thus in fact 
        becomes based on the image of that partial aspect of it which attracts 
        one&#39;s like or dislike, or else on a more developed image fashioned from 
        the original one by the imagination. Thus there is no perception of the 
        object as it actually exists in its entirely in the present moment.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM>The mind falls into the power of 
        mental conditioning,</EM> which interprets the meaning of what is sensed 
        or experienced in the light of one&#39;s personal history or accumulated 
        habits, e.g. by the values, attitudes and opinions which one clings to 
        and upholds. The mind is thus said to fall into a conditioned state, 
        unable to look with equanimity at the bare experience itself.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM>The mind integrates the conditioned 
        image of experience into subsequent proliferations,</EM> thus quickening 
        the accretion of habitual patterns of reaction.</FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The characteristics of mind mentioned 
      above do not pertain only to the coarse and shallow matters of one&#39;s daily 
      life and general affairs. The emphasis in the teachings is on their 
      manifestation at the subtle and profound level of the mental continuum. It 
      is through their presence that ordinary, unenlightened beings are led to 
      see things as stable and substantially real, to perceive inherent beauty 
      or ugliness in them, to attach to conventional truths and to be unable to 
      see phenomena in their true light, as temporal expressions of a causal 
      flux. People accumulate habits and conditioned tendencies to misperceive 
      existence almost from the day they are born, and go twenty or thirty 
      years, forty or fifty years, even longer than that, without ever training 
      themselves to break the circuit of wrong thinking. Consequently, effecting 
      a remedy is not easy. At the very moment that one becomes conscious of an 
      object, before one has had time to steady oneself to check the process, 
      the mind has already switched into an habitual response. Thus the remedy 
      in this case is not simply a matter of breaking a circuit and abrogating 
      the conditioned process, but also necessitates a curbing of the habitual 
      tendency and disposition of the mind to flow strongly along fixed 
      channels. It is <EM>sati</EM> which is vital here, both initially as a 
      sort of ground-breaker, and subsequently as the element around which other 
      factors gather. The objectives of <EM>satipatthana</EM> practice are, 
      therefore, through maintenance of <EM>sati</EM> in the present moment and 
      always seeing things in their bare actuality, the breaking of the circuit 
      of deluded thought, the destruction of the unwholesome causal process, and 
      the gradual alleviation of the old conditioning, with the simultaneous 
      creation of new dispositions in the mind.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The mind which has <EM>sati</EM> helping 
      to maintain it in the present moment will possess characteristics which 
      are the complete antitheses of those shown by the mind caught in the flow 
      of unwholesome <EM>dhammas</EM>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Liking and aversion will have no 
      opportunity to arise in it, because their presence is dependent on the 
      mind seizing on a particular point or aspect of a matter and, through 
      lingering on it, slipping back into the past. Liking and aversion exist 
      only in association with a falling away from the present moment. A 
      consequence of bare mindfulness of the presently existing state is the 
      prevention of a dropping into the past or a floating off into the future. 
      In the presence of <EM>sati</EM> there is also no exacerbation or 
      strengthening of previously accumulated wrong habits.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When one is unceasingly mindful of every 
      phenomenon arising in the present moment, one is bound to perceive certain 
      character traits in oneself which are unpleasant or which one would 
      ordinarily consider unacceptable. With <EM>sati</EM>, one can acknowledge 
      and face up to these qualities as they are, without seeking to avoid them 
      and without any self-deception. One is thus able to cleanse them from the 
      mind and to solve the problems which lie within oneself.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The mind with constant <EM>sati</EM> is 
      one which possesses the qualities of purity, radiance, spaciousness, joy 
      and freedom. It is an unconstricted and untarnished mind.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">All things are established and exist 
      according to natural laws. Figuratively speaking, the truth is revealing 
      itself at all times, but we shut ourselves off from it; or, if we don&#39;t, 
      we either perceive only a distorted image of it or we deceive ourselves as 
      to its nature altogether. The cause of that concealment, distortion and 
      deception is immersion in the conditioned stream of unwholesome <EM>
      dhammas</EM> detailed above. Once that false step has been taken, then the 
      old, false conditioning is even more inclined to drag one into error, thus 
      leaving virtually no hope at all of seeing the truth. In that humanity has 
      been steadily accumulating these habits for an immeasurably long time, the 
      practice to remedy them and to create new dispositions in the mind is also 
      likely to require a long time.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Whenever <EM>sati</EM> keeps up with the 
      change in things and works constantly, without interruptions and in an 
      assured fashion; when one doesn&#39;t put up a barrier to the truth, or 
      distort the images one perceives; when one is free from the power of 
      conditioning and habit; then one is prepared to see things in their 
      actuality and to understand the truth.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On reaching this stage, if the other 
      faculties (particularly the wisdom-faculty) are mature and well-primed, 
      they will join forces with <EM>sati</EM>, or else rely on it to facilitate 
      their full functioning and so bring about <EM>ñana-dassana</EM>, the 
      authentic vision of phenomena which is the goal of <EM>vipassana</EM>. 
      However, to bring the faculties to the maturity demanded for such work, 
      one has to rely on a progressive training which must include, at first, 
      study and investigation of the teachings. Study and logical thought are 
      then of definite assistance in the birth of the clear vision of truth.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM>Sati</EM> is not itself <EM>vipassana</EM>;
      <EM>vipassana</EM> is wisdom (<EM>pañña</EM>) or the use of wisdom. 
      However, wisdom derives its opportunity to work with maximum facility from 
      dependence on <EM>sati&#39;s</EM> direction and support. Thus the training in
      <EM>sati</EM> is of major importance to <EM>vipassana</EM>. One trains in
      <EM>sati</EM> in order to be able to fully utilize the wisdom faculty. To 
      train in <EM>sati</EM> is to simultaneously train in wisdom.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><A NAME="When">When</A> speaking of <EM>
      sati</EM> on the practical rather than academic level, one includes in its 
      meaning that of the wisdom with which it is conjoined, and the strength 
      and continuity attained by <EM>sati</EM> is derived from the cooperation 
      of the two.[<A HREF="#15">15</A>] The <EM>pañña</EM> which works together 
      with <EM>sati</EM> in general tasks tends to bear the characteristic 
      called <EM>sampajañña</EM> or clear comprehension. On this level, <EM>
      pañña</EM> still appears mainly as a contributory factor in practice, 
      cooperating and liaising with <EM>sati</EM>. In speech and conversation, 
      for example, one tends to rely principally on <EM>sati</EM>. However, when 
      it comes to more subtle levels of investigation, prominence shifts to <EM>
      pañña</EM>, and <EM>sati</EM> is relegated to a role rather like that of a 
      servant. The <EM>pañña</EM> which functions on this level is, for example, 
      the <EM>dhamma-vicaya</EM> of the Seven Limbs of Enlightenment. But 
      whether it is <EM>sampajañña</EM> or <EM>dhammavicaya</EM>, or <EM>pañña</EM> 
      by any of its other designations, if it works to produce a clear knowledge 
      and understanding of things in direct accordance with the true nature of 
      their existence so as to liberate the mind, then it is all <EM>vipassana</EM>.[See 
      Vibhanga, 612]</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM>Sati</EM> performs an important task 
      in both <EM>samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassana</EM> and a comparison between 
      the differing roles it plays in each may help to further clarity the 
      matters dealt with above. In <EM>samatha</EM>, <EM>sati</EM> fastens the 
      mind onto its object, or holds the object in the mind, simply in order to 
      enable the mind to concentrate unswervingly on the object and to grasp it 
      firmly, to be motionlessly tranquil and free of distraction and agitation. 
      When the mind is thus firmly and unswervingly centered on the object to 
      the extent that it becomes uninterruptedly one with it, that state is 
      called <EM>samadhi</EM> and signals the achievement of <EM>samatha</EM>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In <EM>vipassana</EM>, <EM>sati</EM> 
      focuses on the object and fastens it to the mind, or maintains the mind on 
      the object in a similar way. However, in this case, the aim is to use the 
      mind as a place to lay the object down for examination and contemplation 
      by the wisdom-faculty. One takes hold of the object in order to let <EM>
      pañña</EM> investigate and analyse it, using the firm and stable mind as 
      one&#39;s laboratory. The practice of <EM>samatha</EM> is like tying a wild 
      young bull to a post with a rope. All it can do is circle around the post 
      to which it is bound until, eventually, when its wildness has abated, it 
      lies down meekly at the foot of the post. Here, the mind may be compared 
      to the wild young bull, the meditation object to the post and <EM>sati</EM> 
      to the rope. The practice of <EM>Vipassana</EM> may be compared to fixing 
      a specimen onto a surface in order to allow a subsequent examination to 
      proceed smoothly and with precision. Here, the means used to pin down the 
      specimen may be compared to <EM>sati</EM>, the specimen to the meditation 
      object, the surface to the stabilized mind and the examination to <EM>
      pañña</EM>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The preceding remarks have covered the 
      significant differences between <EM>samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassana</EM>, 
      but a few minor observations remain to be made. One such observation is 
      that, in <EM>samatha</EM>, one&#39;s aim is to pacify the mind; thus when <EM>
      sati</EM> is employed to focus on an object, it will firmly fasten onto it 
      with the sole aim of producing a firm and unswerving concentration on that 
      object, preventing even the slightest separation, until eventually the 
      mind dwells completely and unwaveringly on the &#39;sign&#39; or mental image of 
      the meditation object, Thus <EM>samatha</EM> involves fixing on an object 
      which is merely a perception created in the mind by the meditator.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In <EM>vipassana</EM>, on the other hand, 
      the aim is towards knowledge and understanding of the way things are. 
      Consequently, <EM>sati</EM> focuses only on truly existent phenomena, in 
      order for <EM>pañña</EM> to fully and clearly comprehend the nature of 
      their existence. It attends to the way things are, right from the moment 
      of their nascence through their gradual decline to their final 
      disintegration. It demands an awareness of every kind of sense-impression 
      which impinges on consciousness so that <EM>pañña</EM> can comprehend each 
      one in its actuality. Thus the object in focus is not a fixed one, and to 
      ensure an accurate and authentic comprehension, <EM>sati</EM> must be 
      mindful of the changing nature at every moment, to prevent the mind from 
      lingering on any one object or aspect of an object.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Another minor point of difference to be 
      observed is that, in <EM>samatha</EM>, <EM>sati</EM> focuses on an object 
      that is either fixed or else moves repetitiously within fixed boundaries. 
      In <EM>vipassana</EM>, <EM>sati</EM> can focus on an object that is moving 
      or changing in any way. In <EM>samatha</EM>, one selects a certain defined 
      object as a skilful means to facilitate the pacification and stabilization 
      of the mind. In <EM>vipassana</EM>, one may focus on any object without 
      restrictions; whatever appears in the mind and lends itself to 
      contemplation, whatever permits the vision of truth, is valid. In fact, 
      all may be subsumed under the headings of body, feelings, mind and <EM>
      dhammas</EM> or else <EM>nama-rupa</EM> (mind and body).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Another important element of the general 
      principles of practice, and examination of which helps to further clarify 
      those special characteristics which distinguish <EM>vipassana</EM> from
      <EM>samatha</EM>, is <EM>yoniso-manasikara</EM> (skilful reflection). <EM>
      Yoniso-manasikara</EM> is a mental factor that assists in the birth of 
      wisdom and is consequently of great importance in <EM>vipassana</EM>. In 
      the practice of <EM>samatha</EM>, although it may be a useful support on 
      many occasions, it is of lesser significance and, on some occasions, may 
      be redundant, ordinary consideration being sufficient. To expand on this 
      point, in the development of <EM>samatha</EM>, if all goes smoothly and 
      results are duly experienced, there is no need to make use of <EM>
      yoniso-manasikara</EM>. However, on those occasions when the mind refuses 
      its attention to the object, resists all restrains and insists on 
      agitation, or else in those meditation themes, e.g. <EM>metta</EM>, which 
      require a certain measure of reflective thought, one may need a skilful 
      means to guide the mind. In such a case, one require the assistance of <EM>
      yoniso-manasikara</EM>, intelligent use of the thought-process, to lead 
      the mind on the correct path towards its goal. An example would be knowing 
      how to reflect so as to arrest anger and cause its replacement by <EM>
      metta</EM>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><A NAME="On">On</A> the <EM>samatha</EM> 
      side of practice, the <EM>yoniso-manasikara</EM> which may be required is 
      solely of the kind that induces wholesome <EM>dhammas</EM>; there is no 
      need to call upon the kind that activates the clear seeing of the true 
      nature of things. In <EM>vipassana</EM>, <EM>yoniso-manasikara</EM> is a 
      singularly important step on the path to wisdom and is thus an essential 
      principle of Dhamma. <EM>Yoniso-manasikara</EM> directly precedes wisdom; 
      it is that which paves the way for wisdom, or opens up a space in which 
      wisdom can mature.[<A HREF="#16">16</A>] Its characteristics and workings 
      are so similar to those of <EM>pañña</EM> that, when speaking of them, 
      there often tends to be a looseness in expression, referring by name to 
      only one and in fact meaning both, thus causing students difficulties in 
      distinguishing between them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM>Yoniso-manasikara</EM> acts as a link 
      between <EM>sati</EM> and <EM>pañña</EM>. It is that which guides the 
      stream of thought in such a way that wisdom is able to get down to work 
      and achieve results. To put it another way, it is that which provides 
      wisdom with its method; it is the skilful means employed in the 
      efficacious use of wisdom. Student of Dhamma tend to become confused 
      because, in general parlance, the term &#39;<EM>yoniso-manasikara</EM>&#39; is 
      used to refer both to the proposal of the means or method of thought 
      (which is its true meaning), and also to the subsequent employment of <EM>
      pañña</EM> in line with that method. Thus, as it is commonly used, the 
      term implies both reflection and wisdom, in other words, &#39;wise 
      reflection&#39;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This ambiguity may also occur when 
      speaking of the practical expressions of <EM>pañña</EM>. For instance, 
      when using the term &#39;<EM>dhammavicaya</EM>&#39; (the discrimination of <EM>
      dhammas</EM>), one is usually left to work out for oneself that <EM>
      dhammavicaya</EM> denotes the employment of the wisdom-faculty to 
      discriminate between <EM>dhammas</EM> using one of the methods provided by
      <EM>yoniso-manasikara</EM>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To demonstrate the process involved as a 
      sequence of events, one could say that when <EM>sati</EM> brings an object 
      to mind and lays it down in full view of the mind, <EM>yoniso-manasikara</EM>, 
      as it were, picks it up and manipulates it in such a way that <EM>pañña</EM> 
      may scrutinize it and then deal with it effectively. <EM>Yoniso-manasikara</EM> 
      fixes on the aspects amenable to the workings of <EM>pañña</EM> and

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A comparison may be made to someone in a 
      rowing boat out on a choppy river, picking flowers or water greens. 
      Firstly, that person ties up the boat or anchors it in such a way that it 
      will remain stationary at the spot where the plants grow. Then with one 
      hand he grasps hold of the stems, gathers them together and exposes them 
      as conveniently as possible for harvesting. With the other hand, using the 
      tool he has prepared for the job, he cuts them off. <EM>Sati</EM> may be 
      compared to the anchor which stabilized the boat, enabling the man to 
      remain within reach of the plants. The boat, held stationary at a given 
      spot, may be compared to the mind. The hand which grasps the plant stems 
      and holds them in a convenient way is like <EM>yoniso-manasikara</EM>. The 
      other hand, using a sharp tool to cut off the stems, is like <EM>pañña</EM>.</FONT></P>

      Commentary. The phrase, &#39;the body in the body&#39; is glossed in several 
      different ways by the commentators, with an overall emphasis on the aim of 
      the contemplation. One interpretation, for example, takes it as focusing 
      on the body without muddle, attending, in the body, only to the body -- 
      not to feelings, mind-states, or <EM>dhammas</EM> associated with it. 
      Another takes it to mean attending to the smaller parts which comprise the 
      body as a unit, distinguishing the different components and looking at 
      them individually, (continued) until one sees that the whole body is 
      nothing other than a congregation of smaller constituents, that there is 
      nobody there, no &#39;Mr. A&#39; or &#39;Ms. B&#39;. It thus implies the analysis of a 
      composite unit, the dismantling of a complex structure, and is an 
      endeavour comparable to that of removing all the leaves and the spadix of 
      a banana tree and finding no heart-wood, no essential tree. (The phrases, 
      &#39;feelings in feelings&#39;, &#39;mind in mind&#39;, and &#39;<EM>dhammas</EM> in <EM>
      dhammas</EM>&#39; may be understood in the same way.) [<A HREF="#Kaye">Back to

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG><A NAME="16">16</A>.</STRONG> Here 
      one should note the differing results, in relation to <EM>pañña</EM>, of
      <EM>saddha</EM> (reasoned conviction) and <EM>yoniso-manasikara</EM>. <EM>
      Saddha</EM> is like digging a fixed channel for thought to flow along. <EM>
      Yoniso-manasikara</EM> is like cutting the path for <EM>pañña</EM> which 
      is at each moment most conducive to its fruitful progress.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In Buddhism, the sort of <EM>saddha</EM> 
      which is encouraged is that which can link up with <EM>pañña</EM>, i.e. 
      that which offers an opportunity to <EM>yoniso-manasikara</EM> to perform 
      its function. To illustrate this point, one example of the <EM>saddha</EM> 
      of the &#39;fixed channel&#39; variety is the theist&#39;s belief that everything 
      which happens is the will of God. Such a faith brings critical thought to 
      a halt. A Buddhist, on the other hand, has conviction in the truth of 
      those of the Buddha&#39;s teachings which he has not yet directly verified for 
      himself, but his faith leads him on. For example, his conviction in the 
      Buddha&#39;s teaching that all things exist in accordance with causes and 
      conditions encourages him, when undergoing an experience, to try to find 
      out what causes and conditions are prevailing at that time. [<A HREF="#On">Back
