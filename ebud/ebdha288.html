      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">P</FONT>racticing the Dhamma is primarily 
      an issue of looking at yourself, looking at your own thoughts, your own 
      words, your own deeds, seeing what’s skillful, seeing what’s not. It’s not 
      so much an issue of self-improvement as one of action-improvement, 
      word-improvement, and thought-improvement. This is an important 
      distinction, because people in the modern world—<I>especially</I> in the 
      modern world—seem to be obsessed with self-image. We’ve spent our lives 
      bombarded with images, and you can’t help but compare your image of 
      yourself to the images of people you see outside you. And for the most 
      part there’s no comparison: You’re not as strong, as beautiful, as 
      wealthy, as stylish, and so forth. I noticed in Thailand that, as soon as 
      television became rampant, teenagers became very sullen. I think it’s 
      largely this issue of people’s looking at themselves in comparison to the 
      images broadcast at them. And the whole question of self-image becomes 
      very sensitive, very painful. So when we say that you’re looking at 
      yourself, remember you’re not looking at your &quot;self.&quot; You’re looking at 
      your thoughts, words, and deeds. Try to look at them as objectively as 
      possible, get the whole issue of &quot;self&quot; out of the way, and then it 
      becomes a lot easier to make improvements.<P>The same applies to your 
      dealings with other people. The Buddha said there are two factors that 
      help most in the arising of discernment, that help you most along the 
      path. The foremost internal factor is appropriate attention. The foremost 
      external factor is admirable friendship. And it’s important that you 
      reflect on what admirable friendship means, because even though you’re 
      supposed to be looking at your own thoughts, words, and deeds, you’re also 
      looking at the thoughts, words, and deeds of the people around you. After 
      all, your eyes are fixed in your body so that they point outside. You 
      can’t help but see what other people are doing. So the question is how you 
      can make this knowledge most useful to yourself as you practice. And this 
      is where the principle of admirable friendship comes in.</P>
      <P>To begin with, it means associating with admirable people, people who 
      have admirable habits, people who have qualities that are worthy of 
      admiration. One list puts these qualities at four: Admirable people have 
      conviction in the principle of kamma, they’re virtuous, they’re generous, 
      and they’re discerning. There’s a well-known line from Dogen where he 
      says, &quot;When you walk through the mist, your robe gets wet without your 
      even thinking about it.&quot; That’s his description of living with a teacher. 
      You pick up the teacher’s habits without thinking about it, but that can 
      be a double-edged sword because your teacher can have both good and bad 
      habits, and you need to be careful about which ones you pick up. </P>
      <P>So in addition to associating with admirable people, the Buddha says 
      there are two further factors in admirable friendship. One is that you ask 
      these people about issues of conviction, virtue, generosity, discernment. 
      And this doesn’t necessarily mean just asking the teacher. You can ask 
      other people in the community who have admirable qualities as well. See 
      what special insights they have on how to develop those qualities. After 
      all, they’ve obviously got experience, and you’d be wise to pick their 
      brains.</P>
      <P>The second factor is that if you see anything in other people worth 
      emulating, you emulate it, you follow it, you bring that quality into your 
      own behavior. So this makes you responsible for your end of admirable 
      friendship, too. You can’t sit around simply hoping to soak up the mist, 
      waiting for it to blow your way. <I>You</I> have to be active. Remember 
      that passage in the Dhammapada about the spoon not knowing the taste of 
      the soup, while the tongue does know the taste.</P>
      <P>But again, when looking at people around you, it’s important that you 
      get away from your sense of competitiveness, of this person versus that 
      person. You look, not at them, but at their activities. Otherwise you 
      start comparing yourself to the other person: &quot;This person’s better than I 
      am. That person’s worse than I am.&quot; And that brings in questions of 
      conceit, resentment, and competition, which are not really helpful because 
      we’re not here to compete with each other. We’re here to work on 
      ourselves. So again, look at other people simply in terms of their 
      thoughts, their words, their actions. And see what’s an admirable action, 
      what are admirable words, what are admirable ideas, ones you can emulate, 
      ones you can pick up. In this way the fact that we’re living together 
      becomes a help to the practice rather than a hindrance. </P>
      <P>The same is true when you notice people around you doing things that 
      are not so admirable. Instead of judging the other person, simply judge 
      the actions by their results: that that particular action, that particular 
      way of thinking or speaking is not very skillful, for it obviously leads 
      to this or that undesirable result. And then turn around and look at 
      yourself, at the things you do and say: Are those unskillful words and 
      actions to be found in you? Look at the behavior of other people as a 
      mirror for your own behavior. When you do this, even the difficulties of 
      living in a community become an aid to the practice. </P>
      <P>The Buddha designed the monkhood so that monks would have time alone 
      but also have time together. If you spent all of your time alone, you’d 
      probably go crazy. If you spent all of your time together, life would 
      start getting more and more like dorm life all the time. So you have to 
      learn how to balance the two. Learn how to develop your own good qualities 
      on your own and at the same time use the actions and words of other people 
      as mirrors for yourself, to check yourself, to see what out there is worth 
      emulating, to see what out there is clearly unskillful. And then reflect 
      on yourself, &quot;Do I have those admirable qualities? Do I have those 
      unskillful qualities in my thoughts, words and deeds?&quot; If you’ve got those 
      unskillful qualities, you’ve got work to do. If you don’t have the 
      admirable ones, you’ve got work to do there as well.</P>
      <P>What’s interesting is that in both of these internal and external 
      factors—both in appropriate attention and in admirable friendship—one of 
      the crucial factors is questioning. In other words, in appropriate 
      attention you learn how to ask yourself questions about your own actions. 
      In admirable friendship you ask the other people you admire about the 
      qualities they embody. If you find someone whose conviction is admirable, 
      you ask that person about conviction. If you find someone whose effort and 
      persistence are admirable, you ask him about persistence. In other words, 
      you take an interest in these things. The things that we ask questions 
      about, those are the things we’re interested in, those are the things that 
      direct our practice. And it’s the combination of the two, the internal 
      questioning and the external questioning, that gets us pointed in the 
      right direction. </P>
      <P>So this is something to think about as you go through the day and you 
      see someone else doing something that gets you upset or something that 
      offends you. Don’t focus on the other person; focus on the action in and 
      of itself, as part of a causal process, and then turn around and look at 
      yourself. If, in your mind, you create other people out there, you create 
      a lot of problems. But if you simply see life in the community as an 
      opportunity to watch the principle of cause and effect as it plays itself 
      out, the problems vanish. </P>
      <P>The same with admirable people: You don’t get jealous of their good 
      qualities; you don’t get depressed about the fact that you don’t have 
      their good qualities. Where do good qualities come from? They come from 
      persistence, from effort, from training, which is something we can all do. 
      So again, if you see something admirable in other people, <I>ask them 
      about it</I>, and then try to apply those lessons in your own life. If we 
      go through life without asking questions, we learn nothing. If we ask the 
      wrong questions, we go off the path. If, with practice, we learn how to 
      ask the right questions, that’s the factor that helps us get our practice 
      right on target. </P>
      <P>I once read a man’s reminiscences about his childhood in which he said 
      that every day, when he’d come home from school, his mother’s first 
      question would be, &quot;What questions did you ask in school today?&quot; She 
      didn’t ask, &quot;What did you learn? What did the teacher teach?&quot; She asked, 
      &quot;What questions did you ask?&quot; She was teaching him to think. So at the end 
      of the day when you stop to reflect on the day’s activities, that’s a good 
      question to ask yourself: &quot;What questions did I ask today? What answers 
      did I get?&quot; That way you get to see which direction your practice is 
      going.</P>
