    <h3>Preface</h3>
    <p>This succinct exposition of the basic principles for
    starting mental development or vipassanâ bhâvanâ, is given
    on request of yogis who would like to have a practical
    guideline and a reminder for their regular practice. </p>
    <p>After the initial enthusiasm it is often difficult to keep
    the fire burning, specially when the pressure of social life
    with all its duties is felt. </p>
    <p>With the aim of offering support in those periods when the
    practice tends to become somewhat dim and the yogi encounters
    discouraging difficulties, the author has written this
    treatise. This small contribution to a better comprehension
    of the instructions for the vipassanâ practice is by no
    means meant to be a complete survey. Many other aspects which
    the yogi will come across in the course of the practice are
    not discussed as they can only be understood in a better way
    with the advice and guidance of a meditation- teacher in a
    personal interview. </p>
    <p><a name="chap1"></a></p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">1. Why Should one Practice
    Vipassanâ?</font></h3>
    <p>THE answer to this question can be brief: &quot;To cope
    with the problem of unsatisfactoriness in life in a better
    way and to become free from it&quot;. </p>
    <p>All beings yearn for some happiness and security in their
    life. Unfortunately nobody is able to evoke happiness just
    because one desires for it, nor is it possible to maintain
    one's pleasure as long as one wants. </p>
    <p>The happiness one can find in the world is fragile. In
    case one gets what one wants there will be happiness but one
    can hardly expect to get always those things to which one has
    a preference. If desires are blocked and one does not get
    what one wants, there is disappointment and aversion. </p>
    <p>Since people are mainly just vaguely aware of these
    processes in the mind, they are time and again affected by
    the constant change of fortunes in life, which is quite
    unsatisfactory. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;In whichever manner people think of things,
        things turn out to be otherwise. Such is the opposite
        nature of things. Observe thus the nature of the
        world.&quot; (Sutta Nipâta) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Human beings are endowed with a discriminative mind. As
    such they are supposed to be able to know the reasons for
    their actions. Nevertheless, people are often not clearly
    aware of the motive or the purpose of their activities. </p>
    <p>They act quite frequently on the spur of the moment
    according to their moods. When motive and purpose are obscure
    one may run the risk of using the wrong means. Such
    uncontrolled behaviour may sometimes have rather embarrassing
    consequences which cause confusion. </p>
    <p>Being confused means that one has no clear sight on the
    reality of what is happening. To gain more insight into one's
    own inner behaviour and one's attitude towards other
    circumstances, one needs to develop the mind. Mental
    development (vipassanâ) in the Buddhist sense, means to
    cultivate a deeper understanding of one's own mental and
    physical actions and their mutual inter-relation. To do this
    effectively, it requires a mindful observation of one's
    activities in speech, body and mind. </p>
    <p>Starting an important activity like mental development
    acccording to the teaching s of the Buddha, it needs some
    preliminary reflections on both motive and purpose. If motive
    and purpose are not in balance the progress will be hampered.
    The next step will be to examine what are the right means to
    reach the set purpose. </p>
    <p>The Buddha clearly pointed out that there is but one way
    to counteract the problem of unsatisfactoriness of life. In
    other words there is a method which when applied in the right
    way - heads for happiness. This method (or way) leads to: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;The purification of beings, overcoming arrow
        Iamentation, elimination pain and grief, reaching the
        right Path and the attainment of Nibbâna.&quot; (Majjima
        Nikâya 10) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To understand these terms, the Buddha used, rightly, one
    should take the time to reflect on their true meaning and
    their connection to one's aim in life. </p>
    <p>Purification here, refers to a state of mind which is free
    from obstructions that cause tension and conflict in oneself.
    </p>
    <p>Generally speaking, just one glimpse of the state of
    affairs in one's life will be enough to see that there is a
    lot of stress and disharmony. These states of mind have their
    roots in craving, anger and confusion which make the mind
    impure. </p>
    <p>Craving brings about the underlying fear of not getting
    what one wants or to become separated from what is dearly
    beloved. Being irritable or angry creates conflict and is
    certainly not conducive to inner peace. Owing to confusion
    which accompanies invariably all these states rooted in
    craving and anger, these impurities are not clearly discerned
    according to their distressing effects on the mind. Because
    these mental states are mainly considered as part and parcel
    of one's life and as such something that is inevitable, the
    according to the teachings of the Buddha, it needs some
    burden of unhappiness is carried on and on. </p>
    <p>One needs wisdom to see how these states of mind create
    dissension and strife in oneself and for others as well.
    Comprehending the cause - craving accompanied by confusion -
    and the effect of conflict (dukkha) which is unsatisfactory,
    one may feel the urge to free the mind from these painful
    states. </p>
    <p>Wisdom can be developed by methodically analysing one's
    own mental behaviour when there is a reaction to the
    unbridled stream of sense-impressions by which people are
    attacked the whole day. People are mainly not very selective
    in the intake of sense-data. Consequently there is a lot of
    unpleasantness. Before one is even clearly aware of it, there
    is already aversion, aggressiveness, pain and grief. </p>
    <p>When there is wisdom, these states will not arise, because
    wisdom is selective. It knows exactly which things lead to
    painful states and which will bring about peace of mind. </p>
    <p>Wisdom or right view is a factor of the (Eightfold) Path.
    Starting on the right path requires initially a little
    wisdom. Following the Path leads to the maturity of wisdom.
    The end of the Path is the full understanding of life as it
    is. With that understanding or wisdom, one has arrived at the
    Noble (Eightfold) Path, which means that cessation of
    conflict and disharmony is guaranteed. </p>
    <p>The first step on the Path to freedom of mind is to
    cleanse the mind from serious obstacles like aggressiveness,
    dishonesty, cruelty, envy, malevolence, greed etc., finding
    an outlet in one's verbal and physical conduct. Developing a
    clear distinction of what makes one's behaviour an obstacle
    and in which way one's conduct can become conducive to the
    development of insight (vipassanâ) needs that basic wisdom.
    To assist in solving the problems of discerning what is right
    and what is wrong conduct, the Buddha gave a frame-work of
    five essential moral principles to work upon. </p>
    <p>In a condensed form, they consist of the restraint from
    killing and harming, stealing, sensual misbehaviour, lying
    and from taking intoxicants like liquor and drugs. </p>
    <p>These basic moral principles are not meant to curb one's
    development in social life. On the contrary, they serve as an
    indispensable stepping-stone for any mental development in
    the social, psychological and spiritual context. Their
    efficacy, however, has much wider implications with regard to
    the progress of insight. </p>
    <p>The two aspects of the endeavour to purify one's conduct -
    to restrain from the bad and being engaged in doing good -
    cover the whole field of moral conduct. </p>
    <p>Surveying one's life, one can gauge oneself the disturbing
    effects of uncontrolled behaviour. One may question oneself
    whether it would be more preferable to accept these
    disturbances as something inevitable in one's life or to make
    a serious attempt to overcome them. </p>
    <p>The effort to overcome them is to develop more awareness,
    being alert when unwholesome thoughts have already arisen in
    the mind and to curb them. When the alertness is sharpened
    one comes to know how to prevent disturbing thoughts from
    arising. This exertion goes together with the development and
    maintenance of wholesome mental states which gradually will
    purify the mind from all agitation. </p>
    <p>Effort in this context, is another factor of the Eightfold
    Path which operates together with mindfulness and
    concentration to bring the mind to tranquillity and insight.
    Insight consists of right view and right thought. </p>
    <p>Someone who has reached the right (Eightfold) Path and
    follows it consequently is practising mental development
    which will lead one out of the endless fluctuations of
    happiness and unhappiness related to objects. It is with
    regard to objects that disturbances defile the mind and that
    people experience the short-lived moments of happiness. The
    happiness and inner peace that one can find at the ultimate
    end indispensable stepping-stone for any mental development
    in of the Path is not related to any object but is free from
    them. This happiness will not fade away. This is the
    attainment of the bliss of freedom from all conflict and
    disharmony, which is Nibbâna. </p>

    <h3><font color="#000080">2. An Outline of Vipassanâ
    Bhâvanâ</font></h3>
    <p>Vipassanâ-bhâvanâ means the mental development to see
    things as they really are. A Chinese saying goes: &quot;If
    you want to know about the pine, go to the pine.&quot; In
    order to see things as they really are, one has to examine
    them, not theoretically, but on the spot. That means, one
    starts to examine one's own body and mind by observing their
    processes at the moment that they are present. For this
    observation one needs awareness or mindfulness (sati). </p>
    <p>Another term, equivalent to vipassanâ, is satipaâna
    which means the establishing of mindfulness. Mindfulness is a
    bare necessity for the analytical examination of mind and
    body. It refers to a plain and impartial attentiveness to the
    object of observation, free from conceptual thinking.
    Mindfulness restricts itself to having that penetrative
    attentiveness of noting the occurrence and disappearance of a
    mental or bodily object (nâma-rupa) as it is. For instance,
    when there is the awareness of hearing, it is immediately
    noted as such. When the knowledge arises of what is heard,
    the mind marks just the fact of knowing and drops further
    interest because another process is already in the making. </p>
    <p>This, `letting go', not paying further interest is
    essential for the establishing of a sharp mindfulness. It
    enables one to follow precisely the arising and disappearing
    of all these processes. </p>
    <p>To understand what is mindfulness and to be able to apply
    it in the right way, one must make a clear distinction
    between the function of mindfulness and the normal attention
    people have, in their various activities. Mindfulness is not
    just a little bit more attention than one usually has. </p>
    <p>Attention (manasikâra), in its general meaning, is taking
    interest in an object, inspecting it with reference to past
    experiences and anticipating its future usefulness - `This is
    nice, l would like to have this.&quot; The knowledge that the
    object is nice is derived from a former experience. The wish
    to have or to keep it is related to the expectation that it
    will have the same pleasantness in future. On account of
    these habitual patterns of likes and dislikes one pays
    attention to objects in different degrees of intensity. </p>
    <p>Mindfulness is not discriminating the object. There is no
    attraction nor rejection. Mindfulness is only facing what is
    in the present moment without giving a specific emotional
    value to the object. Mindfulness deals only with the present
    moment, here and now. </p>
    <p>When one accurately notes the objects the very instant
    they occur and vanish, it will become clear that the moment
    which has just disappeared is definitely past. It can in no
    way be taken back. </p>
    <p>Though mindfulness has also the aspect of recollecting
    things that has been noted before, it does not cling to these
    things. Mindfulness does not allow things to be forgotten. It
    is therefore the opposite of superficiality. The future is
    that point-instant that will arise after the present moment.
    One is not able to predict what one's next thought moment
    will be. Therefore the future is uncertain. </p>
    <p>The specific characteristic of mindfulness is to remain in
    the present and not to float away from the object. The moment
    the mind starts to form ideas about what is noted earlier,
    mindfulness becomes weakened. Remaining in the present refers
    to the short moment of actual existence of an object when one
    experiences it. The lifespan of the experienced object is
    many times shorter than the time one needs to blink one's
    eyes. </p>
    <p>Frequently, recalling past situations or keeping oneself
    busy with the planning of future events gives rise to
    speculative thinking. This kind of thinking is merely based
    on hypotheses or on presumptions which can come true or not.
    It is only at the present moment that the intrinsic nature of
    things can become clear, free from imaginative thinking. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Do not get excited by what Is old, do not be contented
        with what is new. Do not grieve for what is lost, do not
        be controlled by desire.&quot; (Sutta Nipâta, 944) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It does not mean a rejection of thinking. People have to
    think and remember or to plan for the future in daily life.
    However one should bear in mind that every thought, whether
    it has a past or a future event as its object, is a
    present-moment-thought. Being mindful, one sees these
    thoughts for cannot be separated. They are found in all
    matter. what they are, fugitive moments in which no security
    can be found by merely assuming things will happen the way
    one expects it. </p>
    <p>The purifying effect of &quot;remaining in the
    present&quot; is that one is able to discern plainly how
    things that arise, fall away immediately, giving way to
    another phenomenon to arise. When one's noting is unflagging
    and sharp there is simply no room for thinking other than the
    noting thought. </p>
    <p>To make this mindful observing of bodily and mental
    processes more accurate and ongoing, it is necessary to take
    a basic subject of awareness (Kammaâna). The term Kammaâna
    means &quot;working-round&quot; which can be material or
    mental. </p>
    <p>The Buddha gave four basic working~rounds for the
    establishing of mindfulness. One of them is matter or
    corporeality (kâya), the other three are feeling (vedanâ),
    the mind (citta) and mental objects (dhammâ). </p>
    <p>The first one, bodily processes, are more easily to note
    as they are of a gross nature. For example, when one observes
    the expanding and contracting movement of the abdomen caused
    by in-and out-breathing, it is not difficult to feel and note
    these movements. Movement is one of the manifestations of
    matter (rupa). Hardness, softness, heat, cold, pressure etc.
    are apparent in the body and can be experienced. Every
    practising yogi, who is sitting motionless on a cushion for
    some time, will recognise these various experiences in the
    body. </p>
    <p>Bodily sensations are caused by what are called the four
    essential or primary elements (mahâ dhâtu) which together
    constitute matter. They are the element of solidity or
    extension (pathâvi dhâtu), the element of cohesion or
    fluidity (âpo dhâtu), the element of temperature (tejo
    dhâtu) and the element of motion (vâyo dhâtu). These four
    work together and cannot be separated. They are found in all
    matter. </p>
    <p>When the element of solidity is strong and dominant, it is
    felt as hardness. When the element of temperature takes the
    lead, one experiences heat. The element of motion manifests
    itself as movement. The element of cohesion is too subtle to
    be felt in the body. It keeps things together by which they
    have their shape. One can only know this element through
    comprehension. </p>
    <p>Taking the rising and falling movement of the abdomen, as
    one's working-ground, the element of motion (vâyo dhâtu) is
    made the basic subject of observation. Though motion is
    invariably present, it does not always play the dominant role
    in its co-operation with the other three. Sometimes feelings
    of heat manifest themselves more clearly than the motion and
    are accordingly noted. etc.. </p>
    <p>At times the yogi may become aware of unpleasant or
    pleasant feelings in the body. By noting these sensations the
    yogi temporarily leaves the basic subject of observation of
    the abdominal movement. At that moment of noting the yogi is
    no longer involved in the contemplation of the body
    (kâyânupassanâ) but has shifted to the mindful
    contemplation of feeling (vedanânupassanâ). </p>
    <p>Similarly one may, during the practice, become aware of
    the state of mind as distracted or without distraction,
    confused or not, cramped or relaxed etc. </p>
    <p>The yogi exercises that particular moment contemplation of
    mind (cittânupassanâ). Noting for instance the arising of
    sense-desires, worries, restlessness or the experience of joy
    and inner calm or one feels one's energy increasing etc., one
    is occupied for the time being with the contemplation of
    mental objects (dhammânupassanâ). </p>
    <p>In all the temporary shifts to various objects, the
    movement of the abdomen remains the basic point. After having
    observed and noted other phenomena, which are more dominant
    than the rising and falling of the abdomen, one returns to
    the basic subject. </p>
    <p>Accurate noting will bring about the knowledge just enough
    for remembering the event, preventing the mind to become
    involved in further elaborations of what occurred earlier. </p>
    <p>Thinking about the noted object means in fact that one
    moves away from seeing things as they really are. One should
    not try to analyse intellectually the experience during the
    practice. In that case the yogi misses the opportunity to
    note the occurence of other phenomena. </p>
    <p>When the continuous arising and disappearing of all these
    mental and physical processes become more evident, ideas of
    stableness, keeping and holding, become shaky. It will dawn
    upon the mindful observing yogi that in a constant flux of
    instantaneous changing (anicca) there is nothing that
    remains, nothing that is substantial which can be called a
    perceiver, a thinker, a doer or a feeler. No executive ruling
    self (atta) can be found therein. There are only variable
    occurrences which follow each other in a constant flow in
    which nothing is carried on from the past to the present and
    that can go to a future state. </p>
    <p>The tendency of people to keep and to cling is conflicting
    with the reality of incessant change (anicca) and being void
    of any substantiality (anatta). This is what the Buddha
    dubbed (dukkha) conflict, disharmony, unsatisfactoriness. </p>
    <p>Though still tender, the growing insight in the intrinsic
    nature of things as imperrnanent unsatisfactory and void of
    self (anicca, dukkha, anatta) is important in the sense that
    it seriously weakens the obstructive factors of one's
    practice like excessive craving for sense~impressions, anger,
    laziness, restlessness and doubt etc. As long as these
    obstructions are frequently present in the mind, mindfulness
    and concentration will be deterred. </p>
    <p>Mindfulness and concentration work together to establish
    another important factor for the practice, namely clear
    comprehension (sampajanna). Clear comprehension enables one
    to understand immediately what is noticed. It is the
    knowledge that arises on account of sharp noticing and gives
    as it were an extra dimension to what is seen, free from
    intellectual pondering. Mindfulness is like a beam of light
    that illuminates the object when it is present and clear
    comprehension sees it as it is according to its
    characteristic. </p>
    <p>The type of concentration used in vipassanâ bhâvanâ
    functions as a strong support for the on-going mindfulness.
    It has therefore the same characteristic of mornentariness.
    Momentary concentration (khaika samâdhi) is able to follow
    together with mindfulness the arising and vanishing of
    objects by maintainig a constant degree of intensity. This
    type of concentration has the strength to subdue the
    obstructions, facilitating mindfulness to be sharp and
    continuous. </p>
    <p>Sometimes it may happen that the concentrating loses its
    momentariness and becomes too deep for its function in the
    vipassanâ practice. The concentration becomes fixed and
    `immovable' and the mind is at that time only interested in
    just one object. This may occur when the yogi meets with
    extremely pleasant sensations, like experiencing a deep joy
    or feeling lightness in the body, etc. Being enticed by the
    pleantness, one forgets to note and to `let it go'. The mind
    grasps at the agreeable experience and want to enjoy it for
    some time. Such an experience may bring the yogi to the wrong
    conclusion that he or she has reached a certain stage of
    insight which is an impediment for further progress. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left">&quot;Whatever one may understand
        inwardly and outwardly, one has to avoid becoming proud
        of one's conveinctions. For the wise have said that this
        is not the state of calm&quot; (Sutta Nipâta 917) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It will be evident, as is said earlier, that it is
    important to keep a sharp alertness in all situations and not
    to grasp at any object., pleasant or unpleasant. The keynote
    of the practice of vipassanâ is to protect one's
    mindfulness. Then mindfulness will protect the yogi against
    wrong view and confusion about what is real or not. </p>
    <p>The effect of a more established mindfulness will be felt
    in all activities. The five aspects which give mindfulness
    its specific significance for the vipassanâ practice will
    become gradually a natural habit. They are: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Its function to notice the moment of occurrence of an
            object; </li>
        <li>The impartial character of mindfulness; </li>
        <li>The ability to slow down one's activities which gives
            one the opportunity to observe accurately; </li>
        <li>To keep the mind focused on the present supported by
            momentary concentration (khaika samâdi); </li>
        <li>The arising of clear comprehension as an effect of
            constant alertness. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In case disturbances arise in the mind, one is able to
    meet them with more calm than one could do previously. One
    can easily let it go, before the commotion becomes too
    overwhelming. </p>
    <p>The mind tends to become more pliant and it will be easy
    to remain in the present. Habitual programmings in the mind
    lose their strong grip due to the increasing insight that the
    past is definitely past. </p>
    <p>Owing to wrong view, the relation between cause and effect
    is mainly rather vague. This leads often to wrong
    conclusions. More understanding of what is in the present
    will engender a cautiousness in one's behaviour, realising
    that new causes, with their future effects, are created in
    the present. By missing the moment here and now, dreaming
    away, following ideas, it may result in embarrassing
    situations if things turn out to be quite different from that
    which one has banked on. No external agency or situation can
    be blamed for the self-created effects of one's deeds and
    one's reaction when one is confronted with their results. </p>
    <p>In the practice of vipassanâ, through noting an clear
    comprehension, one will gradually understand how these
    conditions are coming into being in oneself and how they, in
    turn, are forming new conditions for the arising of other
    mental and bodily processes. </p>
    <p>The emotional value of tenacious habits in the mind which
    are based on specific ideas about persons and things,
    including one's own functioning will become abated. Things
    become obscure and confusing when one's own reaction to them
    and their emotional import are not rightly understood. </p>
    <p>It is not in the contact of the eye with the visible
    object or of the ear with the audible object etc. itself,
    that the pleasantness or unpleasantness is present. In that
    case it will be difficult to become enlightened, because one
    cannot close one's eyes and ears etc. It is the way the mind
    picks it up as nutriment for its own activities, by making a
    distinction between things as agreeable or not. </p>
    <p>Just by going to the pine and examining it closely, one
    will learn more about the pine, similarly, the investigation
    of mind (nâma) and matter (rupa) will reveal something more
    about their intrinsic nature. That knowledge enables one to
    see things as they really are, which means that one has come
    to right view or wisdom (pannâ). </p>

    <h3><font color="#000080">3. The Vipassanâ Practice and
    Daily Life Situations </font></h3>
    <p>PEOPLE often think that vipassanâ bhânanâ is limited to
    sitting on a cushion for some hours, mindfully watching the
    rising and falling movements of the abdomen together with
    being alert in the walking exercises. However, when one
    leaves the mindfulness behind on the meditation cushion after
    returning to daily life activities, it will bring about but a
    little result with regard to the attainment of any
    insight-knowledge. </p>
    <p>Vipassanâ is in fact not a part-time activity. Mental
    development cannot be done effectively when one confines
    oneself to only the actual meditation sessions and one, in
    the remaining time, forgets to be mindful. The mindfulness
    developed in a retreat or in the daily sessions might have
    its effect for some time afterwards, but if it is neglected
    in other activities it will quickly wither away. Becoming
    absent-minded again, one will soon lapse into one's old
    habitual patterns of thought. </p>
    <p>It goes without saying that in daily life situations, one
    cannot apply minclfulness with the same acuity as in the
    actual practice. But when mindfulness is consequently
    maintained, even at a more superficial level, it will have
    its benefits for both one's attitude in social life and in
    the practice itself. </p>
    <p>Cultivating the habit of doing things mindfully in normal
    work-a-day situations has also its effect on the meditative
    practice in the sense that concentration and mindfulness are
    already present to a certain extent and can easily be
    developed to a deeper level necessary for a sharp and
    unbroken noting. By keeping the mindfulness at all levels
    on-going, the obstructive factors are prevented from becoming
    overpowering in daily situations too. </p>
    <p>The advantage of guarding mindfulness in one's daily life
    is that one becomes less forgetful. It means not wasting
    one's time and energy looking for things that are put down
    somewhere thoughtlessly or not remembering things at the
    moment one needs to know them, because of a lack of
    attentiveness. There are numerous instances in which one
    finds oneself in a quandary because one was unmindful. </p>
    <p>Being mindful in all activities prevents unnecessary
    irritation to arise, because one is fully aware of what one
    has done earlier. Verbal and physical behaviour will become
    more well~imposed. </p>
    <p>Another benefit of being mindful is that less mistakes
    will be made. One is sharply aware of what one is doing, not
    allowing oneself to dream away or to try to do various things
    in the shortest time possible. That little time extra that
    one gives oneself in being mindful and to do just one thing
    at a time, will work out to be more efficient. It often takes
    more time to restore one's mistakes than the time one needs
    to do things fully alert. </p>
    <p>There are circumstances in which one can hardly be alert.
    They are called the direct enemies of mindfulness. The first
    opponent is one's uncontrolled bodily movements. For example,
    roaring with laughter, giving vent to one's pleasurable mood
    by slapping another person's back, can certainly not be
    considered as a mindful act. Arahats, who are always mindful
    and experience happiness, only smile. </p>
    <p>People tend to make in their verbal and physical
    activities a lot of unnecessary gestures of which they are
    hardly aware. </p>
    <p>Another imminent danger to mindfulness is the unbridled
    stream of sense-impressions people `swallow' daily. They
    provide daily nutriment for unwholesome states of mind. The
    mind certainly has wholesome states too which arise on
    account of sense-impressions like the compassion one may have
    when seeing the suffering of others. However, thoughts that
    are rooted in attachment, anger and delusion mainly outnumber
    the ones based on, for instance, thoughts of impartial
    friendliness, benevolence and wisdom. Guarding the sense
    doors and being more selective in the intake of sense-data
    will not only sharpen the mindfulness but it also curbs one's
    habitual emotional reaction to them. </p>
    <p>The third enemy is one's passions. States of mind related
    to anger, greed and confusion are closely associated with the
    arising of emotions. Emotions have the tendency to become
    overwhelming when they are not curtailed by mindfulness. They
    are mainly based on a clouded view on reality with the strong
    inclination to self-centred interest i.e. &quot;my
    experience&quot;, &quot;I am hurt&quot;, etc. </p>
    <p>To maintain mindfulness as much as possible in daily life,
    one needs to be selective in order to protect oneself against
    these hazards and to be steadfast in noting whenever one is
    able to do it. It will be helpful to have regular contact
    with persons who practise mindfulness themselves and who are
    advanced in vipassanâ bhâvanâ. </p>
    <p>Though it cannot always be prevented one should avoid
    close contact with persons who show no interest in the
    practice or who do not see the benefit of mental development.
    However, it does not mean that one should consider these
    persons as potential enemies to one's practice. The only
    thing one has to do is to protect one's own state of mind
    rather than having ideas about others. When one can share
    good experiences with others, with regard to the benefits the
    development of mindfulness has for one's life, one should do
    it at any time. </p>
    <p>With the inclination to establish mindfulness it will come
    naturally and will gradually become a habit. </p>
    <p>The development of bare attention or mindfulness (sail) is
    instrumental in terminating inner conflict (dukkha) and
    disharmony in one's life. It is not an end in itself. </p>
    <p>In this context, it will be useful to realize that every
    time there is sharp noting, dukkha cannot arise at that
    specific moment, because there is no room left between the
    moments of sharp noting of mental and bodily events. The
    efficacy of mindfulness is the gradual fading away of
    attachment which is the cause of dukkha. </p>
    <p>People often consider attachment an indispensable
    ingredient of social life. In a way they are right. It is
    because of attachment that people start family life or a
    certain career. It is however, also on account of attachment
    that there is a lot of conflict in the social contacts people
    have. There is, in fact, nothing against attachment but one
    should realise that it has its consequences - dukkha. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, it is also possible that people develop
    a genuine concern for each other with impartial friendliness
    (mettâ) and compassion (karunâ) or that they are rejoicing
    at other's success and happiness (muditâ). These high
    qualities of mind can only come to their full scope when they
    are not hampered by attachment. Their effect will be a
    tranquil mind free from preferences. Attachment makes people
    prejudiced and partial. </p>
    <p>Well-applied mindfulness leading to the profound
    understanding of the fugitive nature of all phenomena
    (anicca), reveals the opposite character of attachment.
    Because attachment means holding on, clinging to, it causes
    dukkha. When one has done away with attachment, one is
    consequently free from dukkha. That does not imply that one
    becomes indifferent in a hedonic way. Knowing oneself what
    dukkha' is in one's life and becoming gradually free from it,
    one will have compassion towards oneself and others as well,
    considering the fearful position of being in the endless
    cycle of becoming. Having made the mind free from all states
    of defilements, one will be able to help others more
    effectively, apart from self-interest which has a close
    relationship with attachment. </p>

    <h3><font color="#000080">4. Practical Guidelines for
    Vipassanâ</font></h3>
    <p>FOR the yogi it is important to know the instructions for
    vipassanâ bhâvanâ thoroughly and to apply them correctly.
    Though there are a number of different methods of vipassanâ,
    they all aim at the development of insight and wisdom by
    observing mental and physical processes (nâma-r&#150;pa). To
    climb a mountain, one can make use of different possibilities
    and techniques to come at the top. All who start climbing,
    want in one or another way to reach the summit. </p>
    <p>If one starts with one method, it is not advisable to
    combine it with other instructions or to mix different
    methods together. This will certainly lead to confusion which
    is opposite to the aim of vipassanâ namely to reach
    non-confusion or wisdom. Before embarking on the practice of
    vipassanâ the yogi should take the following points into
    consideration. One should be aware whether one's own purpose
    to start the practice is according to the aim of vipassanâ.
    The yogi should realise that the practice of vipassanâ
    demands a certain `fighting spirit' in the sense of not
    giving up too easily. The yogi can be compared to a warrior
    going to the battlefield to conquer defilements, i.e. dukkha
    in all its manifestations and hidden forms. It requires a
    transparent honesty towards oneself. One has to be courageous
    and not too proud to admit less pleasant things in oneself
    and there should be a willingness to work on them. </p>
    <p>In any battle one needs also some rest to regain strength.
    One should avoid over-stressing. It will have more effect
    when one makes the mind calm and well-equipped by way of
    developing concentration and mindfulness gradually. Without
    patience and self-acceptance, the practice will become
    ill-balanced. Self-acceptance means to take oneself as one is
    at the specific moment as a starting point to work on it.
    Ideas about oneself, what one should be or should not be, are
    an obstacle for progress and are certainly not a result of
    keen insight. </p>
    <p>Starting the practice, one should wear. loose clothes,
    covering the body property. During a retreat one should put
    one's things in the kuti or room in order and conveniently
    arranged. In that case one does not have to waste time and
    energy searching for things. One should only bring the most
    necessary things. books and writing-paper should not be used.
    </p>
    <p>From the beginning of a retreat one should make an effort
    to slow down in all activities and to keep strict silence.
    Talking is a considerable hindrance for one who is practising
    vipassanâ intensively. </p>
    <p><a name="chap5"></a></p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">5. The Sitting Position</font></h3>
    <p>IT is important to give some attention to one's posture
    first. One should sit crossed-legged on a small cushion on a
    mat or cloth (both legs placed on the floor in full or half
    lotus position). The knees must touch the floor, the back
    straight, the upper arms hanging straight down. The hands are
    resting on the lap, the right hand upon the left, the palms
    turned upwards, the thumbs touching each other lightly. </p>
    <p>The face should be relaxed, the eyes and mouth closed. </p>
    <p>In order to relax the body one may take three times a deep
    in-breath and let the breath come out slowly. Subsequently
    one directs the attention slowly to that part of the body
    which is called abdomen. </p>
    <p>When the movement of the abdomen can be felt clearly, one
    starts to observe it by taking mental note according to what
    one discerns. If one is aware of a rising movement, one
    notices it accordingly with `rising' as many times as one is
    aware of rising. When the movement is experienced as going
    down one notes `falling' in the same way. It is not advisable
    to try to visualize the particular part of the body or to
    look at it. If the movement is not clear, one may put the
    hands lightly on the abdomen and registrate the movement in
    this way. </p>
    <p>In the beginning it is preferable not to pay attention to
    other objects unless they become too dominant to ignore them.
    For example, when there is a sensation of pain, one takes
    mental note `pain' a few times. Without paying further
    interest one returns to the initial meditation subject, that
    is the movement of the abdomen. lithe pain is persistent, one
    repeats this. One should not allow oneself to change one's
    position. Only in case the pain becomes unbearable, one can
    take the decision to move. Doing that mindfully, one observes
    all changes which take place in the body and the mind as
    well. </p>
    <p>One should not start with taking mental note of other
    phenomena before the awareness of the rising and falling
    movement of the abdomen is quite clear and can be watched for
    some time without a break. lithe mindfulness becomes sharper
    all other events in body and mind that are more prominent
    than the rise and fall of the abdomen, should be noted
    accordingly. After noting them one returns to the basic
    subject if there is no other object to take note of. </p>
    <p>While one is noting, it is important to know what is
    noted. In order to get that knowledge the yogi `labels' that
    what is arising and is noted. It means that one mentally
    labels or names, the object of awareness according to its
    nature, like `thinking' the moment one is aware of thinking.
    In the same way one may note hearing, smelling, heat, pain,
    itching, etc. when they become objects of awareness. This
    labeling must be kept short, without giving the object more
    attention than necessary for knowing it. In case one does not
    know how to classify an object, one just lets it go taking
    further mental note of the following objects. </p>
    <p><a name="chap6"></a></p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">6. The Walking Practice</font></h3>
    <p>THOUGH walking in the practice does not get so much
    attention compared to the sitting posture, it is of equal
    importance. One should practise walking and sitting alike. In
    both it is the element of motion (vâyo dhâtu) that is the
    object of awareness though in a different `setting'. </p>
    <p>When the yogi decides to do the walking practice, he or
    she mindfully changes the posture from sitting via pushing up
    the body to the posture of standing. The standing position
    deserves as much mindful attention as all other postures. One
    should take the time to observe movement in standing as well.
    Gradually one directs the attention to that part of the body
    on which one is standing, namely the feet. When starting with
    walking, one notices the various movements as lifting,
    pushing forwards, going down and pressing etc. </p>
    <p>In the beginning of the walking practice one can walk a
    little bit more slowly than one's normal tempo, noting the
    steps, right, left. Gradually one should slowdown the
    movement and walk as slowly as possible. This gives one the
    opportunity to observe more mindfully the different processes
    in walking. </p>
    <p>During the walking one should not let the eyes wander
    around but keep the eyes half closed looking at the floor in
    front. When the end of the walking-path is reached, one
    notices `standing' again before starting to turn around. One
    may turn slowly in three times, carefully noting the things
    of which one becomes aware. After having adopted the standing
    posture, one starts walking again. </p>
    <p>When there are distracting thoughts, one should stop
    walking, no matter in which position one is, whether the foot
    is lifted or not. One brings the attention back to the actual
    and continues the walking. When one wants to resume the
    sitting posture, one goes slowly back to one's seat and sits
    down mindfully, noting whatever is clearly discerned. </p>
    <p>In all other activities, like eating, drinking, chewing,
    swallowing, washing oneself, dressing, lying down etc. one
    should be steadfast in noting them, not allowing the mind to
    wander around or to lapse into fantasies etc. </p>
    <p>When one is able to get a bit more insight into one's own
    functioning during a retreat, it will be more easy to
    maintain mindfulness in daily life situations too. Mindfully
    noting and slowing down one's activities are both
    indispensable for the practice of vipassanâ. </p>
    <p><a name="chap7"></a></p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">7. A Few Points to Keep in Mind</font></h3>
    <p>IT should be remembered that in the vipassanâ practice
    all phenomena are just noted without giving any value to them
    in the sense of good or bad, with regard to their being
    preferable or not. They are just present for a brief moment
    and vanish immediately. One should try to be aware of those
    particular moments of arising and vanishing of objects. </p>
    <p>When the word investigation or examining is used, these
    terms stand merely for the open-mindedness with which one is
    able to discern things in their true nature and to understand
    them in the right way. When one, for instance, is aware of
    distracting thought, one may, with clear comprehension,
    recognise immediately whether the thought is rooted in
    craving, anger or that it has arisen because of confusion.
    When mindfulness is sharp and clear comprehension present, it
    takes no time to come to that knowledge. </p>
    <p>The yogi should bear in mind that there is in fact no
    &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; meditation. There should
    be just the right effort to see mindful- what is in present
    in body and mind. Any idea about `my practice' is based on
    conceptual thinking associated with self-centeredness. </p>
    <p>In order to come to a profound understanding of the
    intrinsic nature of things, including one's own life, one
    should develop the establishing of mindfulness with, great
    endeavour. To become free from inner conflict, not causing
    contention and disturbance is really understanding one's
    responsibility in life. </p>
    <p>Because one lives, one has the responsibility to do
    something with this life with regard to one's own inner
    development as well as in the social context. Every serious
    attempt to make an end of all conflict (dukkha) in one self
    is in fact the best social attitude one can have. </p>
    <p>One who has overcome conflict and disharmony in one's own
    life will not create any trouble for others too. Such a
    person is a happy one. </p>
