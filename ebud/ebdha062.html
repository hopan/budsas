  <p align="center"><i><b>A lecture delivered in January 2529/1986 at the Fourth
  International Congress of <br>
  the World Buddhist Sangha Council, held at&nbsp; Buddha's Light Vihara, Bangkok</b></i></p>
  <p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">A</font><font FACE="Times New Roman">s we
  all know well, two months after the Enlightenment, on the full moon of the eighth lunar
  month, the Buddha preached his First Sermon at the Deer Park in Isipatana. The First
  Sermon is called the <em>Dhammacakkappavattana-Sutta</em> or the Setting in Motion of the
  Wheel of the Dhamma. On hearing this, Kondanna, one of the five ascetics who had waited
  upon the Bodhisatta when he was practicing self-mortification, gained the Eye of Truth (<em>Dhamma-cakkhu</em>),
  or the Wisdom Eye, as a first glimpse of <em>Nibbana</em>. Kondanna asked the Buddha for
  ordination and was admitted as a Bhikkhu, becoming the first member of the Sangha, or the
  Buddhist Order of monks. He is thus generally known as the Buddha's <em>First Disciple</em>.
  As until that time there had appeared in the world only the Buddha and the Dhamma, this
  event marks the completion of the Triple Gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.</p>
  <p>What should be noted here is the arising of the Sangha. Strictly speaking, it was the
  arising of the first member of the Sangha. That is, Kondanna, who since then became known
  as Annakondanna, was the first man to see the Truth after the Buddha and also the first to
  be admitted as a Bhikkhu.</p>
  <p><font COLOR="#000080"><strong>Two Kinds of Sangha</strong></font></p>
  <p>The term Sangha means an assembly or a community. Here again, two kinds of Sangha
  should be distinguished, namely, the <em>Savaka-Sangha</em>, or the community of (noble)
  disciples, and the <em>Bhikkhu-Sangha</em>, or the community of Bhikkhus or monks. The
  former is also called the <em>Ariya-Sangha</em>, or the Noble Sangha (community of Noble
  or Truly-Civilized Ones), while the latter is also named the <em>Sammati-Sangha</em>, or
  the conventional Sangha. The Noble Sangha of truly civilized people is formed of four
  types of persons, who are at four different stages of development, or levels of insight
  into the Truth. The Conventional Sangha of Bhikkhus, on the other hand, simply consists of
  four or more monks.</p>
  <p>When Kondanna gained the Eye of Truth, he became the first member of the Noble Sangha.
  When he was ordained a Bhikkhu, he became the first member of the Conventional Sangha.
  Thus, the event of the First Sermon marks the beginning both of the Noble Sangha of
  disciples and of the Conventional Sangha of monks.</p>
  <p>The four types of persons who form the Noble Sangha are the <em>Sotapanna</em> or
  Stream-Enterers (those who have entered the stream leading to Nibbana), the <em>Sakadagami</em>
  or Once-Returners (those who will return only once more to the vicissitudes of this
  world), the <em>Anagami</em> or Non-Returners (those who will never come again to the
  dubious conditions of this world), and the <em>Arahants</em> or Worthy Ones (those who
  have achieved the ideal of perfection and attained to the goal of Nibbana).</p>
  <p>The Sotapanna has achieved perfection in morality and has abandoned the three fetters
  of self-illusion, uncertainty and clinging to mere rules and ritual. The Sakadagami has in
  addition mitigated lust, hatred and delusion. The Anagami has achieved perfection in
  mental discipline and further eradicated the fetters of sensual lust and ill will. The
  Arahant has achieved perfection in wisdom and put an end to five more fetters, namely,
  attachment to fine-material existence, attachment to immaterial existence, conceit,
  restlessness and ignorance.</p>
  <p><strong><font COLOR="#000080">The Monastic Sangha and the Creation of the Noble Sangha</font><br>
  </strong><br>
  Obviously, it is the purpose of the Buddha, in his conduct for the well-being of the
  world, to teach all people to progress along these lines of development to become
  Sotapanna, Sakadagami, Anagami and Arahants. In other words, he wants them to be members
  of the Noble Sangha. The ideal is surely to turn the world into a community of noble or
  truly civilized people. To achieve this, however, a sound concrete organization is needed,
  and it is for this reason that the Conventional Sangha of monks was founded. Truly, the
  Sangha of monks or Bhikkhu-Sangha has been vested with the main function of teaching all
  people, regardless of caste, class, sex and nationality, the Dhamma that will help them in
  their self-development to become <em>Ariya</em> or <em>Arya</em> (noble or truly
  civilized). The monks thus lead the people in creating the universal community of noble,
  enlightened and truly civilized people.</p>
  <p>Even when the Bhikkhu-Sangha had been newly established, and it was then a very small
  community consisting of only sixty monks, the Buddha sent all of its members in all
  directions to propagate the Dhamma. The community was then only three months old. Here,
  the spirit of acting for the good of the people is strongly evident. The words of the
  Buddha in sending out his disciples at that time reflect very well the ideal of erecting
  the world Noble Sangha. In the Buddha's own words (Vin.I.21):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>&quot;Go forth, O Bhikkhus, for the good of the many, for the happiness of the
    many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, for the good, for the happiness of
    gods and men.&quot;</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In short, the Sangha of monks or Bhikkhu-Sangha has been set up, both as the instrument
  and as the starting point and the stronghold, for working out the idea of establishing the
  universal Sangha of Dhammically civilized people. The main function of this conventional
  Sangha is, as mentioned earlier, to expound the Dhamma and spread it far and wide, in such
  a way that the common people may understand and practice it, developing themselves in
  their progress along the path of being Ariya (noble or Dhammically civilized) and thus
  joining the Noble Sangha or civilized world community. In the meantime, however, the
  Sangha of monks also plays a number of significant roles, some central and some interim
  and peripheral, such as:</p>
  <p>As, especially at the beginning, the conditions in the surrounding world are not
  favourable to the ideal life, the Bhikkhu-Sangha serves as the suitable setting in which
  zealous members can energetically live their chosen way of life and leading members can
  actively lead others.</p>
  <p>The Bhikkhu-Sangha serves as the core and leading part of the prospective Noble Sangha.
  By leading exemplary noble lives, the monks exercise their influence on the common people
  in treading the noble path towards the goal of joining the Noble Sangha.</p>
  <p>The Bhikkhu-Sangha also serves as the centre for training both those who join it and
  the common people, to turn them into members, or make them more prepared to be members, of
  the Noble Sangha.</p>
  <p><font COLOR="#000080"><strong>Foundations of the Sangha</strong></font></p>
  <p>In the Buddha's time, Buddhism was usually called, &quot;This Dhamma-Vinaya&quot; (the
  Doctrine and the Discipline). This means that the <em>Dhamma-Vinaya</em> is another name,
  actually the original name, for Buddhism. It also indicates that the Dhamma and the Vinaya
  are the two limbs that form Buddhism. This concept is in direct connection with the two
  kinds of Sangha.</p>
  <p>The Conventional Sangha of monks depends for its existence and stability on the Vinaya.
  It is the Vinaya that gives life to the Bhikkhu-Sangha. A person is ordained a Bhikkhu or
  is admitted to the Sangha of monks in accordance with the rules of the Vinaya. His
  Bhikkhuship also ceases if he makes an incurable transgression against the Vinaya. The
  rules of the Vinaya govern all activities of the community of monks and all aspects of a
  Bhikkhu's life. Monks or Bhikkhus are graded according to concrete disciplinary rules. A
  Bhikkhu is classed as a <em>Navaka</em>, or a newly ordained one, if he has been admitted
  to the Order for not more than five years, and he is required to live in
  &quot;Nissaya,&quot; or dependence, on an Acariya or teacher, that is, he is a dependent.
  As soon as his years of standing in the monkhood exceed five, he becomes freed of the
  Dependence and is classed as a <em>Nissaya-Muttaka</em>, or an independent monk. When he
  completes ten years of standing in the monkhood, he becomes a <em>Thera</em> or an Elder.
  Now, if he is qualified, he can act as an Upajjhaya or a preceptor. Rights and privileges
  are vested on the Bhikkhus on equal terms according to the rules of the Vinaya.</p>
  <p>The Noble Sangha of disciples, on the other hand, is based on the Dhamma. While the
  Vinaya governs the external life of a monk, his bodily and verbal activities and his
  social relations with others, his inner and spiritual side is guided by the Dhamma. Not
  only the monks, but all people are expected to follow the guidance of the Dhamma. In
  contrast to the formal admittance to membership in the conventional Sangha of monks,
  membership in the Noble Sangha of disciples is a matter of self-development and inner
  attainment. As soon as a person, whether a monk or a layman, realizes the Four Noble
  Truths and gains a first vision of Nibbana, he automatically becomes a Sotapanna and,
  simultaneously, a member of the Noble Sangha of disciples. His further progress on the
  path up to the final goal is graded solely according to the degree of his self-development
  and inner attainment, without the intervention of any external factors, whether age, sex,
  authority or even time or space. Thus, a novice twelve years of age may be an Arahant
  while an aged monk seventy years old may be only a worldling, not attaining even
  Sotapannaship, and a wise layman may achieve Arahantship in a period of an hour while many
  monks may strive in vain throughout their lives to secure the same. As the Buddha says in
  the Dhammapada: He who, though dressed in fine apparel, exercises tranquility, is calm,
  controlled, certain and chaste and has ceased to injure all other beings, he indeed is a
  Brahman, a Samana, a Bhikkhu. (Dh.142)</p>
  <p>Though the treading of the path of self-development and inner attainment is a personal
  task, the treader is not all alone or helpless. Besides the Great Teacher, the Buddha, who
  shows him the Way and equips him with the tools, the conventional Sangha of monks, as
  regulated by the Vinaya, provides him with <em>Kalyanamitta</em>, or good spiritual
  friends, who will counsel and encourage him along the Way, with a way of life and living
  conditions that are advantageous to his endeavor. In particular, those members of the
  Noble Sangha who are far advanced on the Path or have reached the summit, will find the
  Bhikkhu-Sangha the best community for them to live in, and it is these people who will
  best preserve the conventional Sangha of monks and will act as Kalyanamitta, or good
  spiritual friends, to those who are treading the Path after them.</p>
  <p>In short, the two kinds of the Sangha are reciprocally helpful and complementary in the
  realization of Buddhist ideals. Without the will and effort to join or to maintain the
  Noble Sangha of disciples, the conventional Sangha of monks is meaningless or, at least,
  strays away from the ideal set up by its Founder, the Buddha. Without a concrete
  organization like the Bhikkhu-Sangha as the tool, the task of establishing and maintaining
  the Ariya-Sangha of disciples would be very difficult, if not an impossibility.</p>
  <p><font COLOR="#000080"><strong>The Real Mission of the Sangha</strong></font></p>
  <p>There is no doubt that peace and freedom are the supreme goals of Buddhism. Both of
  them are synonyms of Nibbana or Nirvana. Peace can be realized, and freedom can be
  achieved, if the Sangha of monks exerts itself unfalteringly to maintain and universalize
  the Noble Sangha of disciples.</p>
  <p>Freedom is threefold or can be distinguished at three levels. First, people should
  enjoy the basic freedom of life in absence of the fundamental insecurities and dangers
  that threaten their existence, such as poverty, diseases and calamities like drought and
  famine. Without the minimum of this basic freedom, no one can proceed to enjoy any other
  more sublime freedom. At the second level is social freedom, in absence of human
  oppression and exploitation. Included here are tolerance, friendliness and benevolence.
  With the lack of this freedom, not to speak of the final freedom, even the basic freedom
  will never be realized or, if the latter has been prevailing, it will surely be lost. The
  third and last is the final freedom of man's inner life, that is, freedom from mental
  suffering and from the greed, hatred and delusion that corrupt the mind and cause people
  to commit all kinds of evils. With the achievement of this level of freedom, real
  happiness can be attained to and social freedom can be assured. It is also the firm
  foundation on which to work out any plan or program to overcome the basic insecurities and
  dangers of life, as otherwise people with corrupted mind will ever increase those dangers
  and insecurities.</p>
  <p>In another classification, freedom is said to be fourfold. There, the final inner or
  individual freedom is divided into the two levels of emotional freedom, or freedom of the
  heart, and intellectual freedom, or freedom of wisdom through true knowledge. The four
  levels of freedom are thus distinguished as basic physical freedom, social freedom,
  emotional freedom and intellectual freedom.</p>
  <p>By teaching and encouraging people to realize the three graded goals and the three
  phases of good as enunciated by the Buddha, the Sangha of monks works both directly and
  indirectly to achieve the threefold freedom.</p>
  <p><strong><em>The three graded goals are:</em></strong></p>
  <p>1. Benefits for the present or temporal welfare, called in Pali <em>Ditthadhammikattha</em>,
  represented by wealth, sufficiency of food and other necessities of life, health and other
  aspects of physical well-being, which can be ascertained by hard work, diligence, good
  management, cooperation, economical living and non-negligence in any way.</p>
  <p>2. Benefits for the future, or spiritual welfare, called in Pali <em>Samparayikattha</em>,
  as ensured by confidence in and devotion to the ways of the good, morality, benevolence,
  wisdom and other virtues.</p>
  <p>3. The supreme benefit or the highest good, called in Pali <em>Paramattha</em>,
  consisting in having a mind that is clean and clear, happy and secure, undefiled by greed,
  hatred and delusion, and unshaken by worldly vicissitudes, that is to say, the final
  freedom of Nibbana.</p>
  <p><strong><em>The three phases of good are:</em></strong></p>
  <p>1. The good of one's own or one's own welfare, <em>Attattha</em>, which points to the
  above three graded goals as realized by oneself.</p>
  <p>2. The good of others or others' welfare, <em>Parattha</em>, referring to the same set
  of three goals which one should guide or help others to attain.</p>
  <p>3. The common good or welfare both of oneself and others, <em>Ubhayattha</em>,
  identified with the same set of three graded goals as far as they should be shared by all
  concerned, ranging from public utilities and favourable environment to peace and happiness
  of the mind.</p>
  <p>The first two graded goals secure for all people freedom from the basic miseries and
  insecurities of life and freedom from social abuses such as aggression, crime, oppression
  and exploitation. People who are endowed with these two grades of freedom are in a good
  position or are better prepared to aspire to the highest good and to enjoy the final
  freedom. By conducting oneself towards the realization of the final freedom, one comes to
  join the Noble Sangha of disciples. Those who enjoy the final freedom will ever fortify
  and strengthen the first two grades of freedom, as the final freedom is a guarantee of the
  maintenance of the latter. Moreover, the practices along the line of realizing the three
  phases of good even furthermore reinforce the establishment of the three grades of
  freedom.</p>
  <p>All in all, it is the mission of the Sangha of monks to work for the prevailing of the
  three graded goals and the three phases of good, for the realization of the three levels
  of freedom and thus, ideally, for the establishment and perpetuation of the Noble Sangha
  of disciples.</p>
  <p>Not unlike freedom, peace should be classified. Peace is of two kinds, one is external
  and the other, internal. External peace is usually social. It is freedom from strife,
  dissension, quarrelling, commotion, violence, disorder and, on the largest scale, war.
  Internal peace is the inner peace of mind or spiritual peace. It is a state of freedom
  from fear, anxiety, annoyance, distraction, obsession and, on the minutest scale, from all
  traces of mental suffering and defilement. It is obvious that without freedom, there can
  be no peace. Once freedom is secured, peace is attained to.</p>
  <p>As with freedom, the Sangha has much to do with both external and internal peace. The
  Sangha of monks paves the way through external peace to the inner peace of the final
  freedom and, once the Noble Sangha is established with this inner peace, a firm foundation
  has been laid on which the external social peace will rest securely and lastingly.</p>
  <p><font COLOR="#000080"><strong>Evolution of the Monastic Sangha</strong></font></p>
  <p>The importance of the conventional Sangha of monks as the principal agent for expanding
  and perpetuating the Noble Sangha of disciples has been realized throughout the long
  history of Buddhism. Thus, a small Sangha of monks was dispatched to foreign lands or
  distant places to spread Buddhism. Often, only one monk or a group of two or three monks
  were sent out to do this task and the monk or the group had to depend on local men to
  believe and ordain before a local Sangha of monks could be established.</p>
  <p>In the early periods, especially at the beginning of the career of the Buddha, the
  members of the Sangha of monks were also <em>Ariya</em>, or members of the Noble Sangha.
  Their mission, therefore, turned only outward to increase the membership in the Noble
  Sangha and to receive those who were willing and prepared into the monastic Sangha. As
  time went on and the monastic Sangha became greatly enlarged, the number of members of the
  monastic Sangha who were not yet entitled to the membership in the Noble Sangha increased.
  The monastic Sangha then functioned more and more as the centre for training the
  unenlightened members, and the energy of the leaders in the monastic Sangha had to be
  divided between the inside and outside of the monasteries, sometimes too much on the
  inside, to the neglect of mission for the benefit of the outside. However, generally
  speaking, once a monastic Sangha has been established in a land, Buddhism is established
  there.</p>
  <p>The different monastic Sanghas in different lands and countries lived and worked in
  different surroundings and among peoples of different cultures. With the passing of time,
  throughout the centuries, they developed some new roles and traditions of their own which
  were local. Some of these roles and traditions developed even at the expense of the
  original fundamental function of perpetuating the Noble Sangha of disciples. In spite of
  all local differences, however, the Vinaya keeps the various local monastic Sanghas,
  although geographically far apart, not too dissimilar to one another.</p>
  <p>It is impossible to treat here of all the monastic Sanghas in so many different
  countries. As the Thai Sangha of today is said to be the largest monastic community in the
  world, it will be dealt with here as an example.</p>
  <p><font COLOR="#000080"><strong>The Monastic Tradition in Thailand</strong></font></p>
  <p>The monastic tradition in Thailand can be traced back to the time of King Asoka when,
  around B.E.234 (310 B.C.E.), nine missions of monks were sent out as Dhamma messengers to
  propagate the Dhamma in different countries. One of the missions, headed by the Elders
  Sona and Uttara, came to Suvannabhumi, which covered some parts of what we now call
  Thailand, and succeeded in establishing Buddhism there. We do not know much about the
  Buddhist situations and developments later than that time until the foundation of the
  present lineage of the Thai monastic Sangha in the Sukhothai period, around B.E. 1820
  (1277 C.E.). We learn that at the time when the present form of monastic Sangha of the
  Lankavamsa tradition was established in Sukhothai, there prevailed monks of some older
  local traditions. Before long, the monks of the older traditions became absorbed into the
  newly established Sangha.</p>
  <p>The present tradition of Thai monastic Sangha was established under the full support of
  the King who himself invited the head monk from afar to found it and since then,
  throughout the different periods of over 700 years, it has enjoyed the status of the
  national Sangha under royal patronage and state protection. At present, the large Thai
  monastic community consists of about 400,000 monks and novices who are accommodated in
  more than 30,000 monasteries all over the country. In comparison with the whole Thai
  population of 48 million, of which about 93.4 percent are Buddhist, it makes Thailand
  deserve the name of the &quot;Land of the Yellow Robe.&quot; The fact that such a large
  monastic community fares well under the support of a Buddhist population of that size
  shows clearly how devout and generous the Thai Buddhists are.</p>
  <p>Right from the beginning, the Thai monastic Sangha has been divided into two sections, <em>town-monks</em>
  and <em>forest-monks</em>. The division is only a matter of specialization and there is a
  good relationship between the two, including the transfer of residents. Forest-monks
  preserve the tradition of meditation, while town-monks specialize in study and engage in
  religio-cultural activities. In comparison with town monasteries, the number of forest
  monasteries is small.</p>
  <p>The over 30,000 monasteries are also classified into two categories of royal
  monasteries and private or community ones. Royal monasteries are those erected by the King
  or having obtained his recognition. They are usually large and contain imposing edifices.
  Community monasteries are mostly smaller and simple. Only about 200 monasteries are royal
  and most of them are in the capital, while the majority are private or community ones
  scattered in the villages throughout the country.</p>
  <p>The kings of Ayudhya, beginning 600 years ago, were much influenced by Brahminism, and
  Brahmin advisers were consulted in cultural and administrative affairs. Consequently,
  Brahminical rites and ceremonies have continued in state activities side by side with the
  Buddhist ones. This has sometimes led to the mingling of the two. At the village level,
  the populace have been more or less attached to animistic beliefs and practices. Through
  the monks' association with these villagers, some animistic elements have crept into
  Buddhism. With the integration of animistic and Brahminical elements into Buddhism in the
  process of assimilation, there has developed a form of popular Buddhism, in which rites
  and ceremonies are predominant and superstitious beliefs and practices are prevalent.</p>
  <p>Town and village monasteries have been, for Thais of all classes, centres of education,
  both religious and secular. There, basic subjects like reading, writing and arithmetic
  were taught to boys. The Thais have also developed a custom of <em>temporary ordination</em>.
  Every young man is expected to stay for a period of about three months (usually in the <em>Vassa</em>
  or the rainy season) in a monastery as a monk. Here it is education for socializing male
  members of the society, as they are expected to join the monkhood to undergo monastic and
  cultural training before running families and assuming other civic responsibilities,
  including civil and military services, as learned ex-monks. This custom has, however, been
  on the decline during the last half of the century.</p>
  <p>Since the introduction of the modern Western system of education to the country about a
  century ago, Thailand has been experiencing the problem of inequality of opportunity in
  education, as large numbers of poor and underprivileged youngsters in the upcountry
  villages cannot get access to public and higher education. The monasteries have done much
  to help ease the situation as the monkhood has been the channel of education for these
  sons of the peasants and villagers from distant areas. Thus, the monastic systems of
  education in present-day Thailand, whether the traditional system of Pali and Dhamma
  studies, or the two Buddhist universities in Bangkok, together with their affiliated
  colleges in the provinces, not only provide monastic learning for monks and novices, but
  also serve the educational needs of the Thai society as a whole.</p>
  <p>Monasteries have been seats of Thai culture and Buddhism has been a foundation of the
  Thai culture. Arts and architecture have been developed and preserved in the monasteries.
  A large number of Thai words, especially almost all technical terms, are derived from Pali
  and Sanskrit. Thai literature has been based to a large extent on Buddhist literature. In
  fact, most of the Thai literary works in the past were Buddhist in nature and were written
  by monks in the monasteries. Besides, the monasteries have been centres of social
  activities, where people assemble in large gatherings, both on religious and on civic
  occasions, including temple fairs.</p>
  <p>Although, since the arising of the <em>Dhammayut</em> group (also call <em>Dhammayuttika</em>)
  about one and a half centuries ago, the Thai monastic Sangha has been divided into two
  denominations or suborders of the <em>Mahanikaya</em> and the <em>Dhammayut</em>, the
  whole monastic community is still unified under one and the same governing body, called
  the Council of Elders, or the Sangha Supreme Council, presided over by the Supreme
  Patriarch. The State has enacted laws forming a Constitution under which the monastic
  Sangha governs itself. According to the present act of B.E. 2505 (1962 C.E.), the Sangha
  administration is based on the process of centralization. The Supreme Patriarch, who is
  appointed by the King, has absolute power to govern the whole monastic community and to
  direct all ecclesiastical affairs. Under him is the Sangha Supreme Council, which serves
  him as the Consultative Council. Under this highest governing body, at the local
  administrative level, 73 ecclesiastical provincial governors are responsible for
  provincial affairs of the Sangha, each in his respective province.</p>
  <p><font COLOR="#000080"><strong>The Sangha, the State and the Ideal World Community</strong></font></p>
  <p>In carrying out its mission, the main concern of the monastic Sangha is surely the good
  and happiness of the people. However, throughout its history, all evidence shows that the
  Bhikkhu-Sangha has been in relationship with another central institution of the society,
  that is, the state, as represented by the king or the ruler. In the Buddha's time, King
  Bimbisara and King Pasenadi were in close personal relationship with the Buddha and were
  patrons of the Bhikkhu-Sangha. In Thai history, the monastic Sangha, by tradition, have
  been patronized by all the kings.</p>
  <p>There are at least two reasons that account for this relationship. First, the people
  are subjects of the state. Their destinies, their suffering and happiness are to a large
  extent subject to the conditions of the state and to the acts of the king or ruler. For
  any organization to deal with the people as a whole or to work for their benefit, it is
  impossible to avoid some contact with the state or with the ruler. Because of this, if
  possible, a good relationship should be maintained with the state, so that the Sangha will
  find no difficulty in working for the welfare of the people.</p>
  <p>Secondly, the goal of a good government is similar to that of the Sangha, that is, the
  achievement of the good and happiness for the people. Then, if the government or the ruler
  is a good one, the cooperation between the Sangha and the ruler or the government will
  render the mission more effective. The government or the ruler can even be a medium
  through which the monastic Sangha carries out its mission for the good of people. At
  least, a good government or ruler can provide the people with conditions and circumstances
  that are favorable to the practice of the Dhamma.</p>
  <p>Accordingly, the duties of the monastic Sangha in connection with the state or ruler
  are twofold. First, it should counsel him so that he is a good ruler or that a good
  government is secured. Secondly, it should act in such a righteous way that there will be
  good cooperation with the ruler or the government in operating for the benefit of the
  people, or at least that the way will be open for the Sangha to achieve that goal. On the
  whole, the point is that the secular part of the work for the good of the people should be
  played by one who should account for it, that is, the ruler or government. If he does not
  do so, it is also an obligation of the monastic Sangha to see to it that he does, that is,
  to try to induce him to be a good ruler. The real monastic part of the work under the
  charge of the Sangha is the more sublime inner life of man.</p>
  <p>Although the monastic Sangha has developed new roles, whether central or peripheral,
  whether temporary or lasting, through the different circumstances of space and time, its
  real and fundamental mission remains the same all throughout the ages, that is, to
  perpetuate the Noble Sangha of disciples. In the future, the monastic Sangha, because of
  the factors of space and time, may have to change some existing roles and play some more
  different ones, but as long as it keeps to the real mission, the spirit of the Sangha is
  well preserved. The reason is that the conventional Sangha of monks has been entrusted by
  the Buddha with the task of leading all people in creating the ideal world community of
  noble disciples or truly civilized people.</p>
  <p>Let us hope that all the members of the Sangha of monks will exert themselves and
  cooperate with one another in working out the ideal of producing more and more members of
  the Noble Sangha of disciples, and that Sangha of disciples will grow ever more for the
