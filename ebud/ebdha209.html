        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he topic of this
        talk is <i>samma ditthi</i>. This is a very important subject in
        Buddhism. From the beginning to the end of the Buddha's teaching we find
        <i>samma ditthi</i> everywhere. I shall try to explain what is <i>samma
        ditthi</i>, its many meanings, the different areas it covers and finally
        its significance.<br>
        <font color="#0000ff"><br>
        <strong>Samma Ditthi and the Four Noble Truths</strong></font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The simple meaning of <i>samma ditthi</i>
        is right view. The Noble Eightfold Path starts with <i>samma ditthi</i>.
        You may know that the other factors are right thought, right speech,
        right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and
        right concentration. This is the path leading to the cessation of
        suffering and the attainment of Nibbana. In the Noble Eightfold Path <i>samma
        ditthi</i> is defined as knowledge of the Four Noble Truths (<i>catusu
        ariya saccesu nanam</i>). The complete definition is the knowledge of
        suffering (dukkhe nanam), the cause of suffering (<i>dukkha samudaye
        nanam</i>), the cessation of suffering (<i>dukkha nirodhe nanam</i>) and
        knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of suffering (<i>dukkha
        nirodha gamini patipadaya nanam</i>). So <i>samma ditthi</i> focuses
        directly on the core of the Buddha's philosophy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Samma ditthi</i> means knowledge of
        the Four Noble Truths, but what is the importance of the other seven
        factors? The answer is to be found in the Mahacattarisaka Sutta, or the
        Discourse of the Great Forty, in the Middle Length Sayings. There the
        Noble Eightfold Path is said to have two aspects. The first one is
        mundane or worldly (<i>lokiya</i>) knowledge. This is called right
        understanding in accordance with the truths (<i>saccanulomika samma
        ditthi</i>). This knowledge is clouded by defilements. The second one is
        complete understanding. Having gained worldly knowledge, one should
        start the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path. The Buddha pointed out
        in his first sermon how to approach the Four Noble Truths. The first
        truth, suffering, should be understood (<i>parinneyya</i>); the second
        truth, the cause of suffering, should be abandoned (<i>pahatabba</i>);
        the third truth, the cessation of suffering, should be realized (<i>saccikatabba</i>);
        and the fourth truth, the path leading to the cessation of suffering,
        should be practised (<i>bhavetabba</i>). The resulting wisdom is
        transcendental or supramundane (<i>lokkuttara</i>). It is called right
        understanding or penetrative knowledge of the truths (<i>sacca
        pativedita</i> <i>samma ditthi</i>). This second kind of knowledge is
        free from defilements as well as complete. Its fruit is the enlightened
        mind, through which one realizes perfect <i>samma ditthi</i>.<br>
        <br>
        <strong><font color="#0000ff">Samma Ditthi and the Noble Eightfold Path</font></strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now we can see how <i>samma ditthi</i>
        works along with the Noble Eightfold Path. The Mahacattarisaka Sutta
        says it is very important to understand how <i>samma ditthi</i> works.
        Right view is not to be taken in isolation. It is always connected with
        two other factors. It works together with right effort and right
        mindfulness. Without right effort, right view becomes no more than a
        glimpse. There will be no practice and no achievements. Right
        mindfulness works with mind in many ways; keeping the mind in the
        present moment, it supervises the mind by anchoring it on the right
        thing. Now right view (<i>samma ditthi</i>) works with right effort (<i>samma
        vayama</i>) and right mindfulness (<i>samma sati</i>). Right view is
        like an architect, right effort like an engineer, right mindfulness like
        the supervisor. Moreover, right view goes with every factor in the Noble
        Eightfold Path. Each factor combines with right view. Without right view
        one cannot understand what is right thought, right speech, right action
        etc. Again, without effort there can be no practice; and without
        mindfulness there can be no supervision. That means the three factors
        work together in practice. In the Mahacattarisaka Sutta the Buddha
        teaches: 'Right view, monks (bhikkhus), is the forerunner, and how is
        right view the forerunner? If one understands wrong view as wrong view
        and understands right view as right view. This is right view.' So our
        way along the whole journey to enlightenment is directed by right view.
        All eight factors are interrelated and interconnected through right
        view. 'Right view gives scope for right aim, right aim for right speech,
        right speech for right action, right action for right living, right
        living for right effort, right effort for right mindfulness, right
        mindfulness gives scope for right concentration'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Salayatanika Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya)
        explains that he who practises the Noble Eightfold Path develops the 37
        requisites of enlightenment as well. So <i>samma ditthi</i> is the
        thread which links all the factors together.<br>
        <br>
        <strong><font color="#0000ff">Samma Ditthi and Kamma</font></strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now let us see another side of right
        view. There were 10 kinds of wrong view (<i>miccha ditthi</i>) during
        the Buddha's time, according to the Sevitasevitabba Sutta, Majjhima
        Nikaya. These 10 views denied Kamma and its results (<i>nathi sukata
        dukkhetanam kammanam palam vipako</i>). This means they denied that
        wholesome or unwholesome actions (Kamma) produce good or bad results.
        Generally we know that the Buddha said Kamma means volitional
        activities. These are classified in three groups: bodily, verbal and
        mental actions. There are three unwholesome roots (<i>mula</i>) and
        three wholesome roots for Kamma. 'Greed, O monks, is a condition for the
        arising of (unwholesome) kamma, hatred is a condition for the arising of
        (unwholesome) kamma, delusion is a condition for the arising of
        (unwholesome) kamma.' They are called <i>lobha, dosa </i>and <i>moha</i>
        respectively. In the same manner the very opposite roots produce
        wholesome Kamma. Right view is the guide and purifier of kammic action.
        Sariputta, one of the Buddha's chief disciples, pointed out that it is
        by right view that wholesome states are perfected and developed and that
        it is by right view that wrong view and its unwholesome states are worn
        away. This is how Kamma affects us. It is explained in the Samyutta
        Nikaya: 'According to the seed that is sown so is the fruit ye reap
        therefrom. The doer of good will father good. The doer of evil will
        father evil. The understanding of Kamma and its results is a special
        knowledge <i>(kammassakata nana</i>). It is a part of right view,
        understanding action and effect (<i>kammassakata samma ditthi</i>)
        properly. As the Buddha said: 'Just as of the rising of the sun, O
        monks, the red morning sky is the forerunner and first indication, just
        so, O monks, is right understanding the forerunner and first indication
        of karmically wholesome things.'</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Discourse on Right Understanding
        (Sammaditthii Sutta) in the Middle Length Sayings, right view covers a
        vast area of the Buddha's teaching. According to that discourse, right
        understanding means four things: first, knowing what are wholesome
        actions (<i>kusala</i>) and what are unwholesome actions (<i>akusala</i>);
        second, knowledge of the nutriments (<i>ahara</i>); third, knowledge of
        the Four Noble Truths; and fourth, knowledge of Dependent Origination
        (Paticcasamuppada).<br>
        <br>
        <strong><font color="#0000ff">Samma Ditthi and Dependent Origination</font></strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us see the connection between right
        view and nutriments (ahara). In the Book of Protection (Paritta), the
        first of the 10 questions to be answered by the novice is: what is most
        essential for existence? The answer is: all beings subsist on food (<i>sabbe
        satta aharattitika</i>). In the Sammaditthi Sutta the Buddha says:
        'When, friends, a noble disciple understands nutriment, the origin of
        nutriment, the cessation of nutriment and the way leading to the
        cessation of nutriment, in that way he is one of right view .... and has
        arrived at this true Dhamma.' These fourfold nutrients are:</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can develop knowledge about
        conditions for the continuation of this very life. So what about the
        continuation after death? One dimension of right view is understanding
        the cycle of rebirth (Samsara). In order to explain the cycle of
        rebirth, the Buddha explained Dependent Origination. According to this,
        everything is interrelated and interdependent. The present life is
        conditioned by past ignorance and kammic activities (<i>avijja,
        sankharas</i>). The future, which means the next life, will be produced
        by the present conditions, especially ignorance and craving, and until
        we eradicate these two conditions the continuity of recycling rolls on
        and on. In the doctrine of Dependent Origination, ignorance is taken as
        the first factor. What is ignorance?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ignorance (<i>avijja</i>) is like a
        cloud of delusion (<i>moha</i>) veiling reality that prevents us from
        seeing the true nature of things. Owing to this 'cloud' we see things
        that are impermanent as permanent and suffer when they do not last. This
        ignorance is the cause of all our suffering. Because of not
        understanding, our volitional mental activities (<i>sankharas</i>)
        produce Kamma. In the Buddhist doctrine of Dependent Origination it
        says:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">Conditioned by ignorance, activities
          come to pass; conditioned by activities, consciousness arises. Thus
          conditioned arises name and form . . . Even such is the uprising of
          this entire mass of suffering. But from the utter fading away and
          cessation of ignorance [arises] ceasing of activities, and thus comes
          cessation of this entire mass of suffering.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">These <i>sankharas </i>create suffering
        or worldly happiness. These sankharas are the fuel we have to burn until
        the end, but they prolong the journey in Samsara. Ignorance is explained
        in several ways. In Dependent Origination, ignorance is defined as
        'non-understanding of suffering, non-understanding of the cause of
        suffering, non-understanding of the cessation of suffering and
        non-understanding of the path leading to the cessation of suffering'.
        This is precisely the opposite of <i>samma ditthi</i>. We can get rid of
        ignorance by developing right view, which means understanding the Four
        Noble Truths.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now we understand that in the Noble
        Eightfold Path <i>samma ditthi</i> leads to the attainment of Nibbana.
        In the doctrine of Dependent Origination it works to bring about the end
        of Samsaric existence. In the Noble Eightfold Path it works to eradicate
        the immediate cause of suffering, which is craving. In Dependent
        Origination, it works to overcome ignorance. In both cases what happens
        is realization of the Four Noble Truths. Craving arises because of
        ignorance. In another sense, ignorance is non-understanding of things as
        they really are (<i>yatha bhutam</i>). This means non-understanding of
        the Three Characteristics of Existence: impermanence (<i>anicca</i>),
        suffering (Dukkha) and non-self (<i>anatta</i>). In order to realize the
        Three Characteristics of Existence one should develop insight knowledge
        by practising vipassana meditation, and we should be able to understand
        those three characteristics within the five Aggregates of grasping (<i>khandhas</i>).
        We are unable to see things as they really are because delusion or
        ignorance, by its nature, covers reality (<i>saccapaticchadaka moha</i>).<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#0000ff"><b>Samma Ditthi and Vipassana Knowledge</b></font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha pointed out five ways in
        which one can develop right view:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">By virtue (<i>silanugahita</i>), by
          learning or listening (<i>sutanugahita</i>), by discussion (<i>sakaccanugahita</i>),
          by tranquillity (<i>samathanugahita</i>), by insight vision (<i>vipassananugahita</i>).
          Monks, helped on by these five things right view ripens to mind -
          emancipation and the advantages therefrom, ripens to insight
          emancipation and the advantages therefrom.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Monks, these two things are causes of
          arising of right view. What two? Listening to the Dhamma (<i>paratoghosa</i>)
          and through attention (<i>yonisomanaskara</i>).'</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Buddha's teaching there are two
        types of knowledge. The first is the knowledge which comes through
        sensory perception or <i>indriya nana</i>. In the Madupindika Sutta in
        the <i>Middle Length Sayings</i> the Buddha says:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visual consciousness, your reverences,
          arises because of eye and material shapes. The meeting of the three is
          sensory impingement. Because of sensory impingement arises feeling.
          What one feels, one perceives. What one perceives, one reasons about.
          What one reasons about, obsesses one is the origin of the number of
          perceptions and obsessions which assail a man in regard to material
          shapes cognizible by the eye, past, future and the present. And . . .
          auditory consciousness arises because of the ear and sound. . .
          Olfactory consciousness arises because of nose and smells . . .</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this way he explains how this sensory
        knowledge is acquired, how one sees the world through one's experiences,
        which are based on the situation of one's mind. Venerable Nanananda has
        examined in detail in <i>Concept and Reality</i> how this knowledge,
        which is based on worldly sensory experience, is different from and far
        from reality.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One sees and understands that experience
        is the result or product of craving, conceit and views (<i>tanha, mana,
        ditthi</i>). These conceptual proliferations are called <i>papanca</i>.
        Knowledge based on worldly sense experiences is not perfect. The
        Samyutta Nikaya gives the analogy of a magic show. The audience sits in
        front of the show and is surprised when it sees the magic. But when one
        of the audience sits at the back of the stage, he can see all the
        magician's tricks. The Buddha asks:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">What essence, monks, could there be in
          a magic show? Even so, monks, whatever consciousness - be it past,
          future or present, in oneself or external, gross or subtle, inferior
          or superior, far or near - a monk sees it, ponders over it and
          reflects on it radically. He would find it empty, hollow, void of
          essence. What essence, monks, could there be in a consciousness? Form
          is like a mass of foam and feeling but an airy bubble. Perception is
          like a mirage and formations like a plantain tree. Consciousness is a
          magic show, a juggler's trick entire.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This kind of knowledge is not successful
        in enabling us to see things as they truly are. In order to develop that
        understanding we have to practise <i>vipassana </i>meditation. This way
        enables us to find the truth which lies within the Five Aggregates by
        developing awareness. Through this kind of meditation one is able to
        understand mind and matter (<i>nama-rupa</i>). One gains the knowledge
        to divide mind from matter (<i>namarupapariccheda nana</i>), the
        knowledge of delimitation of mentality and materiality. The physical
        body or <i>rupa</i> is a compound of four elements: hardness (<i>pathavi</i>),
        cohesion (<i>apo</i>), heat (<i>tejo</i>) and motion (<i>vayo</i>). The
        smallest part of the materiality or the body are subatomic particles (<i>kalapa</i>),
        which are not solid. They are mere vibrations. In the Upacala Sutta,
        Samyutta Nikaya it says: 'The entire universe is nothing but combustion
        and vibration' ('<i>Sabbo pajjalito loko sabbo loko pakampito</i>').</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mind part is connected with the
        physical body. Without an object, mind cannot arise. The six faculties
        open to the external world and apprehend objects. Objects can also arise
        from memory. Thereby they create the sixfold consciousness (<i>vinnana</i>),
        and this is followed by perception (<i>sanna</i>) and sensation (<i>vedana</i>).
        After sensation, mind creates mental formations (<i>sankharas</i>). The
        well-known meditation teacher S. N. Goenka clearly shows the picture of
        mind and its functions.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">Understand that this process is going
          on constantly at one sense door or another. Every moment something or
          the other is happening at one of the sense doors. Every moment the
          respective consciousness cognizes: the perception recognizes: the
          feeling part of the mind feels: and the reacting part of the mind
          reacts, with either craving or aversion. This happens continuously in
          one's life.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is how reactions or <i>sankharas </i>create
        suffering. The <i>vipassana </i>meditator, without reacting, just
        observes the sensation. In the Satipatthana Sutta the Buddha explains
        how to establish the fourfold awareness, 'He dwells observing the
        phenomenon of arising in the body. He dwells observing the phenomenon of
        passing away in the body. He dwells observing the phenomenon of arising
        and passing away in the body.'</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is not just suppressing emotions.
        Some people have a misunderstanding that emotion should be suppressed.
        No, this is a wrong idea. Just observe the feeling without reacting. In
        order to break our natural or habitual thinking pattern, the meditator
        trains his mind. As the Buddha advised Bhahiya, 'Train yourself in the
        seen, there will be just the seen; in the heard, just the heard; in the
        sensed, just the sensed; in the cognized, just the cognized.'</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This helps us to overcome the fetter of
        personality belief (<i>sakkaya ditthi</i>), by gaining purification of
        view (<i>ditthi visuddhi</i>). 'In reality there are only mental and
        material phenomena but not a self-I.' As the Buddha pointed out to
        Kaccayana:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">This world, Kaccayana, usually bases
          its view on two things: on existence and on non-existence. Now he who
          with right view sees the uprising of the world as it really is, does
          not hold with the non-existence of the world. But he, who with right
          insight sees the passing away of the world as it really is, does not
          hold with the existence of the world. Grasping after systems,
          imprisoned by dogmas in this world, Kaccayana, for the most part. And
          the man who does not go after that system - grasping, that mental
          standpoint, that dogmatic bias, who does not grasp at it, does not
          take up his stand upon it, [does not think] 'This is my soul.' - who
          thinks - 'that which arises is just ill (suffering), that which passes
          away is ill (suffering). This man is not in doubt, is not perplexed.
          Knowledge herein is his that is not merely another's. Thus far,
          Kaccayana, he has right view.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As Steven Collins has pointed out in
        detail, the understanding of the concept of non-self (<i>anatta</i>),
        which is widely discussed in the discourses in various ways, is a main
        aspect of <i>samma ditthi</i>. This is called <i>vipassana</i> <i>samma
        ditthi</i>. In this way we have to understand the three characteristics
        of existence within oneself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Vipassana</i> meditation, then, is a
        strong technique to realize right view and to eradicate the defilements
        and attain Nibbana. The Buddha said: 'realizing that this body is (as
        fragile) as a jar, establishing the mind (as firm) as a (fortified)
        city, he should attack Mara (defilements) with the weapon of wisdom. He
        should guard his conquest (newly-developed) insight (<i>vipassana</i>)
        and be without attachment (for the<i> jhanas</i>).'<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#0000ff"><b>Samma Ditthi and Spiritual Attainment</b></font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Knowledge of right view becomes
        fulfilled with spiritual attainments, which we call the fruits of the
        path. There are four spiritual stages in which the 10 fetters of
        samsaric existence are gradually eradicated. A person in the first stage
        is known as a stream-enterer or <i>sotapanna</i>. He has eradicated
        personality belief, sceptical doubts and attachment to mere rites and
        rituals. A person in the second stage is called <i>sakadagami </i>or
        once-returner, and has weakened sensual desire and ill will. Those in
        the third stage are called <i>anagamis</i>, or non-returners. They have
        completely eradicated sensual desire and ill will. Those in the fourth
        stage are Arahants or Enlightened Ones. They have eradicated craving for
        fine material existence, craving for immaterial existence, conceit,
        worry and, last of all, ignorance, because all these fetters are rooted
        in ignorance. In the final stage, ignorance can be overcome by realizing
        the Four Noble Truths through right view of penetrative knowledge.<br>
        <i><br>
        </i><font color="#0000ff"><b>The Significance of Samma Ditthi</b></font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's teaching is based on
        understanding. Without understanding, there can be no Nibbana or other
        spiritual attainment. It is clear that the Noble Eightfold Path leads us
        to attain final deliverance, that is Nibbana. 'Just as, monks,
        whatsoever great rivers there be such as the Ganges, Yumuna, Aciravati,
        Sarabhu and Muhi, all of them flow, slide and tend to the ocean. Even
        so, monks, a monk who cultivates and makes much of the Noble Eightfold
        Path flows, slides, tends to Nibbana.' As we have already discussed, the
        Noble Eightfold Path begins with <i>samma ditthi</i>. It points in the
        right direction, towards nibbanic bliss. It is like a compass on a
        journey.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There may be many views of <i>samma
        ditthi</i>. For example, during the Buddha's time, according to the
        Brahmajala Sutta in the Digha Nikaya, there were 62 views. So how do we
        know this is right and others are wrong? The Kalamas were a people who
        lived in Kesaputta. They said to the Buddha that there are many
        different doctrines and views which are explained in many different
        ways. So people are confused. What is right and what is wrong? Then the
        Buddha pointed out 10 possibilities on which we may accept a view as
        right. But he said they should set aside all those possibilities. 'When
        you yourselves know these things are bad, these things are blameable,
        these things are censured by the wise. These things lead to harm and
        ill, abandon them.' So we have our own responsibility to understand
        'things as they really are' or what is the correct view.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, having accepted one's own
        responsibility, one is able to find what is right. As Bhikkhu Bodhi has
        pointed out, 'right view is able both to understand the nature of
        actuality and discriminate between right and wrong doctrines about the
        nature of actuality. Wrong view both confuses the nature of actuality
        and cannot distinguish between right and wrong doctrines about the
        nature of actuality. With the doctrine of Dependent Origination, we saw
        that the cause of samsaric existence is ignorance. It is <i>samma ditthi</i>
        which is the key tool with which to dispel the darkness of ignorance and
        to cross the samsaric ocean. The Buddha compared wisdom to an eye (<i>panna
        cakku</i>). Wisdom is no more than <i>samma ditthi</i>. We can see
        through the eye of <i>samma ditthi</i> and understand the Four Noble
        Truths.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the world, in the past and in the
        present and certainly in the future as well, there are so many problems:
        financial problems, ethical problems, environmental problems, family or
        personal problems. There should be a universal solution to these
        problems of mankind. <i>Samma ditthi</i> has shown us that the method is
        to understand one's own problem, the cause of the problem, the solution
        and the way to be followed for the solution. This is a universal method
        for any human problem. Many personal problems can certainly be solved by
        practising sila or virtue. If one practises the Five Precepts to the
        maximum effect, many problems will be finished. But <i>sila</i> is not
        enough to solve all our problems, especially for those people who have
        mental problems such as stress, depression, unfulfilled aspirations,
        being united with the unpleasant and separated from the pleasant etc. We
        can find a solution by practising meditation or developing tranquillity
        in order to become peaceful. Finally, if one keenly understands that
        this existence is suffering and that the Five Aggregates themselves are
        suffering, then we have to find a solution. <i>Samma ditthi</i> will
        help to eradicate suffering by overcoming ignorance and craving. Then
        enlightenment is the solution, and this can be achieved by the
        realization of what <i>samma ditthi</i> says. Therefore, right view is a
        universal solution for the suffering of mankind.</font></p>
