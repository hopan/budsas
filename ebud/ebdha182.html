      Pah Nanachat for 15 years. Last year (1999) he visited Bodhinyanarama Monastery, New
      Zealand, to direct Venerable Hasapanno's Upasampada (acceptance into the Sangha of monks)

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<font size="6">F</font>rom a Buddhist perspective,
    anything to do with other people can be considered social action: how we relate to the
    individuals close to us such as family or neighbors, to society at large, and to the world
    around us. The field of social action expands out, but it begins with ourselves and our
    relationships to others. The individual is at the core of all relationships between any
    parts of society. We must always return to that core, to recognize that our own actions
    affect other people and the society around us. This is simply the basic law of karma-
    anything we do affects ourselves and others. It's not a matter of &quot;me&quot; and
    &quot;society,&quot; as if they were separate. There isn't really any separation.The two
    are interrelated all the time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What we bring to the society around us are simply our own
    qualities of mind, of heart, of being - our intentions and how they manifest in our
    actions. In order to understand our effects on society, we first have to understand
    ourselves, to see these qualities more clearly. The ability we have to help others, or to
    do anything to affect others, is dependent upon the clarity, intention, and integrity with
    which we live our lives. These things are inseparable. As such, the way we train ourselves
    is equally important to any actions we take outside ourselves. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhist practice, the training laid out for an
    individual begins with how one practices with others. This is sila, or virtue - not
    harming others, being honest in the way one deals with others, being trustworthy in one's
    actions and speech. The practice of keeping the precepts is already social action. The
    precepts remind us of the ways our actions affect others. Oftentimes, people may think,
    &quot;Let s get to the real stuff about Buddhism - the liberation, the enlightenment;
    keeping the precepts is just a social convention, just the basics.&quot; But this
    &quot;basic&quot; stuff has an effect. It is important. The Buddha recognized that our
    actions have effects for ourselves and for others. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While virtue concerns itself with actions and speech, the
    second aspect of the Buddhist training is meditation, or samadhi - a training of the mind
    and the heart, a clarifying of mindfulness, awareness, and composure. These are essential
    to cultivate. If we are going to take any social responsibility, it has to be done with an
    open heart and a clear mind. We must develop a standard for reflection. We can then start
    to ask, what are the effects of our words and actions? Sometimes people get enthused about
    social action and forget about the ordinary activities in life. How do I deal with my
    family? How do I deal with the people closest to me? Or even . . .how do I answer the
    phone? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What do I put into the universe when I am irritated or
    upset? These are very ordinary, everyday things, preparing the ground for how we relate to
    the world around us. Paying attention to these things is social action. Dealing with the
    circle of people around us is social action. It is not different. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From a Buddhist perspective, the next step is recognizing
    the quality of wisdom, or pañña. There are many different levels of wisdom, but seeing
    things as they truly are is its essence. With a reflective ability of the mind, we can
    begin to see things as they truly are and start to turn towards that. This is not simply
    gathering new bits of knowledge or being zapped with some sort of enlightened energy. It
    is a turning inward to be able to open to all the ways things truly are and allowing our
    lives to be guided by that wisdom. How does this affect myself? How does this affect
    others? What is the way to freedom and liberation? What is the way out of suffering and
    dissatisfaction for myself and for others? Wisdom is seeing the different ways we entangle
    ourselves in things and the different ways we can be free. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Virtue, meditation, and wisdom are the tools we use in
    training ourselves in how to relate to the world around us. This training will help us to
    see the qualities that bring true benefit to our society the qualities of loving-kindness,
    compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. These are the Brahma viharas, or divine
    abodes. In a way, these can be considered a goal of social action: creating a way in which
    human beings should live. Loving-kindness is the wish for another's happiness. Compassion
    is the wish to alleviate another's suffering. Sympathetic joy is the happiness we feel in
    the success of another.And equanimity,the ability to stay centered in the midst of life's
    ups and downs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The quality of sympathetic joy is an interesting one in
    terms of social action. Its opposite is jealousy or envy. In many ways, envy is the
    foundation for competition and conflict. If a society is based upon competitive
    accumulation like some societies we know, it can create conflict and a lack of
    appreciation and willingness to enjoy each other. Having come to the United States after
    living in Thailand for twenty-three years, the sense of competition here is very striking.
    In Thailand, there is a wide stratification in terms of socioeconomic level and
    opportunity within society, but there is not a lot of envy or competition. People are
    often motivated to improve their economic lot, but they don't resent those who already
    have wealth or privilege. Similarly, there is usually not a looking down on or shunning of
    those in economic difficulty or from a poor background. There is an acceptance that people
    have accumulated different tendencies and have different abilities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This acceptance has imbued people's consciousness. It is a
    sense of karma playing a role in people s lives over many lifetimes, a feeling of
    &quot;who knows?&quot; This lifetime can change; in other lifetimes it might be different.
    Rebirth is an accepted part of how they perceive the world - it's a long view on life.
    This takes away the edge of selfishness and competitiveness and brings a sense of
    appreciation for each other as human beings, a joy in each other's happiness. By turning
    toward this quality of joy, we can draw on our wish to help others, to be of service.
    Acceptance also brings the quality of equanimity, a non-reactive clarity that allows one
    to stay centered. Equanimity is not indifference. It is the ability to return to a place
    of stillness, to be non-reactive, and to weigh things carefully. This is an important
    quality especially when considering social action or social responsibility. Without
    equanimity we can get drawn into our own reactiveness - our views and opinions. We can
    think that we re always right, that other people are just a bunch of idiots. It's easy to
    get turned around and out of balance. Not being drawn into the web of our views and
    opinions but being able to settle and reflect- to ask, what is the way of balance? -
    equanimity is essential in undertaking social action. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the social action projects I have been involved in, the
    Buddhist perspective has taught me some important things. Take a particular project, like
    protecting the forests. The monastery in Thailand at which I was abbot was quite
    wellknown, with a large community of monks, novices, lay men and lay women practicing and
    training there. I thought it would provide a good balance to set up a more remote branch
    monastery. Our new location was right along the Mekong River. It was in one of the last
    forests in the province, and around that time, the area was made into a national park. But
    this was just a designation on the map, and it caused a lot of problems. The area was full
    of stumps. It was being logged, and many villagers had made their fields there. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist perspective was very helpful. We couldn't
    simply say, &quot;These are awful, nasty people. The planet would be a fine sort of place
    if they weren't doing this.&quot; The reality was that they are doing this and that they
    are people just like us. They are trying to look after their families and to get ahead in
    the world. In order to do anything to protect the forest, we had to find ways to include
    them. How do you involve the people who are cutting down the forest? How do you include
    the merchants who are paying them? How do you include the civil servants who are taking
    the bribes to allow the cutting? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The teachings told us that problems come from people not
    understanding how they are creating suffering for themselves and for others. Problems and
    suffering come from desires and attachments. You can't simply wish that away. You ve got
    to work on the basic problems of bringing knowledge and education into their lives. Why
    were they cutting down the forest? Of course, they wanted to live comfortably, to look
    after their families. So, we had to find ways to provide for them. Otherwise, it would be
    like trying to build a wall to stop the tide from coming in. Good luck! It s going to find
    a way. Instead, you have to think clearly and find ways to address peoples needs, to
    include them and bring them in. This takes time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This understanding reflects our own personal spiritual
    practice. We'd all like to sit down, cross our legs, close our eyes, and become
    enlightened just like that. Instead, we have to take the time to lay a foundation, to
    become patient and clear enough to develop the path in a comprehensive way. Just as the
    Buddha taught us the Four Noble Truths as the basis for our own practice - suffering, the
    causes of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of
    suffering - the same applies to social action. We've got suffering, we've got a problem.
    What are all the different causes of that problem? What kind of end can there be to that
    problem? If we haven't understood the problem, we won't be able to see the causes. And if
    we aren't really clear about the goal we are working towards, we won't really know what
    kinds of path to develop. It works in society the same way it works in our own practice.
    The more we reflect on and practice with those truths for ourselves, the more we are able
    to apply them in our life, in very ordinary situations, with our friends, with our family,
    at work, with different problems happening in the community. That is social action. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">How can we work together to do this? With our project
    along the Mekong, we began by drawing in people affiliated with the monastery who were
    interested in helping. In a Buddhist society, the monastery is a foundation we could build
    on, a field for social action. Because the monastery is dependent on lay people to support
    it, there is a day-to-day connection with the neighboring society. It is a web of support
    and interaction, so that when there is a problem in the community, we can easily recognize
    who is interested in helping. At first there were a few volunteers. When there was too
    much work for volunteers to do, we hired some people. Again, the money for their salaries
    came from offerings to the monastery from people in the community. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The forest project continued to grow. We even drew in
    people like the police.They had power, especially when it came to controlling who was
    taking logs out. Rather than getting into a confrontation with them, we asked how we could
    work with them. That was very easy at the time because one of the supporters of the
    monastery was the Deputy Superintendent of Police. He was a great resource for drawing in
    other honest police officers, who then had a few words with even more police officers and
    got them on our side. This takes time, it takes patience, it takes clarity. If you work in
    a confrontational way, it's difficult to achieve this. By having a strong focus on one's
    personal practice and integrity, by becoming more clear, centered, and pure-hearted in
    one's intention for doing good, the more one starts to connect with other people. In terms
    of social action, this seems to be a magnet, drawing other good people. It gets its own
    momentum going. So far, the forest project is working. And besides being successful in its
    own right, it has been adopted as a model for trial projects in other national parks in
    Thailand. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During one of the recent elections in Thailand, I saw a
    handwritten sign on the side of a building. It said something like, &quot;The forces of
    corruption are given more power when good people retreat.&quot; The &quot;system&quot;
    gains more momentum when we decide we don't want to deal with it, that things are
    hopeless. With social action work, we have to be patient, discerning, equanimous. We have
    to be willing to try and to fail. We have to recognize that sometimes things will work and
    sometimes they won't. And that they always work out in ways we may never have conceived.
    This is the same as returning to the foundation of one's own practice: keeping the
    precepts; developing clarity, tranquillity, and peace of mind; establishing wisdom through
    reflective investigation; cultivating the qualities of kindness, compassion, sympathetic
    joy, and equanimity. These form the foundation that allows us to move out into the realm
    of social action./.</font></p>
