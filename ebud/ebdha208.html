        <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">[<em>A talk delivered on
        April 22, 2539/1996, to an international medical symposium <br>
        on Death and Dying</em>.]</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Distinguished participants:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today I have been expected to speak on
        death and dying, but I would like instead to speak on aging and dying
        rather than on death and dying.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Old age and death are natural phenomena.
        In accordance with the law of nature all conditioned things are
        impermanent and liable to change, being subject to causes and
        conditions. Everything that has a beginning must at last come to an end.
        The lives of all beings, after being born, must decay and die. Aging is
        just the decline of life and the decay of the faculties; and death is
        the passing-away, the termination of the time of life, the break-up of
        the aggregates and the casting off of the body.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although, by nature, aging and death are
        merely facts of life, psychologically they often mean to the worldlings
        a loss of hope, the frustration of all aspirations, a leap into a great
        darkness, and thus the feelings of fear and anguish.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In spite of degeneration and loss
        inherent in aging and dying, old age can be turned into an opportunity
        for development, and death into that for a sublime attainment. At the
        least, one should live the good and worthwhile life of the old, and can
        then die unconfused or even die an enlightened death.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">A human's life span is traditionally
        divided into three stages, the first, the middle and the last stage. Of
        course, with attention to what is good and right, one should live a good
        life through all the three stages of life. However if, through
        negligence, one fails to fulfill the good life in the first and middle
        stages of life, there is still room left for one to fulfill it in the
        last one, that is, in one's old age.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not only when still a young black-haired
        man in the prime of youth, but also when he became old, the Buddha was
        still perfect in his lucid wisdom. This means a happy and fruitful life
        in old age is a possibility. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, one can
        even make progress in the good life and attain to perfection in this
        last stage of life.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So many people spend the whole time of
        their early and middle years in search of fame and fortune, in seeking
        after wealth and power, and in pursuit of material pleasures. They might
        say that their lives have been worthwhile. Really, they are not. It is
        not enough. They have not got the best of their lives. They have not
        realized the full potential of being human. To live longer into old age
        gives them an advantage over other people as they are in a position to
        make advances towards fulfilling these potentials.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What are these potentials? There are a
        lot of them. Examples are the various kinds of inner and independent
        happiness through inner development. In short, there are a lot of the
        good that people in search of wealth, power and pleasures will never
        experience and enjoy except that they survive to develop them in their
        old age.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As long life up to an old age is an
        advantage if one learns how to utilize it, we should look after
        ourselves well so that we will have long lives. Of course, good care of
        life is needed. We should look after ourselves well, physically and
        behaviorally, emotionally and volitionally, and intellectually and
        intuitionally. The interdependence and interrelationship among these
        aspects of life should be rightly steered so that they become
        intercontributary.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">First, physical care should not be
        separated from behavioral development in relationship with the social
        and natural environment. In addition to sufficient nutritious food and
        physical exercise, right attitudes and behavior such as beneficial
        habits should be developed in connection with eating, general material
        consumption and recreations.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As all know well, the present-day
        society functions as a system of competition and consumption where
        people fall into the state of time-scarcity because of competitive
        individualism and personal pursuit of material pleasures. In the context
        of such a society, people find it difficult to take care of other people
        and, therefore, people in old age should be more self-reliant. In these
        situations, they should devote themselves more to an&nbsp; intimate
        relationship with the natural environment. They should enjoy physical
        movements and activities amidst nature.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As far as personal relationships are
        concerned, love of sons and daughters leads to concerns about their weal
        and woe which are satisfied by parental care. However, when children
        have grown up and can take care of themselves, they take responsibility
        for themselves. At this point, the concerns of the old parents over
        their grown-up sons and daughters, or of the grandparents over their
        grand-children, often lead to vexation on the part of the latter and an
        upset on the part of the former. It is not good to the mental health of
        both sides.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a principle in the Buddha's
        teaching that when children grow up and are able to take responsibility
        for their own lives, parents are expected to develop equanimity. This
        means love must be balanced by equanimity. In other words, love that
        grows into attachment, whether to persons or things, must be replaced by
        equanimity. Love must be maintained at the level of loving-kindness or
        friendly love. In Thailand, aged people find the balance of
        loving-kindness with equanimity in joining their peers in the Buddhist
        observances at a village monastery and even stay there overnight every
        seven or eight days.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To go further in emotional care and
        volitional encouragement, the elderly should develop in themselves the
        will to do something. This means that one should have something in mind
        that one values highly and has a loving interest in, which one wants
        very strongly to do, for example, the writing of some book on one's
        cherished experiences, the carrying out of a gardening program, or the
        search for knowledge of a spiritual matter. Let one's will to action be
        so strong as to make one say to oneself: &quot;I cannot die if I have
        not completed this task.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many of us can think of elderly people,
        especially those after retirement, who, not long after retiring from
        work, became subject to loneliness, dejected, down-hearted and gloomy.
        They quickly withered away and died. Some suffer from depression and
        even commit suicide. But the elderly who develop the will to action will
        not be so. Their willpower and strong spirit will only develop. They
        have something to commit themselves to and there, also, they will apply
        reasoning and intellectual investigation. They will become strong and
        healthy, both in mind and in body. The Buddha says that one who has the
        four qualities of the desire to act, strong willpower, the sense of
        commitment, and the spirit of investigation or experimentation, can live
        long throughout the whole life span.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now we come to the boundary between the
        heart and the head, where the emotion will be refined, made wholesome
        and strengthened by the intellectual faculty. However, in passing, I
        would like to mention another two points.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Elderly people usually have bodies that
        are frail and easily afflicted with diseases. This tends to make them
        worried and dejected. Here they are encouraged by the Buddha to train
        themselves: &quot;Although my body is ill, my mind shall not be
        ill,&quot; or &quot;Even though my body becomes frail, my mind shall not
        be weakened.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another point is concerned with
        happiness. Many or most people think of happiness in terms of sensual or
        material pleasures. If happiness consists in satisfying the senses, life
        in old age will be a great torment, forever deprived of happiness,
        because aging means, among other things, the degeneration and decay of
        the sense-faculties.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In reality, there are roughly two kinds
        of happiness. One is sensual happiness, dependent on external material
        pleasures. As this kind of happiness is dependent on material objects
        outside ourselves, those who are devoted to its enjoyment become
        pleasure-seekers or the seekers after happiness. In the pursuit of this
        kind of happiness, the pleasure-seekers learn and spend a lot of energy
        to develop the ability to look for and recognize the goods to gratify
        their senses. This has even been unconsciously taken by these people to
        be the meaning of education.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But it is the gift of human beings that
        they are possessed of the potential for creativity. Through this
        potential, they have created, using their creative thinking and
        constructive ideas, the human world of inventions and technologies.
        Directed inside, this potential can be developed for the creation of
        inner happiness and the various kinds of skillful mental qualities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, the pleasure-seekers or
        happiness-pursuers, being engrossed in the search for external objects
        to gratify their senses, fail to develop this potential for the inner
        creativity. This creative or formative potential left undeveloped then
        works out for their inner lack of happiness and for various negative
        mental states. Thus in this way the pleasure-seekers, while seeking
        external happiness through the gratification of the senses with material
        objects, create or form inside themselves stress, anxiety, worry,
        depression, fear, insomnia and all kinds of negative mental states, and
        even clinical mental disorders.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To be sure, these pleasure-seekers in
        their old age will suffer double anguish. Externally, because of the
        degeneration of their sense-faculties, they experience the frustration
        of the sensual happiness. Internally, they are subject to the formation
        and arising of unskillful feelings such as fear, anxiety, stress, and
        depression, and the frustration of the external happiness intensifies
        these negative emotions even more. This seems to be a very unhappy life
        in old age.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wise people not only develop the ability
        to seek for external objects to satisfy sensual desires, they develop
        the potential for creativity to create in themselves various positive
        mental qualities and inner happiness. We are usually advised by the
        Buddha to develop five skillful qualities as the constant factors of the
        mind, namely joy, delight, relaxing calm, happiness and concentration.
        These five qualities will keep away all negative emotions and
        unhappiness. It is the development of the ability to create happiness or
        to be happy. As this second kind of happiness is an internal mental
        quality independent of material objects outside, the person who has
        developed it becomes, in contrast to the pleasure-seeker, the possessor
        of happiness. In their old age, the elderly should learn to develop more
        and more inner happiness so that they will enjoy lives of peace, freedom
        and happiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is still a higher level of
        happiness. It is happiness beyond all formations. This is the highest
        kind of happiness, to be realized through the liberating wisdom or
        insight into the true nature of things.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the way of liberating the mind
        through wisdom and insight, we are advised by the Buddha to free and
        learn the truth of things at every step. Aging and death are among the
        facts of life that should be constantly reviewed. In the words of the
        Buddha:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>&quot;These five
          facts of life should be again and again contemplated by everyone,
          whether female or male, whether layperson or monk:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          &quot;I am subject to old age: I am not freed from it.<br>
          &quot;I am subject to disease: I am not freed from it.<br>
          &quot;I am subject to death: I am not freed from it.<br>
          &quot;There will be division and separation from all that is dear to
          me.<br>
          &quot;I am the owner of my actions: whatever I do, whether good or
          bad, I become heir to it.&quot;</b></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Death, in particular, which is the
        central point or culmination of these facts, is a special focus of
        contemplation. Buddhists are advised to practice mindfulness or
        contemplation of death (<em>maranasati</em>). This mindfulness or
        contemplation is far different from imagination or fanciful thinking,
        which often leads to fear, sorrow and downheartedness. That is called
        unwise attention. The right and wise contemplation of death leads to the
        acceptance of the fact of the impermanence of&nbsp;&nbsp; life, and
        further to leading a life of diligence or earnestness to get the best of
        life before it comes to an end.&nbsp; Furthermore, it leads to the
        realization of the truth of the impermanence of all things. The insight
        into the true nature of all things will bring about wisdom that
        liberates the mind. The mind of the wise who realize the truth, being
        freed, is set to equilibrium and stands in equanimity. The person who is
        in this state of being is in the position to enjoy the highest
        happiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some of the disciples of the Buddha
        attained to enlightenment and final freedom even at the moment of death.
        For those who have not realized the final goal of perfect freedom, at
        the moment of death they are advised to die with a clear and peaceful
        mind, unconfused.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short, three points should be
        observed concerning aging and death. First, aging and death are plain
        facts of life, the contemplation of which may lead to insight into the
        truth of all things. Second, aging and death can be an opportunity for
        the development of a good life, we should make the best out of them.
        Third, relying on aging and death, even the ageless and the deathless
        can be attained to.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">With these remarks, I bring my talk to a
        close. Thank you.</font></p>
