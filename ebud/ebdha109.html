<blockquote>
    <p align="right"><em>- A talk by Ajahn Viradhammo given at
    Amaravati, U.K., in 1996</em></p>
    <p>In Buddhism we speak of two levels of consideration. The
    first is the conventional level of 'me', as a person, and
    'you', as a person. For example, there is 'Viradhammo':
    fifty-ish, quickly getting out of shape, has duties, is a
    senior monk at Amaravati; his Mom is in Canada - and he has a
    little scar on his head with three stitches. That is 'me', as
    a person. There is the sense here of a person, of social
    responsibility, of a position in society; of the age of the
    body, of its genetic and cultural make-up. This is the
    packaged sense of self that a typical person works with,
    which is quite valid. </p>
    <p>At this level, the considerations are morality, right
    livelihood, responsibility for the environment, social
    action, expression and creativity. This is one level we
    operate on, where we can find all kinds of fulfillment; it is
    a very rewarding thing to be able to work to express and
    create something. However, it is not liberating - because
    things change. We really notice that it is not liberating
    when someone criticises what we are doing. You might think
    you are doing a great job but when someone pokes a few holes
    in it, then you see how un-liberating it is - how bound one
    can be to it. If all we are trying to do is to find
    fulfillment on the level of family, social action and
    creativity, then of course our hearts are never fully
    appeased, because those conditions are always changing and
    they depend on so many other factors which are beyond our
    control. If my whole sense of fulfillment is my family, but
    then my kids leave home, or someone dies, or my child comes
    home with a red Mohican... what do I do if my whole life is
    dependent on that?! So we would say that fulfillment on this
    level is not where liberation lies, it is not a refuge -
    although that is not to put it down. </p>
    <p>The second level is the Dhamma level, the level of
    liberation of the heart. When we develop a Buddhist
    lifestyle, we can see how our families and our social
    positions can actually be our `monasteries'. They are the
    place where we practise inner vigilance and contemplation.
    Whether you are an artist, a doctor, a photographer or on the
    dole, that is your monastery, that is where you practise. </p>
    <p>I was in New Zealand for nine years and was involved with
    a very beautiful monastery project. During that time there
    was the necessity to function on the social level - I had to
    work and to organise things - but, through all that, the most
    important things to consider were suffering and
    non-suffering: the inner world. We built this lovely
    meditation hall (half my monastic life has been spent on
    building sites!). One whole side of it was open, and we had
    doors that were ten feet by ten feet - pretty big doors!
    However, the joiner who was making the doors up was not very
    efficient. He would always tell us that the doors were coming
    next week - and this went on for four months! On the wordly
    level, we had to say to him, &quot;Hey, listen! We have a
    contract, you are not meeting your responsibilities.&quot;
    But on the inner level, we all had to take responsibility for
    our annoyance at this joiner. So both levels were operating. </p>
    <p>This meditation hall is convertible. There is a cloister
    at the front, onto which these huge doors open. On top of the
    cloister we had a marquee custom-made, so we could double the
    size of the hall on big occasions. We got the best tentmaker
    in New Zealand to make this marquee - but it was faulty. We
    had to take tough steps to ensure he didn't rip us off, but
    we still could not hate him. Sometimes we wanted to; the mind
    was saying, 'What a rip-off! What are we paying this man all
    this money for?' Our practice was right there; the tentmaker
    was our monastery. So without denying the necessity and the
    challenge of living in the world, we also recognise the inner
    world. If we view those two worlds skilfully we find a
    balance between conventional reality and the inner work. Then
    the tentmaker becomes a person with whom I learn to stand up
    for what is right, rather than putting my tail between my
    legs and running away. He helps me learn to be patient. </p>
    <p>This inner world is what we work with on a retreat.
    Although we should not forget the conventional world -
    Buddhism is not just a weird experience called retreat! We
    cannot spend our life on a retreat, we have to live in the
    world. The gift of a retreat, of course, is that we don't
    have to do so much social re-organising. If the toast is
    burned, it's burned; we don't sue the cooks. So we work with
    whatever we have, and we have the freedom to observe. A
    retreat offers the opportunity to look at suffering and
    non-suffering. </p>
    <p>Maybe in your own lives you have difficulties to deal with
    - mortgages or recalcitrant teenagers? Don't try to solve
    those problems now! Instead, I suggest you work with that
    very feeling of anxiety or worry as a present condition. This
    is the skill of moving from the conventional, social level of
    'me', as a person, to the impersonal level of basic Dhamma
    elements. This level of the teaching then breaks down our
    conscious experience to fundamentals which we can look at, no
    matter what our social situation is. For example, thought -
    mental activity - is one of the fundamental things we have
    been looking at. If this activity is always kept on the
    personal level, it's, 'Well, what am I going to do tomorrow?
    I don't know... We need to do this; but what if we do that?
    Yes, let's try this, then we'll do that...' All that is on
    the personal level - but on the Dhamma level, this is simply
    planning, worry, thought. </p>
    <p>If we remain on the personal level, there will always be
    this to-ing and fro-ing - struggling. It is only on that
    impersonal level of consciousness that we can understand
    not-self (anatta). It's not that life itself is impersonal -
    we still have our individual kamma, but it is on this level
    that we can penetrate to a liberating understanding, by
    passing beyond ignorance. We are not going to avoid the
    tentmakers and the joiners altogether; life is always going
    to be that way. </p>
    <p>There are many teachings that can help us; for example the
    Four Noble Truths or Dependent Origination
    (paticca-samuppada). Sometimes, we might feel over-whelmed if
    we try to figure these out, but in time we come to see that
    it's a really beautiful package, intellectually very lovely.
    More than that, these teachings encourage us to look in the
    right place, and show us the path to freedom. They take us
    away from the personal situation with the joiner or the
    tentmaker, directly to a fundamental sense of stress. So we
    develop the ability to examine on this level all the time. If
    I can look at the 'aggro' I feel towards the joiner and take
    it out of the personal realm by simply looking at it as
    stress, then I will be able to understand any 'aggro' I may
    have for the rest of my life and know how to deal with it. </p>
    <p>The Buddha encouraged us to consider how human
    consciousness and the human body are involved with pleasant,
    unpleasant and neutral feelings and sensations; to use
    feeling (vedana) as a framework for contemplation. When you
    are thirsty, you drink a glass of orange juice; it is
    pleasant. When you are sitting here and your knees hurt, that
    is unpleasant. That is very obvious. So no matter what you
    are finding pleasant or unpleasant - the body, the weather, a
    person, or your own mind - notice the feeling of
    pleasant-unpleasant-neutral; consider
    attraction-repulsion-neutrality. When we are not in touch
    with Dhamma we often don't consider these fundamental states
    of mind. We just enjoy the pleasant and try to minimise the
    unpleasant - which seems like a logical thing to do. But then
    that keeps us very restless, because no matter how hard we
    try to do this, there will always be pleasant, unpleasant and
    neutral. Sense-consciousness is this way. </p>
    <p>Seeking the pleasant, trying to be rid of the unpleasant
    is samsara. The more we do this, the more we want to do it,
    and the more we have to do it. We become addicted to this way
    of operating. We get into this very restless phenomenon
    called rebirth - becoming, doing, all the time. And this
    takes us away from our real home. This takes us away from the
    unconditioned, because pleasure and pain are always
    conditioned. As they change, we feel the need to change. As
    we grasp pleasure and pain, we find ourselves being spun
    around the samsaric wheel. </p>
    <p>The wheel is one of our traditional images. The rim of the
    wheel represents sense experience - the contacts we
    experience, pleasant and unpleasant - all of it spinning
    around. Grasping the rim of a wheel simply wrings us around
    with the general momentum. So grasping the pleasant, then
    trying to hold onto it and afraid of losing it, we make
    tremendous effort to keep it going; or getting angry at the
    unpleasant - in both cases we continue to spin around
    endlessly. But the hub of the wheel is the centre of knowing
    and being, and this can take it all. This is where the
    unconditioned lies. If we can summon awareness and be that
    still centre of knowing, there are still comings and goings -
    but we have a refuge. This is what Ajahn Chah called, 'our
    real home.' </p>
    <p>This is the basic structure that the Buddha asks us to
    look at. Our sensitive body contacts objects. That contact
    produces pleasant, unpleasant, neutral feelings - vedana.
    From there comes craving (tanha), the grasping of craving
    (upadana), and the whole process of becoming (bhava) and
    rebirth (jati). If one carries on like this over time, it
    becomes a habit. It is then very difficult to return to the
    still centre of being, because one is so restlessly engaged
    with that which moves, with the emotions and the thoughts. </p>
    <p>Why are we kidnapped so much? Even though we sit here
    determining, 'I will not get kidnapped!' - it's very hard,
    isn't it? Don't think you are alone in this, we are all in
    the same boat! It is very difficult because of our habits,
    our kamma. Even though we might have really good intentions,
    situations arise where we feel anger or fear. That is kamma. </p>
    <p>What we are trying to do is to break up all these kammic
    patterns. The way we can do this is by beginning to look at
    Dhamma, rather than remaining stuck on the level of
    personality. The contemplation of feelings (vedanupassana) is
    one of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. It requires
    careful attention to notice this basic structure of the way
    that some things attract our attention, while others repel.
    We can try it with an emotion, with a bodily feeling, with a
    thought; or with people. On this retreat maybe you find
    difficulty with someone, or maybe you fall in love with them.
    Notice how some people are physically very attractive, while
    some are not. Some people have a lot of charisma, and others
    don't. Notice how you are attracted or repelled; look at that
    very simple movement of the heart. This is where our habitual
    emotions are really arising from. </p>
    <p>If you can know that movement and learn to not follow or
    react to it, then you begin not to suffer. For example, your
    own psyche, the things you don't like about yourself, the
    emotions you think should not be there; all these come up as
    very unpleasant. So ask, 'What does an unpleasant emotion
    feel like?' Or in meditation you might sometimes experience
    tranquillity, bliss or bright lights, or notice how beautiful
    silence is, how really attractive that is... but then comes
    the coarseness of the sound of the JCB! So we attach to the
    pleasant and the refined, and we try to get rid of the ugly.
    But what is it that knows pleasant and unpleasant? </p>
    <p>Sometimes when you are sitting, the mind is bored, the
    eyes look around, and you find yourself attracted to
    someone... ah!... and then you start to create. Romance.
    There is the creation of 'me' and 'that person', and what
    'we' are going to do, what is going to happen to 'us' -
    sometimes it's called a 'vipassana marriage' - and then
    suddenly the bell rings! It can happen with hatred too, for
    example when there is something unappealing about someone.
    Rather than just noticing our desire to pull away from them,
    sitting with that until it reaches neutrality - we become
    very critical, caught in aversion, and try to push them away.
    But in contemplation of feelings, we can simply bring up an
    image of a person, and be mindful of the attraction or
    aversion. That takes us to peace of the mind - to neutrality,
    rather than identification with the feeling itself. </p>
    <p>Quite often we are so caught up with the craving for
    pleasure that we don't even notice neutrality, which we find
    boring. As Luang Por Chah said, the neutral, the ordinary is
    like the space between the end of the out-breath and the
    beginning of the in-breath. It is very calming but we don't
    tend to notice it, because we want excitement - we seek to
    react to difficult or frightening things. </p>
    <p>The practice of vedanupassana requires refined attention;
    taking this theme for contemplation to break down the whole
    self-structure. So no matter what you may be as a self, as a
    person, suggest to yourself that today you are going to
    simply try to notice attraction and repulsion in the mind.
    That way you are contemplating Dhamma, instead of just being
    a person. Then ask, 'What is it that knows that which you are
    noticing?' That knowing is where we find our freedom. </p>
    <p>You have a body with senses; you live in an environment
    with which you have contact; that contact produces pleasant,
    unpleasant and neutral feelings. Right there is where you
    work. Then you have tanha: wanting the pleasant, not wanting
    the unpleasant, and the sleepiness and delusion around the
    neutrality. When that wanting arises, there might be grasping
    of it, believing in it; you really think that if you follow
    it you will be truly happy, or that to get rid of it will be
    the right thing to do. So there is belief in the wanting, and
    the grasping (upadana). From the grasping comes the sense of
    becoming; one gets involved in this whole process and is
    reborn into the new situation. From there emerges the sense
    of dissatisfaction, and you get lost in that: 'Oh, here I go
    again!' </p>
    <p>Notice how birth and death work. You are bored with
    meditation, your knees are hurting, you want to get up and do
    something interesting. Then we get a pleasant, beautiful,
    creative idea that is really going to help the world. Rather
    than simply noticing this as a pleasant idea, craving
    develops to keep it going. We start to think, we grasp the
    craving and then we create something. This is where we seek
    rebirth; we go on from one to the next to another. It is
    important to notice this, because at that point we have a
    choice. If we can see craving clearly and not grasp it, we
    save ourselves a rebirth, and experience the silence of the
    mind. If, on the other hand we choose to be reborn then our
    next option will be a death. Death is when the dancing will
    not stop; it continues on and on in the mind. That is the
    decline, the kamma of attachment; rather than face that
    decline into despair and boredom, we seek an alternative
    rebirth. That is why boredom and disillusionment are so very
    important. If we can simply bear to be with the ending of a
    cycle, that acceptance can take us beyond rebirth. </p>
    <p>So we choose. Sometimes we will be able to notice that
    movement towards the pleasant, and we will say, 'No, I don't
    really need that'. At other times we will get caught up with
    the pleasure. Then we will experience its decline, and have
    to bear with that. Remember that if you are reborn, you will
    need to die again! </p>
    <p>Nibbana, liberation, is that which is not born and does
    not die, it carries us beyond the cycle - not in terms of
    whether we will be a rabbit in the next life - but right now.
    If you get that principle right, it will always work for us
    in this way. </p>
