    'Basket of (monastic) Discipline'; PTS edition in 5 volumes
    (PTS translation: <i>Book of the Discipline</i>): </p>
    <ol>
        <li>monastic code (paa.timokkha) for monks and for nuns,
            contained in the <i>Suttavibha&quot;nga</i>, together
            with a commentary on that; </li>
        <li>the Khandhaka, dealing with the regulation of
            communal life, which is contained in the <i>Mahaavagga</i>
            and <i>Cuulavagga</i>. The <i>Mahaavagga</i> also
            contains some material on the life of the Buddha,
            etc.; </li>
        <li>the <i>Parivaara</i>, which is an abstract of the
            whole of the Vinaya Pi.taka, in dialogue form. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>References are to volume and page number, eg. Vin III 59.
    Note that:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>-Vin I and II (Mahaavagga and Cuulavagga) are
        translated as <i>The Book of the Discipline</i> vols IV
        and V.<br>
        -Vin III, IV (Suttavibha&quot;nga) are translated as <i>The
        Book of the Discipline</i> vols I, II and III.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Also note that the translation, when it gives the Pali
    page number in the midst of the translation, gives it at the
    end of that page: eg <b>[1]</b> means p.1 <i>ends</i> here.
    In all other translations, it indicates where a page of the
    original starts.</p>
    <p><a href="#Sutta"><b>SUTTA PI.TAKA</b></a>, 'Basket of

        <li><a href="#D"><b>Diigha Nikaaya</b></a><b> (DN or D)</b>:
            'Long Collection' of 34 Suttas; PTS edition in 3
            volumes; PTS translation: <i>Dialogues of the Buddha</i>.
            References are usually given to the volume and page
            number of the PTS Pali text, e.g. DN III 33. To find
            this in translation, look at <i>Dialogues of the
            Buddha</i> vol. III, then find the section
            corresponding to p33 of the Pali by looking for <b>[33]</b>
            in the body of the text, which indicates where the
            translation of p33 starts. Some authors may simply
            refer to the Sutta number, eg. Diigha no.12; but as
            the Suttas are quite long in this collection, this is
            not a very exact reference. <br>
            </li>
        <li><a href="#M"><b>Majjhima Nikaaya</b></a><b> (MN or M)</b>:
            'Middle Length Collection' of 150 Suttas; PTS edition
            in 3 volumes'; PTS translation: <i>Middle Length
            Sayings</i>. The PTS translation volumes correspond
            to the first, second and third set of 50 Suttas,
            though the PTS Pali version groups them into 1-76,
            77-100 and 101-150. Consequently vol. I of the text
            is translated in vol. I (for pp1-338 of text) and
            part of vol. II (for pp339-524) in the translation.
            References are sometimes made to the Sutta number,
            but it is more usual to refer to vol. and page number
            of the PTS Pali text, e.g. MN I 350, which can be
            found in vol.II of the translation: vol. no. and page
            no. of the Pali is given at top of the page, and the
            Pali page number is also included in the text of the
            translation: <b>[350]</b>. <br>

            subject matter; PTS edition in 5 volumes; PTS
            translation: <i>The Book of Kindred Sayings</i>.
            References are usually to volume and page number of
            the Pali text (e.g. SN III 79). These are given in
            the translation at the top of the left hand page, but
            exact Pali page-breaks are not indicated within the
            text of the translation. References are also given to
            section and Sutta number- which as the Suttas in this
            collection are each fairly short, is a reasonably
            exact way of giving a reference (though Sutta numbers
            differ in different editions). For these types of
            reference, see top of right hand page of translation
            (though this does not give the vol. number). An
            example: S.II.XV.I. 2. For this, look at <i>Kindred
            Sayings</i> vol. II, then look at contents page for
            'chapter' (sa.myutta) XV, section I, then go to this

            edition 5 volumes; PTS translation: <i>The Book of
            Gradual Sayings</i>. References are usually to volume
            and page number of the Pali text (e.g. AN IV 93).
            These are given in the translation at the top of the
            left hand page, but exact Pali page-breaks are not
            indicated within the text of the translation. (except
            in volume V). References are also given to the sutta
            number, eg. A.VI.VI.63: this can be found in the
            sixes (thus in <i>Gradual Sayings</i> vol.III- look
            at contents to find chapter VI of the sixes, then
            locate VI.VI.63 by looking at the top of the right

    <p>In the following, the canonical text title is followed by
    that of its commentary, and the title of the PTS translation
    of this commentary, where it exists. In the system adapted by
    the <i>Pali Text Society Dictionary</i>, the abbreviation for
    commentary for a text is the text abbreviation followed by
    A., e.g.: D.A. = commentary on Diigha Nikaaya. The commentary
    to the Dhammasa&quot;nga.nii also has the abbreviation Asl.
    In the system of the <i>Critical Pali Dictionary</i> (to be
    adopted in the new edition of the <i>Pali Text Society
    Dictionary</i>), there are separate abbreviations for the
    names of many of the commentaries (given below); others add
    -a or -.t, for a commentary (a.t.thakathaa) or sub-commentary
    (.tikaa) respectively. </p>

    <p align="center">(Details taken from the List of Issues
    1996-97)</p>
    <p>The Society was founded in 1881 by T.W. Rhys Davids
    &quot;to foster and promote the study of Pali Texts&quot;. It
    publishes Paali texts in roman characters, translations in
    English and ancillary works including dictionaries,
    concordances, books for students of Paali and a Journal which
    is issued on an ad hoc basis. As this List of Issues shows,
    most of the classical Texts and commentaries have now been
    edited and many works translated into English. The Society
    aims to keep almost all its publications in print and to
    produce two new volumes each year. </p>
    <p>The Society is non-profit making. It depends on the sale
    of its publications, on members' subscriptions and on the
    generosity of donors. It also provides Research Studentships
    for a number of people working in the field of Paali studies.</p>
    <p align="center"><b>Membership</b></p>
    <p>There are two categories of members, sponsoring and
    ordinary. All members may attend and vote at the Annual
    General Meeting, and purchase any of the Society's
    publications direct from the Society at the current rate of
    discount. At present members' discount is being held at the
    special rate of 20%.</p>
    <p>Sponsoring members also receive free (and post-free) one
    volume each year. They may choose which volume they wish to
    receive from the Society's current list, with the exception
    of the dictionaries and the Paali Tipi.taka Concordance. If
    the Hon. Secretary receives no message to the contrary, they
    will receive the volume nominated by the Council, normally
    the Society's latest publication. Sponsoring membership costs
    £16 for one year or £70 for five years.</p>
    <p>Ordinary membership confers no rights to receive
    publications free (or post-free). It costs£7 for one year or
    £30 for five years.</p>
