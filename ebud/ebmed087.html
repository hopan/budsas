      morning I was talking to Venerable Subbato and he was saying he never has 
      developed
      <MI><I>anapanasati</I><D>, mindfulness of the breath. So I said, &#39;Can you 
      be mindful of one inhalation?&#39; And he said, &#39;Oh yes.&#39; &#39;And of one 
      exhalation?&#39; And he said, &#39;Yes.&#39; And I said, &#39;Got it!&#39;</D></MI></FONT><D><MI><P>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There&#39;s nothing more to it than that. 
      However, one tends to expect to develop some special kind of ability to go 
      into some special state. And because we don&#39;t do that, then we think we 
      can&#39;t do it. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But the way of the spiritual life is 
      through renunciation, relinquishment, letting go
      <MI>not through attaining or acquiring. Even the
      <MI><I>jhanas</I> [1]<D> are relinquishments rather than attainments. If 
      we relinquish more and more, letting go more and more, then the jhanic 
      states are natural. </D>

      <D>

      <MI>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The attitude is most important. To 
      practise
      <MI>anapanasati<D>, one brings the attention onto one inhalation, being 
      mindful from the beginning to the end. One inhalation, that&#39;s it; and then 
      the same goes for the exhalation. That&#39;s the perfect attainment of
      <MI><I>anapanasati</I><D><I>.</I> The awareness of just that much, is the 
      result of concentration of the mind through sustained attention on the 
      breath. From the beginning to the end of the inhalation, from the 
      beginning to the end of the exhalation. The attitude is always one of 
      letting go, not attaching to any ideas or feelings that arise from that, 
      so that you&#39;re always fresh with the next inhalation, the next exhalation, 
      completely as it is. You&#39;re not carrying over anything. So it&#39;s a way of 
      relinquishment, of letting go, rather than of attaining and achieving. </D>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The dangers in meditation practice is the 
      habit of grasping at things, grasping at states; so the concept that&#39;s 
      most useful is the concept of letting go, rather than of attaining and 
      achieving. If you say today that yesterday you had a really super 
      meditation, absolutely fantastic, just what you&#39;ve always dreamed of, and 
      then today you try to get the same wonderful experience as yesterday, but 
      you get more restless and more agitated than ever before - now why is 
      that? Why can&#39;t we get what we want? It&#39;s because we&#39;re trying to attain 
      something that we remember; rather than really working with the way things 
      are, as they happen to be now. So the correct way is one of mindfulness, 
      of looking at the way it is now, rather than remembering yesterday and 
      trying to get to that state again. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The first year I meditated I didn&#39;t have a 
      teacher. I was in this little <I>kuti </I>[2] in Nong Khai for about ten 
      months, and I had all kinds of blazing insights. Being alone for ten 
      months, not having to talk, not having to go anywhere, everything calmed 
      down after several months, and then I thought I was a fully enlightened 
      person, an arahant. I was sure of it. I found out later that I wasn&#39;t.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I remember we went through a famine in 
      Nong Khai that year and we didn&#39;t get very much to eat. I had 
      malnutrition, so I thought, &#39;Maybe malnutrition&#39;s the answer. If I just 
      starve myself.<N>.<N>.<N>.&#39; I remember being so weak with malnutrition at 
      Nong Khai that my earlobes started cracking open. When I&#39;d fall asleep I&#39;d 
      have to pry my eyelids open; they&#39;d be stuck shut with the stuff that 
      comes out of your eyelids when you&#39;re not feeling very well. </N>

      </FONT></P>
      <N>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then one day this Canadian monk brought me 
      three cans of tinned milk. In Asia they have tinned sweetened milk and 
      it&#39;s very very delicious. And he also brought me some instant coffee, and 
      a flask of hot water. So I made a cup of this: put in a bit of coffee, 
      poured in some of this milk, poured hot water and started drinking it. And 
      I just went crazy. It was so utterly delicious, the first time I had 
      anything sweet in weeks, or anything stimulating. And being malnourished 
      and being in a very dull tired apathetic state, this was like high-octane 
      petrol - whoomph! Immediately I gulped that down - I couldn&#39;t stop myself 
      - and I managed to consume all three tins of milk and a good portion of 
      that coffee. And my mind actually went flying into outer space, or it 
      seemed like it, and I thought, &#39;Maybe that&#39;s the secret. If I can just get 
      somebody to buy me tinned milk.&#39; </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When I went to Wat Pah Pong the following 
      year I kept thinking, &#39;Oh, I had all those wonderful experiences in Nong 
      Khai. I had all those wonderful kind of beautiful visions, and all those 
      fantastic kind of floating experiences and blazing insights, and it seemed 
      like I understood everything. And you even thought you were an arahant.&#39; 
      At Wat Pah Pong, that first year there, I didn&#39;t have much of anything. I 
      just kept trying to do all the things I&#39;d done in Nong Khai to get these 
      things. But after a while, even using strong cups of coffee didn&#39;t work 
      any more. I didn&#39;t seem to get those exhilarations, those fantastic highs 
      and blazing insights, that I had the first year. So after the first
      <MI><I>Vassa</I><D><I> </I>[3] at Wat Pah Pong, I thought, &#39;This place is 
      not for me. I think I&#39;ll go and try to do repeat what happened in Nong 
      Khai.&#39; And I left Ajahn Chah and went to live on Pupek mountain in Sakorn 
      Nakorn province. </D>

      <MI>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There, at last, I was in an idyllic spot. 
      However, for the alms-round there you had to leave before dawn and go down 
      this mountain, which was quite a climb, and wait for the villagers to 
      come. They&#39;d bring you food, and then you had to climb all the way back 
      up, and eat this food before twelve noon. That was quite a problem. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I was with one other monk, a Thai monk, 
      and I thought, &#39;He&#39;s really very good,&#39; and I was quite impressed with 
      him. But when we were on this mountain, he wanted me to teach him English 
      - so I was really angry with him and wanted to murder him. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It was in an area where there was a lot of 
      terrorists and communists, in North-East Thailand. There were helicopters 
      flying overhead sometimes checking us out. Once they came and took me down 
      to the provincial town, wondering whether I was a communist spy. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then I got violently ill, so ill that they 
      had to carry me down the mountain. I was stuck in a wretched place by a 
      reservoir under a tin roof in the hot season with insects buzzing in and 
      out of my ears and orifices. With horrible food. I nearly died, come to 
      think of it. I almost didn&#39;t make it. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But it was during that time in that 
      tin-roof lean-to that a real change took place. I was really despairing 
      and sick and weak and totally depressed, and my mind would fall into these 
      hellish realms, with the terrible heat and discomfort. I felt like I was 
      being cooked; it was like torture. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then a change came. Suddenly, I just 
      stopped my mind; I refused to get caught in that negativity and I started 
      to practise
      <MI>anapanasati.<D> I used the breath to concentrate my mind and things 
      changed very quickly. After that, I recovered my health and it was time to 
      enter the next
      <MI><I>Vassa</I><D>, so I went back - I&#39;d promised Ajahn Chah I&#39;d go back 
      to Wat Pah Pong for the <I>Vassa </I>- and my robes were all tattered and 
      torn and patched. I looked terrible. When Ajahn Chah saw me, he just burst 
      out laughing. And I was so glad to get back after all that! </D>

      <MI>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I had been trying to practise and what I 
      had wanted were the memories of these insights. I&#39;d forgotten what the 
      insights really were. I was so attached to the idea of working in some 
      kind of ascetic way, like I did the first year, when asceticism really 
      worked. At that time being malnourished and being alone had seemed to 
      provide me with insight, so that for the following several years I kept 
      trying to create the conditions where I would be able to have these 
      fantastic insights. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But the following two or three years 
      seemed to be years of just getting by. Nothing much seemed to happen. I 
      was six months on this mountain before I returned to Wat Pah Pong, just 
      deciding to stay on and follow the insights I had. One of the insights the 
      first year was that I should find a teacher, and that I should learn how 
      to live under a discipline imposed on me by that teacher. So I did that. I 
      realised Ajahn Chah was a good teacher and had a good standard of monastic 
      discipline, so I stayed with him. Those insights that I had were right, 
      but I&#39;d become attached to the memory. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">People get very attached to all these 
      special things, like meditation retreats and courses where everything is 
      under control, and everything is organised and there is total silence. 
      Then, even though you do have insight, reflectiveness is not always there, 
      because one is assuming that to have these insights you need those 
      conditions. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Actually, insight is more and more a 
      matter of
      <MI>living<D> insightfully. It&#39;s not just that you have insight
      <MI>sometimes<D>, but more and more as you reflect on Dhamma, then 
      everything is insightful. You see insightfully into life as it&#39;s happening 
      to you. As soon as you think you have to have special conditions for it, 
      and you&#39;re not aware of that, then you&#39;re going to create all sorts of 
      complexities about your practice. </D>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So I developed letting go: to not concern 
      myself with attaining or achieving anything. I decided to make little 
      achievements possible by learning to be a little more patient, a little 
      more humble, and a little more generous. I decided to develop this: rather 
      than go out of my way to control and manipulate the environment with the 
      intention of setting myself up in the hope of getting high. It became 
      apparent, through reflection, that the attachment to the insights was the 
      problem. The insights were valid insights, but there was attachment to the 
      memory. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then the insight came that you let go of 
      all your insights. You don&#39;t attach to them. You just keep letting go of 
      all the insights you have, because otherwise they become memories, and 
      then memories are conditions of the mind and, if you attach to them, they 
      can only take you to despair. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In each moment it&#39;s as it is. With<MI> <I>
      anapanasati</I><D><I>,</I> one inhalation, at this moment, is
      <MI>this<D> way. It&#39;s not like yesterday&#39;s inhalation was. You&#39;re not 
      thinking of yesterday&#39;s inhalation and yesterday&#39;s exhalation while you&#39;re 
      doing the one now. You&#39;re with it completely, as it is; so you establish 
      that. The reflective ability is based on establishing your awareness in 
      the way it is
      <MI>now<D>, rather than having some idea of what you&#39;d like to get, and 
      then trying to get it in the here and now. Trying to get yesterday&#39;s 
      blissful feeling in the here and now means you&#39;re not aware of the way it 
      is now. You&#39;re not with it. Even with
      <MI>anapanasati<D>if you&#39;re doing it with the hope of getting the result 
      that you had yesterday, that will make it impossible for that result to 
      ever happen. </D>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Last winter, Venerable Vipassi was 
      meditating in the shrine room and someone was making quite distracting 
      noises. Talking to Venerable Vipassi about it, I was quite impressed, 
      because he said first he felt annoyed and then he decided the noises would 
      be part of the practice. So, he opened his mind to the meditation hall 
      with everything in it - the noises, the silence, the whole thing. That&#39;s 
      wisdom, isn&#39;t it? If the noise is something you can stop - like a door 
      banging in the wind - go close the door. If there&#39;s something you have 
      control over, you can do that. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But much of life you have no control over. 
      You have no right to ask everything to be silent for &#39;my&#39; meditation. When 
      there is reflectiveness, instead of having a little mind that has to have 
      total silence and special conditions, you have a big mind that can contain 
      the whole of it: the noises, the disruptions, the silence, the bliss, the 
      restlessness, the pain. The mind is all-embracing rather than specialising 
      on a certain refinement in consciousness. Then you develop flexibility, 
      because you can concentrate your mind. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is where wisdom is needed for real 
      development. It&#39;s through wisdom that we develop it, not through willpower 
      or controlling or manipulating environmental conditions; getting rid of 
      the things we don&#39;t want and trying to set ourselves up so that we can 
      follow this desire to achieve and attain. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Desire is insidious. When we are aware 
      that our intention is to attain some state, that&#39;s a desire, isn&#39;t it? So 
      we let it go. If we are sitting here, even with a desire to attain the 
      first
      <MI>jhana<D>, we recognise that that desire is going to be the very thing 
      that&#39;s going to prevent the fulfilment. So we let of the desire, which 
      doesn&#39;t mean not to do
      <MI>anapanasati<D>, but to change the attitude to it. </D>

      <D>
      <MI>
      <D>
      <MI>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So what can we do now? Develop mindfulness 
      of one inhalation. Most of us can do that; most human beings have enough 
      concentration to be concentrated from the beginning of an inhalation to 
      the end of it. But even if your concentration span is so weak you can&#39;t 
      even make it to the end, that&#39;s all right. At least you can get to the 
      middle, maybe. That&#39;s better than if you gave up totally or never tried at 
      all, isn&#39;t it? Because at least you&#39;re composing the mind for one second, 
      and that&#39;s the beginning: to learn to compose and collect the mind around 
      one thing, like the breath, and sustain it just for the length of one 
      inhalation; if not, then half an inhalation, or a quarter, or whatever. At 
      least you have started, and you must try to develop a mind that&#39;s glad at 
      just being able to do that much, rather than being critical because you 
      haven&#39;t attained the first
      <MI>jhana<D>, or the fourth. </D>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If meditation becomes another thing you 
      have to do, and you feel guilty if you don&#39;t live up to your resolutions, 
      then you start pushing yourself without an awareness of what you&#39;re doing. 
      Then life does get quite dreary and depressing. But if you are putting 
      that skilful kind of attention into your daily life, you&#39;ll find so much 
      of daily life very pleasant - which you may not notice if you are caught 
      in your compulsions and obsessions. If we act with compulsiveness it 
      becomes a burden, a grind. Then we drag ourselves around doing what we 
      have to do in a heedless and negative way. But being able to be in the 
      countryside - the trees, the fields. However we have this time for a 
      retreat - we can sit and walk; we don&#39;t have a lot to do. The morning 
      chanting, the evening chanting can be extremely pleasant for us, when 
      we&#39;re open to it. People are offering the food. The meal is quite a lovely 
      thing. People are eating mindfully and quietly. When we&#39;re doing it out of 
      habit and compulsion then it gets to be a drag. And a lot of things that 
      are quite pleasant in themselves are no longer pleasant. We can&#39;t enjoy 
      them when we&#39;re coming from compulsiveness, heedlessness, and ambition. 
      Those are the kinds of driving forces that destroy the joy and the wonder 
      of our lives. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sustaining your attention on the breathing 
      really develops awareness but when you get lost in thought or 
      restlessness, that&#39;s all right too. Don&#39;t drive yourself. Don&#39;t be a slave 
      driver or beat yourself with a whip and drive yourself in a nasty way. 
      Lead, guide and train yourself; leading onward, guide yourself rather than 
      driving and forcing yourself. Nibbana is a subtle realisation of 
      non-grasping. You can&#39;t drive yourself to Nibbana. That&#39;s the sure way of 
      never realising it. It&#39;s here and now, so if you&#39;re driving yourself to 
      Nibbana, you&#39;re always going far away from it, driving right over it.

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It&#39;s pretty heavy, sometimes, to burn up 
      attachments in our mind. The Holy Life is a holocaust, a total burning, a 
      burning up of self, of ignorance. A diamond is a symbol of the purity that 
      comes from the holocaust; something that went through such fires that what 
      was left was purity. And so that&#39;s why in our life here there has to be 
      this willingness to burn away the self-views, the opinions, the desires, 
      the restlessness, the greed, all of it, the whole of it, so that there&#39;s 
      nothing but purity remaining. Then when there is purity, there is nobody,
