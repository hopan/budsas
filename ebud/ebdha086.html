Kathina (Robe Offering) Ceremony</font></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>t was the rainy season after the
  Buddha preached his first discourse to the five ascetics of Isipatana and due to the rains
  his preaching tours were cut down and he followed the ancient practice to spend the rainy
  season &quot;Vas&quot; in one place of residence carrying out his work on the Dhamma.
  However, as time goes by, this ancient practice was not observed by some erring monks and
  they wandered about defying the elements and inviting unwarranted remarks. The Blessed One
  therefore laid down the precept of observing the &quot;Vas&quot; retreat during the
  &quot;Vassana&quot; season. It was a period for monks to recuperate after months of
  travelling about teaching the dhamma and to spend time in quiet and serious meditation,
  give dhamma talks and help laypeople and junior monks in spiritual development.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the time of the Buddha and even until now the
  &quot;Vas&quot; period remains unchanged for Theraveda monks regardless of geographical
  and climatic differences. According to the &quot;Vinaya&quot; monks may not break
  &quot;Vas&quot; except that he may leave the &quot;Vas&quot; dwelling under specified
  circumstances and must always return before seven days. If he does not, it is an offence
  for he has broken his &quot;Vas&quot;.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The place where &quot;Vas&quot; is observed should be
  conducive to spiritual and mental development of the monk as one of the main object of
  observing &quot;Vas&quot; is to practice meditation besides the opportunity of preaching
  the Dhamma more often to lay devotees. The layperson should take the opportunity of
  &quot;Vas&quot; period to discuss and learn the &quot;Dhamma&quot; with the monks.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The three months seclusion of monks for the rainy season
  ends with the &quot;Pavarana&quot; ceremony which is preceded by the &quot;Uposatha
  Kamma&quot; during which monks establish their &quot;Purisuddhi&quot; (Purity of conduct)
  and individually declared their shortcomings before their fellow brother monks and seek
  absolution. The Vinaya rules are not meant to punish but to rehabilitate an erring monk.
  They are reminders to the sangha to live within the framework of the &quot;Vinaya&quot;.
  The monks who have establish their &quot;Purisiddhi&quot; are worthy of our veneration and
  worthy of receiving our dana. Lay devotees gets the chance to show their respect and
  support of the Buddha-Sasana during the &quot;Kathina&quot; Ceremony. The
  &quot;Kathina&quot; ceremony shall be performed by monks when they have completed their
  &quot;Vas&quot;. The ceremony of giving the &quot;Kathina Robes&quot; is called
  &quot;Kathina-pinkama&quot;. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The offering of this special robe started during the time
  of the Buddha when some monks after observing the three months rain retreat were going to
  the Monastery at Savatthi where the Buddha was staying were thoroughly drenched and soaked
  to the skin by a heavy downpour and taking into consideration their conditions he
  prescribed that the &quot;Kathina&quot; ceremony shall be performed by monks when they
  have completed the &quot;Vas&quot;. After the &quot;Kathina&quot; ceremony monks may go
  out for alms to houses of people who have not invited them. They may go for alms
  collection without wearing the three sets of robes and move in groups of four or more.
  They may possess as many robes as they wanted and whatever the number of robes that the
  monks had receive shall belong to them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the custom in Theravada countries to inform the lay
  devotees of the day on which the &quot;Kathina&quot; ceremony is to be held so that they
  may participate with offerings of robes sponsorship or other requisites. The distribution
  of the robes received by the monks from the lay devotees are entirely a matter for the
  sangha members. The &quot;Kathina&quot; ceremony promotes the interdependency of the
  sangha and the laity. It is an important merit making event for Buddhists following the
  Theravada Tradition.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>End-of-vassa &amp; kathina privileges.</b> The fourth
    lunar month of the rainy season -- beginning the day after the first full moon in October
    and lasting to dawn of the day following the next full moon -- is termed the robe season,
    a period traditionally given over to robe-making. In the early days, when most bhikkhus
    spent the cold and hot seasons wandering, and stayed put in one place only during the
    Rains, this would have been the ideal period to prepare robes for their wandering, and
    would have been the ideal time for lay people who had come to know the bhikkhus during the
    Rains to show their gratitude and respect for them by presenting them with gifts of cloth
    for this purpose. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During this robe season, six of the training rules --
    Nissaggiya Pacittiya 1, 2, &amp; 3; Pacittiya 32, 33, &amp; 46 -- are relaxed as a
    privilege for bhikkhus who have observed the three-month rains residence <i>(vassa),</i>
    to make it more convenient for them to make robes. Also, any cloth accruing to a
    particular monastery during this period may be shared only among the bhikkhus who spent
    the Rains there, and not with any incoming visitors. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the bhikkhus who have spent the Rains in a particular
    monastery number five or more, they are also entitled to participate in a <i>kathina</i>
    ceremony in which they receive a gift of cloth from lay people, bestow it on one of their
    members, and then as a group make it into a robe before dawn of the following day. <i>(Kathina</i>
    means frame, and refers to the frame over which the robe-cloth is stretched, much like the
    frame used in America to make a quilt.) After participating in this ceremony, the bhikkhus
    may take advantage of the above-mentioned privileges for an additional four lunar months,
    up to the dawn after the full-moon day that ends the cold season in late February or
    early-to-mid March (called Phagguna in Pali). </font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><font color="#000080">1. The Rains
  Residence [<a href="#n1" name="1">1</a>]<br>
  </font><em>From &quot;Lay Buddhist Practice&quot;, Bhikkhu Khantipalo,<br>
  <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/bps/wheels/wheel206/rains.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/bps/wheels/wheel206/rains.html</a></em></strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font face="Times New Roman">his is a
  period of three months when bhikkhus must reside in one place and cannot wander, though
  they may undertake all their usual duties provided that they do not take them away from
  their monasteries overnight. In special circumstances they may even be absent from the
  monastery or residence where they have vowed to keep the Rains for as long as seven days.
  As bhikkhus do not withdraw more than usual at this time from involvement with lay people,
  unless they are devoting all their time to meditation, it is better to translate <i>vassavasa</i>
  literally as &quot;rains-residence&quot; rather than &quot;rains-retreat.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The rains residence was instituted by the Buddha to
  prevent bhikkhus traveling during the Rainy Season of India and S.E. Asia, and so damaging
  the crops, and the living creatures which are abundant then. No doubt he considered their
  health as well when he laid down that bhikkhus must spend the rains with four walls round
  them and a roof over their heads. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the beginning this was a time when a bhikkhu could
  live near a teacher, a senior bhikkhu who had specialized in meditation, in the
  Discipline, or in the Discourses. He had the chance then to make intensive efforts and
  learn whatever the teacher taught. After the Rains, especially in the early days when
  bhikkhus mostly wandered and had few monasteries, the teacher might receive an invitation
  to go elsewhere and the settled association with pupils would be broken. And then during
  the Rains there are fewer visitors to the quieter and more secluded monasteries so that
  more intensive efforts are possible at this time. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhist countries this is still the time for intensive
  activity: the meditator meditates more and undertakes more of the austere practices; the
  student of books makes more effort to master his studies; the teacher-monk is more active
  in teaching Dhamma and the writer in writing. In some countries this is the time when many
  laymen, mostly the young, get temporary ordination as &quot;Rains-bhikkhus&quot; (fewer
  women also become nuns for some time), usually for about four months, after which they
  disrobe and return to the layman's state. They are honored by others with the name
  &quot;pandit&quot; (a learned man) for the learning and good conduct that they have
  acquired in the monastery and benefit their families and society in general by bringing
  this knowledge back with them. This general intensification of activities in the Sangha
  leads lay people to consider what they can do during this period. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Usually a lay person on the day of entering the Rains
  makes a vow or vows to practice in a certain way during the three months of the
  Rains-residence. This vow may be told to a senior bhikkhu or it may be kept private but in
  any case it is made in front of a Buddhist shrine. This is something which could be done
  by any one who wanted to tighten up on practice for the duration of the Rains-residence.
  The content of the vows vary with one's character, country and circumstances. Below are a
  number of typical vows made by lay people on Rains-entry day, some of which could be
  practiced by isolated Buddhists: </font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">During the Rains I shall give almsfood to bhikkhus every
      day. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">I shall give up smoking while the Rains are on. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">For the Rains, I shall chant morning and evening service
      every day. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">I shall go to the monastery to hear Dhamma on every holy
      day (i.e., 4 days a month). </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">While the Rains are on I shall not take any intoxicants, or
      see or hear any form of entertainment. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">During the Rains I shall undertake the Uposatha precepts on
      each Full Moon day. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">For the whole Rains I shall practice meditation twice a
      day. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Each holy day during the Rains I shall keep the Eight
      Precepts and meditate twice, each time for an hour. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The vows must be practicable. It is no good making vows,
  perhaps quite exalted ones, which are out of one's range and only another extension of
  one's ego. A person who practices the Dhamma for a while gets to know his strength and
  weaknesses and will know therefore what it possible for him to undertake. At the end of
  the Rains, having accomplished one's vows without a break, one feels that something
  worthwhile has been done. And sometimes these temporary practices have a lasting effect --
  the smoker does not go back to tobacco, or the meditator finds that his practice goes so
  much better that he continues to sit twice a day, and so on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the Rains residence, some lay people in Buddhist
  countries undertake one or two of the austere practices which were allowed by the Buddha
  for bhikkhus. It is not possible for lay people to practice most of them but Acariya
  Buddhaghosa in his &quot;Path of Purification&quot; (Visuddhimagga) has written there (Ch.
  II para 92) that they can undertake the One-sessioner's practice and the bowl-food-eater's
  practice. For an isolated Buddhist who goes out to work, even these two could not be
  practiced. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The One-sessioner's practice means eating one meal in one
  session a day. Practiced strictly a person does not even drink foods (such as milk and
  milk beverages) at other times but having sat down eats enough to last for twenty-four
  hours. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Bowl-food-eater's practice is undertaken when a person
  does not have many plates and dishes but puts all the food to be eaten on one vessel --
  the sweet with the main part of the meal, though without necessarily mixing them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Both practices are good for limiting greed for food, for
  fine flavors and desires for fine textures, etc. Food is taken by such lay people as a
  medicine which is necessary to cure the disease of hunger. It is not used for the
  satisfaction of sensual desires. Particularly for greed characters (in which greed or
  desire is the strongest of the Roots of Evil) such restraint can be valuable. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And if during the Rains one cannot do anything else, at
  least one should at this time practice dana to the best of one's ability and in whatever
  personal ways it is possible to give. Impersonal giving, for instance, having amounts
  stopped out of one's wage packet, should be avoided as there is little or no good kamma
  made in such ways. It may be that giving time and sympathy with the effort to help others
  may be more effective than giving money or goods. The Rains traditionally is the time when
  lay people have the chance to increase their practice of dana and even though one may not
  live near to the Sangha there are still plenty of opportunities for giving. </font></p>

  Sri Lanka<br>
  </font>From: &quot;Buddhist Ceremonies and Rituals of Sri Lanka&quot;, A.G.S. Kariyawasam<br>
  <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/bps/wheels/wheel402.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/bps/wheels/wheel402.html</a></strong></em></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font face="Times New Roman">he <i>Vassa,</i>
  a three-month rains retreat, was instituted by the Buddha himself and was made obligatory
  for all fully ordained bhikkhus; the details are laid down in the Mahavagga of the Vinaya
  Pitaka (3rd and 4th chapters). The retreat extends over a period corresponding to the
  North Indian rainy season, from the day following the full moon of July until the
  full-moon day of October; those who cannot enter the regular <i>Vassa</i> are permitted to
  observe the retreat for three months beginning with the day following the August full
  moon. From the time Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka by the Arahant Mahinda, the
  observance of <i>Vassa</i> -- <i>Vas</i> in Sinhala -- has been one of the mainstays of
  monastic life in the island. During the <i>Vas</i> the monks are expected to dwell
  permanently in their temples and suspend all travelling. If unavoidable circumstances
  necessitate travelling, they are allowed to leave their residences on the promise that
  they will return within a week <i>(sattahakaraniya).</i> On the first day of the retreat
  the monks have to formally declare that they will dwell in that manner in the selected
  monastery or dwelling. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>Vassa</i> is also a time for the lay Buddhists to
  express their devotion to the cause of Buddhism by supporting the Sangha with special
  diligence, which task they regard as a potent source of merit. It is customary for
  prominent persons to invite monks to spend the <i>Vas</i> with them in dwellings specially
  prepared for the purpose. In this latter case the host would go and invite the monk or
  monks formally. If the monks accept the invitation, the hosts would prepare a special
  temporary dwelling in a suitable place with a refectory and a shrine room. On the first
  day of the <i>Vas</i> they would go with drummers and dancers to the monastery where the
  invitees reside and conduct them thence in procession. The hosts would assume
  responsibility for providing all the needs of the monk or monks during this period, and
  they attend to this work quite willingly as they regard it as highly meritorious. If no
  special construction is put up, the lay supporters would invite the monks to observe the
  retreat in the temple itself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the close of the <i>Vas</i> season, the monks have to
  perform the <i>pavarana</i> ceremony. At this ceremony, held in place of the Patimokkha
  recitation, each monk invites his fellows to point out to him any faults he has committed
  during the <i>Vas</i> period. On any day following the day of <i>pavarana</i> in the
  period terminating with the next full-moon day, the <i>kathina</i> ceremony is held.
  Different monasteries will hold the <i>kathina</i> on different days within this month,
  though any given monastery may hold only one <i>kathina</i> ceremony. The main event in
  this ceremony is the offering of the special robe known as the <i>kathina-civara</i> to
  the Sangha, who in turn present it to one monk who has observed the retreat. The laity
  traditionally offer unsewn cloth to the monks. Before the offering takes place, the robe
  is generally taken, with drumming, etc., around the village in the early hours of the
  morning. Once the robe is given to the Sangha, certain monks are selected to do the
  cutting, sewing, and dying of the robe -- all in a single day. Public contributions are
  very often solicited to buy the robe if it is not a personal offering. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This ceremony, which is performed with keen interest and
  devotion, has today become an important occasion of great social and religious
  significance for the Buddhist laity. This seems to have been so even in historical times
  when many Sinhala kings made this offering with much interest and devotion (e.g. Mhv.
  xliv,48, xci, etc). </font></p>

  Kathina Robe-Offering Ceremony<br>
  </font>Bhikkhu Dhammasami, U.K., 1977<br>
  Source: <a href="http://www.nibbana.com/">http://www.nibbana.com</a> </strong></em></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>oday we have been engaged in a
  series of programme that are part of Kathina robe-offering ceremony. It is important that
  we understand about what we are doing -- in this particular case, about Kathina ceremony;
  to be aware of some thing we are undertaking is Buddhist way of doing things which is
  technically called Right Understanding. There is more chance for Right Understanding when
  Right Mindfulness is present. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So today it is nothing but appropriate for us to reflect
  on the practice of Kathina -- the Theravada traditional robe-offering ceremony.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The word 'Kathina' is Pali in origin. It means a frame
  used in sewing robes those days in India. However, before we talk about this Kathina let
  us look at some other monastic practices related to it so that we can understand Kathina
  ceremony in a broader perspective.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>PRACTICE OF RETREAT</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kathina ceremony is necessarily a monastic one, supported
  by the generous devotees. It is essentially connected to the three months retreat that
  ends on 16th this month. (October, 1997)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We need to discuss about Buddhist Monastic Retreat as a
  background before we actually take on Kathina issue. Buddhist retreat came into existence
  as a result of complaint made by the people. Jaina monastic order was already practising
  this Vassana Retreat practice before the Buddha made His follower Bhikkhus do the same.
  The people expected monks, both Buddhist and non Buddhist, to stay in one place at least
  for a certain period. They complained that the monks were moving from place to place all
  the time without a permanent dwelling. During rainy season, the monks did damage the
  plants and crops. The Jaina monks and other mendicants observed a treat during rainy
  season staying in one place for a period. People were wondering why the disciples of the
  Gautama Buddha did not do so.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This prompted the Buddha to lay down a rule that Buddhist
  monks should observe Retreat and stay in one place for three months. People wanted them to
  do that during rainy season and it became known as Rainy Retreat (Vassana). But strictly
  speaking the three months retreat can now take place at any season -- maybe in winter or
  summer, although almost all have been observed during rainy season according to meteoric
  calendar in India. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The period is the same -- three months. This practice has
  been mostly observed during rainy season because the people wanted the monks to do so in
  ancient India -- that is mainly, as I said earlier, for agricultural reason.[*] There were
  no high ways during the Buddha's time. One had to across farm lands to travel. Therefore,
  this practice has its relevance in that 6th century BC Indian society.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nevertheless, even in India at that time the approval of
  the three months retreat practice was by no means limited to the agriculturists. It was
  seen as a means to spiritual progress as well. That was why during the time of the Buddha
  itself, Bimbisara, the King of Magadha sent an envoy to the monks asking them to come and
  observe a retreat in his kingdom. But it happened to be in summer and the monks first
  didn't accept it. Instead they referred it to the Buddha, who then relaxed the rule by
  adding that a monk could make a retreat during summer provided it is the wish of the ruler
  of the land. Therefore, the monks can also observe this practice of retreat in any other
  seasons other than rainy one if there are circumstances we have just described.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before this rule was there, the monks including the Buddha
  Himself travelled around the year and they still did so for nine months after the rule was
  laid down. Travelling and meeting people at different places is a kind of missionary life
  that the Buddha envisaged. It helps the monks not to be attached to dwelling places and
  people. It enables them to render their service to as many as possible. It frees them from
  a huge burden of constructing, maintaining and developing a big temple or monastery. It
  helps the teachings to spread everywhere as they travel. Travelling made them encounter
  with different cultures. It gave them an understanding of real nature of life. Roaming
  around empowers them to endure hard life. When you have to move from one place to another
  almost all the time, you do not gather things. You start gathering things only when you
  have the idea to settle. Since they wander most of the time their way of thinking, their
  attitude towards life and their spiritual practices are very pragmatic, realistic and are
  based on facts.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You can see now some development was taking place in
  monastic life. With this Rainy Retreat (Vassana) practice coming along, the monks got a
  bit comfortable shelter. The devotees who approach them can enjoy the opportunity of
  learning the Dhamma from the monks: they have regular and appropriate receivers in
  performing their act of generosity. Therefore, the benefit of the three months retreat is
  mutual. (Samyutta Nikaya)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I think that with the introduction of this Vassana
  practice, Buddhist monastic life came to balance its way of life. Brahmanism has secular
  lay life as its core while Jaina monastic life encouraged no shelter whatsoever such as a
  place for three months retreat. Buddhist Vassana practice could be viewed as middle way in
  this context.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A monk can choose his own time to start Rainy Retreat.
  There are two commencing dates different from one another exactly a month. But he is
  entitled to receive Kathina-civara (Kathina-robe) only if he starts his retreat with an
  earlier date -- not the later one. This is quite important condition required of a monk to
  be entitled to Kathina-robe. Within three months retreat he must not break the rule of
  retreat by spending nights somewhere else without a valid reason consented in the Vinaya
  (Buddhist Monastic Disciplinary Rules). If there is emergency reason to travel, he can do
  so even during the retreat.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To make the offering of robe especially valid as
  Kathina-civara these rules are much essential. Failing to comply with either of the two
  conditions will affect the validity of Kathina-robe. Invalid Kathina-robe, of course has
  more to do with the monks than the devotees. Though the devotees got the same merits
  whether the Kathina-robe is considered valid or not, the monks will lose the advantages
  associated with Kathina.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It means they will get the robe but he can not enjoy five
  relaxations on Vinaya that come necessarily with the validity of Kathina procedure. Once
  being offered a valid Kathina-robe in this way during this particular one month's time the
  monks can remain without following five of the 220 disciplines -- known as 'Vinaya
  Sikkhapada' for four months starting exactly a month after the end of the retreat. This is
  something about Retreat which is a precondition to Kathina-robe offering.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>INVITATION CEREMONY</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second important procedure that must be done before
  Kathina ceremony is Invitation Ceremony (Pavarana). This is again purely monastic
  practice.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Invitation means at the end of retreat the monks must get
  together and invite one another to point out at one's fault if they have seen it
  themselves or have heard from some one or are just in doubt. This would help them in
  purifying themselves. A Bhikkhu has to be open to any criticism from his colleagues
  regarding his behaviour. He can not say, &quot;Is it your business?&quot; or &quot;This is
  my life&quot;.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Being open was a way of life the Lord Buddha led. The
  monks have to be sensitive to a complaint made by the people in order to win their respect
  and in order to encourage them to learn the Dhamma. They have to be sensitive towards the
  remarks made by their fellow monks. This, according to the Buddha, could maintain both
  unity and purity in the Buddhist Monastic Order. It could also help keep the Monastic
  Rules and Regulations (Vinaya) alive. It is a kind of check-and-balance system between
  individual Bhikkhus as well as between the seniors and the juniors. This is exactly the
  core of Monastic Discipline as much as of the Teachings.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every fortnight there has to be a meeting between the
  higher ordained ones, known as Bhikkhu (monks) or Bhikkhuni (nuns) in the case of ordained
  female. In that kind of assembly, a learned monk recites the 220 rules to the monks.
  Before he recites there has to be a procedure of confession, which means every individual
  has to inform the Sangha of the offense he has committed. This kind of confession can
  clear him from 203 kinds of offenses out of 220. Confession can psychologically relieve
  someone who has committed a grave evil like patricide. The story of King Ajatasattu who
  killed his father is an example. He could not sleep until he confessed his sin to the
  Buddha. Confession did not put his sin away but practically relieved him from
  psychological burden.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In being open to others the Buddha Himself was the best
  example. At every fortnight meeting the Lord Buddha would start inviting anyone present
  there to point out His fault if any. He encouraged people to be open making Himself the
  subject of openness. That must be the reason why people felt so close to Him. They did
  respect Him for a reason. They spoke so openly their opinion to the Buddha. They knew well
  that the Buddha did not take their offense.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Venerable Sariputta, the most important figure apart from
  the Buddha would ask the monks to point out his fault too. In this way, the invitation was
  to be offered by any monk present. Actually, what we call Arahat means the one who has no
  longer secret. He is perfectly open to anyone especially regarding his behaviour.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha wanted His disciples, at least those who have
  been ordained, to be as close as possible in their spiritual quest helping one another
  along the way. The only way of doing it and maintaining it is to practice to become
  increasingly open to each other that we no longer have anything to hide. Public morality
  can be maintained in this way. Therefore, we can say that monastic life is where one has
  least privacy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This Invitation Ceremony is so important ceremonially as
  well as spiritually. Without this there can not be a proper Kathina robe-offering -- it
  may become only ordinary robe-offering with whatsoever no advantage on the part of the
  monks themselves.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The two ceremonies -- the Ceremony of Invitation and that
  of Offering Robe -- mark the termination of the Retreat.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>KATHINA CEREMONY</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now let us pick up our main topic 'Kathina'. We may well
  imagine a situation during 6th BC where any advanced textile technology hardly known to
  the people. The monks had no choice but to do the sewing the robe and giving it a dye
  themselves. The Buddha asked them to help one another using the best technique then
  available. Some made a frame while some went out in search of needle and thread. Some sew
  pieces of clothe to make it a robe while others prepared for another process of making
  fire and getting a suitable colour ready. Dying a robe was extremely difficult because
  they had to boil the bark of the tree to get the colour they wanted. Just imagine how the
  monks were busy to get a robe done. It was a hard life collecting pieces of cloth from
  different places such as rubbish-heap, cemetery, and streets to get it sufficient for a
  robe. Ordinary life was at that time reasonably hard especially regarding clothes; the
  monks were no exception; they had to struggle for a robe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But this became a kind of practice that trained monks to
  depend on themselves, to live in simple way creating no burden to the lay community and to
  be content with basic needs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Though we could say that this practice would reflect the
  economic reality in India those days, when the Lord Buddha declared this practice it was
  automatically adopted as a social norm among the followers. Those monks with well-to-do
  family and royal family background were no exception. They all adopted the practice. As we
  all know the majority of the immediate disciples of the Buddha came from either royal
  families or families of noble background They were in comfort to ignore this practice of
  making a robe in such a difficult process. Instead, they took it as a way of life with a
  great honour. This humbleness and contentment clearly indicate high spiritual achievement.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha recommended this practice to be observed at the
  end of the Retreat because monks can still be found in a large number in one place at this
  time and they could help one another.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once entitled to Kathina-robe, a Bhikkhu is permitted to
  ignore some five minor rules. The relaxation is mainly felt on travel and invitation for
  alms-giving. Normally a Bhikkhu, senior or junior has to inform his fellow Bhikkhu living
  in the same temple before he goes out. He can choose not to do it when he has received
  Kathina-robe. Usually he has to carry all the three pieces of robe wherever he goes. He
  can now leave one behind if he wishes after he has been offered Kathina-robe. He certainly
  has less restriction on travel. He can also accept as many robes if offered during the
  period of four months. Monks on the usual occasions are not supposed to accept food
  offered by someone using the terms of layman culture, the words normally employed by
  people in their social interaction. But once offered Kathina-robe(s) a Bhikkhu can receive
  such food given to him in that way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This Kathina ceremony is, as far as I can see, recommended
  by the Lord Buddha mainly for the welfare of the Sangha (the Community of monks). The Lord
  Buddha did take into consideration how the Order He founded could survive. After the
  Mahaparinibbana (the Great Passing Away) of the Buddha Himself, the whole responsibility
  of both perpetuation and propagation of His Teachings would certainly fall on the Sangha.
  Therefore, the continuity of the Sangha means the continuity of the Dhamma itself.
  Moreover, after His Mahaparinibbana, we could see the Buddha Himself only once we see,
  understand and realise the Dhamma. This was the case even when the Buddha was still alive
  for He declared that one really sees Him only once one sees the Dhamma. Now we can see the
  logic behind the recommendation of this Kathina ceremony -- how it is important for the
  cause of Buddhism itself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha did not start preaching to every one before He
  had had the Monastic Order well established. After His Enlightenment, He made a long
  journey to Benares -- a journey that took Him more than a week -- just to convert a group
  of five ascetics and made them a monk. He knew very well that all the five had a very high
  possibility of becoming a monk and forming the Order.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He continued focusing on establishing the Order until He
  became confident that the Order has been well established and was capable of helping Him
  to propagate the Dhamma. His teachings spread far and wide after He passed away. Despite
  the fact that the Buddha was no longer with us, the geographical expansion still took
  place in a greater scale. The Buddha Himself would have definitely foreseen this great
  service of His disciples that He put a lot of effort to establish the Monastic Order
  (Sangha). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Monastic Order was firmly established when the Buddha
  had ordained sixty men -- all of whom came from either royal family or that of nobility.
  Missionary work in its true sense started only then with sixty deputies, despatching them
  to different directions asking two not to go in the same way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The implication here is that the existence of the
  well-established monastic order is extremely essential if we are about to get the
  teachings of the Buddha across the people. The Arahat Mahinda simply had this in mind when
  he told King Devanam Piyatissa of Sri Lanka (3rd BC) that the Sasana (Buddha's
  Dispensation) will get rooted on Sri Lankan soil only when a Sri Lankan native monk has
  become well versed in Monastic Rules (Vinaya). [**]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There was a time in the West when European Buddhists used
  to consider that monkhood is nothing more than to set an exemplary life and to spread the
  words of the Buddha does not depend on the existence of Monastic Order.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us look at this attitude carefully from Buddhist
  History. Let us not forget to use our common sense. History always shows that the Buddhist
  Monastic Order was at the core of the matter -- whether Buddhism was on the decline or
  progress. The monks have to share more responsibility -- sometime for the degeneration and
  sometime for the growth. It is in the best interest of the whole Buddha's Sasana that
  Buddhist Monastic Order is properly maintained, purified and well supported. The Bhikkhus
  dedicate their whole life to the cause of Sasana -- studying, training, meditating,
  preaching, and writing about the Buddha's Dhamma.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this respect, we should be encouraged to see the
  Amaravati Monastery (Theravada Forest Tradition) and its branches doing very well with the
  sons and daughters of the United Kingdoms at the helm. In other European countries, the
  natives have not been very successful in furthering the Dhamma despite having produced
  several distinguished Buddhist scholars.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In contrast, if I understand the situation correctly, the
  United Kingdom has been well ahead of other European countries in both academic field and
  monastic life. We owe a lot to the most venerable monks of true missionary spirit from Sri
  Lanka, Thailand, Burma and other countries that we have made our way far in this new land.
  I am speaking about this just to remind ourselves that the Sangha of 19th and 20th century
  also deserve to be called a devout and true follower of the Lord Buddha. They -- like the
  late Venerable Narada of Vajirarama, Colombo and Venerable Dr. H. Saddhatissa -- should be
  credited for what we are here now. Venerable U Setthila (Thittila) of Burma who arrived
  here in England during World War II and Venerable Ajahn Chah, Thailand's best know
  meditation master of our time must not be forgotten for their great service rendered to
  the cause of Buddha Sasana in this United Kingdom.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Together with ceaseless support on the part of the
  devotees, the successive Kathina ceremonies held every year in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand
  and other countries have enabled the monks to carry on their missionary work far and wide.
  The Kathina ceremony we are celebrating today will have the effect just as well like that.</font></p>
