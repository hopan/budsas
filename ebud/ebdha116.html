</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This guide is aimed at providing an introduction to some
  aspects of monastic discipline for those lay people who are interested in understanding
  something of the background to the rules and conventions which structure the way of life
  of the monks and nuns of this tradition. It is hoped that these notes will be helpful in
  furthering the relationship of support between members of the Sangha and lay
  practitioners.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Generally, in the Indian spiritual tradition, there is
  difference made between those whose lifestyle is that of a householder and those who have
  &#145;gone forth&#146; from the home life to follow a path of renunciation. For the
  Buddhist renunciate, this spiritual life is guided by the principles of Dhamma-Vinaya.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist monastic discipline, called <i>Vinaya, is </i>a
  refined training of body, speech and mind. This discipline is not an end in itself, but a
  tool which, when applied in conjunction with the spiritual teachings <i>(Dhamma), </i>can
  help foster maturity and spiritual development.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Apart from the direct training that the Vinaya affords, it
  also serves to establish a supportive relationship between lay people and renunciates,
  which is an essential aspect of the Theravada tradition. Within the context of this
  relationship Buddhist monastics give up many ordinary freedoms and undertake the
  discipline and conventions of Vinaya in order to focus on the cultivation of the heart.
  They are able to live as mendicants because lay people respect their training and are
  prepared to help to support them. This gives rise to a sense of mutual respect and
  co-operation in which both lay person and samana are called upon to practice their
  particular lifestyles and responsibilities with sensitivity and sincerity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many of the Vinaya rules were created specifically to
  avoid offending lay people or giving cause for misunderstanding or suspicion. As naturally
  no samana wishes to offend by being fussy and difficult to look after, and no lay Buddhist
  wishes to accidentally cause samanas to transgress their discipline, this pamphlet
  attempts to clarify the major aspects of the Vinaya as it relates to lay people. There are
  some generally accepted activities in which it would be seen as inappropriate for members
  of the Theravada Buddhist renunciate community to involve themselves, although these may
  be quite usual activities for both Buddhist monastics of other traditions and also for
  householders. These include driving cars, growing their own food and officiating at
  marriage ceremonies. If there is any doubt about what is appropriate, it is always
  possible to ask for clarification.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">While samanas benefit from the companionship of dedicated
  lay practitioners and from being relieved from the necessity to support themselves
  materially, lay people benefit from the presence of committed renunciates, their teaching
  and their friendship. The relationship has a ritual aspect, laid out in the conventions of
  Vinaya, and when approached with wisdom and compassion, this becomes the space in which a
  greater awareness can arise.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><b>PROVIDING THE MEANS OF
  SUPPORT</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;The Vinaya as laid down by the Buddha defines, in
  its many practical rules, the status of a monastic as being one of mendicancy. Having no
  personal means of support is a very practical means of understanding the instinct to seek
  security; furthermore, the need to seek alms gives the monastic a source of contemplation
  on what fundamental things are actually necessary -- namely, the four requisites.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These four requisites -- food, clothing, shelter and
  medicines -- are what lay people can offer as a practical instance of expressing
  generosity, appreciation or their faith in belonging to the Buddhist Community. Members of
  the Sangha respond in various ways by helping spread goodwill and by making available the
  teachings of the Buddha to those who wish to hear.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080">&nbsp;<b>THE FOUR REQUISITES</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong><b>(i) Food</b></strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhist countries, where samanas make a daily
  alms-round through the streets, people make their intentions clear by standing by the side
  of the road with bowls of food, or even verbally invite the samanas to come and receive
  alms. In the West where the principles of mendicancy are not so well cultivated, there is
  less emphasis on the daily almsround. Instead supporters often bring food to the
  monasteries which can be offered for the meal that day or it can be stored in the larder.
  This stored food can then be prepared by lay guests or <i>anagarikas </i>(postulants) and
  offered as the meal for the day at a later date. Lay donors often offer food for a special
  occasion, e.g. on a memorial day for a deceased relative, or on a birthday.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Samanas should not directly request food unless they are
  sick. This principle should be borne in mind when offering food -- rather than asking
  about particular preferences, it is better simply to invite the samanas to receive the
  food you wish to offer. Considering that the meal will be the main meal of the day, offer
  what seems the right amount, recognizing that the samanas will take what they need and
  leave the rest. One way to offer is to bring bowls of food to the samanas and let them
  choose what they need from each bowl; or the food may be set on a table, and each dish
  offered so that the samanas can then help themselves. Members of the Sangha generally
  prefer to eat in silence.</font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Without getting too technical, in Vinaya food refers to
      anything that is eatable or drinkable, except plain water and those items specially
      allowed as <b>medicine </b>(see heading (iv) below). </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha allowed his samana disciples to collect, receive
      and consume food <b>between dawn and noon </b>(which<b> </b>is 1:00 p.m. in Summer Time).
      They are allowed neither to consume food outside of this time nor to store food overnight.
      </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Although samanas live on whatever is offered, many would
      encourage <b>vegetarianism </b>on ethical grounds. It is not permitted for bhikkhus to
      cook food. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">It is worth noting that, in the understanding of the <i>Vinaya
      </i>within the Forest Tradition, <b>milk </b>is considered to be a food, as are malted
      drinks such as Ovaltine and Horlicks, so these would only be allowed if offered and
      consumed between dawn and midday. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In considering the relationship between monastics and
  laity, there are certain specific rules concerning food and medicine, which are slightly
  different for bhikkhus and for siladharas.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<b><i>Offering of Food and Medicines</i></b></font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">A bhikkhu may only consume eatables and drinkables
      (including medicines) except pure water, <b>formally offered into his hands </b>or placed
      on or into something in direct contact with his hands. In order to avoid physical contact
      with a woman, Thai tradition prefers that he set down a cloth to receive things offered by
      her. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">In the monasteries, a refinement of the guideline on
      offering is practiced. This means that, once offered, neither food nor medicine should be
      handled again by a lay person, as this implies that the lay person has taken
      responsibility for the food away from the samanas who therefore should not consider it to
      be theirs. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The rule for siladharas is slightly different, in that food
      or medicine should be offered <b>&#145;by body, speech or arrangement&#146;</b>. Where
      possible it should be offered directly, e.g. women may simply hand food to a nun. Men
      should not offer food directly into the hands of a nun but may simply place it down
      directly in front of her. Alternatively a verbal invitation may be made: (&quot;This is
      for you, Sister.&quot;; &quot;I&#146;ll put this on the table for you, Sister; please help
      yourself.&quot;) </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">In the Vinaya, the <b>formal manner of offering </b>food
      and medicines is fulfilled correctly when the lay person approaches within forearm&#146;s
      distance of the samana, makes a gesture of offering and offers something that can be
      conveniently carried. All this serves to make the act of offering a mindful and reflective
      one, irrespective of what one is giving. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As with all of the conventions dealt with in this booklet,
  it is always possible to request guidance and clarification from samanas about how to
  proceed with anything concerning food and offering whenever there is any doubt.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;[<b>Footnote</b> -- One extra small refinement of
  the food offering etiquette usually observed in the monasteries is worth mentioning:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Making Fruit Allowable</i></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In accordance with the discipline a bhikkhu must take care
  when offered fruit or vegetables containing fertile seeds. It is best, if possible, for
  the seeds to be removed before offering. Another way is for the lay person to &#145;make
  the fruit allowable&#146; by slightly damaging it with a knife. So when offering these
  foods, this is done by piercing the fruit and saying at the same time &#145;kappiyam
  bhante&#146;, (meaning &quot;I am making this allowable, sir.&quot;). This rule does not
  apply to siladharas.]</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<b>(ii) Clothing</b></font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The discipline makes a standard allowance of <b>three </b>basic
      robes for bhikkhus and <b>four </b>for siladharas. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">In the forest monasteries, samanas generally make these
      robes themselves from cloth that is given. Sometimes cloth of the appropriate color is
      offered (please don&#146;t hesitate to ask for a color sample) and cloth and garments of
      plain white cotton are also useful -- which can be dyed to the correct color -- dull ochre
      for bhikkhus and dark brown for siladharas. For the thick outer robe, a woolen cloth is
      sometimes used, although the tradition for bhikkhus is to make this robe from two layers
      of thin cloth. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">In a cold climate, this basic robe allowance is
      supplemented with other garments: sweaters, T-shirts, socks, etc., and these, of an
      appropriate brown color, can also be offered. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The traditional robes plus other items all need to be of
  the appropriate color, and not of a luxurious or opulent standard.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<b>(iii) Shelter</b></font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Solitary, quiet and simple would be a fair description of
      ideal <b>lodging </b>for a samana. From the scriptures it seems that the general standard
      of lodging was to neither cause discomfort, nor to impair health, yet not to be
      indulgently luxurious. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Modest <b>furnishings </b>of a simple and utilitarian
      nature were also allowed, there being a precept against using &#145;high, luxurious beds
      and chairs&#146; -- i.e. items that are opulent by current standards. So a simple bed is
      an allowable thing to use, and for the benefit of the back, many monastics prefer a firm
      surface. However, those hosting visiting monks and nuns can rest assured that almost
      certainly whatever is offered would be acceptable and in keeping with the training of
      samanas to be easy to look after. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The Vinaya precepts do not allow bhikkhus to sleep for more
      than 3 nights in the same room as an unordained person, and neither bhikkhus nor
      siladharas should lie down in the same room with a person of the opposite sex unless in
      exceptional circumstances, e.g. when ill. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, in providing a temporary lodging for the night, a lay
  person need not go to a lot of trouble to provide anything special -- a simple spare room
  is adequate -- but there should be suitably private sleeping and bathing arrangements.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<b>(iv) Medicines and Tonics</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Vinaya, medicines can be considered as those things
  consumed by eating or drinking which are not normally considered as food and:</font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">which are <b>specifically for illness, </b>e.g.
      pharmaceuticals, homeopathic remedies, vitamin supplements etc.; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">which have a <b>tonic or reviving quality </b>(such as tea
      or sugar); </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">which have a <b>nutritional value </b>in times of
      debilitation, hunger or fatigue (certain specified items such as fruit juice.) </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In contrast to food, monastics may store these medicines
  overnight. <b>For bhikkhus, </b>there are different limitations regarding the amount of
  time that such &#145;medicines&#146; can be stored:</font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">&#145;One-day&#146; allowance: Filtered fruit Juice (i.e.
      free of pulp) of any fruit. These juices are allowed to be received and drunk any time
      between one dawn and the dawn of the next day -- this time-limit prevents the chance of
      fermentation. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">&#145;Seven-day&#146; allowance: Ghee, animal or vegetable
      oil, honey and any kind of sugar (including molasses) can be kept and consumed any time up
      to the dawn of the eighth day after which they were received. In modern times, certain
      other tonics are considered allowable. Donors should not hesitate to ask for
      clarification. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">&#145;Life-time&#146; allowance: Pharmaceutical medicines,
      vitamins; plant roots such as ginger, ginseng; herbal decoctions, such as chamomile;
      beverages such as tea, coffee and cocoa. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>For siladharas, </b>all medicines are considered
  lifetime allowances.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Medicines which are not consumed orally, e.g. creams,
  massage oils, ear or eye drops, etc. may also be useful. These do not need to be formally
  offered into the hands in the way food or consumable medicines do.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<b>Other Requisites</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also allowed monastics to make use of other
  small requisites, such as needles, a razor, etc. In modern times, such things might
  include a pen, a clock, a torch, etc. All of these were to be plain and simple, costly or
  luxurious items being expressly forbidden. Requisites may be communally owned by the
  monastic community, especially larger items, e.g. furniture, electronic equipment, etc.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><b>EXTENDING AN INVITATION
  (PAVARANA)</b></font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The principles of mendicancy forbid samanas from asking for
      anything, unless they are ill, without having received <b>prior invitation. </b>(Two
      exceptions: samanas may always ask for pure water and may make other requests from family
      members.) So, as noted above, if there is the intention to give food or medicines, rather
      than wait for a samana to make a request, this can be made clear by saying, for example,
      &quot;May I offer you some of this food?&quot;; &quot;May I offer you some tea?&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">One can also make invitation, &#145;<i>pavarana</i>&#146;,
      to cover any circumstances that you might not be aware of -- a health problem, need for a
      toothbrush, etc. -- by saying, e.g. &quot;If you are in need of any medicine or
      requisites, please let me know.&quot; To avoid misunderstanding it is better to be quite
      specific, such as -- &quot;If you need any more food...,&quot; &quot;If you need anything
      while you are staying here&#133;,&quot; &quot;If you ever need a new pair of
      sandals&#133;&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Unless specified, an invitation is generally considered as
      lasting for up to 4 months, after which time it lapses unless renewed. Specifying the time
      limit, or giving some indication of the scope of the offering prevents misunderstanding --
      so that, for instance, when you are intending to offer some fruit juice, the monastic
      doesn&#146;t get the impression that you want to buy a washing machine for the monastery! </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><b>INAPPROPRIATE
  ITEMS</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<b>(a) Luxurious Belongings</b></font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">In general, it is inappropriate for a samana to accept any <b>luxurious
      items. </b>This is because they may stimulate attachment in the samana and may excite envy
      in others, possibly even the intention to steal. It also seems inappropriate for an alms
      mendicant, living on charity as a source of inspiration to others, to have opulent
      belongings. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<b>(b) Money</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Vinaya specifies a prohibition for monks to <b>receive
  money (&#145;gold and silver&#146;), to instruct others to receive it or to consent to
  money being kept on one&#146;s behalf. </b>Thus the use of and control over personal
  funds, whether these are in the form of coins, bank notes or credit cards, is forbidden to
  samanas. Financial donations made to the Sangha are looked after by trusted lay
  supporters:</font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">In practical terms, monasteries are administered
      financially by <b>lay stewards, </b>who then make open invitation for the Sangha to ask
      for what they need, under the direction of the senior incumbent of each monastery. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The stewards are the Trustees (or other lay people acting
      on their behalf) of the charitable Trusts which oversee the financial affairs of each of
      the monasteries. (For a list of the stewards of the monasteries, please see appendix). </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Generally, individual Sangha members have to consult with a
      senior member of the community before they may take up the stewards&#146; offer, for
      example, to pay for dental treatment, or to obtain footwear or necessary medicines. This
      is to ensure that the donations that are given to support the Sangha are used responsibly
      and according to the intention of the donors. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The following is an outline of the suitable way to make
  offerings of financial support to samanas:</font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">If lay people wish to give something to a particular
      samana, but are uncertain what that individual might need, they should approach the samana
      in order to <b>make invitation </b>(<i>pavarana</i>). Financial donations should not be
      made directly to an individual samana, but placed in a donation box, given to one of the
      anagarikas (dressed in white) or to one the lay stewards of the monastery, making it clear
      if such a offering is intended for a particular item or for the needs of a certain samana.
      </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">If inviting a member of the Sangha to visit, for example,
      for a teaching engagement, money to cover travelling expenses can be given to an
      accompanying anagarika or accompanying lay person, who can then buy tickets, drinks for a
      journey or anything else that the samana may need at that time. It is quite a good
      training for a lay person to actually consider what items are necessary, and offer those
      rather than money. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080">&nbsp;<b>RELATIONSHIPS</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<b>(Bhikkhus with
  women, siladharas with men)</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The rules around relationships between samanas and members
  of the opposite sex can often lead to misunderstanding and so it is worth detailing some
  of the conventions that govern this.</font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Samanas lead lives of total celibacy, in which any kind of
      intentional erotic behavior is forbidden. This includes even suggestive speech or physical
      contact with lustful intent -- which are very serious offences against the discipline for
      both bhikkhus and siladharas. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">As one&#146;s intent may not be always obvious (even to
      oneself) and one&#146;s words not always guarded, it is a general principle for bhikkhus
      and siladharas to refrain completely from any physical contact with members of the
      opposite sex. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Bhikkhus should have another male present who can
      understand what is being said when talking with a woman, and similarly siladharas should
      have another woman present when speaking to a man. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Much of this standard of behavior was laid down in the
  Buddha&#146;s time to prevent scandalous gossip or misunderstanding occurring. In the
  stories that explain the origination of a rule, there are examples of bhikkhus being
  accused of being a woman&#146;s lover, of a woman misunderstanding a bhikkhu&#146;s reason
  for being with her, and even of a bhikkhu being thrashed by a jealous husband!</font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">So to prevent such misunderstandings, however groundless, a
      siladhara should be with another woman whenever in the presence of a man, and a monk has
      to be accompanied by a man whenever in the presence of a woman -- for instance, on a
      journey or sitting in a secluded place (one would not call a meditation hall or a bus
      station a secluded place). </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Generally, samanas would also refrain from carrying on
      correspondence with members of the opposite sex, other than for matters pertaining to the
      monastery, arrangements, providing basic information, etc. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080">&nbsp;<b>TEACHING DHAMMA</b></font><font
  face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The samana as Dhamma teacher must find the appropriate
      occasion to give the profound and insightful teachings of the Buddha to those who wish to
      hear it. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">There are numerous definitions of what is appropriate --
      where a samana is not annoying people by teaching without invitation, nor in the context
      where the teachings cannot be reflected upon adequately. This is a significant point, as
      the Buddha&#146;s teachings are meant to be a vehicle that one should first contemplate
      and then apply. The value of Dhamma is greatly reduced if it is just received as chitchat,
      or speculative talk. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Accordingly for a Dhamma talk, it is good to set up a room
      where the teachings can be listened to with respect being shown to the speaker. In terms
      of etiquette this means affording the speaker a seat and a role that is appropriate for
      the occasion. It may be an informal dialogue where one should arrange the seating to help
      facilitate conversation; or it may be a situation where the teacher will be at the front,
      addressing the group. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Whatever the occasion, it is always good to consult with
      the speaker on how best to encourage participation, when to ask questions, etc. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also, when inviting samanas, for instance, for the meal or
  a teaching engagement, it is usual for the person making the invitation to also make the
  travel arrangements.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><b>MINOR MATTERS OF ETIQUETTE</b></font><font
  face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vinaya also extends into the realm of convention and
  custom. These observances are not &#145;rules&#146; but can be seen as skilful means of
  manifesting beautiful behavior. In monasteries, there is some emphasis on such matters as
  a means of establishing harmony, order and pleasant relationships within a community. Lay
  people may be interested in applying such conventions for their own training in
  sensitivity, but it is important for visitors to note that these are not to be considered
  as an imposed or obligatory standard. Such practices should only be entered into
  reflectively, when the individual is ready to do so.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<b>Addressing Members of the
  Renunciate Community</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Western monasteries of the Thai Theravada Forest
  Tradition, there are different titles used in addressing monastics:</font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The title &#145;Venerable&#146; may be prefixed before a
      bhikkhu&#146;s Pali name, e.g. Venerable Jayamangalo. The Thai form <i>&#145;Tan&#146; </i>may
      also be used for monks, e.g. Tan Parisuddho. &#145;Sister&#146; is the respectful title
      used for nuns, e.g. Sister Sujata. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Both bhikkhus and siladharas who have been in the community
      for more than ten years are referred to as <i>&quot;Ajahn&quot; </i>(a Thai word, from the
      Pali <i>acariya, </i>which means &quot;teacher&quot;). Sometimes one might hear a senior
      bhikkhu referred to as &quot;Tan Ajahn.&quot; Both titles may be prefixed to the Pali name
      of the samana or used on its own, e.g. &quot;Excuse me, Ajahn<i>...,&quot; </i>&quot;Ajahn
      Sujata is coming.&quot;, &quot;Is Tan Ajahn Parisuddho here?&quot; etc. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">All bhikkhus may be addressed with the word <i>&#145;Bhante&#146;,
      </i>and all siladharas with the respectful form &#145;Sister&#146;. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The Thai way of addressing someone who is considered a very
      venerable elder is &#145;Luang Por,&#146; which means &#145;Venerable Father,&#146; e.g.
      Tan Ajahn Chah is often referred to as Luang Por Chah. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<b>Gestures of Respect</b></font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">There is the custom of bowing to a shrine or teacher. This
      is done when first entering their presence or when taking leave. Done gracefully at the
      appropriate time, this becomes a beautiful gesture that honors the person who does it. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Another common gesture of respect is to place the hands
      together in front of the chest, the fingers pointing upwards. The gesture of then raising
      the joined hands to the slightly lowered forehead is called <i>&#145;anjali&#146;. </i>This
      is a pleasant means of greeting, bidding farewell, saluting the end of a Dhamma talk, or
      concluding an offering. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Body language is something that is well-understood in
  Asian countries. Some of these customs are maintained as a training in bringing attention
  into the body and for the benefit of bringing into awareness the importance of physical
  gestures of respect.</font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">While listening to a Dhamma talk, an upright posture shows
      the listener&#146;s attention is with the speaker. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Custom holds that it is disrespectful to point one&#146;s
      feet at a shrine or a Buddha image, or to lie down in a shrine room (unless a sleeping
      place for the night is offered there). </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">It is considered respectful to duck slightly if having to
      walk between people who are speaking. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Similarly one would not stand looming over samanas to talk
      to them or to offer them something but rather, where possible (age and flexible joints
      permitting) to approach them on the level at which they are sitting. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<b>Appropriate Dress</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When visiting or staying as a guest at monasteries, it is
  suitable for both men and women always to be modestly dressed.</font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Loose, comfortable clothing is recommended. T-shirts, long
      sleeved tops, long trousers and suitably long skirts are all appropriate clothing for
      wearing in the monastery. Even in warm weather, shorts are not suitable. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Shoes should be taken off when entering most of the
      monastery buildings where people sit on the floor: shrine rooms, meditation halls, meeting
      rooms, retreat facilities, etc. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><b>CONCLUSION</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;These conventions have evolved as an aid to
  liberation. Sincere effort is required both to undertake the discipline oneself, and to
  support others in that undertaking, as well as to learn how to make it effective in
  leading to the goal. In bringing us into relationship based on our aspiration to cultivate
  the spiritual path, it is this sincere effort which renunciates and householders alike can
  respect and honor. This short guide has sought to introduce some of the main aspects of
  the discipline, in order to ease the way for those who are interested in entering into
  this relationship, and exploring how this influences our mutual well-being.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is not an exhaustive account of the <i>Vinaya, </i>and
  so individuals are whole-heartedly encouraged to ask for more information if there is
  anything that is not clear.</font></p>
