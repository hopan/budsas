      <P>I</FONT>n Christian literature of the lighter sort we sometimes come 
      across the expression &quot;Little Devil DOUBT.&quot; This personage is not known to 
      Buddhists, but another little devil can be still more devastating. He is 
      an ugly little Mara, named CONCEIT. Unlike his big brother Pride, who is 
      not lacking in dignity, Conceit is a mean, slinking little devil, lurking 
      in dark corners and always ready to rush out and nip our heels. Doubt is 
      slain when the disciple wins the stream: Conceit being a manifestation of 
      Pride, remains a menace to the very end.</P>
      <P>Pride in all its forms, devolves from self-esteem, which is in reality 
      &quot;ego-worship.&quot; It stems, so they say, from Greed, the first of the Roots 
      of evil. The thought here is rather subtle: when the ordinary person 
      thinks of greed he thinks first of what one puts into one&#39;s tummy -- that 
      second helping of plum-pudding, or the consumption of a pound of candies 
      in a single evening. The commentators of old were much more drastic. Greed 
      is &quot;delight in one&#39;s own possessions.&quot; Hence we can be greedy about 
      anything to which we have affixed the label &quot;mine.&quot; My car, my table, my 
      cat, my best beloved. The Greedy aspect of Conceit is recognized when we 
      realize we are &quot;taking delight&quot; in our own good qualities or capacities.</P>
      <P>Conceit can arise from the most trivial cause. One completes a piece of 
      work, and having made a good job of it, one is naturally pleased. There&#39;s 
      no harm in that: we all know the difference between a worker whose only 
      interest is his pay-packet, and the man who takes pride in his work. The 
      trouble arises when we begin to make comparisons -- &quot;X. couldn&#39;t have done 
      it half as well.&quot; That may be quite true, but it is dangerous to think 
      that because one&#39;s skill is superior in a single instance that one is 
      therefore a better person. That is &quot;Superiority Conceit,&quot; and it has its 
      counterpart in the &quot;Inferiority Conceit&quot; of the unsuccessful person, and 
      the &quot;Equality Conceit&quot; of the man who says &quot;I&#39;m as good as you.&quot; With the 
      underlying implication &quot;And a good deal better!&quot;</P>
      <P>A feeling of superiority is a very pleasant mental state, but it is 
      essentially <I>akusala</I> -- unhealthy and unskilled, highly dangerous in 
      its results.</P>
      <P>Any conceit that arises in connection with the practice of Dhamma is 
      much to be deplored. This sometimes occurs when students are making good 
      progress in their studies. Some queer experience or flash of &quot;insight&quot; is 
      assumed to be a sign of virtue or an advance towards Higher Consciousness, 
      and the student, instead of checking up on his experience with a wise 
      teacher, jumps to the conclusion that he is half-way to being an Arahant. 
      We do well to remember that no two people have exactly the same experience 
      in regard to meditation practice. The was recognized in the Buddha&#39;s own 
      day: Sariputta was revered for his wisdom, and Moggallana for his psychic 
      powers, but both were venerated as &quot;Great Beings.&quot;</P>
      <P>Conceit is very prone to arise when one is praised for some particular 
      work or mental quality. Within limits praise from a knowledgeable person 
      is stimulating and encouraging; some people who are modest or diffident by 
      nature can only work well when they are appreciated. The trouble is that 
      too much praise, particularly if it borders on flattery, stimulates the 
      sense of &quot;I&quot;-ness. The ego sticks out its chest and feels two inches 
      taller; it has a delicious feeling of security and believes itself to be 
      invulnerable!</P>
      <P>This is the nasty sort of pride that the ancient Greeks called <I>
      hubris</I>; it was looked upon as an insult to the gods, and when the 
      Olympians found a man suffering from it they unloosed Nemesis, the goddess 
      of revenge, who brought him to death or destruction.</P>
      <P>The cultivation of humility is not easy; there&#39;s a temptation to 
      indulge in mock-modesty, and untruthfully disclaim any real achievement, 
      and still worse to be conceited about not being conceited. It is wiser, I 
      think, to tackle Conceit at its first uprising; if one can do that, then 
      Humility will develop in the natural course of events.</P>
      <P>For our comfort we find that much can be done to curb the activities of 
      this persistent Mara. Pride has been aptly described as the &quot;giant weed.&quot; 
      We may grub up a few roots in this life-span, but the thing has already 
      gone to seed and will appear in the future.</P>
      <I>
      <P>One year&#39;s seeds<BR>
      Seven years weeds</P>
      </I>
      <P>say the old gardeners. If we acquire the habit of eradicating conceit 
      in this life, the habit will travel on in our sankharas and bear good 
      fruit in future lives.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Methods</P>
      </B>
      <P>1. Recognize Conceit whenever he pops up and <I>name</I> him. This as 
      readers will remember is the advise given by Nyanaponika Thera in his 
      valuable articles in &quot;Sangha.&quot; Mara, like Satan, hates to be recognized. 
      This practice is doubly effective because it &quot;keeps one on one&#39;s toes,&quot; 
      and induces a real dislike of the tendency.</P>
      <P>2. Get back to the first two &quot;steps&quot; of the Noble Eightfold Path (a) 
      Right Understanding of the mental quality or capacity involved: to see 
      according to reality &quot;This (quality) is not mine; I am not this; there is 
      no self in it&quot;; (b) Right Aspiration towards the expunging of Conceit. In 
      the Discourse on Expunging (M.N. I.8) we read &quot;Now I say that the arising 
      of thoughts is very helpful in regard to skilled states of mind. Therefore 
      the thought should arise &#39;Others may be harmful; as to this we will not be 
      harmful&#39; and so on for all our evil propensities. Others may be conceited; 
      but we as to this will not be conceited.&#39;&quot;</P>
      <P>The method of analysis is also helpful. &quot;I&quot; am being praised for some 
      real or imagined virtue, say generosity. Generosity is non-greed (<I>alobha</I>) 
      one of the Good Roots, and as such appears in the list of dharmas given in 
      the Abhidharma philosophy. According to Mahayana &quot;All dharmas are empty of 
      own-being&quot; -- that is to say they are non-existent. Therefore &quot;I&quot; am being 
      praised for something which doesn&#39;t exist. This is so absurd that it 
      knocks the bottom out of my conceit.</P>
      <P>Alternatively &quot;I&quot; am the result of past kamma. My talents are not due 
      to my own virtue, but have arisen on account of the skilled actions 
      performed by vanished personalities whose kammic descendant &quot;I&quot; am. 
      Therefore it is silly of me to be conceited about qualities which are not 
      in any real sense &quot;mine.&quot;</P>
      <P>Again and again in the suttas we find the expression &quot;Thus must you 
      train...&quot; This is Buddhist mental culture: it is Right or Supreme Effort 
      to put down unskilled mental states and prevent them rising in the future, 
      and furthermore to encourage the arising of skilled states.</P>
      <P>A word of warning may not be out of place here. It is inadvisable to 
      dwell too much on our so-obvious faults. By unwisely reflecting on them we 
      encourage them to root themselves still more firmly in our unconscious 
      (i.e., our <I>sankharas</I>). Instead remember the advice of Paul the 
      Apostle &quot;Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest... 
      whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if 
      there be any virtue, if there be any praise, <I>think on these things</I>.&quot; 
      We as Buddhists have the Buddha Dhamma to think about -- &quot;lovely in the 
      beginning, lovely in the middle, lovely in the ending.&quot; This as Dr. Henn 
      Collins has pointed out is the true philosopher&#39;s stone whose alchemy will 
      transmute the base metal of our ordinary consciousness into the gold of 
      Enlightenment.</P>

      <P>F</FONT>ew of us are free from Pride in one form or another. We know 
      that in the interests of spiritual development it must be killed out. We 
      are taught as much, and accept the teaching without question. But the 
      method by which Pride may be eliminated is a problem not easy to solve, 
      and the indirect, sweeping precepts of the sages are of little practical 
      help to us. It is all very well saying: &quot;Kill out this, and kill out 
      that,&quot; but what we want to know is, how may we go about it?</P>
      <P>In the first place: what <I>is</I> Pride?</P>
      <P>Let us call analogy to our aid. Regard pride as a weed, propagating 
      itself with alarming fecundity in the garden of the mind. Its root is not 
      visible, but the flowering shoots are in plain view. Cut down these shoots 
      and either they grow again or the roots puts out new ones. The only way to 
      destroy it is to dig it up altogether. That root is <I>Self-Esteem</I>. 
      From it grow the roots of <I>Conceit, Boastfulness, Ambition, Jealousy, 
      Envy and Intolerance</I>. There are others, but let us take these six 
      manifestations for the sake of discussions. Unbiased, detached 
      self-scrutiny will disclose what others may exist in one&#39;s own character, 
      and it is unlikely that all will be found equally developed. There is 
      cause for alarm when we discover them in ourselves. Pride is invariably 
      despised when observed in others, yet we sometimes boast of possessing it. 
      &quot;I have my pride, you know,&quot; is a common assertion.</P>
      <P>Beneath every manifestation of Pride, lies <I>Self-Esteem</I>. It is 
      the conviction of superiority over others -- the feeling that we are what 
      they are not, or that we can do what they cannot do. Successes in early 
      childhood may sow the seeds of it. The praise of relatives fosters it. 
      Once planted, it grows, and not even the flattening criticism by one&#39;s own 
      contemporaries in adolescence can stop it. By and by it becomes a habit to 
      compare oneself with the people one meets or passes in the street, 
      generally to their disadvantage. What we know of our own accomplishments 
      is measured by what we presume they lack. We think we know our friends 
      inside and out, and our judgments are based on a firm belief in the 
      infallibility of our perception. There is a tendency to group those who 
      are not obviously outstanding under the heading of &quot;Ordinary People,&quot; and 
      sometimes to place them in the inferior category for no more reason than 
      that they look as if they belong there. How often we hear the remark: &quot;He 
      seems so ordinary, but when you get to know him there&#39;s a lot in him!&quot; We 
      are surprised to see our spot judgment wrong -- that there really is 
      something in that very ordinary-looking person. Can we honestly claim to 
      be free of this habit of automatically comparing others with our own ideas 
      of ourselves? If so, then <I>Self-Esteem</I> is not present.</P>
      <P>It would be bad enough if Pride flourished in no more then <I>
      Self-Esteem</I>, but it must manifest itself in every way it can. It 
      strives to show on the surface, which is perhaps just as well, for then it 
      becomes obvious. <I>Conceit</I>, first shoot of the weed Pride, is <I>
      Self-Esteem</I> manifesting in visible form. Not content with merely 
      feeling superior to the people around us, we show it in our bearing. A 
      glance from some passer-by of the opposite sex may be interpreted as a 
      look of approval. The fine figure reflected in the shop window as we pass 
      engenders a feeling of warm satisfaction. Smart clothes, we believe, do 
      justice to our carriage. We may not be so tall as that person over yonder, 
      but we have a more distinguished look. No one would pick out any one of 
      them in a crowd, but all can see we are different. Crude, isn&#39;t it? But 
      that is the way <I>Conceit</I> affects us, and its crudity is indeed 
      shocking when self-analysis brings us face to face with it. Inspired by a 
      consciousness of a desire for Truth, our minds turn the searchlight of 
      enquiry inwards upon our own characters, and then there dawns the 
      realization that <I>Conceit</I> has been part of us for as long as we 
      remember. Formerly, we would have angrily denied the charge of being 
      conceited. Now we see that it is well founded. Our &quot;apartness,&quot; our 
      treasured &quot;individuality,&quot; is plainly one of its aspects.</P>
      <I>
      <P>Conceit</I> has grown without its presence being suspected, and an even 
      more dangerous and disgusting shoot has sprung up beside it. This is <I>
      Boastfulness</I> -- <I>Self-Esteem&#39;s</I> oral manifestation. One of our 
      national conventions is the taboo on bragging, and the idea of voicing a 
      plain, undisguised boast would shock us as much as it would disgust the 
      conventional listener. a very admirable convention too -- but it by no 
      means eliminates <I>Boastfulness</I>, for there are other ways of 
      boasting, and as long as the <I>desire</I> to call attention to oneself 
      exists, that particular ramification of Pride is a danger. We can get 
      others to boast for us. We can also impress them (particulary our 
      relations) that they sing our praises to others. In this way we gain more 
      than were it to come from ourselves, and run no risk of its incurring 
      disagreeable criticism. We can seek publicity and, once gained, declaim 
      it. We may artfully bring a conversation round to a point at which we 
      &quot;modestly&quot; have to admit to something we are really proud of. It takes a 
      certain amount of courage to probe one&#39;s own secret heart and bring to 
      light some of the many ways in which we who sincerely believe ourselves to 
      be guiltless can actually indulge in <I>Boastfulness</I>. It is one of the 
      most persistent roots of the weed of Pride, and the most dangerous because 
      so frequently overlooked.</P>
      <P>There are two kinds of <I>Ambition</I>. There is <I>Wrong Ambition</I>, 
      and <I>Right Ambition</I>. One is based on <I>Self-Esteem</I>; the other 
      is free of any taint of it. <I>Wrong Ambition</I> is the desire to excel 
      or succeed in order to enhance one&#39;s standing -- one&#39;s reputation. It is 
      the urge to achieve with the object of &quot;putting the other chap&#39;s eye out!&quot; 
      In its more acceptable, and therefore more insidious aspect, it is the 
      will to gain admiration and respect -- to become, in fact, a worldly 
      &quot;success,&quot; which nearly always means a financial success. Confident of our 
      great worth, we cannot be satisfied until repeated success have called the 
      attention of others to it. We feel that wealth is a concrete recognition 
      of it.</P>
      <I>
      <P>Right Ambition</I>, on the other hand, is above itself. It is the will 
      to succeed, not for the gratification of self-esteem, but to further 
      achievement for its own sake. The painter who strives to express 
      adequately the idea inspiring him -- the poet who seeks to express an 
      emotion as it has never been expressed -- the craftsman ever intent on 
      bettering his achievement -- all are followers of <I>Right Ambition</I>. 
      Their &quot;selves&quot; are forgotten. They work as instruments, and they feel that 
      in the expression of their art is little personal, but rather a universal 
      power whose tools they are. Noblest ambition of all is the desire to 
      achieve an objective of disinterested service to one&#39;s fellow creatures, 
      whether human or animal. it is sometimes gratifying to learn how many of 
      us have this objective.</P>
      <I>
      <P>Jealousy</I> might be defined as the resentment felt against another 
      for competing at the same level. Note that it is <I>at the same level</I> 
      that competition begets jealousy. An admission of inferiority by the other 
      will quickly banish the jealousy we may feel against him. Those we admit 
      to be our superiors do not arouse our jealousy. It is a bestial emotion, 
      but one that undoubtedly had its uses in our passage through the lives in 
      the Instinctive Mind, for it was an aid to our survival. Carried over into 
      the influence of Intellect it has no place, and puts a drag on our upward 
      progress. He who is at one moment the object of our jealousy, is regarded 
      with affection once that jealousy has been smothered. What may has served 
      us for the conservation of the means of life when we existed in a lower 
      condition is now no more than a vehicle for Pride&#39;s manifestation, and its 
      redundancy is obvious the moment the reason has torn Jealousy&#39;s red veil 
      from the perception. We know it is useless, and long to rid ourselves of 
      it. We seem to succeed, and then conditions come about favorable to its 
      reappearance, and the unwelcome pangs are felt again. Remember, then, that 
      it is a shoot of <I>Self-Esteem</I> and until that root has been killed 
      out the shoot may be beaten down only to blossom again.</P>
      <P>We joke about <I>Envy</I>, and are inclined to look on it as less 
      despicable than Jealousy, its near relative. Think about it -- think over 
      and around it -- define it to yourself -- get to know it. When the nature 
      of an unpleasant thing is known, it is less to be dreaded. With all these 
      ramifications of the weed of Pride the same approach can be recommended. 
      Define them to yourself. Figure out what they are and how much you are 
      subject to their influence. <I>Envy</I> can be called the resentment felt 
      against another for possessing that which one values and does not posses 
      oneself. It may be only a gentle resentment sometimes, but is dangerous 
      nevertheless, for it may become fierce. Underlying it is the feeling, &quot;Why 
      should he have it, and not I?&quot; <I>Self-Esteem</I> is outraged.</P>
      <P>Then there is <I>Intolerance</I>. Sometimes it is the only form of 
      Pride we are subject to. It is often the most robust shoot of the whole 
      plant. It springs directly from <I>Self-Esteem</I>, for it is a refusal to 
      accept anything that conflicts with our own ideas. It is to brand as wrong 
      all that to us is not right. <I>Intolerance</I> causes us to condemn a 
      person for doing that with which we disagree, but let him do just what we 
      would do ourselves and -- here is what is so unreasonable -- a feeling of 
      jealousy may be aroused. Pride sweeps us first one way, then another. 
      There is no keeping our feet when once in its grasp. Don&#39;t expect Pride to 
      be in any way &quot;reasonable,&quot; for it wilts and disappears in the light of 
      reason, its greatest foe.</P>
      <P>We are repeatedly being asked: &quot;Why carry the burden of Pride? Throw it 
      aside! It is so much relief to rid yourselves of its weight and know the 
      lightness of freedom!&quot; We feel inclined to retort: &quot; That&#39;s all very well, 
      but <I>how</I> can we get rid of it? We know we must, but we don&#39;t know 
      how to begin!&quot;</P>
      <P>The sickle which can cut down these roots is Reason -- calm reflection 
      -- Meditation. Make it your task for a few weeks to give up half an hour 
      daily for reasoning it out, and the results may amaze you. Look at 
      yourself, as it were, from outside. Be honest with yourself, in making a 
      searching examination to determine how Pride is manifesting through you, 
      for fair self-analysis is in itself a powerful weapon to use against it. 
      Classify those manifestations. Reason them out. Do they make sense? In 
      your everyday life try and form the habit of watching with interest to 
      spot each of Pride&#39;s several shoots as it appears, and once a week spend a 
      meditation hour in asking yourself for a detailed report of every one 
      noted. Form a picture in your mind of the perfect character, and compare 
      your own character with it. For example, say to your self: &quot;Now, I think 
      there was an inclination to boast in my remark to Mrs. So-and-so at tea 
      yesterday. How would the Ideal Being have acted under the circumstances?&quot; 
      Or again: &quot;Would the Ideal Being have considered himself superior in 
      bearing to those ugly people I passed in such-and-such a street? Of course 
      not! He would have been above that.&quot; The power of standing apart from, and 
      criticizing, the Ego who is subject to Pride, allows you to find 
      satisfaction in adverse criticism from others. Whereas formerly you felt 
      bitter if ridiculed or put &quot;in the wrong,&quot; it now amuses you, for you see 
      what good medicine it is for the Self you desire to set free. When others 
      treat you with intolerance, welcome it, for they are doing you a favor by 
      striking direct at your own intolerance. Seek those things which formerly 
      aroused in you the pangs of Envy or Jealousy. Find pleasure in feeling 
      that other self hurt by them, knowing that the wounds are suffered by the 
      false Ego -- Pride -- and not by the real You. It will not be long before 
      the pain is gone, and then you will have a good laugh at the memory of 
      that squirming demon who fled surprised and vanquished.</P>
      <P>We who are subject to Conceit dread ridicule. Cease to dread it. When 
      we see the wicked caricatures, or witness those vivid mimicries of 
      ourselves, it is for us to welcome them, for they are aiding us materially 
      in the conquest of Pride. So also, to hear ourselves belittled is an 
      antidote for Boastfulness. When we do, there is no need to hide a raging 
      heart behind a sickly smile. Once we have learned the trick of standing 
      apart from ourselves these things can no longer hurt.</P>
      <P>But beat down the shoots of Pride as we may, we cannot be free from the 
      weed until the root has gone. It is right to prevent the shoots from 
      thriving. Destroy them by all means. But Pride will persist in making its 
      appearance until <I>Self-Esteem</I> is rooted out -- and to accomplish 
      that is the hardest job of all!</P>
      <P>Here is a tip that may perhaps be of service. Try and form the habit of 
      supposing every passer-by on whom the thoughts rest to be possessed of at 
      least one attribute superior to your own. Think to yourself: &quot;This 
      creature isn&#39;t much to look at, but I&#39;ll bet she is far more even-tempered 
      than I am!&quot; Look at that rather foppish young man whose appearance used to 
      annoy you, and think: &quot;All the same, in a pinch he would show far greater 
      physical courage than I.&quot; Cease to regard the large, loud-mouthed person 
      as empty-headed, and think instead: &quot;He&#39;s probably far cleverer with his 
      hands than I.&quot; We are all learning our lessons in Life&#39;s school-room. Some 
      are more advanced than us in one thing, and behind us in others. The 
      person who cannot resist the temptation to gratify the senses may 
      nevertheless be a good angel to others in need of help. The thief may be 
      an actual hero. If we consistently regard others as possessing at least 
      one of those desirable characteristics we ourselves are striving for, we 
      are actually admitting our inferiority, and <I>Self-Esteem</I> suffers a 
      staggering blow. Remember that <I>Self-Esteem</I> is a habit, and just as 
      a habit must be acquired, so may it be abandoned. We are not born with it. 
      We cultivate it by regarding ourselves as superior to others in some 
      particular thing -- later in more things -- ultimately in everything. Kill 
      it out by recognizing the superiority of others in some way. Credit them 
      with that superiority, even though you don&#39;t know they possess it. <I>
      Self-Esteem</I> will die for lack of nourishment, and one day will come 
      the first joyful realization that there is no Him nor Her nor You, but 
      that we are all one. You need not fear going too far and acquiring an 
      &quot;inferiority complex.&quot; Your eyes will be open, and what you will find is 
      True Humility.</P>
