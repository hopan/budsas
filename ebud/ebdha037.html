<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"></font>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Paticcasamuppada (The Law Of
    Dependent Origination) is fundamental to the teaching of the
    Buddha. Emphasizing its importance, the Buddha said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One who sees the the Law Of
        Dependent Origination<br>
        sees the Dhamma.<br>
        One who sees the Dhamma<br>
        sees the Law Of Dependent Origination<br>
        <em>-- Majjhima-nikaya I, Nal. 241, PTS 191. </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Law Of Dependent Origination
    explains that the samsara, the process of repeated suffering
    and existences, is perpetuated by a chain of interconnected
    links of cause and effect; it also reveals the method of
    breaking this chain and putting an end to the process. The
    Buddha said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The man with craving as his
        companion has <br>
        been flowing in the stream of repeated<br>
        existences from time immemorial. He comes<br>
        into being, experiences various types of miseries,<br>
        dies again and again, and does not put an end to this <br>
        unbroken process of becoming.<br>
        <em>-- Suttanipata, verse 339, Nal. 383, PTS 139. </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the world of suffering, as
    explained by the Buddha. He further said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rightly understanding the
        perils of this process,<br>
        realizing fully craving as its cause,<br>
        becoming free from craving and attachment, one<br>
        should mindfully lead the life of detachment.<br>
        <em>-- Ibid., verse 340, Nal. 383, PTS 140. </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such an approach, he said, will
    have great benefit: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pleasure is the binding force
        in the world. <br>
        Rolling thought processes are its ever changing base. <br>
        With the complete eradication of craving,<br>
        The state called nibbana is attained.<br>
        <em>-- Samyutta-nikaya I, Nal. 37, PTS 39; Suttanipata
        verse 134, Nal. 436, PTS 202. </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These statements made by the Buddha
    describe the nature of samsara, the state of suffering, and
    the nature of nibbana, the state of final emancipation. But
    how can detachment be developed, and craving eradicated? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the practical aspect of
    Dhamma discovered by Siddhattha Gotama, the realization that
    made him a Buddha (enlightened one), and that he in turn
    revealed to the world by the doctrine of the Law Of Depenent
    Origination. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to this doctrine, twelve
    links form the wheel of becoming (bhava-cakka). They are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Ignorance (avijja)<br>
        2. Volitional Activities (sankhara)<br>
        3. Consciousness (vinnana)<br>
        4. Mind &amp; Matter (nama-rupa)<br>
        5. Six Sense Doors (salayatana)<br>
        6. Contact (phassa)<br>
        7. <b><i>Sensation</i></b> (vedana)<br>
        8. Craving (tanha)<br>
        9. Clinging (upadana)<br>
        10. Becoming (bhava)<br>
        11. Birth (jati)<br>
        12. Decay And Death (jara-marana) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dependent on ignorance, volitional
    activities arise. Dependent on volitional activities,
    consciousness arises. Dependent on consciousness, mind and
    matter arises. Dependent on mind and matter, the 6 sense
    doors arise. Dependent on 6 sense doors, contact with sense
    objects arise. Dependent on contact with sense objects,
    sensations arise. <b><i>Dependent on sensations, cravings
    arise</i></b>. Dependent on cravings, clinging arises. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the vicious circle of misery
    rotates on and on.In other words, the origin of each link
    depends upon the preceding one. As long as this chain of
    twelve causal relations operates, the wheel of becoming
    (bhava-cakka) keeps turning, bringing nothing but suffering.
    This process of cause and effect is called The Law Of
    Dependent Origination (anuloma-paticcasamuppada). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our task is to emerge from this
    bhava-cakka of dukkha (sorrow). Explaining how to do so, the
    Buddha said that when any one of the links of the chain is
    broken, the wheel of becoming comes to an end, resulting in
    the cessation suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through deep insight, the Buddha
    discovered that the crucial link is <b><i>sensation</i></b>
    (vedana). The Buddha said that with the base of sensation
    craving and aversion arise. Sensation is the cause of desire
    (craving/aversion)...which causes suffering. In order to
    remove the cause of suffering (craving/aversion), therefore,
    one must not allow sensation to generate cravings/aversions.
    One must practice Insight Meditation (Vipassana) at this
    juncture so that ignorance (avijja) becomes wisdom (panna).
    One has to observe sensations, and to experientially
    comprehend the truth of its arising and passing away, ie
    &quot;impermanence&quot; (anicca). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through Insight Meditation as one
    experiences sensations properly, one comes out of the
    delusion of the &quot;perception of permanence&quot;
    (nicca-sanna) by the development of the &quot;wisdom of
    impermanence&quot; (anicca-vijja) towards experienced
    sensations<b><i>. This is done by observing with equanimity
    the arising and passing away of sensations</i></b>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With anicca-vijja (wisdom of
    impermanence) the habit pattern of the mind changes. Instead
    of the earlier pattern vedana-paccaya tanha, through the
    wisdom of impermanence it becomes vedana paccaya panna (with
    the base of sensation wisdom arises). As wisdom becomes
    stronger naturally sanna and with it craving/aversion becomes
    weaker. The process of the multiplication of suffering with
    the base of ignorance then becomes the process of cessation
    of suffering, with wisdom as its base. As this process
    continues, a time comes where there is the complete cessation
    of sensation as well as craving/aversion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This state of emancipation is a
    state beyond mind and matter, where both sensation and
    perception cease. One can experience this for a few seconds,
    minutes, hours, or days when, according to one's own
    capacity, one becomes established in nirodha-samapatti (right
    cessation/nibbana) by practicing Vipassana. After the period
    of nirodha-samapatti when one comes back to the sensual field
    of mind and matter, one again experiences sensation. But now
    the whole habit pattern of the mind has been changed, and
    continued practice leads to the stage where one does not
    generate aversion or craving at all because the deep rooted
    mental impurities are eradicated. In this way by the breaking
    of one link, sensation, the whole process is shattered and
    the wheel of repeated existence is broken completely. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we want to advance on the path
    of liberation, we have to work at the level of sensation
    because it is here that the rotation of the wheel of misery
    can be arrested. With sensation starts the turning of the
    wheel of becoming, leading to desire (aversion/craving),
    which causes suffering. This is the path which ignorant
    people follow, since they react to sensations and generate
    desires based on these sensations. And from here also the
    wheel of Dhamma, or the wheel of cessation of suffering can
    start to rotate, leading to the end of craving as the result
    of the perception / wisdom of impermanence. This is the path
    the wise follow, by not reacting to sensations, because they
    have developed the wisdom/perception of impermanence through
    the practice of Vipassana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many of the contemporaries of the
    Buddha held the view that craving causes and that to remove
    suffering one has to abstain from the objects of craving. In
    order to develop detachment, the Buddha tackled the problem
    in a different way. Having learned to examine the depths of
    his own mind, he realized that between the external object
    and the mental reflex of craving is a missing link:
    sensation. Whenever we encounter an object through the five
    physical senses or the mind, a sensation arises; and based on
    the sensation, desire arises. If the sensation is pleasant we
    crave to prolong it, and if it is unpleasant we crave to be
    read of it. It is in the chain of Dependent Origination that
    the Buddha expressed his profound discovery: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dependent on contact, sensation
        arises. <br>
        Dependent on sensation, craving arises.<br>
        <em>-- Vinaya, Mahavagga, Nal.3, PTS 2. </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The immediate cause for the arising
    of craving and of suffering is, therefore, not something
    outside of us but rather the sensations that occur within us.
    To be free ourselves from craving and suffering we must deal
    with this inner reality of sensations. Doing so is the
    practical way to emerge from suffering. By developing the
    wisdom of impermanence we learn to cut the knots of our
    misery and witness the true nature of Dhamma. Sensation then
    is the cause of our bondage when not properly observed, as
    well as the means of our liberation when properly observed by
    understanding the Dhamma, the law of Dependent Origination. </font></p>
