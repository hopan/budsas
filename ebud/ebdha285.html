      <TD WIDTH="100%"><B></B><FONT SIZE="6">F</FONT>rom my experience, I see 
      three levels of truth that can be found in all spiritual traditions. The 
      first is the level of history or &quot;what actually happened.&quot; The second is 
      the level of myth. The third is how the first two layers map on to our own 
      psyche and experience. These three are interwoven in all religions.
      <P>Using the example of the Christian or Hebrew Bible, one can see that 
      for the past 150 years, academics have been going through the text 
      questioning its authenticity and validity. This is a bit like a little kid 
      dissecting a slug to see how it works and then becoming upset that the 
      slug can no longer move around or eat lettuce. The dissection of religion 
      takes away its true meaning. Does Cinderella become a useless story 
      because there might not have been an actual young woman named Cinderella? 
      No. It's a great story! And why do we keep telling it? Because it is 
      useful. Any of the thousands and thousands of tales repeated around living 
      rooms and camp fires are told because they are good stories. They convey 
      meaning that is useful to us. </P>
      <P>Among these is the story of the Buddha's life. About 2,500 years ago in 
      a Nepalese kingdom, a male child was born and for various reasons left the 
      life of privilege and comfort in a royal household to become a wandering 
      mendicant. </P>
      <P>Somewhere along the line, he had a profound experience of insight and 
      then proceeded for the rest of his life to wander as a yogi living on 
      whatever was offered from the benevolence of the local people. In 
      exchange, he would teach those who invited him to share what he had to 
      say. After eighty years, he passed away, having founded a religious order 
      of both women and men. Most historians would agree that something like 
      this happened. </P>
      <P>On the mythological level, events happened in a much more glorious and 
      miraculous way. The Buddha's birth on the full moon of May occurred in an 
      environment of earthquakes, rainbows and celestial music. His mother gave 
      birth to him standing up. He walked and talked as soon as he was born. His 
      birth had been predicted to be that of an amazing person: either a world 
      conqueror or the greatest sage to walk the planet. Since his father, the 
      king, wanted his son to end up as a world conqueror, he made sure to keep 
      out of sight anything that would cause his child to incline towards the 
      religious life. The old, sick and deceased were hidden from him. Of 
      course, the prince eventually left the palace and saw these forbidden 
      sights, along with that of a wandering mendicant showing him the path he 
      would soon embark upon himself. </P>
      <P>There are many wonderful and marvelous events in the Buddha's 
      historical and mythological lives. But the Buddha himself said that the 
      most wonderful and marvelous quality was that when a feeling arises in the 
      mind of the Tathagata, he knows this is a feeling arising. When a feeling 
      abides in the mind of the Tathagata, he knows this is a feeling abiding. 
      When a feeling fades away in the mind of the Tathagata, he knows this is a 
      feeling fading away. So too with thoughts and perceptions. </P>
      <P>So why then are the Buddha's birth, death and enlightenment brought 
      together on one day? My own theory is that this points to the very 
      practice of meditation itself for perhaps there is something in our 
      experience of the moment that gathers together in a similar way, that 
      follows the same pattern on an internal and much-diminished scale. For 
      example, we notice a sensation in our body: our knee starts to ache. This 
      is equivalent to &quot;the life of the Bodhisattva&quot; before the enlightenment: a 
      sensation arises; it is born. There is a bit of happiness and a bit of 
      pain. Then the pain in our knee no longer comes and goes but begins to 
      dominate our perceptions -- &quot;This hurts&quot; -- and we struggle with it. This 
      is comparable to the Buddha becoming dissatisfied with life in the palace: 
      it is tedious, boring and burdensome. Perhaps then we remember some 
      spiritual instruction. In the life of the Buddha, this is the ripening of 
      spiritual virtues, or paramitas.When he saw sickness, old age and death, 
      followed by the religious seeker, those virtues ripened, and he said, &quot;Ah 
      ha, that's the way!&quot; In our own microcosm, we remember that we are 
      supposed to be paying attention to the pain in our knee, not just sitting 
      there wrestling with it, hating it, fearing it, resenting it. Perhaps we 
      have imagined it is bone cancer or a ripped cartilage. &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; we 
      think. &quot; I should be working with this instead of getting carried away!&quot; 
      So that's the Buddha waking up to the problem of pain and seeking to do 
      something about it. </P>
      <P>&quot;All right,&quot; we may say, &quot;this is a pain in my leg. I should get rid of 
      the pain by suppressing it and paying attention to the breath instead.&quot; 
      This is what the Buddha did in the beginning. He used his will to drive 
      out all that was unwanted in his mind, such as fear, thoughts and 
      emotions. Six years of suppression left the Buddha in a barren, intense 
      and collapsed state. Then in our meditation we remember the Middle Way. 
      Suppression is motivated by fear and hatred -- the thought &quot; I want to get 
      rid of it.&quot; Instead, we should make friends with the pain. It is just a 
      feeling. All feelings arise and pass away. Just relax. This is the moment 
      of &quot;enlightenment.&quot; The heart releases. The feeling of pain is still 
      there, but we let go of the tension around it, let go of the fear, let go 
      of negotiating. It just is what it is. In that moment we share the life of 
      the Buddha. The feeling in the leg may persist -- it may get a bit 
      stronger, disappear, come back, change and move around -- but it's no 
      longer a problem. </P>
      <P>Eventually the pain goes away or the bell rings for the end of the 
      meditation. This is the <I>&quot;Parinibbana,&quot;</I> the final Nibbana, the 
      passing of the Buddha. The object disappears. Even with just a thought or 
      a sound, there is a natural quality of pure bliss with its cessation.When 
      the chirping of birds or the hum of the refrigerator stops, there is a 
      feeling of relief. This is a micro- or nano-parinibbana. When the 
      condition ceases, we experience the bliss of the free mind. That bliss, 
      clarity and peacefulness has been there all along, but it was obscured by 
      the experience of grabbing the feeling, the hope, the fear or the 
      excitement. The pattern of the entire life of the Buddha thus charts the 
      process of our experience, if the heart is guided wisely, as it manifests 
      in a few seconds of meditation. The birth, enlightenment and Parinibbana 
      celebrated at Visakha Puja gather together in this way as a symbol of this 
      path of insight and true knowing that leads to the heart's release. </P>
