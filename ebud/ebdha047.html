<P>
	<B>B</B>efore considering the Zen-Pure Land
union as introduced to Vietnam through the Tha?o - Ddu+o+`ng
school, let us survey the Vietnamese Buddhist scene from the
Ddinh (969-981) to Tra^`n (1225-1400) dynasties when Buddhism
developed from a national religion to a nationalist religion
before merging with aspects of Taoist and Confucian beliefs
characteristic of the unification of the three religions
following the decline of Buddhist influence in the Late Tr�n
dynasty.  The beginning of Buddhism as the national religion
of the Vietnamese can be placed as early as the Ddinh-Bo^.-Li~nh
established a Vietnamese Sangha and initiated the practice
of appointing eminent monks to serve as royal advisors on
political, religious, and domestic matters.  The Early Le^
dynasty (981-1009) continued this policy in addition to
providing Vietnam's Buddhist heritage with a firm basis for
development by obtaining from China the complete Chinese
Tripitaka, the collection of Buddhist sacred texts.  During
this period of growth and assimilation, Buddhism adjusted
itself to local practices, absorbing diverse areas of belief
in the comprehensive goal of enlightenment for all sentient
beings.  The teachings of the Buddha flourished in the land,
and, with the coming of the Ly' dynasty (1010-1225), the
Vo^-Ngo^n-Tho^ng sect was particularly prosperous; the first
two kings, Ly'-Tha'i-To^? (ruled 1010-1028), a former disciple
of Ty`-Ni-Dda-Lu+u-Chi master Ven. Va.n-Ha.nh, and Ly'-Tha'i-To^n
(ruled 1028-1045), a student of Ven. Thie^`n-La~o, a famous
master of the Vo^-Ngo^n-Tho^ng Zen sect, continued the practice
begun by Ddinh-Bo^.-Li~nh of appointing learned monks to
advisory positions in the government, thus providing a basis
for the merging of religious and national interests
characteristic of the Early Tra^`n dynasty.  
<P>

	The first real propagation of a Buddhist sect occurred under the third king
of Ly', Ly'-Tha'nh-To^n (ruled 1054-1072), Dharma-successor to
Ven. Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng.  As first patriarch of the Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng sect,
Ly'-Tha'nh-To^n was instrumental in establishing the teachings of his master
in Vietnam and in providing a suitable ecology for the growth of Tha?o-
Ddu+o+`ng Zen.  The four successive
monarchs of the Ly' were likewise earnest Buddhist patrons;
among them Ly'-Anh-To^n (ruled 1138-1175) and Ly'-Cao-To^n
(ruled 1176-1210) received the seal-of-mind (V. Ta^m-a^'n, J.
Shin-in) in the Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng tradition.  With emphasis on the
merging of loving-kindness (S. karuna) and insight (S.
prajna), the Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng sect provided the background
material from which the first monarch of the Tra^`n dynasty,
Tra^`n-Tha'i-To^n, constructed his all-encompassing philosophy
of humanism, which was to weave an important pattern in the
Zen of the Tru'c-La^m sect founded by Tra^`n-Nha^n-To^n in the
thirteenth century.  
<P>
	The interval separating King
Ly'-Cao-To^n's abdication to accept the seal-of-mind within
the patriarchial tradition of the Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng school from
King Tra^`n-Nha^n-To^n's resignation to become a monk and
founder of the Tru'c-La^m school was marked by three
significant events acting as a catalyst phasing the religion
of the Ly' dynasty into the national religion, the comingling
of nationalism and religion of the Tra^`n dynasty.  These
events--the Mongol invasions of 1257, 1285 and 1287--led to
a reassessment of national character, inner conviction, and
ethnic aim culminating in the founding of the Tru'c-La^m Zen
sect.  Thus we may say of the Tra^`n dynasty, in
contradistinction to the Ly' dynasty, that Buddhism adapted
itself to the nationalist tendencies of the Vietnamese which
were then finding their full expression under the stimulus
to reevaluation provided by the Mongolian threat of foreign
domination; during the Ly' dynasty, however, with which we
are concerned in this chapter, Buddhism captivated the
Vietnamese to such extent as to make the teaching of
Sakyamuni the one belief of the entire country.  The
Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng school, with its practical methods suitable for
all to follow in everyday life, opened the way by which
Buddhism penetrated the heart of the nation and over the
years transformed and directed the energies of the
Vietnamese towards the Pure Land.  
<P>
	Speaking of the
circumstances leading to the introduction of Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng Zen
during King Ly'-Tha'nh-To^n's reign (1054-1072), Mai-Tho.-Truye^`n
writes in his 'Buddhism in Vietnam' (p.42):  "In 1069, to be
precise, a significant event occurred.  At that time the
country was at war with the kingdom of Champa, a turbulent
neighbor, whose frequent incursions into Vietnamese
territory caused great alarm.  The Emperor returned from an
expedition against Champa with a number of prisoners of
war," among them the Chinese monk Tha?-Ddu+o+`ng (C.
Ts'ao-tang), who had been temporarily in Champa teaching the
unified Zen-Pure Land practice with fellow Chinese
Buddhists.  On Ly'-Tha'nh-To^n's return to the palace he
assigned Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng to assist Vietnam's Royal Head Monk (V.
Ta(ng-lu.c); one day when this nmonk was out on a visit,
according to historical sources, Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng took his
Ngu+~-Lu.c, a record of the teachings of great Buddhist bonzes,
and made corrections in the text.  After Ly'-Tha'nh-To^n heard
of this he sent for the prisoner to test his understanding
of Buddhism.  Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng explained the teachings of numerous
Buddhist tests and answered questions with penetrating
insight, thoroughly convincing the king of his extraordinary
abilities.  Then, learning of Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng's background of
study with the Chinese master Tuye^'t-Dda^.u Minh-Gia'c (C.
Hsueh-t'ou Ming-chueh, 980-1052) and of his teaching
activities in Champa at the time of his capture, King
Ly'-Tha'nh-To^n admitted him to the Vietnamese Sangha with the
title Quo^'c-Su+ (C. Kuo-shih, J. Kokushi), or National
Teacher, and placed him in charge of teaching Zen practice
and Buddhist philosophy in the royal palace; thereafter
Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng stayed at Khai-Quo^'c temple in the capital city of
Tha(ng-Long (now Hanoi).  With Ly'-Tha'nh-To^n as his earnest
supporter, the master's fame spread quickly to the
surrounding countryside; hearing of his residence at
Khai-Quo^'c, Dharma-seekers journeyed from both China and
Vietnam to benefit from his teachings.  
<P>
	Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng, one of
seventeen Dharma-successors to Tuye^'t-Dda^.u Minh-Gia'c,
advocated the unified practice of Zen and Pure Land methods
for attaining enlightenment.  The combined teachings, known
as the doctrine of Ch'an-ching I-chih (Thie^`n Ti.nh Nha^'t Tri'), were
accepted and
widely cultivated during the development of Sung (To^'ng)dynasty
syncretism, a movement grounded in the late T'ang (Ddu+o+`ng) dynasty
when leaders of different Buddhist schools found it
profitable to join together with their fellow Buddhists in
soliciting the favor of the imperial court.  Emphasis
shifted to the harmonious elements under-lying all Buddhist
teachings, and, through the interchange of doctrine and
practice, the traditional boundaries once separating various
sects merged with one another as Chinese Buddhism found a
new mode of expression in the philosophy of syncretism.  The
union of Zen meditation and Pure Land avocation, a lasting
result of Sung syncretism, may, at first glance, as Heinrich
Dumoulin writes in 'A History of Zen Buddhism' (p.125),  "seem
especially surprising in view of the basic difference in
structure between the two movements.  But here too the
embedding of Zen in Buddhist piety--a piety shich Zen may
surpass in mystical enlightenment but can never fully
deny--becomes evident.  Moreover, there is a remarkable
psychological similarity between the rhythmic repetition of
the Buddha name in the so-called nien-fo (Jap. Nembutsu) and
the intensive practice of the koan."  
<P>
	The similar goal of
meditation and of Buddha's-name-recitation, or mantra as
devotional invocation designed to produce a certain state of
mind, and their connection in the history of Buddhist
propagation in China, goes back to the early days of the
introduction of the Dharma.  As Buddhism developed in China,
by the time of the sixth patriarch Hui-ne^ng (J. Eno,
638-713), looking into one's own nature to perceive the
Buddha was tantamount to perfecting the mind to reach the
Pure Land.  Due to the growth in popularity of Pure Land
teachings, questioners seeking to understand the nature of
faith in Amitabha and the essence of his Western Heaven
frequently approached the patriarch solicting his opinion.
His remarks, as recorded in the Altar Sutra (trans. Lu K'uan
Yu, pp. 40-41), present an outlook supported by most
enlightened monks within the Ch'an tradition.  According to
Hui-ne^ng:  
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	"The deluded man repeats the Buddhas's name to
seek rebirth in the (Western) Paradise but the enlightened
man purifies his own mind (instead).  This is why the Buddha
said that purification of mind is simultaneous with
purification of the Buddha land.  The ignorant man who does
not know clearly about his own nature and ignores the Pure
Land which is within himself, looks to the east and the
west.  For the enlightened man, the position in which he may
find himself makes no difference.  This is why the Buddha
said that happiness existed anywhere one might happen to be.
If your mind is entirely right, the West(ern) Paradise is
near at hand.  If your mind is wrong, it will be very
difficult to reach it by (merely) repeating the Buddha's
name....If thought after thought and without interruption
you perceive your own nature, and if you are constantly
impartial and straightforward, you will arrive there in a
snap of the fingers and will behold Amitabha Buddha.  If you
practice the ten good virtues, there will be no need for you
to be reborn there.  If you do not get rid of the ten evils,
which Buddha will come and receive you?  If you are awakened
to the instantaneous doctrine of the uncreate, you will
perceive the Western Paradise in an instant (ksana).  If you
are not awakened to it and if you (only) repeat the Buddha's
name to be reborn there, the distance being so great how can
you go there?"  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
	Hui-ne^ng's teachings provided a basis for the
subsequent union of Zen and Pure Land traditions--a union
producing a cooperant methodology drawn from the source of
knowledge and inspiration cultivated by each school.  One of
Hui-ne^ng's chief disciples, Nan-yueh Huai-jang (Nam Nha.c Hoa`i Nhu+o+.ng, J.
Nangaku Ejo, d.744), did in fact suggest the recitation of Buddha's name to
augment Zen meditation.  The important compiler of the basic rules for
monastic living, Pai-chang Huai-hai (Ba' Tru+o+.ng Hoa`i Ha?i, J. Hyakujo
Ekai, 720-814), a student of Ma-tsu Tao-i (Ma~ To^? Dda.o Nha^'t, J. Baso
Doitsu, D. 788), the famed disciple of Nan-yueh Huai-jang,
included in his twenty monastic principles the method of
Buddha's-name-recitation.  Contemporaneous with Pai-chang, a
school of practice developed by Hsuan-shih in Szechwan,
claiming descendance from the fifth patriarch Hung-je^n (J.
Gunin, 601-675), advocated meditation on the recitation of
Buddha's name.  So we see that between Zen and Pure Land
Buddhism, as Heinrich Dumoulin writes in 'The Development of
Chinese Zen' (pp. 36-37),  
	"connecting links had existed for a
long time.  The Nembutsu, the devout invocation of Amida
Buddha's name, was practiced by many important adherents of
Zen, as for instance Hoji, the Fourth Patriarch of the
branch line of Gozu Zen, by Eno's disciple Nangaku Ejo, and
others....Yomyo Enju of the Hogen Sect, one of the greatest
syncretists of Chinese Buddhism, declared himself
emphatically in favor of combining the Nembutsu and Zen
(zenjo icchi).  While one who limited himself to Zen
practice alone reached the goal only with difficulty, he who
combined Zen with the Nembutsu was certain to attain
enlightenment."  
<P>
	This basic attitude stressing the ease and
sureness with which enlightenment may be won by the practice
of both meditation and Buddha's-name-recitation comes
through clearly in the teachings of Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng as presented
to his disciples in his famous 'Warning Statement', a summary
of his essential views containing the most central doctrines
of Zen-Pure Land union.  In the poem below introducing his
Warning Statement, Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng emphasizes giving rise to a
psychological disposition of mind such that the teachings of
Buddhism may bring about their effect.  Thus in order to
enter the unchanging realm of nirvana, we prepare for this
attainment by realizing the world of samsara as
though-construction, knowing the body as the production of
our mind working through karmic causes, and experiencing the
ceaseless change and unsatisfactoriness of life conditioned
by birth and death.  Unless consciousness be set free from
these bindings, the force of illusion continues to control
the content of our mind and shape the aspects of our being.
Knowing the power of the samsaric current holding us within
its confines, keeping us from purifying our mind of
illusion-creating thought-construction veiling the nature of
reality, Buddha in his compassion comes to teach the
doctrine of liberation from suffering and the means whereby
this may be attained.  
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><FONT COLOR=#800080>--Warning Statement--</FONT></B>  
<BR>
Regard the world has an air-flower, <BR> 
Unreal.  <BR>
See the body as though a vision,  <BR>
Without basis.  <BR>
All things change and are not dependable.  <BR>
Unless you seek the path of purification  <BR>
You live in illusion for many lives.  <BR>
Knowing this, Buddha came to the world in compassion,  <BR>
Using the Way to teach us how to vanquish suffering,  <BR>
How to cut off desire, release birth and death,  <BR>
And enter nirvana's unchanging abode.  <BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	Before continuing with Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng's 'Warning Statement', we may note
briefly that his understanding of Buddha's appearance in the world is upheld
by most followers of the Mahayana, and as
detailed in the Lotus Sutra (S. Saddharmapundarika Sutra),
its applicability extends to influence a large area of basic
Mahayana belief.  Essentially the Lotus Sutra regards
Buddha's appearance in this sahaloka, our world of birth and
death, as the natural outcome of compassion working through
wisdom resulting in fitness of action, or skillful means (phu+o+ng tie^.n, S.
upaya, C. fang-pien, J. hoben), the inherent way of all
Tathagatas who neither come nor go but abide in thusness (S.
tathatva).  As stated in the Lotus Sutra (pp. 76-77):  "He,
the Tathagata... who has reached the highest perfection in
the knowledge of skillful means, who is most merciful,
long-suffering, benevolent, compassionate... appears in this
triple world... in order to deliver from affection, hatred,
and delusion the beings subject to birth, old age, disease,
death...."  
<P>
	Thus with the appearance of a Buddha, practice
of the Dharma becomes possible.  Acknowledging the variety
of available methods, Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng condenses them as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	"Though you may practice Buddhism in many ways, in summary
there are three main methods:  meditation, contemplation,
and Buddha's-name-recitation.  The method of meditation has
no definite way to follow and is therefore a difficult
practice.  If you do not have an enlightened master or a
capable mind, you may stop midway in your progress or remain
mistaken for your entire life.  Contemplation is a very
subtle method; without a good teacher or prajna wisdom,
complete enlightenment is hard to attain.
Buddha's-name-recitation [V. Nie^.m-Pha^.t] is a quick and easy
method.  In all the ages past both intelligent and dull,
both men adn women have been able to practice Nie^.m-Pha^.t.
Nobody makes a mistake with this method because of the
applicability of the four types of outlook [V. Tu+'
Lie^.u-gia?n].  Putting worries aside, you may therefore
proceed with a decisive heart."  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
	According to Pure Land tradition as formulated by the Chinese patriarch T'an-
luan (J. Donran, 476-542), Nagarjuna first distinguished between difficult and
easy practice in his Dasabhumivibhasa Sastra (Tha^.p tru. Ti` Ba` Sa Lua^.n,
C. Shih-chu P'i-p'o-sha Lun, J. Fujubibasharon), section five "On Easy
Practice," in which he writes that a
practitioner wishing to quickly reach the stage of
no-turning-back should keep the Buddha's name ever before
his mind.  In Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng's threefold classification,
meditation and contemplation, the ways of the Holy Path
schools in contradistinction to the Pure Land path, come
under the heading of difficult practices, while the
Nie^.m-Pha^.t, or way of recitation, is considered the easy way
to Buddhahood.  
<P>
	Before discussing Tu+' Lie^.u-gia?n, the four
types of outlook formulated by the founder of the Lin-chi
(J. Rinzai) sect in China, and their relation to
Buddha's-name-recitation (V. Nie^.m-Pha^.t), we may note here
that as regards the practice of Buddhism, Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng's
philosophy is one of Ddo^`ng-quy nhi thu`-ddo^`, a Vietnamese
expression meaning "one purpose through different methods"
or "same destination but different directions."  Thu`-ddo^`
refers to the Buddhist practices of meditation,
contemplation, and Nie^.m-Pha^.t.  Ddo^`ng-quy is to go in one
direction with one aim and for one purpose--that is, to keep
the mind at all times on its goal, inner-realization of the
Pure Land.  According to Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng's philosophy,
meditation, contemplation, and Nie^.m-Pha^.t are all ways within
the one practice of Buddhism for stripping mind of
attachment to desire, thus eliminating self-clinging which
obscures the Dharma-eye, preventing attainment of nirvana
and arrival at the other shore, the Pure Land.  For
achieving this aim Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng clearly indicates that
Buddha's-name-recitation (V. Nie^.m-Pha^.t) supplemented with
the four types of outlook (V. Tu+' Lie^.u-gia?n) is both an easy
and an efficacious practice.  
<P>
	As we turn to the topic of Tu+' Lie^.u-gia?n (C. ssu-liao-chien, J. shi
ryoken), we begin to see the results of combined Zen-Pure Land methods; that
is, the operation of Lin-chi (J. Rinzai) techniques in the form of the four
types of outlook within a practice traditionally ascribed to the Pure Land
school, the Nie^.m-Pha^.t (C. Nien-fo, J. Nembutsu), or recitation of the name
of Buddha Amitabha, a form of mantra practice leading to singlehearted
concentration through which the other-ower finds a channel of expression.
Within the workings of Nie^.m-Pha^.t the four distinctions are self-acting or
self-perpetuating in the
sense that an outside agent, such as a Zen master, does not
apply them.  They arise of their own through the "power of
the other," which may actually result from concentrated
belief and complete faith in the efficacy of the practice.
The four distinctions, listed below are as formulated by
Lin-chi, are central to his methodology of self-realization:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
eliminating subject, leaving object  <BR>

eliminating both, leaving neither <BR>
eliminating neither, leaving both  <BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
	Regarding the applicability of the four distinctions from a more general
viewpoint, "eliminate" can be looked upon as a form of
emptying; the four distinctions themselves can then quite
readily be seen as relating to the first four types of
emptiness, or negation, comprising the twenty, sometimes
eighteen, styles of emptiness outlined in the Great
Perfection of Wisdom Sutra (S. Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra, C.
Ta-pan-jo Po-lo-mi-to Ching, J. Daihannyaharamittakyo):
emptiness of subject, emptiness of object, emptiness of both
subject and object, and emptiness of emptiness.  In Zen
methodology, depending on the astuteness of the master, the
particular level or experience of attainment of the student,
and the aptness of circumstance, one sometimes empties the
subject of itself, sometimes the object.  Sometimes one
empties both subject and object, sometimes neither, thereby
leaving emptiness void of that emptiness.  The third
patriarch of Zen Se^ng-ts'an (J. Sosan), writing on this
subject in his "On Having No Doubt in Mind" (Ti'n Ta^m Minh, trans. Suzuki,
Manual, p. 78), declares:  
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The two exist because of the One, <BR>
But hold not even to this One;  <BR>
When a mind is not disturbed,  <BR>
The ten thousand things offer no offense.  <BR>
<BR>
No offense offered, and no ten thousand things;  <BR>
No disturbance going, and no mind set up to work:  <BR>
The subject is quieted when the object ceases,  <BR>
The object ceases when the subject is quieted.  <BR>
<BR>
The object is an object for the subject,  <BR>
The subject is a subject for the object:  <BR>
Know that the relativity of the two  <BR>
Rests ultimately on one Emptiness." <BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
	Within this one emptiness, according to Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng,
<P>
	"Nie^.m-Pha^.t is to keep your mind on the six syllables Nam-mo^ A-Di-Dda`
Pha^.t and not let it move and jump freely about.
While practicing Nie^.m-Pha^.t the eyes look at the image of
Buddha, the mouth recites the Buddha's name, and the ears
hear the chanting sounds.  When you feel heavy and
frustrated, try harder and keep on without losing a single
second.  A quiet mind naturally returns."  
<P>
With these instructions on Buddha's-name-recitation, Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng
introduces Pure Land meditation as cultivated in China where it drew
increasingly for doctrinal support from the
teachings of the Dharma-ending-age, when, because of
accumulated evil karma, men would be able to attain
enlightenment only through reliance on Amitabha Buddha's
compassionate vow to save all suffering beings.  Holmes
Welch remarks of this attitude in The Practice of Chinese
Buddhism (pp. 89-90):  
<P>
	"Since we are living in the age of the decay of the dharma, it is
difficult... to reach nirvana here through our own efforts.  Therefore most
Buddhists in China prefer to get the help of Amitabha by reciting his name
(nien-fo).  That is, they repeat the words 'homage to the buddha Amitabha'
(na-mo O-mi-t'o-fo) in the belief that if they do so wholeheartedly they will
be reborn in the Western Paradise.  'Wholeheartedly' means making their minds
'whole
and still' (i-hsin pu-luan, nha^'t ta^m ba^'t loa.n), so that nothing is there
but Amitabha.  He is in their mouths (as they recite his name), in their ears
(as they listen to the recitation), and in their minds (as they visualize
him).  This is called
'perfect concentration in reciting buddha's name' (nien-fo
san-mei, nie^.m Pha^.t tam muo^.i).  It corresponds to a degree of
enlightenment achieved in the meditation hall."  
<P>
	In Zen-Pure Land practice in Vietnam, as in China, both hua-t'ou (thoa.i
dda^`u, J. wato), which are similar in function to the koan exercise, and
Nie^.m-Pha^.t may be pursued.  Describing the actual Chinese practice,
identical in many aspects with Vietnamese ways, Holmes Welch notes, again from
his 'Practice of Chinese Buddhism' (pp. 398-399):  
<P>
	"Many monastries carried on the joint practice of
Ch'an and Pure Land (ch'an-ching shuang-hsin, thie^`n ti.nh song ha`nh).  This
usually meant that they had both a meditation hall and a hall for reciting the
buddha's name.  But there was also a special form of joint practice in one
hall.... There seem to have
been eight periods of work a day... and each period was
divided into circumambulation and sitting.  While the
inmates circumambulated, they recited Buddha's name aloud.
While they sat, they either worked on a Ch'an hua-t'ou or
employed 'buddha's name meditation' (nien-fo kuan, nie^.m Pha^.t qua'n).  The
latter included different techniques for people at different stages of
proficiency.  Beginners used the technique termed 'reciting buddha's name
while meditating on the buddha
image' (kuan-hsiang nien-fo).  That is, they would fix their
eyes on the image in the hall.  Those further advanced would
attempt to visualize the form of Amitabha with their mind's
eye.  This was termed 'reciting buddha's name while
meditating on the mental image of the buddha' (kuan-hsi�ng
nien-fo).  Those furthest advanced strove to avoid having
any buddha to visualize or any ego to do the visualizing.
This was termed 'reciting buddha's name while meditating on
the quintessence of the buddha' (shih-hsiang nien-fo).	Explanations were given
of both Ch'an and Pure Land methods.
<P>
	Abiding of mind in the Pure Land results from continued
practice of these three gradations of method.  According to
Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng:  
<P>
	"If you continue to practice Nie^.m-Pha^.t, your
mind will stay in the Pure Land; your heart will join with
Amitabha Buddha.  Without walking a step the Pure Land
appears in front of you; without waiting for a future life
the blessings of the Western Heaven are yours.  Why do you
tarry in this short, impermanent life of birth, old age,
sickness, and death, rather than reaching for an unlimited
life of permanency, joyfulness, substantiality, and purity?
Is this not happier?"  
<P>
	In this section of his 'Warning
Statement' Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng presents the form which Pure Land
doctrine assumed under practical interpretation of the
Chinese mind.  Originally based on the Larger Sukhavativyuha
Sutra and related at least in aim with the cult of Maitreya,
Pure Land tradition as developed in China evolved from the
idea of a Pure Land in the West where one seeks entrance by
various practices as noted in the Larger Sukhavativyuha
Sutra (C. Ta-wu Liang-shou Ching, J. Daimuyrojukyo), the
Smaller Sukhavativyuha Sutra (C. O-mi-t'o Ching, J.
Amidakyo), and the Amitayurdhyana Sutra (C. Kuan-wu
Liang-shou Ching, J. Kammuryojukyo), to the identification
of the Chinese character for "land" or "realm" with the
meaning of "mind"; hence in the process of Zen-Pure Land
union, the Pure Land came to mean the realm of Pure Mind.
Speaking of this transformation of Pure Land doctrine,
Hajime Nakamura notes in 'Ways of Thinking of Eastern Peoples'
(pp. 253-254) that the authority of the Vimalakirtinirdesa
Sutra which teaches "the pure mind is identical with the
Pure Land" provided support for the growth of "a mind-only
doctrine" resulting in the dictum that "the Pure Land of the
pure mind exists in all parts of the world."  As a
development of Sung dynasty syncretism, "the Chinese
Buddhists exclusively followed this pure-mind view, and
after the Ming dynasty, no contradiction was felt in
practicing simultaneously sitting and the Pure Land
practice."  
<P>
	The Chinese, with their emphasis on the
practical value of belief, its demonstrable validity in the
everyday world, gradually shifted the distant or
non-too-distant Pure Land of the Sukhavativyuha Sutra to the
immediate presence-of-mind, a shift creating a rich field of
cultivation for Chinese Buddhists by providing a basis from
which the practices of both common man and monk could grow.
Thus when pressed for an explanation of the combination of
seemingly contradictory methodologies in the Zen-Pure Land
union, "many enlightened Chinese Buddhists," as Reginald
Johnston writes in his 'Buddhist China' (p.93), "will declare
that the Ch'an and Ching-t'u teachings are not really
inconsistent with one another, but that the Ch'an doctrines
are to the educated Buddhist what the Amidist doctrines are
to the ignorant."  Shifting the Pure Land from the beyond to
the here-and-now, the beyond within, resulted in recognition
of the potentially of all beings to attain an enlightened
state of mind in this very life.  The Chinese, like the
Vietnamese, were not overly interested in preparing for
something in the distant future might or might not come
about.  With a practical bent of mind already steeped in the
this-wordly traditions of Confucianism, they sought the
substantiation of belief through its efficacy in daily life.
<P>
	In closing his 'Warning Statement' with the gatha below,
Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng emphasizes awakening to the original mind of
Ch'an, one's own true abode, which is none other than the
Pure Realm, the real native land.  
<P>

<P>
	Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng's verse contains principles and teachings recognized by
almost all Buddhist sects, and here we might do well to dwell momentarily on
the background tradition from which he draws his gatha.  The three worlds or
realms (tam gio+'i, S. traidhatuka or trailokya) with which he opens his gatha
refer in Buddhism's cosmology of mind to the world of sensuous desire (du.c
gio+'i, S. kamadhatu) including the six heavens of desire, the human world,
and the hells where existence is characterized by desires deriving from six
and appetite; the world of form (sa('c gio+'i, S. rupadhatu) inclusive of the
four dhyana heavens and located above kamadhatu; and the formless world (vo^
sa('c gio+'i, S. arupadhatu) of pure spirit comprising the four attainments
beyond form (S. arupyasamapatti).  All such realms are generally considered
indications of various states of consciousness; according to the Lankavatara
Sutra (pp. 145,75), for example, "The triple world is no more than thought-
construction (prajnapti),
there is no reality in its self-nature."  And, "The being
and nonbeing of things subject to causation has no reality;
the triple world owes its existence to the Mind put into
confusion by reason of habit-energy."  
<P>
	Thus in the authoritative text of early Zen Buddhism the triple world appears
as none other than mind
disturbed by the permeating and dwelling nature of vasana,
or "habit-energy" (C. hsi-chi) according to Chinese
translation; as put concisely in the Avatamsaka Sutra (C.
Hua-yen Ching, J. Kegonkyo):  "The three worlds are only
Mind."  (S. Svacittamatram traidhatukam).  That mind is the
foundation of both samsara and nirvana, and that samsara is
but the obscured function of mind confused by habit-energy
(S. vasana) and solidified by wrong views (S. vikalpa, C.
fe^n-pieh, J. fumbetsu), while nirvana is mind's original
nature undisturbed by the structural elements of samsara,
the nature of which is like a house eternally devoured by
flames, is a basic outlook of Mahayana Buddhists symbolized
in part through the parable of the burning house contained
in the Lotus Sutra.  Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng's gatha contrasts the
burning house of samsara with nirvana's Pure Land where
eight waters of good qualities extinguish the flames of the
passions.  To pass beyond the misery of the triple world
Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng teaches in accordance with the Larger
Sukhavativyuha Sutra, and as provided for in the sixteen
meditations comprising the Amitayurdhyana Sutra, to form a
firm thought of the Pure Land in order to lead mind to its
realization.  
<P>
	The desire to see the Pure Land, made possible
by the grace or power of Buddha's vows (S. pranidhana,
adhis-thana), but initiated in action by the stirring of
self-nature in search of its own fulfillment, is one of the
deepest perceptions of human consciousness, and one in which
the other-power of Buddha's compassion to save us and the
self-power of our own determination to attain enlightenment
merge in the One Mind of neither self nor other, the fourth
outlook of Lin-chi's distinctions (V. Tu+' Lie^.u-gia?n).  As
presented in the Amitayurdhyana Sutra (p.169), by the power
of Buddha and his vows we may see the Pure Land, but only if
we direct our mind to that realm and make it "our only aim,
with concentrated thought, to get a perception of the
western quarter."  And so in Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng's gatha he points
out "to leave samsara behind, send your thought to Pure
Land."  
<P>
	The concentration of mind necessary to achieve this
aim in Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng's school is accomplished through the
efficacy of mantra meditation, or concentration on the name
of Amitabha Buddha, which, as taught in the Amitayurdhyana
Sutra, is the way to sever the bonds of samsara and, as
Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng says, "return mind to its original, unmoving
condition."  In the Smaller Sukhavativyuha Sutra (p.99),
meditation on the name of Amitabha is held up as the way
even to the exclusion of the performance of good deeds.  No
stock of merit amassed in this life leads to birth in the
Pure Land, in contradistinction to the teaching of the
Larger Sukhavativyuha Sutra (p.15), but rather,  
<P>
	"whatever son or daughter of a family shall hear the name of the blessed
Amitayus, the Tathagata, and having heard it, shall
keep it in mind...then that Amitayus, the Tathagata,
surrounded by an assembly of disciples and followed by a
host of Bodhisattvas, will stand before them at the hour of
death, and they will depart this life with tranquil minds.
After their death they will be born in the world Sukhavati,
in the Buddha country of the same Amitayus, the Tathagata."
<P>
	That Amitabha Buddha does not dwell in seclusion as
Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng teaches in his gatha is indicated in the
Amitayurdhyana Sutra which provides for this realization
through various visualization exercises leading to the clear
perception that 84,000 shapes of Buddha have no substance
outside of mind; the three Pure Land practices of
visualizing the form of Amitabha Buddha while meditating on
the essence of the name likewise lead to an undeniable
experience of the emptiness of all form as perceived by
mind--that is, its emptiness apart from the content or
substrate of mind.  As stated in the Amitayurdhyana Sutra
(pp.177-178):  
<P>
	"When you have perceived this, you should next
perceive Buddha himself.  Do you ask how?  Every Buddha
Tathagata is one whose (spiritual) body is the principle of
nature (Dharma-dhatu-kaya), so that he may enter into the
mind of any beings.  Consequently, when you have perceived
Buddha, it is indeed that mind of yours that possesses those
thirty-two signs of perfection and eighty minor marks of
excellence (which you see in Buddha).  In fine, it is your
mind that becomes Buddha, nay, it is your mind that is
indeed Buddha.  The ocean of true and universal knowledge of
all the Buddhas derives its source from one's own mind and
thought.  Therefore you should apply your thought with an
undivided attention to a careful meditation on that Buddha
Tathagata, Arhat, the Holy and Fully Enlightened One."  
<P>
	And, as put concisely in Lu K'uan Yu's translation of this same sutra (p.93):
"When the mind is set on thinking of (that)
Buddha, it is identical...because Mind realizes Buddhahood;
Mind is Buddha...."  "Therefore," says Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng, "what are
you waiting for?  This Pure Land--you've been there before."
<P>
	We find in Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng's 'Warning Statement' a unification of the
practices of the Zen and Pure Land schools of Buddhism and a fusing of the
concepts of self-power and other-power
which, up to the time of the Sung dynasty, had served to
distinguish meditation as the way of self-power and
Buddha's-name-recitation as the way of other-power, an
outlook preserved today in Japanese Buddhism in contrast to
Chinese and Vietnamese Buddhism.  Approaching the subject of
self-power and other-power in terms of prajna and karuna,
the foundations supporting Mahayana Buddhist practices, D.T.
Suzuki writes in 'The Essence of Buddhism' (pp.46,76):  
<P>
	"There are two pillars supporting the great edifice of Buddhism: the Daichi
(tai-chi), Mahaprajna, the Great Wisdom, and the Daihi (tai-pei), Mahakaruna,
the Great Compassion.  The
wisdom flows from the Compassion and the Compassion from the
Wisdom, for the two are in fact one, though from the human
point of view we have to speak of them as two....In Japanese
Buddhism, Zen represents the Prajna phase of the Mahayana,
and the Pure Land school claims the Karuna."  
<P>
	In Vietnamese Buddhism, with its emphasis on syncretism, these two pillars
are one in practice; the prajna phase of Zen and the karuna aspect of the Pure
Land, joined in the Zen-Pure Land union originally introduced to the country
by Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng, support the framework of modern Vietnamese Buddhism.
Though
appearing somewhat antithetical, Zen and Pure Land
Dharma-doors ultimately open on the same goal; approached
from this standpoint, various fluctuations in methodology
are of small concern, for as Holmes Welch notes in 'The
Practice of Chinese Buddhism' (pp.399-400):  
<P>
	"Regardless of contradictory details, the main principles of the joint
practice of Ch'an and Pure Land seem clear enough.  In both sevts the goal was
to reduce attachment to ego.  The Pure
Land method of "no stirrings in the whole mind" (i-hsin pu
luan) did not differ essentially from the Ch'an method of
"meditating to the point of perfect concentration"
(ch'an-ting).  Pure Land speaks of getting the help of
another, that is, Amitabha, to reach the Western Paradise,
while Ch'an asserts that one must depend on oneself to reach
enlightenment.  But, as the abbot of Chin Shan remarked,
"Who is going to help you stop your whole mind from
stirring?  You have to do it yourself."  A lay informant
said he had been told by Hsu-yun that "all the buddhas in
every universe, past, present, and future, preach the same
dharma.  There is no real difference between the methods
advocated by Sakyamuni and Amitabha...."  The methods of the
two sects are connected in many ways.  For example, the
hua-t'ou most often used in orthodox Ch'an meditation halls
directly involved Pure Land practice, for how could one ask
"Who is this reciting buddha's name?" unless one had been
reciting it?...Many monks told me that they regarded Ch'an
and Pure Land as complements essential to one another.
"Pure Land without Ch'an cannot be depended upon
(k'ao-pu-chu).  Ch'an without Pure Land has no 'principle'
(mei-yu chu)."  
<P>
	Even the distinctions "Ch'an" and "Pure Land" vanish in Vietnamese Buddhism
where all ways are Buddha-ways and are one in the communal quest of
enlightenment through Thie^`n-Ti.nh Nha^'t-tri' (C. Ch'an-ching I-chih, J.
Zenjo itchi), the unification of meditation and recitation.  In the Vietnamese
view, if we practice
Nie^.m-Pha^.t with mouth calling Buddha's name, eyes seeing
Buddha's form, ears hearing Nam-mo^ A-Di-Dda`-Pha^.t until the
Pure Land appears in front of us and we realize 84,000
wondrous Buddha-shapes are not outside of mind, then what
real difference is there with the Zen aim of meditating
until Mind, Buddha, and sentient beings are not three
separate things or until realizing one is all, all things
are one, samsara is nirvana, and passions are Bodhi?  The
fusion of Zen and Pure Land systems, of no-mind and one-mind
in the Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng school, is the significant junction of the
loving-kindness (S. karuna) and wisdom (S. prajna) of Buddha
and his teachings.  According to Vietnamese Buddhists, when
karuna (V. Tu+`-bi) and prajna (V. Tri'-hue^.) are united there
is no difference between Zen and Pure Land, between
self-power and other-power; instead there is oneness and
togetherness within the Karuna-Prajna MInd which is indeed
the meeting place of all sects in Buddhism.  This unified
philosophy of Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng was keenly attuned to the character
and aspirations of the Vietnamese people; having inherited
the various teachings of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism
with their accompanying cultural traditions, the Vietnamese
ever sought to consolidate these traditions into a spiritual
rationale or ethical mean consonant with their own cultural
background and indegenous beliefs.  Since Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng's
philosophy of syncretism was so suited to this purpose,
dignitaries of high position, kings, and officials of the
imperial court, as well as the Vietnamese people, accepted
it with their earnest heart.  King Ly'-Tha'nh-To^n, as
mentioned previously, when once aware of Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng's
position as a distinguished Chinese Zen master, gave him his
full support, openly praising his philosophy and concept of
practice.  As Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng's first disciple the king was
instrumental in creating and spreading the doctrine of this
third Zen school in Vietnam; Ly'-Tha'nh-To^n was not just a
Buddhist patron in word, but in deed as well.  Many
instances of his kindness and benevolence are recorded in
Vietnamese history, and stories such as the ones below are
familiar to Vietnamese Buddhists.  
<P>
	According to historical sources King Ly'-Tha'nh-To^n was a most sincere
Buddhist, incomparable in devotion and compassion.  During the winter months
his thoughts often dwelt on the suffering of the prisoners and poor people.
Calling his attendant one
bitter-cold day the king lamented, "Here I am in the
palace--warm clothes and shelter--yet still I feel cold.
What of those in our prison cells who don't have enough to
eat or enough to wear?  How they must suffer from cold and
hunger!  And what of those suspects who have yet to be
questioned--are we to assume them guilty and treat them like
criminals?  They could suffer unjustly merely waiting for
interrogation which would be most pitiful.  Surely we must
do something about all this."  The king then ordered
sufficient clothing, bedding, and food for all prisoners and
suspects being detained by the state.  
<P>
	A sceond frequently related incident concerns the time Ly'-Tha'nh-To^n's
daughter Princess Ddo^.ng-Thie^n attended a Thie^n-Kha'nh court session over
which the king presided.  After issuing his judgment on a particular case
before the court he turned to his board of jurors and said, "Today my daughter
is here, Princess
Ddo^.ng-Thie^n.  Though I love my peoples as I love my daughter,
when they break laws they must be punished.  Nonetheless I
feel deeply for them; from now on we must mitigate every
penalty."  
<P>
	Due to Ly'-Tha'nh-To^n's dedication in realizing the
Bodhisattva ideal and his insight acquired through continual
practice of both meditation and recitation, Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng
transmitted the seal-of-mind (V. Ta^m-a^'n, J. Shin-in) to him,
thus establishing the king as the first patriarch of the
Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng Zen school.  Ly'-Nha^n-To^n (ruled 1072-1127), Ly'-Tha^`n-To^n
(ruled 1128-1138), Ly'-Anh-To^n (ruled 1138-1175), and Ly'-Cao-To^n (ruled
1176-1210), the four successive monarchs who brought the prosperous Ly'
dynasty to a close, all emulated Ly'-Tha'nh-To^n in their patronage and study
of Buddhism.  They frequently arranged for esteemed masters to teach
meditation and Buddhist doctrine in the imperial palace, honored them with the
positions of national teachers, and sought their advice
concerning administration of internal and foreign affairs.
Among these later Buddhist kings, Ly'-Anh-To^n and Ly'-Cao-To^n
were most successful in their religious life, receiving the
seal-of-mind and transfer of patriarchal authority in the
tradition of Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng Zen.  
<P>
	Following Ly'-Tha^`n-To^n's death, Ly'-Anh-To^n (Prince Thie^n-To^., ruled
1138-1175) succeeded to the throne, where he studied meditation and recitation
with Ven. Kho^ng-Lo^., sixth patriarch in the second generation of the Tha?o-
Ddu+o+`ng school, from whom he received the seal-of-mind.  Ly'-Anh-To^n
supported other Buddhist sects as well as his own; during his reign Buddhism
prospered in the country under many enlightened monks such as Venerables
Tri'-Thuye^`n, Am-Tri', Ba?o-Gia'm, and Vie^n-Tho^ng.  In 1144, though his own
disposition of mind lay with the Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng teachings, Ly'-Anh-To^n chose
to name Ven. Vie^n-Tho^ng, a famed master of the Ty`-Ni-Dda-Lu+u-Chi Zen sect,
as national
teacher.  The king ever urged people to expand their
educational horizons by becoming aware of their diverse
cultural background and the significance of the teachings of
the three religions; in 1169 in order to stimulate study he
opened an examination based on the doctrines of Buddhism,
Taoism, and Confucianism as a means of selecting government
officials.  Speaking of these educational reforms and noting
commercial advancements made during Ly'-Anh-To^n's reign,
Professor Howard Sosis writes in his "Introductory Notes on
the Meditation Sects of Buddhism in Ancient Vietnam" (p.19,
n.188):  "Under the rule of this Emperor commercial
relations were made with China, Java, and Thailand in
precious metal and jewels, elephants for warfare, rhinoceros
horns, silk and brocades.... This ruler was also to open
schools in religious instruction in the three major
religions in the land:  Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism."
<P>
	The last monarch of the Ly' dynasty, Ly'-Anh-To^n's son Prince Long-Ca'n
(ruled as King Ly'-Cao-To^n 1176-1210), inherited the throne at the age of
three, but national affairs ran well
due to the guidance of mandarin supervisor To^-Hie^'n-Tha`nh.
As Prince Long-Ca'n grew older he evinced the same
earnestness in pursuing Buddhist studies as did preceding
kings of Ly'; he practiced meditation and recitation with
Ven. Tru+o+ng-Tam-Ta.ng of the fourth generation of the
Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng sect and upon receiving his master's seal-of-mind
became the sixteenth patriarch in Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng tradition.
After coming of age and assuming actual control of the
government, he received the name of King Ly'-Cao-To^n; in this
position he continued his father's work, propagating
Buddhism in the country and sincerely practicing both Zen
and Nie^.m-Pha^.t.  Ly'-Cao-To^n belonged to the fifth and last
generation of the Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng school.  Subsequent history
does not mention the names and biographies of any other
successors.  
<P>
	Generally speaking, Buddhism, especially the Ty`-Ni-Dda-Lu+u-Chi, Vo^-Ngo^n-
Tho^ng, and Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng Zen sects, flourished during the Ly' dynasty due
to the generous support
and sincere interest of the Ly' monarchs and their officials
whose practice of the Buddhist way influenced the people to
join their hearts and minds with the teaching of Buddha.
The Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng sect, having a number of kings among its
patriarchs, was most prosperous during this period of
Vietnamese history and, as we see from the following lineage
of the school, various eminent monks and outstanding laymen
as well as these monarchs contributed to the extension of
Tha?o-Ddu+o+`ng tradition through five generations and eighteen
patriarchs, spanning the years from Ly'-Tha'nh-To^n (1054) to
Ly'-Cao-To^n (1210).
