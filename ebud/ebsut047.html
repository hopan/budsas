    <p>Removing Annoyance </p>
    <blockquote>
      </b><p>&quot;Bhikkhus, there are these five ways of removing annoyance, by which annoyance
      can be entirely removed by a bhikkhu when it arises in him. What are the five?</p>
      <p>&quot;Loving-kindness can be maintained in being towards a person with whom you are
      annoyed: this is how annoyance with him can be removed. Compassion can be maintained in
      being &#133; Onlooking equanimity can be maintained in being &#133;. The forgetting and
      ignoring of a person &#133; can be practiced &#133;. Ownership of deeds in a person &#133;
      can be concentrated upon thus: 'This good person is owner of his deeds, heir to his deeds,
      his deeds are the womb from which he is born, his deeds are his kin for whom he is
      responsible, his deeds are his refuge, he is heir to his deeds, be they good or bad.' This
      too is how annoyance with him can be removed.</p>

    <p>Handling Anger</b></p>

      world. Which three? An individual like an inscription in rock, like an inscription in
      soil, and like an inscription in water.</p>
      <p>&quot;And how is an individual like an inscription in rock? There is the case where a
      certain individual is often angered, and his anger stays with him a long time. Just as an
      inscription in rock is not quickly effaced by wind or water and lasts a long time, in the
      same way a certain individual is often angered &#133; .</p>
      <p>&quot;And how is an individual like an inscription in soil? There is the case where a
      certain individual is often angered, but his anger doesn't stay with him a long time. Just
      as an inscription in soil is quickly effaced by wind or water and doesn't last a long
      time, in the same way a certain individual is often angered &#133;.</p>
      <p>&quot;And how is an individual like an inscription in water? There is the case where a
      certain individual - when spoken to roughly, spoken to harshly, spoken to in an unpleasing
      way - is nevertheless congenial, companionable, &amp; courteous. Just as an inscription in
      water immediately disappears and doesn't last a long time, in the same way a certain
      individual - when spoken to roughly, &#133;. </p>

      blind turtle that came up once at the end of each century. What do you think, bhikkhus?
      Would that blind turtle put his neck into that yoke with one hole in it?</p>
      <p>&quot;He might, venerable sir, sometime or other at the end of a long period.</p>

      with a single hole in it than a fool, once gone to perdition, would take to regain the

      the ultimate goal, and some do not attain it?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;As to that, brahmin, I will ask you a question in return. &#133;. Suppose a man
      came who wanted to go to Rajagaha, and he approached you and said: 'Venerable sir, I want
      to go to Rajagaha. Show me the road to Rajagaha.' Then you told him: 'Now, good man, this
      road goes to Rajagaha. Follow it for awhile and you will see a certain village, go a
      little further and you will see a certain town, go a little further and you will see
      Rajagaha with its lovely parks, groves, meadows, and ponds.' Then having been thus advised
      and instructed by you, he would take a wrong road and would go to the west. Then a second
      man came who &#133;. Then having been thus advised and instructed by you, he would arrive
      safely in Rajagaha. Now, brahmin, since Rajagaha exists and the path leading to Rajagaha
      exists and you are present as the guide, what is the cause and reason why, when those men
      have been thus advised and instructed by you, one man takes a wrong road and would go to
      the west and one arrives safely in Rajagaha?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;What can I do about that, Master Gotama? I am one who shows the way.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;So too, brahmin, Nibbana exists and the path leading to Nibbana exists and I am
      present as the guide. Yet when my disciples have been thus advised and instructed by me,
      some of them attain Nibbana, the ultimate goal, and some do not attain it. What can I do
      about that, brahmin? The Tathagata is one who only shows the way.&quot;</p>

      the householder Upali's mind was ready, receptive, free from hindrances, elated, and
      confident, he expounded to him the teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin,
      its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth with all marks removed would take dye
      evenly, so too, while the householder Upali sat there, the spotless immaculate vision of

      cessation.&quot; Then the householder Upali saw the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma,
