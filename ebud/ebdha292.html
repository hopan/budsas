      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT>n this presentation, I will use 
      stories and anecdotes, as well as some jokes, to demonstrate how we can 
      find out for ourselves the meaning of life, in order to live meaningfully. 
      Then I will go on to show that living life meaningfully, according to the 
      Dharma, will take the grief out of loss, and let us die joyfully.<P>In the 
      summer of 1969, just after my 18th birthday, I was enjoying my first 
      experience of tropical jungles. I was travelling in the Yucatan Peninsula 
      of Northeast Guatemala, heading for the recently discovered pyramids of 
      the vanished Mayan civilization.</P>
      <P>In those days, travel was difficult. It took me three or four days to 
      cover the few hundred kilometres from Guatemala City to the ruined temple 
      complex known as Tical. I travelled up narrow rainforest rivers on 
      oil-soaked fishing boats, down winding dirt roads balanced atop heavily 
      loaded trucks, and through small jungle paths on ramshackle rickshaws. It 
      was a region remote, poor and pristine.</P>
      <P>When I finally arrived at the extensive complex of abandoned temples 
      and ancient pyramids, I had neither guide nor guide book to tell me the 
      meaning of those impressive stone monuments pointing to the sky. Nobody 
      was around. So I started climbing one of the tall pyramids.</P>
      <P>On reaching the top, I suddenly knew the meaning of the pyramid, its 
      purpose.</P>
      <P>For the previous three days, I had been travelling exclusively through 
      jungle. The roads, paths and rivers were like tunnels through the dense 
      greenery. Jungle quickly made a ceiling above any new thoroughfare. I 
      hadn&#39;t seen the horizon for many days. Indeed, I hadn&#39;t seen far distances 
      at all. I was in jungle.</P>
      <P>On top of that pyramid, I was above all the tangle of the jungle. Not 
      only could I see where I was in the map-like panorama spread before me, 
      but also I could now see in all directions, with nothing between infinity 
      and me.</P>
      <P>Standing up there as if on top of the world, I imagined what it might 
      have been like for a young Mayan Indian who had been born in the jungle, 
      raised in the jungle, who had lived all their life in the jungle. I 
      pictured them in some religious rite of passage being led gently by the 
      hand, by a wise old holy man, up to the summit of a pyramid for the very 
      first time. When they rose above the tree line and beheld their jungle 
      world unfolded and spread out before them, when they gazed beyond the 
      limits of their world to the horizon and above, they would see emptiness 
      above and around, with no thing and no body between them and the infinite. 
      Their hearts would resonate with the clear symbols of Truth. Insights 
      would flower and give their fruit. They would understand their place in 
      their home world, and they would have seen the infinite, the emptiness, 
      which embraces it all. Their life would have found its meaning.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <FONT SIZE="6">
      <P>L</FONT>iving meaningfully requires such deep insights. We all need to 
      grant ourselves the time and the peace to climb that pyramid inside each 
      one of us, to rise above and beyond the tangled jungle that is our life, 
      if only for a short time. Then we will see for ourselves our place among 
      things, the overview of our life-journey, and gaze unimpeded at the 
      infinity holding it all. Call that meditation if you will, silent knowing 
      or still seeing. It is just like the Mayan Indian ascending the pyramid 
      and transcending his jungle home, so as to find meaning.</P>
      <P>I could tell you what &quot;living meaningfully&quot; is, but that would just add 
      one more philosophy to the confusion of spiritual sciences that you may 
      already be burdened with. One of be beauties of Buddhism is that it does 
      not tell you what to believe, but it tells you how to find out.</P>
      <P>For example, for many years, I believed what other people told me about 
      happiness.</P>
      <P>When I was 14 years old, I was studying for my O-level examinations in 
      a high school in London. My parents and teachers advised me to stop 
      playing soccer in the evenings and weekends, but instead to stay at home 
      giving the time to my homework. They explained how important the O-level 
      exams were and that if I did well, then I&#39;d be happy.</P>
      <P>So I followed their advice and did very well. But it didn&#39;t make me 
      that happy because my success meant that now I must study even harder, for 
      another two years, for the A-level exams. My parents and teachers advised 
      me to stop going out in the evenings and weekends, chasing girls now 
      rather than chasing a football, but instead to stay at home and study. 
      They told me how important the A-level exams were and that if I did well, 
      then I&#39;d be happy.</P>
      <P>So I followed their advice and, once again, did very well. But once 
      again, it didn&#39;t make me that happy, because now I had to study hardest of 
      all, for three more long years, at a University for a degree. My parent 
      (my father was now dead) and teachers advised me to steer clear of the 
      bars and parties, but instead to work hard. They told me how essential a 
      University degree is for success in life, and that if I did well, then I&#39;d 
      be happy.</P>
      <P>At this point, I started to become suspicious.</P>
      <P>I saw some of my older friends who had done well, got their degrees and 
      were working jolly hard. They told me that they were working so hard to 
      save up money to buy something important. When they had enough to buy 
      themselves a car, or a small apartment, then they&#39;d be happy.</P>
      <P>When they had bought their small car, they still weren&#39;t too happy. 
      They were struggling in the turmoil of romance, looking for their partner 
      in life. When they were married, they said to me, then they&#39;d be happy.</P>
      <P>Once married they would have to work so hard to buy a bigger apartment, 
      or even a dream house. &quot;When we have saved up enough to put down a 
      deposit, then we&#39;ll be happy&quot;, they explained.</P>
      <P>Then they would have children to wake them up at night, soak up all 
      their spare money and generate a quantum leap in worry. Happiness would 
      once again be put off. As so many told me, &quot;Once the kids are grown up, 
      left home and settled, then we can do what we want&quot;. Then they&#39;d be happy.</P>
      <P>By the time the kids had left home, the parents were staring at 
      retirement. They continued to work hard, investing and saving for their 
      old age. &quot;When I retire&quot;, they said, &quot;Then I&#39;ll be happy&quot;.</P>
      <P>Even before they retired, and certainly after, my elderly relatives and 
      friends were all going to church. Have you ever noticed how many old 
      people like going to temples and churches? That is because they all think, 
      &quot;When I die, then I&#39;ll be happy&quot;!</P>
      <P>That was the sort of happiness they wanted me to believe in: &quot;When you 
      get this or get that, then you&#39;ll be happy&quot;. Happiness was always a dream 
      in the future, like a rainbow one or two steps ahead, but forever just out 
      of reach. Something was wrong. No one was really happy now.</P>
      <P>That is what happens when we simply believe others, rather than seeing 
      the truth for ourselves. If you live your life pursuing possessions, 
      accumulating attachments, even hurrying after heaven - you will discover 
      that you are not living meaningfully.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <FONT SIZE="6">
      <P>M</FONT>any modern media gurus propose that a fulfilling relationship 
      is the key to living meaningfully. Too many of us, I think, buy that line 
      without questioning it fully.</P>
      <P>Why is it that we don&#39;t choose our children, yet we love them forever, 
      and unconditionally? Even if they turn out far less than desired, we still 
      love them. On the other hand, although we carefully choose our husband or 
      wife, checking them out more thoroughly than anything else in our life 
      before signing the contract, on the whole we do not love them forever, and 
      certainly never unconditionally! Why?</P>
      <P>It is because the love that flows between partners in a relationship is 
      not the same as the love that flows between parents and children.</P>
      <P>In an article in Time magazine several years ago entitled, &quot;The 
      Chemistry of Love&quot;, bio-chemists demonstrated that when boy meets girl 
      over a romantic, candle-lit dinner, hormones are secreted into the 
      bloodstream to produce a chemically induced high. Your partner literally 
      &quot;turns you on&quot;. And you love that high, not that person. Or as Time put 
      it, &quot;You love the way they make you feel&quot;. Later, when your body builds up 
      a natural tolerance to those chemicals, your partner doesn&#39;t turn you on 
      any more. So it&#39;s not their fault after all. It is just chemistry. So, 
      please, never shout and get angry with your partner, shout and get angry 
      at the chemistry book instead!</P>
      <P>The love between a parent and a child is substantially different. You 
      love them even though there may be nothing in it for you. You love them 
      irrespective of the way they make you feel. It is selfless love, 
      unconditional love.</P>
      <P>My father revealed such a love to me when I was only 13, or so. When 
      there was only the two of us sitting in his old car, in a backstreet of 
      West London, he turned round and said to me.</P>
      <P>&quot;Son, whatever you do in your life, the door of my house will always be 
      open to you.&quot; Then he drove back to our home.</P>
      <P>I was, at the time; too young to understand what he meant, but old 
      enough to know it was something important. I remembered it. Only many 
      years later, long after my father had died, while I was a young monk, did 
      I decipher its real meaning.</P>
      <P>His house, our home, was a small rented apartment in a poor area of 
      West London. It wasn&#39;t much of a place to open to anyone. We were never 
      afraid of burglars, because we thought that if a burglar came in and saw 
      our place, then he would probably leave us something out of his own pocket 
      from compassion!</P>
      <P>What my father meant, what he was really trying to say was:</P>
      <P>&quot;Son, whatever you do in your life, the door to my heart will always be 
      open to you&quot;.</P>
      <P>That is what is meant by unconditional love. That is the type of love 
      often found between parents and children. That is selfless love. 
      No-strings-attached love. Freeing love. &quot;Whatever you do in your life, the 
      door to my heart will always be open to you&quot;</P>
      <P>Back to relationships, which type of love flows between you and your 
      partner? Here&#39;s a test for you to find out.</P>
      <P>Imagine your partner. Do you really love them? Do you want them to be 
      happy? Do you truly care about their well being? Is their happiness the 
      most important thing in the world for you?</P>
      <P>Now imagine that you go home from this conference to find that your 
      partner has run off to Paris with your best friend for a steamy affair. 
      How would you feel?</P>
      <P>If you really cared for their well being, then you would be thrilled to 
      hear how happy they both are now. If you really loved your partner, you&#39;d 
      be overjoyed that they are now even happier with your best friend than 
      they were with you. If your loved one&#39;s happiness was that important to 
      you, you would be ecstatic - Oh What Joy! -- to read that they were having 
      such a great time together in the moonlight by the Seine. You always 
      wanted your partner to be happy, now they are. What&#39;s the problem?</P>
      <P>This test makes the point that love in most relationships is selfish 
      love, conditioned love. It is rooted in attachment and branches, sooner or 
      later, into suffering. They say there are three rings in a marriage:</P>
      <I>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>- The engagement ring, <BR>
        - The wedding ring, and <BR>
        - Suffer-ring </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      </I>
      <P>Selfless love is without attachment. It is rooted in giving and 
      branches, inevitably, into freedom. It is the type of love which says, 
      &quot;Whatever you do, the door of my heart is open to you&quot;. It is the way that 
      we can all live meaningfully.</P>
      <P>Such selfless love is the foundation of all charity work. If you give a 
      donation expecting recognition, that is not selfless. If you serve a 
      community wanting to be praised, that is not giving. If you offer your 
      friendship to another wanting something in return, then that is not 
      compassion. Charity, like selfless love, says, &quot;Whatever you do, whoever 
      you are, I give you my heart and share it with you&quot;.</P>
      <P>Even monks practise charity. My monastic life is a festival of giving.</P>
      <P>A woman called me on the phone an hour before I was to give a public 
      talk.</P>
      <P>&quot;Are you speaking tonight?&quot; she politely enquired.</P>
      <P>&quot;Yes, madam. The talk begins a 7.30 pm&quot;, I replied.</P>
      <P>&quot;How much does it cost to get in?&quot; she continued.</P>
      <P>&quot;Nothing, madam, nothing at all&quot;, I explained.</P>
      <P>&quot;No, no!&quot; she interrupted, &quot;You don&#39;t understand. How much money do I 
      have to pay?&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;Madam, you don&#39;t have to pay any money. All my talks are free&quot;.</P>
      <P>&quot;Listen!&quot; she shouted down the phone line, &quot;DOLLARS! CENTS! How much 
      must I cough up to get through the door?&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;Madam&quot;, I said soothingly, &quot;You don&#39;t cough up any money at the door, 
      neither on the way in nor on the way out. We don&#39;t ask for your name nor 
      press you for a donation. If you don&#39;t like the talk, you may walk out at 
      any time. It&#39;s free&quot;.</P>
      <P>There was a long pause.</P>
      <P>&quot;Well&quot; she said with sincere consternation, &quot;What do you guys (meaning 
      &#39;monks&#39;) get out of this then?&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;Happiness, madam&quot;, I replied, &quot;We only get happiness&quot;.</P>
      <P>Such selfless giving is the difference between living life meanly and 
      living life meaningfully. The more you let go the more richly one lives. 
      That&#39;s why all the donation boxes in my temples in Perth are called 
      &quot;Letting Go Boxes&quot;.</P>
      <P>The Buddha said at Dhammapada verse 204: <I>&quot;Contentment is the 
      greatest wealth.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>Thus Buddhism, which teaches such contentment through selfless love: 
      &quot;Whatever you do, the door of my heart is open to you&quot;, is all about 
      wealth creation. The meaning of life is to generate such wealth. 
      Contentment is your portfolio, selfless love are your shares, giving the 
      most secure of investments with dividends literally &quot;out of this world&quot;, 
      all guaranteed by the Chairman of the Reserve, the Buddha Himself.</P>
      <P>The seventeenth century English romantic poet, John Keates, opened his 
      celebrated poem &#39;Endymion&#39; with the timeless words: &quot;A thing of beauty, is 
      a joy forever&quot;.</P>
      <P>Indeed, many of us find meaning in life through the appreciation of 
      beauty. - through watching a glorious sunset in the evening, seeing a 
      roaring waterfall in an unscarred forest, or by pausing to enjoy a 
      brilliant coloured flower smiling by the wayside. Beauty does give life 
      meaning, but not so much in the way said so far.</P>
      <P>Beauty for a monk, said the Buddha (Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta) is 
      virtue. So it is. The most beautiful people in the world are those who are 
      pure hearted. The good person is good to be with. The kind, are kind of 
      nice. And a holy one among the many folk is like a rose emerging out of 
      the thorn bush. Even a wrinkled, broken toothed and grey haired old person 
      who has lived a virtuous life glows with an inner beauty that would make 
      any super-model envious.</P>
      <P>Monk teachers like me encourage all their listeners to live a moral 
      life, to gain that inner beauty that, in John Keates&#39; words, is &quot;a joy 
      forever&quot;. Which is why I call my Buddhist City Centre in Perth, Western 
      Australia, not &quot;Dhammaloka&quot; but &quot;Ajahn Brahm&#39;s Beauty Parlour&quot;! I give 
      little &quot;nips and tucks&quot; to your moral life, apply facial treatments to 
      your honesty, and take the wrinkles out of your precepts. Living life with 
      such a beauty is living meaningfully. Try it. If you want a good time, 
      then be good.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <FONT SIZE="6">
      <P>A</FONT>ll good things come to an end. We all die. As a monk, I have 
      attended more funerals than the flowers by a graveside. Many times I have 
      listened to relatives and friends after the service talking about the one 
      who has just died. It is remarkable that what they remember is not the 
      deceased&#39;s wealth, nor their property, nor their power. What is talked 
      about after the funeral is the person&#39;s goodness, their kindness and how 
      charitable they were. It is as if they are all summing up the newly dead 
      person&#39;s whole life. And what counts, the only things that count, are 
      things like charity, virtue and selfless love. Such qualities are, in 
      accountancy terms, the &quot;bottom line&quot; of a person&#39;s life. It is what their 
      life meant and what gave it meaning. It is strange that only through a 
      death can we realize the wisdom of the Buddha&#39;s teachings on what 
      constitutes living meaningfully.</P>
      <P>For a person who has a profitable bottom line, who has lived their life 
      meaningfully, then dying can be joyful. A Buddhist would understand that 
      because they have performed much good karma, then they can legitimately 
      look forward to a wonderful time after death. They know that they are 
      simply exchanging a worn-out old body for something much better. It is 
      like buying a new car, the vehicle changes but the driver carries on. 
      Where is the tragedy in that?</P>
      <P>Moreover, living meaningfully, as explained so far, is a training in 
      letting go. You let go of some of your wealth to perform charity. You let 
      go of gross behaviour to keep precepts. You let go of concern for yourself 
      to practise compassion. And you let go of desires to practise meditation. 
      The Dharma is a complete training course in letting go.</P>
      <P>So when it comes time to let go of your body and pass through the death 
      experience, a person trained in the Dharma lets go gracefully. In my long 
      experience dealing with the death of both Buddhists and non-Buddhists in 
      Western countries, Buddhists die so much more peacefully and joyfully than 
      anyone else.</P>
      <P>Once, a close disciple rang me from hospital. The woman, in her early 
      forties, had been diagnosed that morning with an untreatable cancer. She 
      could expect only two or three months more to live. I visited her that 
      same afternoon. From her bed in the cancer ward she was smiling and joking 
      with me as she made plans for her death.</P>
      <P>As I left the cancer unit, the head nurse of the ward asked to speak 
      with me. She told me that she was extremely concerned that my disciple was 
      in denial, not accepting the diagnosis of impending death. I had to reply 
      quite firmly that my disciple was not in denial at all. In fact, she had 
      been talking about her death with me for the past hour! You see, the 
      experienced head nurse had never seen such a swift acceptance before. She 
      had only seen terror and tears, anger and defiance. And she had mistaken 
      the lack of such negativity to signify denial. She hadn&#39;t seen a Buddhist 
      die before, and she found it difficult to comprehend how they could face 
      death so joyfully.</P>
      <P>A few months later, at my disciple&#39;s funeral, her Christian doctor said 
      how impressed he was that Buddhists die so gracefully.</P>
      <P>When you understand Dharma, and live that understanding, then there is 
      nothing sad about dying. The only thing that makes me sad is when people 
      do not live meaningfully and waste their precious life.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <FONT SIZE="6">
      <P>M</FONT>y own father died when I was only 16. I loved him very much and 
      still do. Yet I never cried at his funeral, nor have I cried since. I 
      didn&#39;t feel like crying. It took me many years to understand how I felt at 
      the time. Now I use that understanding as a guide on how to die, with joy. 
      This is my understanding.</P>
      <P>As a young man, I loved music. All types of music whether classical or 
      rock, jazz or folk. I would spend many an evening in the concert halls and 
      clubs of central London enjoying some of the best orchestras and bands, 
      musicians and singers that our world had to offer. London was a great 
      place to grow up if you liked music.</P>
      <P>When the concert was to end, I would stand up with the others, clapping 
      and shouting for more. Often, the orchestra or band would play on for a 
      few minutes. But eventually they had to stop and I had to return home. As 
      I remember walking out of the concert halls late in the evening, it always 
      seemed to be raining in London, in that most miserable manner called 
      &quot;drizzle&quot;. It was cold, wet and gloomy, and I knew that I probably would 
      never get to see that great orchestra again. Yet even in the miserable 
      damp darkness of the night, I never felt sad. I never dropped into 
      despair. Instead I was elated and inspired by the great music I had just 
      had the privilege to hear. What a stirring crescendo, what a magnificent 
      performance, what a wonderful experience! I was light years away from the 
      gloom surrounding the London night.</P>
      <P>That is the only way I can describe how I felt when my own father died. 
      It was such a short recital, a mere sixteen years. I was clapping and 
      cheering for more at the end. My dad kept playing a little while longer 
      and, in truth, it was a marvellous crescendo to his life. As I walked out 
      of the crematorium in Mortlake, West London, after his funeral service, I 
      clearly remember that it was drizzling and very cold. Yet I never felt sad 
      at all. I felt inspired, uplifted and deeply moved. &quot;Dad, that was a 
      wonderful performance. That was a tremendous concert that you played in 
      front of your son. I will never forget those fugues and cadenzas and the 
      deep feeling that you gave to your symphony. You were a maestro of life. 
      How lucky I was to have been at your concert&quot;. I was inspired, not sad. I 
      felt deep gratitude not grief. I felt I had witnessed one of the great 
      lives of my era.</P>
      <P>That is how one can die joyfully, and joyfully look at the death of a 
      dear one. In one&#39;s centre one knows that: &quot;Dear loved one, dearest friend, 
      the door of my heart will forever be open to you, no matter what you ever 
      do, even if you die&quot;. Even in death, you let them go. Such selfless love 
      is freeing. Liberating the one who must leave you, and freeing one&#39;s self 
      from all sadness.</P>

      <P>S</FONT>o this is what I mean by living meaningfully and dying 
      joyfully. It is what I have seen for myself climbing beyond the confusion 
      of the world in my monk&#39;s meditation, like ascending the pyramids in the 
      jungles of Central America. It is what is said by the Buddha in the 
      ancient Sutras. And it is written in your heart right now, waiting to 
      guide you.</P>
      <P>When you live your life meaningfully not only will you die joyfully, 
      but you will also give so much joy to all who meet with you, in your life 
      and in death.</P>
