      proselytize but merely to present the teachings of the Buddha to those who 
      are interested. I found numerous such persons. To those who believed in 
      God, I said, if you are convinced of God and if it is beneficial, by all 
      means you may believe in him. But for my part, I told them that I could do 
      better without depending on him.&quot;</I><P>These words of Ven. Narada Maha 
      Thera <I>(Ceylon Daily News- 21.12.1966)</I> showed the same spirit, even 
      after 2500 years after the parinibbana of the Buddha, of the following 
      utterance of the Buddha. <I>&quot;Aparuta tesam amatassa dvara ye sotavanto 
      pamuncantu saddham Vihimsa sanni pagunam na bhasim - Dhammam panitam 
      manujesu brahme&quot; ti (Mahapadana Sutta, Digha Nikaya) - </I>&quot;Open are the 
      doors to the deathless those who have ears repose trust&quot;.</P>
      <P>The Buddha during his 45 years after Enlightenment travelled the length 
      and breath of North India beating the &#39;drum of deathlessness&#39; (amata 
      dundubhim) so that intelligent beings could listen to the teaching and 
      become followers of the Buddha by reposing trust in the Buddha, the 
      Dhamma, and the Sangha.</P>
      <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>Early Days</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>Ven. Narada lived for 85 years. He was born on July 14, 1898 to Kalonis 
      Perera (father) and Pabilina de Silva (mother) who were living in 
      Kotahena. It was a Christian environment but the influence of Anagarika 
      Dharmapala, who was vehemently criticizing the Sinhala people for 
      slavishly giving Christian names to their children, was visible in that 
      the name given to the new born was Sumanapala. He had his secondary 
      education at St. Benedict&#39;s College, Kotahena. His learning ability and 
      his excellent ways drew the attention of the padres, especially Father 
      James, who once had remarked that young Sumanapala was most suitable to be 
      a cleric of the Catholic Church. His familiarity with Christian rituals 
      and his deep knowledge of Christianity stood in good stead when he 
      travelled in the West as a Buddhist missionary.</P>
      <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>Period of Preparation</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>The First World War was ending in 1918 and the suffering and carnage a 
      war brings may have influenced young Sumanapala who was reaching the age 
      of 18 years. His uncle was a dayaka at Vajiraramaya and this brought 
      Sumanapala into contact with the Most Venerable Pelene Vajiragnana Maha 
      Nayaka Thera. The Maha Nayaka Thera had the ability to spot talent and on 
      his 18th birthday Sumanapala was ordained at Vajiraramaya taking the name 
      &#39;Narada&#39;. Two years later he gained his higher ordination or upasampada.</P>
      <P>Ven. Narada could not have had a better teacher to learn the Buddha 
      Dhamma than the Most Venerable Pelene Vajiragnana Maha Nayaka Thera. As an 
      external student, he studied Ethics and Philosophy at the University 
      College, Colombo, where he was able to associate closely with Ven. 
      Rambukwelle Siddhartha Thera, an oriental scholar monk of repute. At the 
      Vajiraramaya, he also met Dr. Cassius Perera (later Ven. Kassapa) and 
      together they started the Servants of Buddha Society in 1921. Alec 
      Robertson, who later was a President of this Society, wrote as follows to 
      the Narada Felicitation Volume (1979), &#39;<I>As a young and promising monk 
      of only 21 years of age, he (Ven. Narada) showed exceptional intellectual 
      prowess matched by an equal degree of spiritual fervour. With the mature 
      guidance and advice of Dr. Cassius Perera he mastered the English language 
      and in course of time became an eloquent and convincing speaker who 
      captivated the minds of the English educated Buddhists with his sermons 
      which were characterized by their clarity and discernment.&#39;</I> Ven. 
      Narada also had the companionship of that soft spoken and talented English 
      monk, Ven. Metteyya, who was residing at the Vajiraramaya.</P>
      <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>First visit abroad</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>Ven. Narada was 31 years old when he made his first debut in the 
      international world. Due to the untiring effort of Anagarika Dharmapala 
      the Mulagandakuti Vihara at Sarnath, India was completed in 1929 and there 
      was an invitation to the maha sangha to participate at the opening 
      ceremony. Sri Lanka&#39;s delegation, which included Ven. Narada, was led by 
      Ven. Kahawe Ratanasara Nayaka Thera, the head of the Vidyodaya Pirivena. 
      It was fortuitous that it fell on the shoulders of Ven. Narada to conduct 
      all proceedings at this historic function. The opening was attended by 
      Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru whom Ven. Narada met for the first time.</P>
      <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>Successful Missions of Ven. Narada Maha Thera</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>During Ven. Narada&#39;s fifty years of missionary work, which ended with 
      his demise on October 20, 1983, he had visited all continents, except the 
      Antarctica. In many of the countries he was the first Theravada Buddhist 
      monk to have set foot in recent times. Due to the work of oriental 
      studies&#39; societies like the Pali Text Society and the Royal Asiatic 
      Societies, the excavations of Buddhist sites by eminent archaeologists 
      like Sir Aurel Stein and Cunningham, and the missionary work of persons 
      like Anagarika Dharmapala, there was much interest both in the West and 
      the East to know more of Theravada Buddhism.</P>
      <P>Ven. Narada Maha Thera fitted this bill very well. He had the erudition 
      and the serenity, the gentleness and piety, and above all a perfect 
      command of the English language to put across the most abstruse teachings 
      of the Buddha in a simple, eloquent and persuasive manner. Some of his 
      books like the English translation of the Dhammapada and Buddhism in a 
      Nutshell had been translated to several languages and at times preceded 
      his visits. Because of his publications there was an eagerness to see him 
      in person and, hence, he was able to command the respect of the audience. 
      Furthermore, his compassion was all pervasive, and because of his 
      vegetarian ways, his special love for children and his amiable demeanour 
      and countenance he was able to reach the hearts of everyone.</P>
      <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>Asia</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>His most successful missions in Asia were in Indonesia, Nepal, 
      Singapore, and Vietnam. His first visit to Indonesia was in 1934 when he 
      carried a bo-sapling from the sacred bodhi tree in Anuradhapura and 
      planted it in the precincts of the famous Borobudur temple. He is 
      remembered as the first Theravada bhikkhu to have set foot in Indonesia in 
      a thousand years. During his mission in June 1959 to participate in the 
      Vesak festivities in Borobudur, he ordained 2 Chinese, 2 Indonesian and 2 
      Balanese persons and established a sima for the conduct of vinaya acts of 
      monks. When he revisited Borobudur in 1969, which was his 4th visit, he 
      was overjoyed when he saw that the bo-sapling planted by him 35 years ago 
      had &#39;grown and matured into a huge tree covering a vast area around the 
      Borobudur shrine&#39;. It also symbolised the establishment of the Theravada 
      Buddhist tradition in Indonesia. In March 1982 Ven. Narada conducted his 
      12th dhammaduta mission to Indonesia and the year later he was again in 
      Indonesia to officiate at the Poson festivities. That happened to be his 
      last mission because he passed away soon after his return.</P>
      <P>Ven. Narada Maha Thera considered Vietnam as his second home. In some 
      of his missions he stayed for over one year counselling and serving the 
      people. He has undertaken over 17 dhammaduta missions to Vietnam. In 1966 
      after his 6th mission he was asked whether he has a special liking for 
      Vietnam and his reply bespeaks for himself as a true Buddhist missionary.
      <I>&quot;I regard the whole world as my motherland, all people as my brothers 
      and sisters. I prefer to work in Vietnam because the Vietnamese Buddhists 
      are badly in need of voluntary religious workers to propagate the Buddha&#39;s 
      message.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>He had many successes in Vietnam. At the Jetavana Vihara [*] in Saigon 
      the Vesak celebrations were jointly organised by the entire Buddhist 
      community belonging to all sects because of his leadership. In 1969 he 
      opened a Buddhist school with a full curriculum. In 1973 the foundation 
      stone for a Buddhist hall and library was laid. In 1974 for the first time 
      an all night pirit ceremony was held in Vietnam at the Jetavana Vihara 
      following Sinhala tradition. The Sakyamuni Vihara [*], situated about 100 
      miles away from Saigon, was the centrepiece of his missionary work in 
      Vietnam. All the elements of a Sinhala Buddhist temple and the 
      architectural traditions of Sri Lanka were featured. He would not have 
      minded if he were to pass away there.</P>
      <P>To Nepal he led over six dhammaduta missions. The most notable was the 
      mission in 1946, when he led a delegation consisting of Ven. Piyadassi, 
      Ven. Amitananda of Nepal, who was residing at the Vajiraramaya, Prof. M. 
      D. Ratnasuriya and Prof. M. B. Ariyapala to meet with the King of Nepal. 
      His mission was to obtain a royal decree for the return of the Theravada 
      monks who were exiled to India. He was not only successful to get royal 
      pardon but also was able to get the day of Vesak declared a public 
      holiday. Ven Narada Maha Thera was highly respected by the Nepalese 
      royalty and this helped in the firm establishment of the Theravada sangha 
      in Nepal. The ties between the Nepalese and the Sihala sangha have since 
      grown from strength to strength.</P>
      <P>The Lankaramaya established by the Ven. Thera with the assistance of 
      the Sri Lankan Buddhist Community along with the Sima for ecclesiastical 
      acts was the first Theravada temple in Singapore. From Vietnam the Ven. 
      Thera visited the neighbouring countries on dhammaduta work. Missions to 
      Cambodia and Laos (1959) are recorded. Ven Narada Maha Thera was accorded 
      the title of Sadhu Maha by the Sangharaja and the King of Laos during his 
      visit in recognition of his services to the Sasana in the countries of 
      Indochina. Prior to his mission to Laos, the Ven. Thera, who travelled to 
      Rangoon by ship, flew to Peking (now Beijing), China (24.07.1959) 
      accompanied by Ven. Dhammaruci, a Chinese monk who was studying in Sri 
      Lanka. He took with him Buddha relics and presented them to Chao Pu-Chu, 
      the Vice President, and General Secretary of the Buddhist Association of 
      China.</P>
      <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>Australia</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>On the invitation of the President of the Buddhist Society of New South 
      Wales the Ven. Thera visited Sydney in March 1955. As there was no temple 
      at the time he stayed in the house of Mr. Berkley, the President of the 
      Society. A few years earlier Mr. Berkley has met Ven. Narada Maha Thera in 
      Colombo and had become a Buddhist. He spent three months in Australia 
      engaged in dhammaduta work.</P>
      <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>Africa</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>Ven. Maha Thera&#39;s visit to Africa was in 1947. Before his goodwill 
      mission a farewell was accorded to him by the Colombo YMBA on March 24, 
      1947. The invitation was from Mr. D. A. S. Nanayakkara of the Tanzania 
      Colony Civil Service as the President of the Dar-es-Salam YMBA. This 
      goodwill mission, which lasted 40 days, took him to Mombasa, Dar-es-Salam, 
      Zanzibar, and Nairobi. Commenting on this mission he said, &quot;During my stay 
      I emphasized the need for Christian neighbourliness, Muslim brotherhood, 
      Hindu oneness, and Buddhist maitree.&quot;</P>
      <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>Americas</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>During his visit to the USA in 1959, he was invited by the Sri Lanka&#39;s 
      Ambassador, Mr. R. S. S. Gunewardena and the Burmese Ambassador U. Win to 
      spend the vassana in Washington. He declined because of his other 
      engagements in Europe. A public lecture was given by him at the Washington 
      Memorial. The Ven. Maha Thera was honoured by the Humanist Award given by 
      the Roiscrucian Society. He wrote an article to the Roiscrucian digest of 
      July 1959, with the title &#39;A Plea for Peace and Disarmament&#39;. His thinking 
      is summarised by his concluding lines. &quot;One Western poet sang &#39;East is 
      East and West is West. The twain shall never meet&#39;.</P>
      <I>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>&quot;With all humility it may be said,<BR>
        East is East and West is West.<BR>

        For all in peace to live&quot;</P>

      <P>The first dhammaduta mission of the Ven. Maha Thera to England was in 
      June 1949. He delivered a lecture at China House and Mr. Christmas 
      Humphreys presided at the meeting. In 1954, he revisited England at the 
      invitation of Sir Cyril Soysa to be the head of the first Buddhist Vihara 
      in London, located at Kensington. He left after 6 months. In 1956 he was 
      invited by the World Congress of Faiths, Switzerland to deliver a talk on 
      &#39;The Buddhist View of the Contemporary Situation&#39;. After a visit of Ven. 
      Narada Maha Thera a Buddhist Society was formed in Gothenburg, Sweden in 
      1957. On his return he had engagements in Holland, Rome, Greece and Egypt. 
      In 1963, the Ven. Thera visited Germany and France.</P>
      <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>Ven. Narada Maha Thera Museum</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>Ven. Narada Maha Thera is undoubtedly one of the greatest Buddhist 
      missionaries of the 20th century. The Times Collection of paper cuttings, 
      maintained at the National Archives, was the main source for this article, 
      besides other secondary sources. But it is extremely scrappy with many 
      voids. It will be useful in tracing the history of the spread of Buddhism 
      in the world to reconstruct a chronological record of the many dhammaduta 
      missions of Ven. Narada Maha Thera. There were intentions to set up a 
      Narada Thera Museum at the Vajiraramaya temple (Ceylon Daily News - 
      17.12.83). Later events indicate that it has been only wishful thinking. A 
      project of this nature should draw the attention of all concerned 
      Buddhists, especially those who are associated with the Vajiraramaya 
      Temple.</P>
