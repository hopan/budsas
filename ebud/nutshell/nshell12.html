    </blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>Anapana Sati</strong></em> is mindfulness on
    respiration. <em><strong>Ana</strong></em> means inhalation
    and <em><strong>Apana</strong></em> exhalation. </p>
    <p>Concentration on the breathing process leads to
    one-pointedness of the mind and ultimately to Insight which
    enables one to attain Sainthood or Arhatship. </p>
    <p>The Buddha also practiced concentration on respiration
    before He attained Enlightenment. </p>
    <p>This harmless concentration may be practiced by any person
    irrespective of religious beliefs. </p>
    <p>Adopting a convenient posture, keep the body erect. Place
    the right hand over the left hand. Eyes may be closed or
    half-closed. </p>
    <p>Easterners generally sit cross-legged with the body erect.
    They sit placing the right foot on the left thigh and the
    left foot on the right thigh. This is the full position.
    Sometimes they adopt the half position, that is by simply
    placing the right foot on the left thigh or the left foot on
    the right thigh. </p>
    <p>When the triangular position is assumed the whole body is
    well-balanced. </p>
    <p>Those who find the cross-legged posture too difficult may
    sit comfortably in a chair or any other support sufficiently
    high to rest the legs on the ground. </p>
    <p>It is of no importance which posture one may adopt
    provided the position is easy and relaxed. </p>
    <p>Head should not be drooping. Neck should be straightened
    so that the nose may be in a perpendicular line with the
    navel. </p>
    <p>Buddhas usually adopt the full lotus position. They sit
    with half closed eyes looking not more than a distance of
    three and half feet. </p>
    <p>Before the practice, bad air from the lungs should be
    breathed out slowly through the mouth and then the mouth
    should be closed. </p>
    <p>Now inhale through the nostrils normally, without strain,
    without force. Mentally count one. Exhale and count two.
    Inhale and count three. Count up to ten constantly
    concentrating on the breathing process without thinking of
    anything else. While doing so one's mind may wander. But one
    need not be discouraged. Gradually one may increase the
    number of series -- say five series of ten. </p>
    <p>Later, one may inhale and pause for a moment,
    concentrating merely on inhalation without counting. Exhale
    and pause for a moment. Thus inhale and exhale concentrating
    on respiration. Some prefer counting as it aide concentration
    while others prefer not to count. What is essential is
    concentration and not counting, which is secondary. </p>
    <p>When one practices this concentration one feels very
    peaceful, light in mind and body. After practicing for a
    certain period a day might come when one may realize that
    this so-called body is supported by mere breath and that body
    perishes when breathing ceases. One fully realizes
    impermanence. Where there is change there cannot be a
    permanent entity or an immortal soul. Insight can then be
    developed to attain Arhatship. </p>
    <p>It is clear that the object of this concentration on
    respiration is not merely to gain one-pointedness but also to
    cultivate Insight to obtain deliverance from suffering. </p>
    <p>In some discourses this simple and harmless method of
    respiration is described as follows: </p>
    <p>&quot;Mindfully he inhales; mindfully he exhales. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>1. When making a long inhalation he knows: 'I make a
        long inhalation'; when making a long exhalation he knows;
        'I make a long exhalation'. </p>
        <p>2. When making a short inhalation he knows: ' I make a
        short inhalation'; when making a short exhalation he
        knows: 'I make a short exhalation'. </p>
        <p>3. Clearly perceiving the entire breathing process
        (i.e., the beginning, middle and end), 'I will inhale;
        thus he trains himself; clearly perceiving the entire
        breathing process, 'I will exhale'; thus he trains
        himself. </p>
        <p>4. Calming the respiration, 'I will inhale'; thus he
        trains himself; calming the respirations, 'I will
        exhale'; thus he trains himself. &quot; </p>

        <p>As a clean and empty vessel is filled with pure water
        I now fill my clean heart and pure mind with peaceful and

        will, cruelty, violence, jealousy, envy, passion and
        aversion. </p>

    <p>Think ten times: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>May I [*] be well and happy! May I be free from
        suffering, disease, grief, worry and anger! May I be
        strong, self-confident, healthy and peaceful! </p>
        <p>*[Here the term &quot;I&quot; is used in a
        conventional sense.] </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Think thus: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Now I charge every particle of my system, from head to
        foot, with thoughts of boundless loving-kindness and
        compassion. I am the embodiment of loving-kindness and
        compassion. My whole body is saturated with
        loving-kindness and compassion. I am a stronghold, a
        fortress of loving-kindness and compassion. I am nothing
        but loving-kindness and compassion. I have sublimated
        myself, elevated myself, ennobled myself. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Think ten times: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>May I be well and happy! May I be free from suffering,
        disease, grief, worry and anger! May I be strong,
        self-confident, healthy and peaceful! </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Think: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Mentally I create an aura of loving-kindness around
        me. By means of this aura, I cut off all negative
        thoughts, hostile vibrations. I am not affected by the
        evil vibrations of others. I return good for evil,
        loving-kindness for anger, compassion for cruelty,
        sympathetic joy for jealously. I am peaceful and
        well-balanced in mind. Now I am a fortress of loving-
        kindness, a stronghold of morality. </p>
        <p>What I have gained I now give unto others. </p>

    <p>Think of all your near and dear ones at home, individually
    or collectively, and fill them with thoughts of
    loving-kindness and wish them peace and happiness, repeating
    May all beings be well and happy! ... Then think of all seen
    and unseen beings, living near and far, men, women, animals
    and all living beings, in the East, West, North, South, above
    and below, and radiate boundless loving-kindness, without any
    enmity or obstruction, towards all, irrespective of class,
    creed, colour or sex. </p>
    <p>Think that all are your brothers and sisters,
    fellow-beings in the ocean of life. You identify with all.
    You are one with all. </p>
    <p>Repeat ten times, &quot;May all beings be well and
    happy,&quot; and wish them all peace and happiness. </p>
    <p>In the course of your daily life try to translate your
    thoughts into action as occasion demands. </p>
