<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The non-aggressive, moral and philosophical system
    expounded by the Buddha, which demands no blind faith from
    its adherents, expounds no dogmatic creeds, encourages no
    superstitious rites and ceremonies, but advocates a golden
    mean that guides a disciple through pure living and pure
    thinking to the gain of supreme wisdom and deliverance from
    all evil, is called the Dhamma and is popularly known as
    Buddhism. </p>
    <p>The all-merciful Buddha has passed away, but the sublime
    Dhamma which He unreservedly bequeathed to humanity, still
    exists in its pristine purity. </p>
    <p>Although the Master has left no written records of His
    Teachings, His distinguished disciples preserved them by
    committing to memory and transmitting them orally from
    generation to generation. </p>
    <p>Immediately after His demise 500 chief Arahats [*] versed
    in the Dhamma [**] and Vinaya, [***] held a convocation to
    rehearse the Doctrine as was originally taught by the Buddha.
    Venerable Ananda Thera, who enjoyed the special privilege of
    hearing all the discourses, recited the Dhamma, while the
    Venerable Upali recited the Vinaya. </p>
    <p>* [Literally, the Worthy Ones. They are the enlightened
    disciples who have destroyed all passions.] ** [The
    Teaching.] *** [The Discipline.] </p>
    <p>The <em><strong>Tipitaka</strong></em> was compiled and
    arranged in its present form by those Arahats of old. </p>
    <p>During the reign of the pious Sinhala King Vattagamani
    Abhaya, about 83 B.C., the Tipitaka was, for the first time
    in the history of Buddhism, committed to writing on palm
    leaves (ola) in Ceylon. </p>
    <p>This voluminous <em><strong>Tipitaka</strong></em>, which
    contains the essence of the Buddha's Teaching, is estimated
    to be about eleven times the size of the Bible. A striking
    contrast between the Tipitaka and the Bible is that the
    former is not a gradual development like the latter. </p>
    <p>As the word itself implies, the <em><strong>Tipitaka</strong></em>
    consists of three baskets. They are the Basket of Discipline
    (<em><strong>Vinaya Pitaka</strong></em>), the Basket of
    Discourses (<em><strong>Sutta Pitaka</strong></em>), and the
    Basket of Ultimate Doctrine (<em><strong>Abhidhamma Pitaka</strong></em>).
    </p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><strong>Vinaya Pitaka</strong></font></p>
    <p>The <em><strong>Vinaya Pitaka</strong></em> which is
    regarded as the sheet anchor to the oldest historic celibate
    order -- the Sangha -- mainly deals with rules and
    regulations which the Buddha promulgated, as occasion arose,
    for the future discipline of the Order of monks (<em><strong>Bhikkhus</strong></em>)
    and nuns (<em><strong>Bhikkunis</strong></em>). It described
    in detail the gradual development of the <em><strong>Sasana</strong></em>
    (Dispensation). An account of the life and ministry of the
    Buddha is also given. Indirectly it reveals some important
    and interesting information about ancient history, Indian
    customs, arts, science, etc. </p>
    <p>The Vinaya Pitaka consists of the five following books: </p>
    <p>(Vibhanga): <br>
    1. <em><strong>Parajika</strong></em> Pali -- Major Offenses <br>
    2. <em><strong>Pacittiya</strong></em> Pali -- Minor Offenses
    </p>
    <p>(Khandaka): <br>
    3. <em><strong>Mahavagga</strong></em> Pali -- Greater
    Section <br>
    4. <em><strong>Cullavagga</strong></em> Pali -- Shorter
    Section </p>
    <p>5. <em><strong>Parivara</strong></em> Pali -- Epitome of
    the Vinaya </p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><strong>Sutta Pitaka</strong></font></p>
    <p>The <em><strong>Sutta Pitaka</strong></em> consists
    chiefly of discourses, delivered by the Buddha himself on
    various occasions. There are also a few discourses delivered
    by some of His distinguished disciples such as the Venerable
    Sariputta, Ananda, Moggallana, etc., included in it. It is
    like a book of prescriptions, as the sermons embodied therein
    were expounded to suit the different occasions and the
    temperaments of various persons. There may be seemingly
    contradictory statements, but they should not be misconstrued
    as they were opportunely uttered by the Buddha to suit a
    particular purpose: for instance, to the self-same question
    He would maintain silence (when the inquirer is merely
    foolishly inquisitive), or give a detailed reply when He knew
    the inquirer to be an earnest seeker. Most of the sermons
    were intended mainly for the benefit of Bhikkhus and they
    deal with the Holy life and with the expositions of the
    doctrine. There are also several other discourses which deal
    with both the material and moral progress of His lay
    followers. </p>
    <p>This Pitaka is divided into five Nikayas or collections,
    viz: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>1. <em><strong>Digha Nikaya</strong></em> (Collection
        of Long Discourses). <br>
        2. <em><strong>Majjhima Nikaya</strong></em> (Collection
        of Middle-Length Discourses). <br>
        3. <em><strong>Samyutta Nikaya</strong></em> (Collection
        of Kindred Sayings). <br>
        4. <em><strong>Anguttara Nikaya</strong></em> (Collection
        of Discourses arranged in accordance with numbers). <br>
        5. <em><strong>Khuddaka Nikaya</strong></em> (Smaller
        Collection). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The fifth is subdivided into fifteen books: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>1. <em><strong>Khuddaka Patha</strong></em> (Shorter
        texts) <br>
        2. <em><strong>Dhammapada</strong></em> (Way of Truth) <br>
        3. <em><strong>Udana</strong></em> (Paeans of Joy) <br>
        4. <em><strong>Iti Vuttaka</strong></em> (&quot;Thus
        said&quot; Discourses) <br>
        5. <em><strong>Sutta Nipata</strong></em> (Collected
        Discourses) <br>
        6. <em><strong>Vimana Vatthu</strong></em> (Stories of
        Celestial Mansions) <br>
        7. <em><strong>Peta Vatthu</strong></em> (Stories of
        Petas) <br>
        8. <em><strong>Theragatha</strong></em> (Psalms of the
        Brethren) <br>
        9. <em><strong>Therigatha</strong></em> (Psalms of the
        Sisters) <br>
        10. <em><strong>Jataka</strong></em> (Birth Stories) <br>
        11. <em><strong>Niddesa</strong></em> (Expositions) <br>
        12. <em><strong>Patisambhida Magga</strong></em>
        (Analytical Knowledge) <br>
        13. <em>Apadana</em> (Lives of Arahats) <br>
        14. <em><strong>Buddhavamsa</strong></em> (The History of
        the Buddha) <br>
        15. <em><strong>Cariya Pitaka</strong></em> (Modes of
        Conduct) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#800080"><strong>Abhidhamma Pitaka</strong></font></p>
    <p>The <em><strong>Abhidhamma Pitaka</strong></em> is the
    most important and the most interesting of the three,
    containing as it does the profound philosophy of the Buddha's
    Teaching in contrast to the illuminating and simpler
    discourses in the Sutta Pitaka. </p>
    <p>In the <em><strong>Sutta Pitaka</strong></em> is found the
    conventional teaching (<em><strong>vohara desana</strong></em>)
    while in the <em><strong>Abhidhamma Pitaka</strong></em> is
    found the ultimate teaching (<em><strong>paramattha-desana</strong></em>).
    </p>
    <p>To the wise, Abhidhamma is an indispensable guide; to the
    spiritually evolved, an intellectual treat; and to research
    scholars, food for thought. Consciousness is defined.
    Thoughts are analyzed and classified chiefly from an ethical
    standpoint. Mental states are enumerated. The composition of
    each type of consciousness is set forth in detail. How
    thoughts arise, is minutely described. Irrelevant problems
    that interest mankind but having no relation to one's
    purification, are deliberately set aside. </p>
    <p>Matter is summarily discussed; fundamental units of
    matter, properties of matter, sources of matter, relationship
    between mind and matter, are explained. </p>
    <p>The Abhidhamma investigates mind and matter, the two
    composite factors of the so-called being, to help the
    understanding of things as they truly are, and a philosophy
    has been developed on those lines. Based on that philosophy,
    an ethical system has been evolved, to realize the ultimate
    goal, Nibbana. </p>
    <p>The <em><strong>Abhidhamma Pitaka</strong></em> consists
    of seven books: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>1. <em><strong>Dhammasangani</strong></em>
        (Classification of Dhammas) <br>
        2. <strong>Vibhanga</strong> (The book of Divisions) <br>
        3. <em><strong>Katha-Vatthu</strong></em> (Points of
        Controversy) <br>
        4. <em><strong>Pubbala-Pannatti</strong></em>
        (Descriptions of Individuals) <br>
        5. <em><strong>Dhatu-Katha</strong></em> (Discussion with
        reference to elements) <br>
        6. <em><strong>Yamaka</strong></em> (The Book of Pairs), <br>
        7. <em><strong>Patthana</strong></em> (The Book of
        Relations) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the Tipitaka one finds milk for the babe and meat for
    the strong, for the Buddha taught His doctrine both to the
    masses and to the intelligentsia. The sublime Dhamma
    enshrined in these sacred texts, deals with truths and facts,
    and is not concerned with theories and philosophies which may
    be accepted as profound truths today only to be thrown
    overboard tomorrow. The Buddha has presented us with no new
    astounding philosophical theories, nor did He venture to
    create any new material science. He explained to us what is
    within and without so far as it concerns our emancipation, as
    ultimately expounded a path of deliverance, which is unique.
    Incidentally, He has, however, forestalled many a modern
    scientist and philosopher. </p>
    <p>Schopenhauer in his &quot;World as Will and Idea&quot; has
    presented the truth of suffering and its cause in a Western
    garb. Spinoza, though he denies not the existence of a
    permanent reality, asserts that all phenomenal existence is
    transitory. In his opinion sorrow is conquered &quot;by
    finding an object of knowledge which is not transient, not
    ephemeral, but is immutable, permanent, everlasting.&quot;
    Berkeley proved that the so-called indivisible atom is a
    metaphysical fiction. Hume, after a relentless analysis of
    the mind, concluded that consciousness consists of fleeting
    mental states. Bergson advocates the doctrine of change.
    Prof. James refers to a stream of consciousness. </p>
    <p>The Buddha expounded these doctrines of Transiency (<em><strong>Anicca</strong></em>),
    Sorrow (<em><strong>Dukkha</strong></em>), and No-Soul (<em><strong>Anatta</strong></em>)
    some 2500 years ago while He was sojourning in the valley of
    the Ganges. </p>
    <p>It should be understood that the Buddha did not preach all
    that He knew. On one occasion while the Buddha was passing
    through a forest He took a handful of leaves and said:
    &quot;O Bhikkhus, what I have taught is comparable to the
    leaves in my hand. What I have not taught is comparable to
    the amount of leaves in the forest.&quot; </p>
    <p>He taught what He deemed was absolutely essential for
    one's purification making no distinction between an esoteric
    and exoteric doctrine. He was characteristically silent on
    questions irrelevant to His noble mission. </p>
    <p>Buddhism no doubt accords with science, but both should be
    treated as parallel teachings, since one deals mainly with
    material truths while the other confines itself to moral and
    spiritual truths. The subject matter of each is different. </p>
    <p>The Dhamma He taught is not merely to be preserved in
    books, nor is it a subject to be studied from an historical
    or literary standpoint. On the contrary it is to be learnt
    and put into practice in the course of one's daily life, for
    without practice one cannot appreciate the truth. The Dhamma
    is to be studied, and more to be practiced, and above all to
    be realized; immediate realization is its ultimate goal. As
    such the Dhamma is compared to a raft which is meant for the
    sole purpose of escaping from the ocean of birth and death (<em><strong>Samsara</strong></em>).
    </p>
    <p>Buddhism, therefore, cannot strictly be called a mere
    philosophy because it is not merely the &quot;love of,
    inducing the search after, wisdom.&quot; Buddhism may
    approximate a philosophy, but it is very much more
    comprehensive. </p>
    <p>Philosophy deals mainly with knowledge and is not
    concerned with practice; whereas Buddhism lays special
    emphasis on practice and realization. </p>
