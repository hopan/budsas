<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"></font>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This process of birth and death continues <em><strong>ad
    infinitum</strong></em> until this flux is transmuted, so to
    say, to Nibbanadhatu, the ultimate goal of Buddhists. </p>
    <p>The Pali word Nibbana is formed of <em><strong>Ni</strong></em>
    and Vana. <em><strong>Ni</strong></em> is a negative particle
    and <em><strong>Vana</strong></em> means lusting or craving.
    &quot;It is called Nibbana, in that it is a departure from
    the craving which is called <em><strong>Vana</strong></em>,
    lusting.&quot; Literally, Nibbana means non-attachment. </p>
    <p>It may also be defined as the extinction of lust, hatred
    and ignorance, &quot;The whole world is in flames,&quot; says
    the Buddha. &quot;By what fire is it kindled? By the fire of
    lust, hatred and ignorance, by the fire of birth, old age,
    death, pain, lamentation, sorrow, grief and despair it is
    kindled.&quot; </p>
    <p>It should not be understood that Nibbana is a state of
    nothingness or annihilation owing to the fact that we cannot
    perceive it with our worldly knowledge. One cannot say that
    there exists no light just because the blind man does not see
    it. In that well known story, too, the fish arguing with his
    friend, the turtle, triumphantly concluded that there exists
    no land. </p>
    <p>Nibbana of the Buddhists is neither a mere nothingness nor
    a state of annihilation, but what it is no words can
    adequately express. Nibbana is a Dhamma which is
    &quot;unborn, unoriginated, uncreated and unformed.&quot;
    Hence, it is eternal (<em><strong>Dhuva</strong></em>),
    desirable (<em><strong>Subha</strong></em>), and happy (<em><strong>Sukha</strong></em>).
    </p>
    <p>In Nibbana nothing is &quot;eternalized,&quot; nor is
    anything &quot;annihilated,&quot; besides suffering. </p>
    <p>According to the Books references are made to Nibbana as <em><strong>Sopadisesa</strong></em>
    and <em><strong>Anupadisesa</strong></em>. These, in fact,
    are not two kinds of Nibbana, but the one single Nibbana,
    receiving its name according to the way it is experienced
    before and after death. </p>
    <p>Nibbana is not situated in any place nor is it a sort of
    heaven where a transcendental ego resides. It is a state
    which is dependent upon this body itself. It is an attainment
    (Dhamma) which is within the reach of all. Nibbana is a
    supramundane state attainable even in this present life.
    Buddhism does not state that this ultimate goal could be
    reached only in a life beyond. Here lies the chief difference
    between the Buddhist conception of Nibbana and the
    non-Buddhist conception of an eternal heaven attainable only
    after death or a union with a God or Divine Essence in an
    after-life. When Nibbana is realized in this life with the
    body remaining, it is called <em><strong>Sopadisesa
    Nibbana-dhatu</strong></em>. When an Arahat attains
    Parinibbana, after the dissolution of his body, without any
    remainder of physical existence it is called <em><strong>Anupadisesa
    Nibbana-dhatu</strong></em>. </p>
    <p>In the words of Sir Edwin Arnold: </p>
    <p>&quot;If any teach Nirvana is to cease Say unto such they
    lie. If any teach Nirvana is to love Say unto such they
    err.&quot; </p>
    <p>From a metaphysical standpoint Nibbana is deliverance from
    suffering. From a psychological standpoint Nibbana is the
    eradication of egoism. From an ethical standpoint Nibbana is
    the destruction of lust, hatred and ignorance. </p>
    <p>Does the Arahat exist or not after death? </p>
    <p>The Buddha replies: </p>
    <p>&quot;The Arahat who has been released from the five
    aggregates is deep, immeasurable like the mighty ocean. To
    say that he is reborn would not fit the case. To say that he
    is neither reborn nor not reborn would not fit the
    case.&quot; </p>
    <p>One cannot say that an Arahat is reborn as all passions
    that condition rebirth are eradicated; nor can one say that
    the Arahat is annihilated for there is nothing to annihilate.
    </p>
    <p>Robert Oppenheimer, a scientist, writes: </p>
    <p>&quot;If we ask, for instance, whether the position of the
    electron remains the same, we must say 'no'; if we ask
    whether the electron's position changes with time, we must
    say 'no'; if we ask whether the electron is at rest, we must
    say 'no'; if we ask whether it is in motion, we must say
    'no'. </p>
    <p>&quot;The Buddha has given such answers when interrogated
    as to the conditions of man's self after death; [*] but they
    are not familiar answers from the tradition of the 17th and
    18th century science.&quot; </p>
    <p>* [Evidently the writer is referring to the state of an
    Arahat after death.] </p>
