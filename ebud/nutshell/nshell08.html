    <p><em><strong>Paticca</strong></em> means because of, or
    dependent upon: <em><strong>Samuppada</strong></em>
    &quot;arising or origination.&quot; <em><strong>Paticca
    Samuppada</strong></em>, therefore, literally means --
    &quot;Dependent Arising&quot; or &quot;Dependent
    Origination.&quot; </p>
    <p>It must be borne in mind that <em><strong>Paticca
    Samuppada</strong></em> is only a discourse on the process of
    birth and death and not a theory of the ultimate origin of
    life. It deals with the cause of rebirth and suffering, but
    it does not in the least attempt to show the evolution of the
    world from primordial matter. </p>
    <p>Ignorance (<em><strong>Avijja</strong></em>) is the first
    link or cause of the wheel of life. It clouds all right
    understanding. </p>
    <p>Dependent on ignorance of the Four Noble Truths arise
    activities (<em><strong>Sankhara</strong></em>) -- both moral
    and immoral. The activities whether good or bad rooted in
    ignorance which must necessarily have their due effects, only
    tend to prolong life's wandering. Nevertheless, good actions
    are essential to get rid of the ills of life. </p>
    <p>Dependent on activities arise rebirth-consciousness (<em><strong>Vinnana</strong></em>).
    This links the past with the present. </p>
    <p>Simultaneous with the arising of rebirth-consciousness
    there come into being mind and body (<em><strong>Nama-rupa</strong></em>).
    </p>
    <p>The six senses (<em><strong>Salayatana</strong></em>) are
    the inevitable consequences of mind and body. </p>
    <p>Because of the six senses contact (<em><strong>Phassa</strong></em>)
    sets in. Contact leads to feeling (<em><strong>Vedana</strong></em>).
    </p>
    <p>These five -- viz., consciousness, mind and matter, six
    senses, contact and feeling -- are the effects of past
    actions and are called the passive side of life. </p>
    <p>Dependent on feeling arises craving (<em><strong>Tanha</strong></em>).
    Craving results in grasping (<em><strong>Upadana</strong></em>).
    Grasping is the cause of Kamma (<em><strong>Bhava</strong></em>)
    which in its turn, conditions future birth (<em><strong>Jati</strong></em>).
    Birth is the inevitable cause of old age and death (<em><strong>Jara-marana</strong></em>).
    </p>
    <p>If on account of cause effect comes to be, then if the
    cause ceases, the effect also must cease. </p>
    <p>The reverse order of the <em><strong>Paticca Samuppada</strong></em>
    will make the matter clear. </p>
    <p>Old age and death are possible in and with a
    psychophysical organism. Such an organism must be born;
    therefore it pre-supposes birth. But birth is the inevitable
    result of past deeds or Kamma. Kamma is conditioned by
    grasping which is due to craving. Such craving can appear
    only where feeling exists. Feeling is the outcome of contact
    between the senses and objects. Therefore it presupposes
    organs of senses which cannot exist without mind and body.
    Where there is a mind there is consciousness. It is the
    result of past good and evil. The acquisition of good and
    evil is due to ignorance of things as they truly are. </p>
    <p>The whole formula may be summed up thus: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Dependent on Ignorance arise Activities (Moral and
        Immoral)<br>
        Activities arises Consciousness (Re-birth Consciousness)<br>
        Consciousness arise Mind and Matter<br>
        Mind and Matter arise the six Spheres of Sense<br>
        The Six Spheres of Sense arises Contact<br>
        Contact arises Feeling<br>
        Feeling arises Craving<br>
        Craving arises Grasping<br>
        Grasping arise Actions (Kamma)<br>
        Actions arises Rebirth<br>
        Birth arise Decay, Death, Sorrow, Lamentation, Pain,
        Grief, and Despair. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Thus does the entire aggregate of suffering arise. The
    first two of these twelve pertain to the past, the middle
    eight to the present, and the last two to the future. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The complete cessation of Ignorance leads to the
        cessation of Activities. <br>
        The cessation of Activities leads to the cessation of
        Consciousness.<br>
        Consciousness leads to the cessation of mind and matter.<br>
        Mind and Matter leads to the cessation of the six Spheres
        of Sense. <br>
        The six Spheres of Sense leads to the cessation of
        Contact,<br>
        Contact leads to the cessation of Feeling. <br>
        Feeling leads to the cessation of Craving. <br>
        Craving leads to the cessation of Grasping.<br>
        Grasping leads to the cessation of Actions. <br>
        Actions leads to the cessation of Re-birth.<br>
        Re-birth leads to the cessation of Decay, Death, Sorrow,
        Lamentation, Pain, Grief, and Despair. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Thus does the cessation of this entire aggregate of
    suffering result. </p>
    <p>This process of cause and effect continues ad infinitum.
    The beginning of this process cannot be determined as it is
    impossible to say whence this life-flux was encompassed by
    nescience. But when this nescience is turned into knowledge,
    and the life-flux is diverted into <em><strong>Nibbanadhatu</strong></em>,
    then the end of the life process of <em><strong>Samsara</strong></em>
    comes about. </p>
