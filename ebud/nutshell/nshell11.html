<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"></font>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>How is Nibbana to be attained? </p>
    <p>It is by following the Noble Eight-fold Path which
    consists of Right Understanding (<em><strong>samma-ditthi</strong></em>),
    Right Thoughts (<em><strong>samma-sankappa</strong></em>),
    Right Speech (<em><strong>samma-vaca</strong></em>), Right
    Actions (<em><strong>samma-kammanta</strong></em>), Right
    Livelihood (<em><strong>samma-ajiva</strong></em>), Right
    Effort (<em><strong>samma-vayama</strong></em>), Right
    Mindfulness (<em><strong>samma-sati</strong></em>), and Right
    Concentration (<em><strong>samma-samadhi</strong></em>). </p>
    <p>1. <em><strong>Right Understanding</strong></em>, which is
    the key-note of Buddhism, is explained as the knowledge of
    the four Noble Truths. To understand rightly means to
    understand things as they really are and not as they appear
    to be. This refers primarily to a correct understanding of
    oneself, because, as the Rohitassa Sutta states,
    &quot;Dependent on this one-fathom long body with its
    consciousness&quot; are all the four Truths. In the practice
    of the Noble Eightfold Path, Right Understanding stands at
    the beginning as well as at its end. A minimum degree of
    Right Understanding is necessary at the very beginning
    because it gives the right motivations to the other seven
    factors of the Path and gives to them correct direction. At
    the culmination of the practice, Right Understanding has
    matured into perfect Insight Wisdom (<em><strong>vipassana-panna</strong></em>),
    leading directly to the Stages of Sainthood. </p>
    <p>2. Clear vision of right understanding leads to clear
    thinking. The second factor of the Noble Eight-fold Path is
    therefore, <em><strong>Right Thoughts</strong></em>
    (samma-sankappa), which serves the double purpose of
    eliminating evil thoughts and developing pure thoughts. Right
    Thoughts, in this particular connection, are three fold. They
    consist of: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>i. <em><strong>Nekkhamma</strong></em> -- Renunciation
        of worldly pleasures or the virtue of selflessness, which
        is opposed to attachment, selfishness, and
        possessiveness; </p>
        <p>ii. <em><strong>Avyapada</strong></em> --
        Loving-kindness, goodwill, or benevolence, which is
        opposed to hatred, ill-will, or aversion; and </p>
        <p>iii. <em><strong>Avihimsa</strong></em> --
        Harmlessness or compassion, which is opposed to cruelty
        and callousness. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>3. Right Thoughts lead to <em><strong>Right Speech</strong></em>,
    the third factor. This includes abstinence from falsehood,
    slandering, harsh words, and frivolous talk. </p>
    <p>4. Right Speech must be followed by <em><strong>Right
    Action</strong></em> which comprises abstinence from killing,
    stealing and sexual misconduct. </p>
    <p>5. Purifying his thoughts, words and deeds at the outset,
    the spiritual pilgrim tries to purify his <em><strong>livelihood</strong></em>
    by refraining from the five kinds of trade which are
    forbidden to a lay-disciple. They are trading in arms, human
    beings, animals for slaughter, intoxicating drinks and drugs,
    and poisons. </p>
    <p>For monks, wrong livelihood consists of hypocritical
    conduct and wrong means of obtaining the requisites of
    monk-life. </p>
    <p>6. <em><strong>Right Effort</strong></em> is fourfold,
    namely: </p>
    <p>i. the endeavor to discard evil that has already arisen;
    ii. the endeavor to prevent the arising of unarisen evil;
    iii. the endeavor to develop unarisen good; iv. the endeavor
    to promote the good which has already arisen. </p>
    <p>7. <em><strong>Right Mindfulness</strong></em> is constant
    mindfulness with regard to body, feelings, thoughts, and
    mind-objects. </p>
    <p>8. <strong>Right Effort</strong> and <em><strong>Right
    Mindfulness</strong></em> lead to <em><strong>Right
    Concentration</strong></em>. It is the one-pointedness of
    mind, culminating in the Jhanas or meditative absorptions. </p>
    <p>Of these eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path the
    first two are grouped under the heading of Wisdom (<em><strong>panna</strong></em>),
    the following three under Morality (<em><strong>sila</strong></em>),
    and the last three under Concentration (<em><strong>samadhi</strong></em>).
    But according to the order of development the sequence is as
    follows: </p>
    <p>I. Morality (s<em><strong>ila</strong></em>) Right Speech
    Right Action Right Livelihood </p>
    <p>II. Concentration (<em><strong>samadhi</strong></em>)
    Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right Concentration </p>
    <p>III. Wisdom (<em><strong>panna</strong></em>) Right
    Understanding Right Thoughts </p>
    <p>Morality (<em><strong>sila</strong></em>) is the first
    stage on this path to Nibbana. </p>
    <p>Without killing or causing injury to any living creature,
    man should be kind and compassionate towards all, even to the
    tiniest creature that crawls at his feet. Refraining from
    stealing, he should be upright and honest in all his
    dealings. Abstaining from sexual misconduct which debases the
    exalted nature of man, he should be pure. Shunning false
    speech, he should be truthful. Avoiding pernicious drinks
    that promote heedlessness, he should be sober and diligent. </p>
    <p>These elementary principles of regulated behavior are
    essential to one who treads the path to Nibbana. Violation of
    them means the introduction of obstacles on the path which
    will obstruct his moral progress. Observance of them means
    steady and smooth progress along the path. </p>
    <p>The spiritual pilgrim, disciplining thus his words and
    deeds, may advance a step further and try to control his
    senses. </p>
    <p>While he progresses slowly and steadily with regulated
    word and deed and restrained senses, the Kammic force of this
    striving aspirant may compel him to renounce worldly
    pleasures and adopt the ascetic life. To him then comes the
    idea that, </p>
    <p>&quot;A den of strife is household life, And filled with
    toil and need; But free and high as the open sky Is the life
    the homeless lead.&quot; </p>
    <p>It should not be understood that everyone is expected to
    lead the life of a Bhikkhu or a celibate life to achieve
    one's goal. One's spiritual progress is expedited by being a
    Bhikkhu although as a lay follower one can become an Arahat.
    After attaining the third state of Sainthood, one leads a
    life of celibacy. </p>
    <p>Securing a firm footing on the ground of morality, the
    progressing pilgrim then embarks upon the higher practice of
    Samadhi, the control and culture of the mind -- the second
    stage on this Path. </p>
    <p>Samadhi -- is the &quot;one-pointedness of the mind.&quot;
    It is the concentration of the mind on one object to the
    entire exclusion of all irrelevant matter. </p>
    <p>There are different subjects for meditation according to
    the temperaments of the individuals. Concentration on
    respiration is the easiest to gain the one-pointedness of the
    mind. Meditation on loving-kindness is very beneficial as it
    is conducive to mental peace and happiness. </p>
    <p>Cultivation of the four sublime states -- loving-kindness
    (<em><strong>Metta</strong></em>), compassion (<em><strong>Karuna</strong></em>),
    sympathetic joy (M<em><strong>udita</strong></em>), and
    equanimity (U<em><strong>pekkha</strong></em>) -- is highly
    commendable. </p>
    <p>After giving careful consideration to the subject for
    contemplation, he should choose the one most suited to his
    temperament. This being satisfactorily settled, he makes a
    persistent effort to focus his mind until he becomes so
    wholly absorbed and interested in it, that all other thoughts
    get ipso facto excluded from the mind. The five hindrances to
    progress -- namely, sense-desire, hatred, sloth and torpor,
    restlessness and brooding and doubts are then temporarily
    inhibited. Eventually he gains ecstatic concentration and, to
    his indescribable joy, becomes enwrapt in Jhana, enjoying the
    calmness and serenity of a one-pointed mind. </p>
    <p>When one gains this perfect one-pointedness of the mind it
    is possible for one to develop the five Supernormal Powers (<em><strong>Abhinna</strong></em>):
    Divine Eye (<em><strong>Dibbacakkhu</strong></em>), Divine
    Ear (<em><strong>Dibhasota</strong></em>), Reminiscence of
    past births (<em><strong>Pubbenivasanussati-nana</strong></em>).
    Thought Reading (<em><strong>Paracitta vijanana</strong></em>)
    and different Psychic Powers (<em><strong>Iddhividha</strong></em>).
    It must not be understood that those supernormal powers are
    essential for Sainthood. </p>
    <p>Though the mind is now purified there still lies dormant
    in him the tendency to give vent to his passions, for by
    concentration, passions are lulled to sleep temporarily. They
    may rise to the surface at unexpected moments. </p>
    <p>Both Discipline and Concentration are helpful to clear the
    Path of its obstacles but it is Insight (<em><strong>Vipassana
    Panna</strong></em>) alone which enables one to see things as
    they truly are, and consequently reach the ultimate goal by
    completely annihilating the passions inhibited by Samadhi.
    This is the third and the final stage on the Path of Nibbana.
    </p>
    <p>With his one-pointed mind which now resembles a polished
    mirror he looks at the world to get a correct view of life.
    Wherever he turns his eyes he sees nought but the Three
    Characteristics -- <strong>Anicca</strong> (transiency), <em><strong>Dukkha</strong></em>
    (sorrow) and <em><strong>Anatta</strong></em> (soul-lessness)
    standing out in bold relief. He comprehends that life is
    constantly changing and all conditioned things are transient.
    Neither in heaven nor on earth does he find any genuine
    happiness, for every form of pleasure is a prelude to pain.
    What is transient is therefore painful, and where change and
    sorrow prevail there cannot be a permanent immortal soul. </p>
    <p>Whereupon, of these three characteristics, he chooses one
    that appeals to him most and intently keeps on developing
    Insight in that particular direction until that glorious day
    comes to him when he would realize Nibbana for the first time
    in his life, having destroyed the three Fetters --
    self-illusion (<em><strong>Sakkaya-ditthi</strong></em>),
    doubts (<em><strong>Vicikiccha</strong></em>), indulgence in
    (wrongful) rites and ceremonies (<em><strong>Silabbataparamasa</strong></em>).
    </p>
    <p>At this stage he is called a <em><strong>Sotapanna</strong></em>
    (Stream-Winner) -- one who has entered the stream that leads
    to Nibbana. As he has not eradicated all Fetters he is reborn
    seven times at the most. </p>
    <p>Summoning up fresh courage, as a result of this glimpse of
    Nibbana, the Pilgrim makes rapid progress and cultivating
    deeper Insight becomes a <em><strong>Sakadagami</strong></em>
    (Once Returner) by weakening two more Fetters -- namely
    Sense-desire (<em><strong>Kamaraga</strong></em>) and
    ill-will (<em><strong>Patigha</strong></em>). He is called a
    Sakadagami because he is reborn on earth only once in case he
    does not attain Arhatship. </p>
    <p>It is in the third state of Sainthood -- <em><strong>Anagama</strong></em>
    (Never-Returner) that he completely discards the aforesaid
    two Fetters. Thereafter, he neither returns to this world nor
    does he seek birth in the celestial realms, since he has no
    more desire for sensual pleasures. After death he is reborn
    in the &quot;Pure Abodes&quot; (<em><strong>Suddhavasa</strong></em>)
    a congenial Brahma plane, till he attains Arhatship. </p>
    <p>Now the saintly pilgrim, encouraged by the unprecedented
    success of his endeavors, makes his final advance and,
    destroying the remaining Fetters -- namely, lust after life
    in Realms of Forms (<em><strong>Ruparaga</strong></em>) and
    Formless Realms (<em><strong>Aruparaga</strong></em>),
    conceit (<em><strong>Mana</strong></em>), restlessness (<em><strong>Uddhacca</strong></em>),
    and ignorance (<em><strong>Avijja</strong></em>) -- becomes a
    perfect Saint: an Arahant, a Worthy One. </p>
    <p>Instantly he realizes that what was to be accomplished has
    been done, that a heavy burden of sorrow has been
    relinquished, that all forms of attachment have been totally
    annihilated, and that the Path to Nibbana has been trodden.
    The Worthy One now stands on heights more than celestial, far
    removed from the rebellious passions and defilements of the
    world, realizing the unutterable bliss of Nibbana and like
    many an Arahat of old, uttering that paean of joy: </p>
    <p>&quot;Goodwill and wisdom, mind by method trained, The
    highest conduct on good morals based, This maketh mortals
    pure, not rank or wealth.&quot; </p>
    <p>As T.H. Huxley states -- &quot;Buddhism is a system which
    knows no God in the Western sense, which denies a soul to
    man, which counts the belief in immortality a blunder, which
    refuses any efficacy to prayer and sacrifice, which bids men
    to look to nothing but their own efforts for salvation, which
    in its original purity knew nothing of vows of obedience and
    never sought the aid of the secular arm: yet spread over a
    considerable moiety of the world with marvelous rapidity --
    and is still the dominant creed of a large fraction of
    mankind.&quot; </p>
