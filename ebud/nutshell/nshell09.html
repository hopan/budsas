<blockquote>
    <p>This Buddhist doctrine of re-birth should be distinguished
    from the theory of re-incarnation which implies the
    transmigration of a soul and its invariable material rebirth.
    Buddhism denies the existence of an unchanging or eternal
    soul created by a God or emanating from a Divine Essence (<em><strong>Paramatma</strong></em>).
    </p>
    <p>If the immortal soul, which is supposed to be the essence
    of man, is eternal, there cannot be either a rise or a fall.
    Besides one cannot understand why &quot;different souls are
    so variously constituted at the outset.&quot; </p>
    <p>To prove the existence of endless felicity in an eternal
    heaven and unending torments in an eternal hell, an immortal
    soul is absolutely necessary. Otherwise, what is it that is
    punished in hell or rewarded in heaven? </p>
    <p>&quot;It should be said,&quot; writes Bertrand Russell,
    &quot;that the old distinction between soul and body has
    evaporated quite as much because 'matter' has lost its
    solidity as mind has lost its spirituality. Psychology is
    just beginning to be scientific. In the present state of
    psychology belief in immortality can at any rate claim no
    support from science.&quot; </p>
    <p>Buddhists do agree with Russell when he says &quot;there
    is obviously some reason in which I am the same person as I
    was yesterday, and, to take an even more obvious example if I
    simultaneously see a man and hear him speaking, there is some
    sense in which the 'I' that sees is the same as the 'I' that
    hears.&quot; </p>
    <p>Till recently scientists believed in an indivisible and
    indestructible atom. &quot;For sufficient reasons physicists
    have reduced this atom to a series of events. For equally
    good reasons psychologists find that mind has not the
    identity of a single continuing thing but is a series of
    occurrences bound together by certain intimate relations. The
    question of immortality, therefore, has become the question
    whether these intimate relations exist between occurrences
    connected with a living body and other occurrence which take
    place after that body is dead.&quot; </p>
    <p>As C.E.M. Joad says in &quot;The Meaning of Life,&quot;
    matter has since disintegrated under our very eyes. It is no
    longer solid; it is no longer enduring; it is no longer
    determined by compulsive causal laws; and more important than
    all, it is no longer known. </p>
    <p>The so-called atoms, it seems, are both &quot;divisible
    and destructible.&quot; The electrons and protons that
    compose atoms &quot;can meet and annihilate one another while
    their persistence, such as it is, is rather that of a wave
    lacking fixed boundaries, and in process of continual change
    both as regards shape and position than that of a
    thing.&quot; [*] </p>
    <p>* [C.E.M. Joad, <em><strong>The Meaning of Life</strong></em>]
    </p>
    <p>Bishop Berkeley who showed that this so-called atom is a
    metaphysical fiction held that there exists a spiritual
    substance called the soul. </p>
    <p>Hume, for instance, looked into consciousness and
    perceived hat there was nothing except fleeting mental states
    and concluded that the supposed &quot;permanent ego&quot; is
    non-existent. </p>
    <p>&quot;There are some philosophers,&quot; he says,
    &quot;who imagine we are every moment conscious of what we
    call 'ourself,' that we feel its existence and its
    continuance in existence and so we are certain, both of its
    perfect identity and simplicity. For my part, when I enter
    most intimately into what I call 'myself' I always stumble on
    some particular perception or other -- of heat or cold, light
    or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never catch
    myself... and never can observe anything but the
    perception... nor do I conceive what is further requisite to
    make me a perfect non-entity.&quot; </p>
    <p>Bergson says, &quot;All consciousness is time existence;
    and a conscious state is not a state that endures without
    changing. It is a change without ceasing, when change ceases
    it ceases; it is itself nothing but change.&quot; </p>
    <p>Dealing with this question of soul Prof. James says --
    &quot;The soul-theory is a complete superfluity, so far as
    accounting for the actually verified facts of conscious
    experience goes. So far no one can be compelled to subscribe
    to it for definite scientific reasons.&quot; In concluding
    his interesting chapter on the soul he says: &quot;And in
    this book the provisional solution which we have reached must
    be the final word: the thoughts themselves are the
    thinkers.&quot; </p>
    <p>Watson, a distinguished psychologist, states: &quot;No one
    has ever touched a soul or has seen one in a test tube or has
    in any way come into relationship with it as he has with the
    other objects of his daily experience. Nevertheless to doubt
    its existence is to become a heretic and once might possibly
    even had led to the loss of one's head. Even today a man
    holding a public position dare not question it.&quot; </p>
    <p>The Buddha anticipated these facts some 2500 years ago. </p>
    <p>According to Buddhism mind is nothing but a complex
    compound of fleeting mental states. One unit of consciousness
    consists of three phases -- arising or genesis (<em><strong>uppada</strong></em>)
    static or development (<em><strong>thiti</strong></em>), and
    cessation or dissolution (<em><strong>bhanga</strong></em>).
    Immediately after the cessation stage of a thought moment
    there occurs the genesis stage of the subsequent
    thought-moment. Each momentary consciousness of this
    ever-changing life-process, on passing away, transmits its
    whole energy, all the indelibly recorded impressions to its
    successor. Every fresh consciousness consists of the
    potentialities of its predecessors together with something
    more. There is therefore, a continuous flow of consciousness
    like a stream without any interruption. The subsequent
    thought moment is neither absolutely the same as its
    predecessor -- since that which goes to make it up is not
    identical -- nor entirely another -- being the same
    continuity of Kamma energy. Here there is no identical being
    but there is an identity in process. </p>
    <p>Every moment there is birth, every moment there is death.
    The arising of one thought-moment means the passing away of
    another thought-moment and vice versa. In the course of one
    life-time there is momentary rebirth without a soul. </p>
    <p>It must not be understood that a consciousness is chopped
    up in bits and joined together like a train or a chain. But,
    on the contrary, &quot;it persistently flows on like a river
    receiving from the tributary streams of sense constant
    accretions to its flood, and ever dispensing to the world
    without the thought-stuff it has gathered by the way.&quot;
    [*] It has birth for its source and death for its mouth. The
    rapidity of the flow is such that hardly is there any
    standard whereby it can be measured even approximately.
    However, it pleases the commentators to say that the time
    duration of one thought-moment is even less than
    one-billionth part of the time occupied by a flash of
    lightning. </p>
    <p>*[See <em><strong>Compendium of Philosophy</strong></em>,
    Tr. by Shwe Zan Aung (Pali Text Society, London) --
    Introduction p. 12.] </p>
    <p>Here we find a juxtaposition of such fleeting mental
    states of consciousness opposed to a superposition of such
    states as some appear to believe. No state once gone ever
    recurs nor is identical with what goes before. But we
    worldlings, veiled by the web of illusion, mistake this
    apparent continuity to be something eternal and go to the
    extent of introducing an unchanging soul, an Atta, the
    supposed doer and receptacle of all actions to this
    ever-changing consciousness. </p>
    <p>&quot;The so-called being is like a flash of lightning
    that is resolved into a succession of sparks that follow upon
    one another with such rapidity that the human retina cannot
    perceive them separately, nor can the uninstructed conceive
    of such succession of separate sparks.&quot; [*] As the wheel
    of a cart rests on the ground at one point, so does the being
    live only for one thought-moment. It is always in the
    present, and is ever slipping into the irrevocable past. What
    we shall become is determined by this present thought-moment.
    </p>
    <p>* [Compare the cinematograph film where the individual
    photographs give rise to a notion of movement.] </p>
    <p>If there is no soul, what is it that is reborn, one might
    ask. Well, there is nothing to be re-born. When life ceases
    the Kammic energy re-materializes itself in another form. As
    Bhikkhu Silacara says: &quot;Unseen it passes whithersoever
    the conditions appropriate to its visible manifestation are
    present. Here showing itself as a tiny gnat or worm, there
    making its presence known in the dazzling magnificence of a
    Deva or an Archangel's existence. When one mode of its
    manifestation ceases it merely passes on, and where suitable
    circumstances offer, reveals itself afresh in another name or
    form.&quot; </p>
    <p>Birth is the arising of the psycho-physical phenomena.
    Death is merely the temporary end of a temporary phenomenon. </p>
    <p>Just as the arising of a physical state is conditioned by
    a preceding state as its cause, so the appearance of
    psycho-physical phenomena is conditioned by cause anterior to
    its birth. As the process of one life-span is possible
    without a permanent entity passing from one thought-moment to
    another, so a series of life-processes is possible without an
    immortal soul to transmigrate from one existence to another. </p>
    <p>Buddhism does not totally deny the existence of a
    personality in an empirical sense. It only attempts to show
    that it does not exist in an ultimate sense. The Buddhist
    philosophical term for an individual is <em><strong>Santana</strong></em>,
    i.e., a flux or a continuity. It includes the mental and
    physical elements as well. The Kammic force of each
    individual binds the elements together. This uninterrupted
    flux or continuity of psycho-physical phenomenon, which is
    conditioned by Kamma, and not limited only to the present
    life, but having its source in the beginningless past and its
    continuation in the future -- is the Buddhist substitute for
    the permanent ego or the immortal soul of other religions. </p>
