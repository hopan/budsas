    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The foundations of Buddhism are the four Noble Truths --
    namely, Suffering (the <em><strong>raison d'etre</strong></em>
    of Buddhism), its cause (i.e., Craving), its end (i.e.,
    Nibbana, the Summum Bonum of Buddhism), and the Middle Way. </p>
    <p>What is the Noble Truth of Suffering? </p>
    <p>&quot;Birth is suffering, old age is suffering, disease is
    suffering, death is suffering, to be united with the
    unpleasant is suffering, to be separated from the pleasant is
    suffering, not to receive what one craves for is suffering,
    in brief the five Aggregates of Attachment are
    suffering.&quot; </p>
    <p>What is the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering? </p>
    <p>&quot;It is the craving which leads from rebirth to
    rebirth accompanied by lust of passion, which delights now
    here now there; it is the craving for sensual pleasures (<em><strong>Kamatanha</strong></em>),
    for existence (<em><strong>Bhavatanha</strong></em>) [*] and
    for annihilation (<em><strong>Vibhavatanha</strong></em>).&quot;
    [**] </p>
    <p>* [Craving associated with &quot;Eternalism&quot; (<em><strong>Sassataditthi</strong></em>)
    (Comy)] <br>
    ** [Craving associated with &quot;Nihilism&quot; (<em><strong>Ucchedaditthi</strong></em>)
    (Comy)] </p>
    <p>What is the Noble Truth of the Annihilation of Suffering? </p>
    <p>&quot;It is the remainderless, total annihilation of this
    very craving, the forsaking of it, the breaking loose,
    fleeing, deliverance from it.&quot; </p>
    <p>What is the Noble Truth of the Path leading to the
    Annihilation of Suffering? </p>
    <p>&quot;It is the Noble Eightfold Path which consists of
    right understanding, right thoughts, right speech, right
    action, right livelihood, right endeavor, right mindfulness,
    and right concentration.&quot; </p>
    <p>Whether the Buddhas arise or not these four Truths exist
    in the universe. The Buddhas only reveal these Truths which
    lay hidden in the dark abyss of time. </p>
    <p>Scientifically interpreted, the Dhamma may be called the
    law of cause and effect. These two embrace the entire body of
    the Buddha's Teachings. </p>
    <p>The first three represent the philosophy of Buddhism; the
    fourth represents the ethics of Buddhism, based on that
    philosophy. All these four truths are dependent on this body
    itself. The Buddha states: &quot;In this very one-fathom long
    body along with perceptions and thoughts, do I proclaim the
    world, the origin of the world, the end of the world and the
    path leading to the end of the world.&quot; Here the term
    world is applied to suffering. </p>
    <p>Buddhism rests on the pivot of sorrow. But it does not
    thereby follow that Buddhism is pessimistic. It is neither
    totally pessimistic nor totally optimistic, but, on the
    contrary, it teaches a truth that lies midway between them.
    One would be justified in calling the Buddha a pessimist if
    He had only enunciated the Truth of suffering without
    suggesting a means to put an end to it. The Buddha perceived
    the universality of sorrow and did prescribe a panacea for
    this universal sickness of humanity. The highest conceivable
    happiness, according to the Buddha, is Nibbana, which is the
    total extinction of suffering. </p>
    <p>The author of the article on Pessimism in the Encyclopedia
    Britannica writes: &quot;Pessimism denotes an attitude of
    hopelessness towards life, a vague general opinion that pain
    and evil predominate in human affairs. The original doctrine
    of the Buddha is in fact as optimistic as any optimism of the
    West. To call it pessimism is merely to apply to it a
    characteristically Western principle to which happiness is
    impossible without personality. The true Buddhist looks
    forward with enthusiasm to absorption into eternal
    bliss.&quot; </p>
    <p>Ordinarily the enjoyment of sensual pleasures is the
    highest and only happiness of the average man. There is no
    doubt a kind of momentary happiness in the anticipation,
    gratification and retrospection of such fleeting material
    pleasures, but they are illusive and temporary. According to
    the Buddha non-attachment is a greater bliss. </p>
    <p>The Buddha does not expect His followers to be constantly
    pondering on suffering and lead a miserable unhappy life. He
    exhorts them to be always happy and cheerful, for zest (<em><strong>Piti</strong></em>)
    is one of the factors of Enlightenment. </p>
    <p>Real happiness is found within, and is not to be defined
    in terms of wealth, children, honors or fame. If such
    possessions are misdirected, forcibly or unjustly obtained,
    misappropriated or even viewed with attachment, they will be
    a source of pain and sorrow to the possessors. </p>
    <p>Instead of trying to rationalize suffering, Buddhism takes
    suffering for granted and seeks the cause to eradicate it.
    Suffering exists as long as there is craving. It can only be
    annihilated by treading the Noble Eightfold Path and
    attaining the supreme bliss of Nibbana. </p>
    <p>These four Truths can be verified by experience. Hence the
    Buddha Dhamma is not based on the fear of the unknown, but is
    founded on the bedrock of facts which can be tested by
    ourselves and verified by experience. Buddhism is, therefore
    rational and intensely practical. </p>
    <p>Such a rational and practical system cannot contain
    mysteries or esoteric doctrines. Blind faith, therefore, is
    foreign to Buddhism. Where there is no blind faith there
    cannot be any coercion or persecution or fanaticism. To the
    unique credit of Buddhism it must be said that throughout its
    peaceful march of 2500 years no drop of blood was shed in the
    name of the Buddha, no mighty monarch wielded his powerful
    sword to propagate the Dhamma, and no conversion was made
    either by force or by repulsive methods. Yet, the Buddha was
    the first and the greatest missionary that lived on earth. </p>
    <p>Aldous Huxley writes: &quot;Alone of all the great world
    religions Buddhism made its way without persecution
    censorship or inquisition.&quot; </p>
    <p>Lord Russell remarks: &quot;Of the great religions of
    history, I prefer Buddhism, especially in its earliest forms;
    because it has had the smallest element of persecution.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>In the name of Buddhism no altar was reddened with the
    blood of a Hypatia, no Bruno was burnt alive. </p>
    <p>Buddhism appeals more to the intellect than to the
    emotion. It is concerned more with the character of the
    devotees than with their numerical strength. </p>
    <p>On one occasion Upali, a follower of Nigantha Nataputta,
    approached the Buddha and was so pleased with the Buddha's
    exposition of the Dhamma that he instantly expressed his
    desire to become a follower of the Buddha. But the Buddha
    cautioned him, saying: </p>
    <p>&quot;Of a verity, O householder, make a thorough
    investigation. It is well for a distinguished man like you to
    make (first) a thorough investigation.&quot; </p>
    <p>Upali, who was overjoyed at this unexpected remark of the
    Buddha, said: </p>
    <p>&quot;Lord, had I been a follower of another religion, its
    adherents would have taken me round the streets in a
    procession proclaiming that such and such a millionaire had
    renounced his former faith and embraced theirs. But, Lord,
    Your Reverence advises me to investigate further. The more
    pleased am I with this remark of yours. For the second time,
    Lord, I seek refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma and the
    Sangha.&quot; </p>
    <p>Buddhism is saturated with this spirit of free enquiry and
    complete tolerance. It is the teaching of the open mind and
    the sympathetic heart, which, lighting and warming the whole
    universe with its twin rays of wisdom and compassion, sheds
    its genial glow on every being struggling in the ocean of
    birth and death. </p>
    <p>The Buddha was so tolerant that He did not even exercise
    His power to give commandments to His lay followers. Instead
    of using the imperative, He said: &quot;It behooves you to do
    this -- It behooves you not to do this.&quot; He commands not
    but does exhort. </p>
    <p>This tolerance the Buddha extended to men, women and all
    living beings. </p>
    <p>It was the Buddha who first attempted to abolish slavery
    and vehemently protested against the degrading caste system
    which was firmly rooted in the soil of India. In the Word of
    the Buddha it is not by mere birth one becomes an outcast or
    a noble, but by one's actions. Caste or colour does not
    preclude one from becoming a Buddhist or from entering the
    Order. Fishermen, scavengers, courtesans, together with
    warriors and Brahmins, were freely admitted to the Order and
    enjoyed equal privileges and were also given positions of
    rank. Upali, the barber, for instance, was made in preference
    to all other the chief in matters pertaining to Vinaya
    discipline. The timid Sunita, the scavenger, who attained
    Arhatship was admitted by the Buddha Himself into the Order.
    Angulimala, the robber and criminal, was converted to a
    compassionate saint. The fierce Alavaka sought refuge in the
    Buddha and became a saint. The courtesan Ambapali entered the
    Order and attained Arhatship. Such instances could easily be
    multiplied from the Tipitaka to show that the portals of
    Buddhism were wide open to all, irrespective of caste, colour
    or rank. </p>
    <p>It was also the Buddha who raised the status of
    downtrodden women and not only brought them to a realization
    of their importance to society but also founded the first
    celibate religious order for women with rules and
    regulations. </p>
    <p>The Buddha did not humiliate women, but only regarded them
    as feeble by nature. He saw the innate good of both men and
    women and assigned to them their due places in His teaching.
    Sex is no barrier to attaining Sainthood. </p>
    <p>Sometimes the Pali term used to denote women is <em><strong>Matugama</strong></em>,
    which means &quot;mother-folk&quot; or &quot;society of
    mothers.&quot; As a mother, woman holds an honorable place in
    Buddhism. Even the wife is regarded as &quot;best
    friend&quot; (<em><strong>parama sakha</strong></em>) of the
    husband. </p>
    <p>Hasty critics are only making ex parte statements when
    they reproach Buddhism with being inimical to women. Although
    at first the Buddha refused to admit women into the Order on
    reasonable grounds, yet later He yielded to the entreaties of
    His foster-mother, Pajapati Gotami, and founded the Bhikkhuni
    Order. Just as the Arahats Sariputta and Moggallana were made
    the two chief disciples in the Order of monks, even so he
    appointed Arahats Khema and Uppalavanna as the two chief
    female disciples. Many other female disciples too were named
    by the Buddha Himself as His distinguished and pious
    followers. </p>
    <p>On one occasion the Buddha said to King Kosala who was
    displeased on hearing that a daughter was born to him: </p>
    <p>&quot;A woman child, O Lord of men; may prove Even a
    better offspring than a male.&quot; </p>
    <p>Many women, who otherwise would have fallen into oblivion,
    distinguished themselves in various ways, and gained their
    emancipation by following the Dhamma and entering the Order.
    In this new Order, which later proved to be a great blessing
    to many women, queens, princesses, daughters of noble
    families, widows, bereaved mothers, destitute women, pitiable
    courtesans -- all, despite their caste or rank, met on a
    common platform, enjoyed perfect consolation and peace, and
    breathed that free atmosphere which is denied to those
    cloistered in cottages and palatial mansions. </p>
    <p>It was also the Buddha who banned the sacrifice of poor
    beasts and admonished His followers to extend their loving
    kindness (<em><strong>Metta</strong></em>) to all living
    beings -- even to the tiniest creature that crawls at one's
    feet. No man has the power or the right to destroy the life
    of another as life is precious to all. </p>
    <p>A genuine Buddhist would exercise this loving-kindness
    towards every living being and identify himself with all,
    making no distinction whatsoever with regard to caste, colour
    or sex. </p>
    <p>It is this Buddhist Metta that attempts to break all the
    barriers which separate one from another. There is no reason
    to keep aloof from others merely because they belong to
    another persuasion or another nationality. In that noble
    Toleration Edict which is based on <em><strong>Culla-Vyuha</strong></em>
    and <em><strong>Maha-Vyuha</strong></em> Suttas, Asoka says:
    &quot;Concourse alone is best, that is, all should harken
    willingly to the doctrine professed by others.&quot; </p>
    <p>Buddhism is not confined to any country or any particular
    nation. It is universal. It is not nationalism which, in
    other words, is another form of caste system founded on a
    wider basis. Buddhism, if it be permitted to say so, is
    supernationalism. </p>
    <p>To a Buddhist there is no far or near, no enemy or
    foreigner, no renegade or untouchable, since universal love
    realized through understanding has established the
    brotherhood of all living beings. A real Buddhist is a
    citizen of the world. He regards the whole world as his
    motherland and all as his brothers and sisters. </p>
    <p>Buddhism is, therefore, unique, mainly owing to its
    tolerance, non-aggressiveness, rationality, practicability,
    efficacy and universality. It is the noblest of all unifying
    influences and the only lever that can uplift the world. </p>
    <p>These are some of the salient features of Buddhism, and
    amongst some of the fundamental doctrines may be said --
    Kamma or the Law of Moral Causation, the Doctrine of Rebirth,
    Anatta and Nibbana. </p>
