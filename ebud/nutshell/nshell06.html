<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"></font>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We are faced with a totally ill-balanced world. We
    perceive the inequalities and manifold destinies of men and
    the numerous grades of beings that exist in the universe. We
    see one born into a condition of affluence, endowed with fine
    mental, moral and physical qualities and another into a
    condition of abject poverty and wretchedness. Here is a man
    virtuous and holy, but, contrary to his expectation, ill-luck
    is ever ready to greet him. The wicked world runs counter to
    his ambitions and desires. He is poor and miserable in spite
    of his honest dealings and piety. There is another vicious
    and foolish, but accounted to be fortune's darling. He is
    rewarded with all forms of favors, despite his shortcomings
    and evil modes of life. </p>
    <p>Why, it may be questioned, should one be an inferior and
    another a superior? Why should one be wrested from the hands
    of a fond mother when he has scarcely seen a few summers, and
    another should perish in the flower or manhood, or at the
    ripe age of eighty or hundred? Why should one be sick and
    infirm, and another strong and healthy? Why should one be
    handsome, and another ugly and hideous, repulsive to all? Why
    should one be brought up in the lap of luxury, and another in
    absolute poverty, steeped in misery? Why should one be born a
    millionaire and another a pauper? Why should one be born with
    saintly characteristics, and another with criminal
    tendencies? Why should some be linguists, artists,
    mathematicians or musicians from the very cradle? Why should
    some be congenitally blind, deaf and deformed? Why should
    some be blessed and others cursed from their birth? </p>
    <p>These are some problems that perplex the minds of all
    thinking men. How are we to account for all this unevenness
    of the world, this inequality of mankind? </p>
    <p>Is it due to the work of blind chance or accident? </p>
    <p>There is nothing in this world that happens by blind
    chance or accident. To say that anything happens by chance,
    is no more true than that this book has come here of itself.
    Strictly speaking, nothing happens to man that he does not
    deserve for some reason or another. </p>
    <p>Could this be the fiat of an irresponsible Creator? </p>
    <p>Huxley writes: </p>
    <p>&quot;If we are to assume that anybody has designedly set
    this wonderful universe going, it is perfectly clear to me
    that he is no more entirely benevolent and just in any
    intelligible sense of the words, than that he is malevolent
    and unjust.&quot; </p>
    <p>According to Einstein: </p>
    <p>&quot;If this being (God) is omnipotent, then every
    occurrence, including every human action, every human
    thought, and every human feeling and aspiration is also his
    work; how is it possible to think of holding men responsible
    for their deeds and thoughts before such an Almighty Being. </p>
    <p>&quot;In giving out punishments and rewards, he would to a
    certain extent be passing judgement on himself. How can this
    be combined with the goodness and righteousness ascribed to
    him.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;According to the theological principles man is
    created arbitrarily and without his desire and at the moment
    of his creation is either blessed or damned eternally. Hence
    man is either good or evil, fortunate or unfortunate, noble
    or depraved, from the first step in the process of his
    physical creation to the moment of his last breath,
    regardless of his individual desires, hopes, ambitions,
    struggles or devoted prayers. Such is theological
    fatalism.&quot; -- Spencer Lewis </p>
    <p>As Charles Bradlaugh says: </p>
    <p>&quot;The existence of evil is a terrible stumbling block
    to the Theist. Pain, misery, crime, poverty confront the
    advocate of eternal goodness and challenge with unanswerable
    potency his declaration of Deity as all-good, all-wise, and
    all-powerful.&quot; </p>
    <p>In the words of Schopenhauer: </p>
    <p>&quot;Whoever regards himself as having become out of
    nothing must also think that he will again become nothing;
    for an eternity has passed before he was, and then a second
    eternity had begun, through which he will never cease to be,
    is a monstrous thought. </p>
    <p>&quot;If birth is the absolute beginning, then death must
    be his absolute end; and the assumption that man is made out
    of nothing leads necessarily to the assumption that death is
    his absolute end.&quot; </p>
    <p>Commenting on human sufferings and God, Prof. J.B.S.
    Haldane writes: </p>
    <p>&quot;Either suffering is needed to perfect human
    character, or God is not Almighty. The former theory is
    disproved by the fact that some people who have suffered very
    little but have been fortunate in their ancestry and
    education have very fine characters. The objection to the
    second is that it is only in connection with the universe as
    a whole that there is any intellectual gap to be filled by
    the postulation of a deity. And a creator could presumably
    create whatever he or it wanted.&quot; </p>
    <p>Lord Russell states: </p>
    <p>&quot;The world, we are told, was created by a God who is
    both good and omnipotent. Before He created the world he
    foresaw all the pain and misery that it would contain. He is
    therefore responsible for all of it. it is useless to argue
    that the pain in the world is due to sin. If God knew in
    advance the sins of which man would be guilty, He was clearly
    responsible for all the consequences of those sins when He
    decided to create man.&quot; </p>
    <p>In &quot;Despair,&quot; a poem of his old age, Lord
    Tennyson thus boldly attacks God, who, as recorded in Isaiah,
    says, &quot;I make peace and create evil.&quot; (Isaiah, xiv.
    7.) </p>
    <p>&quot;What! I should call on that infinite love that has
    served us so well? Infinite cruelty, rather that made
    everlasting hell, Made us, foreknew us, foredoomed us, and
    does what he will with his own. Better our dead brute mother
    who never has heard us groan.&quot; </p>
    <p>Surely &quot;the doctrine that all men are sinners and
    have the essential sin of Adam is a challenge to justice,
    mercy, love and omnipotent fairness.&quot; </p>
    <p>Some writers of old authoritatively declared that God
    created man in his own image. Some modern thinkers state, on
    the contrary, that man created God in his own image. With the
    growth of civilization man's concept of God also became more
    and more refined. </p>
    <p>It is however, impossible to conceive of such a being
    either in or outside the universe. </p>
    <p>Could this variation be due to heredity and environment?
    One must admit that all such chemico-physical phenomena
    revealed by scientists, are partly instrumental, but they
    cannot be solely responsible for the subtle distinctions and
    vast differences that exist amongst individuals. Yet why
    should identical twins who are physically alike, inheriting
    like genes, enjoying the same privilege of upbringing, be
    very often temperamentally, morally and intellectually
    totally different? </p>
    <p>Heredity alone cannot account for these vast differences.
    Strictly speaking, it accounts more plausibly for their
    similarities than for most of the differences. The
    infinitesimally minute chemico-physical germ, which is about
    30 millionth part of an inch across, inherited from parents,
    explains only a portion of man, his physical foundation. With
    regard to the more complex and subtle mental, intellectual
    and moral differences we need more enlightenment. The theory
    of heredity cannot give a satisfactory explanation for the
    birth of a criminal in a long line of honourable ancestors,
    the birth of a saint or a noble man in a family of evil
    repute, for the arising of infant prodigies, men of genius
    and great religious teachers. </p>
    <p>According to Buddhism this variation is due not only to
    heredity, environment, &quot;nature and nurture,&quot; but
    also to our own kamma, or in other words, to the result of
    our own inherited past actions and our present deeds. We
    ourselves are responsible for our own deeds, happiness and
    misery. We build our own hells. We create our own heavens. We
    are the architects of our own fate. In short we ourselves are
    our own kamma. </p>
    <p>On one occasion [*] a certain young man named Subha
    approached the Buddha, and questioned why and wherefore it
    was that among human beings there are the low and high
    states. </p>
    <p>* [<em><strong>Culakamma Vibhanga Sutta</strong></em> --
    Majjhima Nikaya, No. 135.] </p>
    <p>&quot;For,&quot; said he, &quot;we find amongst mankind
    those of brief life and those of long life, the hale and the
    ailing, the good looking and the ill-looking, the powerful
    and the powerless, the poor and the rich, the low-born and
    the high-born, the ignorant and the intelligent.&quot; </p>
    <p>The Buddha briefly replied: &quot;Every living being has
    kamma as its own, its inheritance, its cause, its kinsman,
    its refuge. Kamma is that which differentiates all living
    beings into low and high states.&quot; </p>
    <p>He then explained the cause of such differences in
    accordance with the law of moral causation. </p>
    <p>Thus from a Buddhist standpoint, our present mental,
    intellectual, moral and temperamental differences are mainly
    due to our own actions and tendencies, both past the present.
    </p>
    <p>Kamma, literally, means action; but, in its ultimate
    sense, it means the meritorious and demeritorious volition (<em><strong>Kusala
    Akusala Cetana</strong></em>). Kamma constitutes both good
    and evil. Good gets good. Evil gets evil. Like attracts like.
    This is the law of Kamma. </p>
    <p>As some Westerners prefer to say Kamma is
    &quot;action-influence.&quot; </p>
    <p>We reap what we have sown. What we sow we reap somewhere
    or some when. In one sense we are the result of what we were;
    we will be the result of what we are. In another sense, we
    are not totally the result of what we were and we will not
    absolutely be the result of what we are. For instance, a
    criminal today may be a saint tomorrow. </p>
    <p>Buddhism attributes this variation to Kamma, but it does
    not assert that everything is due to Kamma. </p>
    <p>If everything were due to Kamma, a man must ever be bad,
    for it is his Kamma to be bad. One need not consult a
    physician to be cured of a disease, for if one's Kamma is
    such one will be cured. </p>
    <p>According to Buddhism, there are five orders or processes
    (<em><strong>Niyamas</strong></em>) which operate in the
    physical and mental realms: </p>
    <p>i. <em><strong>Kamma Niyama</strong></em>, order of act
    and result, e.g., desirable and undesirable acts produce
    corresponding good and bad results. </p>
    <p>ii. <em><strong>Utu Niyama</strong></em>, physical
    (inorganic) order, e.g., seasonal phenomena of winds and
    rains. </p>
    <p>iii. <em><strong>Bija Niyama</strong></em>, order of germs
    or seeds (physical organic order); e.g., rice produced from
    rice-seed, sugary taste from sugar cane or honey etc. The
    scientific theory of cells and genes and the physical
    similarity of twins may be ascribed to this order. </p>
    <p>iv. <em><strong>Citta Niyama</strong></em>, order of mind
    or psychic law, e.g., processes of consciousness (<em><strong>Citta
    vithi</strong></em>), power of mind etc. </p>
    <p>v. <em><strong>Dhamma Niyama</strong></em>, order of the
    norm, e.g., the natural phenomena occurring at the advent of
    a Boddhisatta in his last birth, gravitation, etc. </p>
    <p>Every mental or physical phenomenon could be explained by
    these all-embracing five orders or processes which are laws
    in themselves. </p>
    <p>Kamma is, therefore, only one of the five orders that
    prevail in the universe. It is a law in itself, but it does
    not thereby follow that there should be a law-giver. Ordinary
    laws of nature, like gravitation, need no law-giver. It
    operates in its own field without the intervention of an
    external independent ruling agency. </p>
    <p>Nobody, for instance, has decreed that fire should burn.
    Nobody has commanded that water should seek its own level. No
    scientist has ordered that water should consist of H2O, and
    that coldness should be one of its properties. These are
    their intrinsic characteristics. Kamma is neither fate nor
    predestination imposed upon us by some mysterious unknown
    power to which we must helplessly submit ourselves. It is
    one's own doing reacting on oneself, and so one has the
    possibility to divert the course of Kamma to some extent. How
    far one diverts it depends on oneself. </p>
    <p>It must also be said that such phraseology as rewards and
    punishments should not be allowed to enter into discussions
    concerning the problem of Kamma. For Buddhism does not
    recognize an Almighty Being who rules His subjects and
    rewards and punishes them accordingly. Buddhists, on the
    contrary, believe that sorrow and happiness one experiences
    are the natural outcome of one's own good and bad actions. It
    should be stated that Kamma has both the continuative and the
    retributive principle. </p>
    <p>Inherent in Kamma is the potentiality of producing its due
    effect. The cause produces the effect; the effect explains
    the cause. Seed produces the fruit; the fruit explains the
    seed as both are inter-related. Even so Kamma and its effect
    are inter-related; &quot;the effect already blooms in the
    cause.&quot; </p>
    <p>A Buddhist who is fully convinced of the doctrine of Kamma
    does not pray to another to be saved but confidently relies
    on himself for his purification because it teaches individual
    responsibility. </p>
    <p>It is this doctrine of Kamma that gives him consolation,
    hope, self reliance and moral courage. It is this belief in
    Kamma &quot;that validates his effort, kindles his
    enthusiasm,&quot; makes him ever kind, tolerant and
    considerate. It is also this firm belief in Kamma that
    prompts him to refrain from evil, do good and be good without
    being frightened of any punishment or tempted by any reward. </p>
    <p>It is this doctrine of Kamma that can explain the problem
    of suffering, the mystery of so-called fate or predestination
    of other religions, and above all the inequality of mankind. </p>
    <p>Kamma and rebirth are accepted as axiomatic. </p>
