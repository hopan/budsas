<blockquote>
    <p>As long as this Kammic force exists there is re-birth, for
    beings are merely the visible manifestation of this invisible
    Kammic force. Death is nothing but the temporary end of this
    temporary phenomenon. It is not the complete annihilation of
    this so-called being. The organic life has ceased, but the
    Kammic force which hitherto actuated it has not been
    destroyed. As the Kammic force remains entirely undisturbed
    by the disintegration of the fleeting body, the passing away
    of the present dying thought-moment only conditions a fresh
    consciousness in another birth. </p>
    <p>It is Kamma, rooted in ignorance and craving, that
    conditions rebirth. Past Kamma conditions the present birth;
    and present Kamma, in combination with past Kamma, conditions
    the future. The present is the offspring of the past, and
    becomes, in turn, the parent of the future. </p>
    <p>If we postulate a past, present, and a future life, then
    we are at once faced with the alleged mysterious problem --
    &quot;What is the ultimate origin of life?&quot; </p>
    <p>Either there must be a beginning or there cannot be a
    beginning for life. </p>
    <p>One school, in attempting to solve the problem, postulates
    a first cause, God, viewed as a force or as an Almighty
    Being. </p>
    <p>Another school denies a first cause for, in common
    experience, the cause ever becomes the effect and the effect
    becomes the cause. In a circle of cause and effect a first
    cause is inconceivable. According to the former, life has had
    a beginning, according to the latter, it is beginningless. </p>
    <p>From the scientific standpoint, we are the direct products
    of the sperm and ovum cells provided by our parents. As such
    life precedes life. With regard to the origin of the first
    protoplasm of life, or colloid, scientists plead ignorance. </p>
    <p>According to Buddhism we are born from the matrix of
    action (Kammayoni). Parents merely provide an infinitesimally
    small cell. As such being precedes being. At the moment of
    conception it is past Kamma that conditions the initial
    consciousness that vitalizes the fetus. It is this invisible
    Kammic energy, generated from the past birth that produces
    mental phenomena and the phenomenon of life in an already
    extent physical phenomenon, to complete the trio that
    constitutes man. </p>
    <p>For a being to be born here a being must die somewhere.
    The birth of a being, which strictly means the arising of the
    five aggregates or psycho-physical phenomena in this present
    life, corresponds to the death of a being in a past life;
    just as, in conventional terms, the rising of the sun in one
    place means the setting of the sun in another place. This
    enigmatic statement may be better understood by imagining
    life as a wave and not as a straight line. Birth and death
    are only two phases of the same process. Birth precedes
    death, and death, on the other hand, precedes birth. The
    constant succession of birth and death in connection with
    each individual life flux constitutes what is technically
    known as <em><strong>Samsara</strong></em> -- recurrent
    wandering. </p>
    <p>What is the ultimate origin of life? </p>
    <p>The Buddha declares: </p>
    <p>&quot;Without cognizable end is this Samsara. A first
    beginning of beings, who, obstructed by ignorance and
    fettered by craving, wander and fare on, is not to be
    perceived.&quot; </p>
    <p>This life-stream flows <em><strong>ad infinitum</strong></em>,
    as long as it is fed by the muddy waters of ignorance and
    craving. When these two are completely cut off, then only, if
    one so wishes, does the stream cease to flow, rebirth ends as
    in the case of the Buddhas and Arahats. An ultimate beginning
    of this life-stream cannot be determined, as a stage cannot
    be perceived when this life-force was not fraught with
    ignorance and craving. </p>
    <p>The Buddha has here referred merely to the beginning of
    the life-stream of living beings. It is left to scientists to
    speculate on the origin and the evolution of the universe.
    The Buddha does not attempt to solve all the ethical and
    philosophical problems that perplex mankind. Nor does He deal
    with theories and speculations that tend neither to
    edification nor to enlightenment. Nor does He demand blind
    faith from His adherents. He is chiefly concerned with the
    problem of suffering and its destruction. With but this one
    practical and specific purpose in view, all irrelevant side
    issues are completely ignored. </p>
    <p>But how are we to believe that there is a past existence? </p>
    <p>The most valuable evidence Buddhists cite in favor of
    rebirth is the Buddha, for He developed a knowledge which
    enabled Him to read past and future lives. </p>
    <p>Following His instructions, His disciples also developed
    this knowledge and were able to read their past lives to a
    great extent. </p>
    <p>Even some Indian Rishis, before the advent of the Buddha,
    were distinguished for such psychic powers as clairaudience,
    clairvoyance, thought-reading, remembering past births, etc. </p>
    <p>There are also some persons, who probably in accordance
    with the laws of association, spontaneously develop the
    memory of their past birth, and remember fragments of their
    previous lives. Such cases are very rare, but those few
    well-attested, respectable cases tend to throw some light on
    the idea of a past birth. So are the experiences of some
    modern dependable psychics and strange cases of alternating
    and multiple personalities. </p>
    <p>In hypnotic states some relate experiences of their past
    lives; while a few others, read the past lives of others and
    even heal diseases. [*] </p>
    <p>* [See <em><strong>Many Mansions</strong></em> and <em><strong>The
    World Within</strong></em> by Gina Cerminara.] </p>
    <p>Sometimes we get strange experiences which cannot be
    explained but by rebirth. </p>
    <p>How often do we meet persons whom we have never met, and
    yet instinctively feel that they are quite familiar to us?
    How often do we visit places, and yet feel impressed that we
    are perfectly acquainted with those surroundings? </p>
    <p>The Buddha tells us: </p>
    <p>&quot;Through previous associations or present advantage,
    that old love springs up again like the lotus in the
    water.&quot; </p>
    <p>Experiences of some reliable modern psychics, ghostly
    phenomena, spirit communications, strange alternating and
    multiple personalities and so on shed some light upon this
    problem of rebirth. </p>
    <p>Into this world come Perfect Ones like the Buddhas and
    highly developed personalities. Do they evolve suddenly? Can
    they be the products of a single existence? </p>
    <p>How are we to account for great characters like
    Buddhaghosa, Panini, Kalidasa, Homer and Plato; men of genius
    like Shakespeare, infant prodigies like Pascal, Mozart,
    Beethoven, Raphael, Ramanujan, etc.? </p>
    <p>Heredity alone cannot account for them. &quot;Else their
    ancestry would disclose it, their posterity, even greater
    than themselves, demonstrate it.&quot; </p>
    <p>Could they rise to such lofty heights if they had not
    lived noble lives and gained similar experiences in the past?
    Is it by mere chance that they are been born or those
    particular parents and placed under those favorable
    circumstances? </p>
    <p>The few years that we are privileged to spend here or, for
    the most five score years, must certainly be an inadequate
    preparation for eternity. </p>
    <p>If one believes in the present and in the future, it is
    quite logical to believe in the past. The present is the
    offspring of the past, and acts in turn as the parent of the
    future. </p>
    <p>If there are reasons to believe that we have existed in
    the past, then surely there are no reasons to disbelieve that
    we shall continue to exist after our present life has
    apparently ceased. </p>
    <p>It is indeed a strong argument in favor of past and future
    lives that &quot;in this world virtuous persons are very
    often unfortunate and vicious persons prosperous.&quot; </p>
    <p>A Western writer says: </p>
    <p>&quot;Whether we believe in a past existence or not, it
    forms the only reasonable hypothesis which bridges certain
    gaps in human knowledge concerning certain facts of every day
    life. Our reason tells us that this idea of past birth and
    Kamma alone can explain the degrees of difference that exist
    between twins, how men like Shakespeare with a very limited
    experience are able to portray with marvelous exactitude the
    most diverse types of human character, scenes and so forth of
    which they could have no actual knowledge, why the work of
    the genius invariably transcends his experience, the
    existence of infant precocity, the vast diversity in mind and
    morals, in brain and physique, in conditions, circumstances
    and environment observable throughout the world, and so
    forth.&quot; </p>
    <p>It should be stated that this doctrine of rebirth can
    neither be proved nor disproved experimentally, but it is
    accepted as an evidentially verifiable fact. </p>
    <p>The cause of this Kamma, continues the Buddha, is <em><strong>avijja</strong></em>
    or ignorance of the Four Noble Truths. Ignorance is,
    therefore, the cause of birth and death; and its
    transmutation into knowingness or <em><strong>vijja</strong></em>
    is consequently their cessation. </p>
    <p>The result of this analytical method is summed up in the <em><strong>Paticca
    Samuppada</strong></em>. </p>
