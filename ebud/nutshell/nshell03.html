    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It is neither a religion in the sense in which that word
    is commonly understood, for it is not &quot;a system of faith
    and worship owing any allegiance to a supernatural
    being.&quot; </p>
    <p>Buddhism does not demand blind faith from its adherents.
    Here mere belief is dethroned and is substituted by
    confidence based on knowledge, which, in Pali, is known as <em><strong>Saddha</strong></em>.
    The confidence placed by a follower on the Buddha is like
    that of a sick person in a noted physician, or a student in
    his teacher. A Buddhist seeks refuge in the Buddha because it
    was He who discovered the Path of Deliverance. </p>
    <p>A Buddhist does not seek refuge in the Buddha with the
    hope that he will be saved by His personal purification. The
    Buddha gives no such guarantee. It is not within the power of
    a Buddha to wash away the impurities of others. One could
    neither purify nor defile another. </p>
    <p>The Buddha, as Teacher, instructs us, but we ourselves are
    directly responsible for our purification. </p>
    <p>Although a Buddhist seeks refuge in the Buddha, he does
    not make any self-surrender. Nor does a Buddhist sacrifice
    his freedom of thought by becoming a follower of the Buddha.
    He can exercise his own free will and develop his knowledge
    even to the extent of becoming a Buddha himself. </p>
    <p>The starting point of Buddhism is reasoning or
    understanding, or, in other words, <em><strong>Samma-ditthi</strong></em>.
    </p>
    <p>To the seekers of truth the Buddha says: </p>
    <p>&quot;Do not accept anything on (mere) hearsay -- (i.e.,
    thinking that thus have we heard it from a long time). Do not
    accept anything by mere tradition -- (i.e., thinking that it
    has thus been handed down through many generations). Do not
    accept anything on account of mere rumors -- (i.e., by
    believing what others say without any investigation). Do not
    accept anything just because it accords with your scriptures.
    Do not accept anything by mere suppositions. Do not accept
    anything by mere inference. Do not accept anything by merely
    considering the reasons. Do not accept anything merely
    because it agrees with your pre-conceived notions. Do not
    accept anything merely because it seems acceptable -- (i.e.,
    thinking that as the speaker seems to be a good person his
    words should be accepted). Do not accept anything thinking
    that the ascetic is respected by us (therefore it is right to
    accept his word). </p>
    <p>&quot;But when you know for yourselves -- these things are
    immoral, these things are blameworthy, these things are
    censured by the wise, these things, when performed and
    undertaken conduce to ruin and sorrow -- then indeed do you
    reject them. </p>
    <p>&quot;When you know for yourselves -- these things are
    moral, these things are blameless, these things are praised
    by the wise, these things, when performed and undertaken,
    conduce to well-being and happiness -- then do you live
    acting accordingly.&quot; </p>
    <p>These inspiring words of the Buddha still retain their
    original force and freshness. </p>
    <p>Though there is no blind faith, one might argue whether
    there is no worshiping of images etc., in Buddhism. </p>
    <p>Buddhists do not worship an image expecting worldly or
    spiritual favors, but pay their reverence to what it
    represents. </p>
    <p>An understanding Buddhist, in offering flowers and incense
    to an image, designedly makes himself feel that he is in the
    presence of the living Buddha and thereby gains inspiration
    from His noble personality and breathes deep His boundless
    compassion. He tries to follow His noble example. </p>
    <p>The Bo-tree is also a symbol of Enlightenment. These
    external objects of reverence are not absolutely necessary,
    but they are useful as they tend to concentrate one's
    attention. An intellectual person could dispense with them as
    he could easily focus his attention and visualize the Buddha.
    </p>
    <p>For our own good, and out of gratitude, we pay such
    external respect but what the Buddha expects from His
    disciple is not so much obeisance as the actual observance of
    His Teachings. The Buddha says -- &quot;He honors me best who
    practices my teaching best.&quot; &quot;He who sees the
    Dhamma sees me.&quot; </p>
    <p>With regard to images, however, Count Kevserling remarks
    -- &quot;I see nothing more grand in this world than the
    image of the Buddha. It is an absolutely perfect embodiment
    of spirituality in the visible domain.&quot; </p>
    <p>Furthermore, it must be mentioned that there are not
    petitional or intercessory prayers in Buddhism. However much
    we may pray to the Buddha we cannot be saved. The Buddha does
    not grant favors to those who pray to Him. Instead of
    petitional prayers there is meditation that leads to
    self-control, purification and enlightenment. Meditation is
    neither a silent reverie nor keeping the mind blank. It is an
    active striving. It serves as a tonic both to the heart and
    the mind. The Buddha not only speaks of the futility of
    offering prayers but also disparages a slave mentality. A
    Buddhist should not pray to be saved, but should rely on
    himself and win his freedom. </p>
    <p>&quot;Prayers take the character of private
    communications, selfish bargaining with God. It seeks for
    objects of earthly ambitions and inflames the sense of self.
    Meditation on the other hand is self-change.&quot; -- Sri
    Radhakrishnan. </p>
    <p>In Buddhism there is not, as in most other religions, an
    Almighty God to be obeyed and feared. The Buddha does not
    believe in a cosmic potentate, omniscient and omnipresent. In
    Buddhism there are no divine revelations or divine
    messengers. A Buddhist is, therefore, not subservient to any
    higher supernatural power which controls his destinies and
    which arbitrarily rewards and punishes. Since Buddhists do
    not believe in revelations of a divine being Buddhism does
    not claim the monopoly of truth and does not condemn any
    other religion. But Buddhism recognizes the infinite latent
    possibilities of man and teaches that man can gain
    deliverance from suffering by his own efforts independent of
    divine help or mediating priests. </p>
    <p>Buddhism cannot, therefore, strictly be called a religion
    because it is neither a system of faith and worship, nor
    &quot;the outward act or form by which men indicate their
    recognition of the existence of a God or gods having power
    over their own destiny to whom obedience, service, and honor
    are due.&quot; </p>
    <p>If, by religion, is meant &quot;a teaching which takes a
    view of life that is more than superficial, a teaching which
    looks into life and not merely at it, a teaching which
    furnishes men with a guide to conduct that is in accord with
    this its in-look, a teaching which enables those who give it
    heed to face life with fortitude and death with
    serenity,&quot; [*] or a system to get rid of the ills of
    life, then it is certainly a religion of religions. </p>
    <p>* [Bhikkhu Silacara] </p>
