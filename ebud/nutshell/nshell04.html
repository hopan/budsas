    <h2 align="center"><font color="#800000">Is Buddhism an
    Ethical System?</font></h2>
    <hr width="30%">
    <p>It no doubt contains an excellent ethical code which is
    unparalleled in its perfection and altruistic attitude. It
    deals with one way of life for the monks and another for the
    laity. But Buddhism is much more than an ordinary moral
    teaching. Morality is only the preliminary stage on the Path
    of Purity, and is a means to an end, but not an end in
    itself. Conduct, though essential, is itself insufficient to
    gain one's emancipation. It should be coupled with wisdom or
    knowledge (<em><strong>panna</strong></em>). The base of
    Buddhism is morality, and wisdom is its apex. </p>
    <p>In observing the principles of morality a Buddhist should
    not only regard his own self but also should have a
    consideration for others we well -- animals not excluded.
    Morality in Buddhism is not founded on any doubtful
    revelation nor is it the ingenious invention of an
    exceptional mind, but it is a rational and practical code
    based on verifiable facts and individual experience. </p>
    <p>It should be mentioned that any external supernatural
    agency plays no part whatever in the moulding of the
    character of a Buddhist. In Buddhism there is no one to
    reward or punish. Pain or happiness are the inevitable
    results of one's actions. The question of incurring the
    pleasure or displeasure of a God does not enter the mind of a
    Buddhist. Neither hope of reward nor fear of punishment acts
    as an incentive to him to do good or to refrain from evil. A
    Buddhist is aware of future consequences, but he refrains
    from evil because it retards, does good because it aids
    progress to Enlightenment (Bodhi). There are also some who do
    good because it is good, refrain from evil because it is bad.
    </p>
    <p>To understand the exceptionally high standard of morality
    the Buddha expects from His ideal followers, one must
    carefully read the Dhammapada, Sigalovada Sutta, Vyaggapajja
    Sutta, Mangala Sutta, Karaniya Sutta, Parabhava Sutta, Vasala
    Sutta, Dhammika Sutta, etc. </p>
    <p>As a moral teaching it excels all other ethical systems,
    but morality is only the beginning and not the end of
    Buddhism. </p>
    <p>In one sense Buddhism is not a philosophy, in another
    sense it is the philosophy of philosophies. </p>
    <p>In one sense Buddhism is not a religion, in another sense
    it is the religion of religions. </p>
    <p>Buddhism is neither a metaphysical path nor a ritualistic
    path. </p>
    <p>It is neither sceptical nor dogmatic. </p>
    <p>It is neither self-mortification nor self-indulgence. </p>
    <p>It is neither pessimism nor optimism. </p>
    <p>It is neither eternalism nor nihilism. </p>
    <p>It is neither absolutely this-worldly nor other-worldly. </p>
    <p>It is a unique Path of Enlightenment. </p>
    <p>The original Pali term for Buddhism is Dhamma, which,
    literally, means that which upholds. There is no English
    equivalent that exactly conveys the meaning of the Pali term.
    </p>
    <p>The Dhamma is that which really is. It is the Doctrine of
    Reality. It is a means of Deliverance from suffering, and
    Deliverance itself. Whether the Buddhas arise or not the
    Dhamma exists. It lies hidden from the ignorant eyes of men,
    till a Buddha, an Enlightened One, realizes and
    compassionately reveals it to the world. </p>
    <p>This Dhamma is not something apart from oneself, but is
    closely associated with oneself. As such the Buddha exhorts: </p>
    <p>&quot;Abide with oneself as an island, with oneself as a
    Refuge. Abide with the Dhamma as an island, with the Dhamma
    as a Refuge. Seek no external refuge.&quot; -- Parinibbana
    Sutta </p>
