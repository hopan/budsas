<blockquote>
    <p align="center"><em><strong>Namo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato
    Samma-Sambuddhassa</strong></em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>On the fullmoon day of May, in the year 623 B.C., there
    was born in the district of Nepal an Indian Sakya Prince
    named Siddhattha Gotama, who was destined to be the greatest
    religious teacher in the world. Brought up in the lap of
    luxury, receiving an education befitting a prince, he married
    and had a son. </p>
    <p>His contemplative nature and boundless compassion did not
    permit him to enjoy the fleeting material pleasures of a
    Royal household. He knew no woe, but he felt a deep pity for
    sorrowing humanity. Amidst comfort and prosperity, he
    realized the universality of sorrow. The palace, with all its
    worldly amusements, was no longer a congenial place for the
    compassionate prince. The time was ripe for him to depart.
    Realizing the vanity of sensual enjoyments, in his
    twenty-ninth year, he renounced all worldly pleasures and
    donning the simple yellow garb of an ascetic, alone,
    penniless, wandered forth in search of Truth and Peace. </p>
    <p>It was an unprecedented historic renunciation; for he
    renounced not in his old age but in the prime of manhood, not
    in poverty but in plenty. As it was the belief in the ancient
    days that no deliverance could be gained unless one leads a
    life of strict asceticism, he strenuously practiced all forms
    of severe austerities. &quot;Adding vigil after vigil, and
    penance after penance,&quot; he made a superhuman effort for
    six long years. </p>
    <p>His body was reduced to almost a skeleton. The more he
    tormented his body, the farther his goal receded from him.
    The painful, unsuccessful austerities which he strenuously
    practiced proved absolutely futile. He was now fully
    convinced, through personal experience, of the utter futility
    of self-mortification which weakened his body and resulted in
    lassitude of spirit. </p>
    <p>Benefiting by this invaluable experience of his, he
    finally decided to follow an independent course, avoiding the
    two extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification. The
    former retards one's spiritual progress, and the latter
    weakens one's intellect. The new way which he himself
    discovered was the Middle Path, <em><strong>Majjhima Patipada</strong></em>,
    which subsequently became one of the salient characteristics
    of his teaching. </p>
    <p>One happy morning, while He was deeply absorbed in
    meditation, unaided and unguided by any supernatural power
    and solely relying on His efforts and wisdom, He eradicated
    all defilements, purified Himself, and, realizing things as
    they truly are, attained Enlightenment (Buddhahood) at the
    age of 35. He was not born a Buddha, [*] but He became a
    Buddha by His own striving. As the perfect embodiment of all
    the virtues He preached, endowed with deep wisdom
    commensurate with His boundless compassion. He devoted the
    remainder of His precious life to serve humanity both by
    example and precept, dominated by no personal motive
    whatever. </p>
    <p>* [An Awakened or Enlightened One.] </p>
    <p>After a very successful ministry of 45 long years the
    Buddha, as every other human being, succumbed to the
    inexorable law of change, and finally passed away in His 80th
    year, exhorting His disciples to regard His doctrine as their
    teacher. </p>
    <p>The Buddha was a human being. As a man He was born, as a
    man He lived, and as a man His life came to an end. Though a
    human being, He became an extraordinary man (<em><strong>Acchariya
    Manussa</strong></em>), but He never arrogated to Himself
    divinity. The Buddha laid stress on this important point and
    left no room whatever for anyone to fall into the error of
    thinking that He was an immortal divine being. Fortunately
    there is no deification in the case of the Buddha. It should,
    however, be remarked that there was no Teacher, &quot;ever so
    godless as the Buddha, yet none so god-like.&quot; </p>
    <p>The Buddha is neither an incarnation of the Hindu God
    Vishnu, as is believed by some, nor is He a savior who freely
    saves others by His personal salvation. The Buddha exhorts
    His disciples to depend on themselves for their deliverance,
    for both purity and defilement depend on oneself. Clarifying
    His relationship with His followers and emphasizing the
    importance of self-reliance and individual striving, the
    Buddha plainly states: &quot;You should exert yourselves, the
    Tathagatas [*] are only teachers.&quot; </p>
    <p>* [Lit., Thus who hath come.] </p>
    <p>The Buddhas point out the path, and it is left for us to
    follow that path to obtain our purification. </p>
    <p>&quot;To depend on others for salvation is negative, but
    to depend on oneself is positive.&quot; Dependence on others
    means a surrender of one's effort. </p>
    <p>In exhorting His disciples to be self-dependent the Buddha
    says in the <em><strong>Parinibbana Sutta</strong></em>:
    &quot;Be ye islands unto yourselves, be ye a refuge unto
    yourselves, seek not for refuge in others.&quot; These
    significant words are self-elevating. They reveal how vital
    is self-exertion to accomplish one's object and, how
    superficial and futile it is to seek redemption through
    benignant saviors and to crave for illusory happiness in an
    after life through the propitiation of imaginary Gods or by
    irresponsive prayers and meaningless sacrifices. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, the Buddha does not claim the monopoly of
    Buddhahood which, as a matter of fact, is not the prerogative
    of any specially graced person. He reached the highest
    possible state of perfection any person could aspire to, and
    without the close-fist of a teacher he revealed the only
    straight path that leads thereto. According to the Teaching
    of the Buddha anybody may aspire to that supreme state of
    perfection if he makes the necessary exertion. The Buddha
    does not condemn men by calling they wretched sinners, but,
    on the contrary, He gladdens them by saying that they are
    pure in heart at conception. In His opinion the world is not
    wicked but is deluded by ignorance. Instead of disheartening
    His followers and reserving that exalted state only to
    Himself, He encourages and induces them to emulate Him, for
    Buddhahood is latent in all. In one sense all are potential
    Buddhas. </p>
    <p>One who aspires to become a Buddha is called a Bodhisatta,
    which, literally, means a wisdom-being. This Bodhisatta ideal
    is the most beautiful and the most refined course of life
    that has ever been presented to this ego-centric world, for
    what is nobler than a life of service and purity? </p>
    <p>As a Man He attained Buddhahood and proclaimed to the
    world the latent inconceivable possibilities and the creative
    power of man. Instead of placing an unseen Almighty God over
    man who arbitrarily controls the destinies of mankind, and
    making him subservient to a supreme power, He raised the
    worth of mankind. It was He who taught that man can gain his
    deliverance and purification by his own exertion without
    depending on an external God or mediating priests. It was he
    who taught the ego-centric world the noble ideal of selfless
    service. It was He who revolted against the degrading caste
    system and taught equality of mankind and gave equal
    opportunities for all to distinguish themselves in every walk
    of life. </p>
    <p>He declared that the gates of success and prosperity were
    open to all in every condition of life, high or low, saint or
    criminal, who would care to turn a new leaf and aspire to
    perfection. </p>
    <p>Irrespective of caste, color or rank He established for
    both deserving men and women a democratically constituted
    celibate Order. He did not force His followers to be slaves
    either to His Teachings or to Himself but granted complete
    freedom of thought. </p>
    <p>He comforted the bereaved by His consoling words. He
    ministered to the sick that were deserted. He helped the poor
    that were neglected. He ennobled the lives of the deluded,
    purified the corrupted lives of criminals. He encouraged the
    feeble, united the divided, enlightened the ignorant,
    clarified the mystic, guided the benighted, elevated the
    base, dignified the noble. Both rich and poor, saints and
    criminals loved Him alike. Despotic and righteous kings,
    famous and obscure princes and nobles, generous and stingy
    millionaires, haughty and humble scholars, destitute paupers,
    down-trodden scavengers, wicked murderers, despised
    courtesans -- all benefited by His words of wisdom and
    compassion. </p>
    <p>His noble example was a source of inspiration to all. His
    serene and peaceful countenance was a soothing sight to the
    pious eyes. His message of Peace and Tolerance was welcomed
    by all with indescribable joy and was of eternal benefit to
    every one who had the fortune to hear and practice it. </p>
    <p>Wherever His teachings penetrated it left an indelible
    impression upon the character of the respective peoples. The
    cultural advancement of all the Buddhist nations was mainly
    due to His sublime Teachings. In fact all Buddhist countries
    like Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Nepal,
    Tibet, China, Mongolia, Korea, Japan, etc., grew up in the
    cradle of Buddhism. Though more than 2500 years have elapsed
    since the passing away of this greatest Teacher, yet his
    unique personality exerts a great influence on all who come
    to know Him. </p>
    <p>His iron will, profound wisdom, universal love, boundless
    compassion, selfless service, historic renunciation, perfect
    purity, magnetic personality, exemplary methods employed to
    propagate the Teachings, and his final success -- all these
    factors have compelled about one-fifth of the population of
    the world today to hail the Buddha as their supreme Teacher. </p>
    <p>Paying a glowing tribute to the Buddha Sri Radhakrishnan
    states: &quot;In Gautama the Buddha we have a master-mind
    from the East second to none so far as the influence on the
    thought and life of the human race is concerned, and, sacred
    to all as the founder of a religious tradition whose hold is
    hardly less wide and deep than any other. He belongs to the
    history of the world's thought, to the general inheritance of
    all cultivated men, for, judged by intellectual integrity,
    moral earnestness, and spiritual insight, He is undoubtedly
    one of the greatest figures in history. </p>
    <p>In <em><strong>The Three Greatest Men in History</strong></em>,
    H.G. Wells writes: &quot;In the Buddha you see clearly a man,
    simple, devout, lonely, battling for light -- a vivid human
    personality, not a myth. He too gave a message to mankind
    universal in character. Many of our best modern ideas are in
    closest harmony with it. All the miseries and discontents are
    due, he taught, to selfishness. Before a man can become
    serene he must cease to live for his senses or himself. Then
    he merges into a great being. Buddha in different language
    called men to self-forgetfulness 500 years before Christ. In
    some ways he is nearer to us and our needs. He was more lucid
    upon our individual importance and service than Christ and
    less ambiguous upon the question of personal
    immortality.&quot; </p>
    <p>St. Hilaire remarks &quot;The perfect model of all the
    virtues He preaches. His life has not a stain upon it.&quot; </p>
    <p>Fausboll says -- &quot;The more I know of Him, the more I
    love Him.&quot; </p>
    <p>A humble follower of his would say -- &quot;The more I
    know Him, the more I love Him; the more I love Him, the more
    I know Him.&quot; </p>
