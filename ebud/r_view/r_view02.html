    the Discourse on Right View </font></h2>
    <hr width="30%">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus have I heard:&nbsp;&nbsp; the
    Sammaditthi Sutta.</p>
    <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, all such questions spoken by the
    Elder as &quot; 'One of right view, one of right view' is
    said, friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; In what way is a noble disciple
    one of right view
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; or &quot;And
    what, friends, is the unwholesome
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- these are
    questions showing a desire to expound.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein,
    since those who know, those who do not know, those outside
    the Dispensation, those within it, those who speak by
    hearsay, etc., and those who speak by personal knowledge, say
    &quot;one of right view,&quot; therefore, taking it as an
    expression (common) to the many, he touched upon it twice,
    saying &quot;One of right view, one of right view&quot; is
    said, friends (<i>sammaditthi sammaditthi ti avuso vuccati</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The intention here is this:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Others say 'one
    of right view,' and still others say 'one of right view.'
    Since that is said, in what way, friends, is a noble disciple
    one of right view in respect of meaning and
    characteristic?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, one of right view
    is one possessing a lucid and praiseworthy view (<i>sobhanaya
    pasatthaya ca ditthiya samannagato</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; But when
    this word &quot;right view&quot; is used to signify a state
    (rather than a person endowed with that state), it then means
    a lucid and praiseworthy view.<a href="#1" name="r1">[1]</a></p>
    <p>This right view is twofold:&nbsp;&nbsp; mundane (<i>lokiya</i>)
    and supramundane (<i>lokuttara</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, the
    knowledge of kamma as one's own and knowledge which is in
    conformity with the (Four Noble) Truths are mundane right
    view; or, in brief, (mundane right view is) all understanding
    that is accompanied by the taints.<a href="#2" name="r2">[2]</a>
    Understanding connected with the noble paths and fruits is
    supramundane right view.<a href="#3" name="r3">[3]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The person possessing right view is of three
    kinds:&nbsp;&nbsp; the worldling (<i>puthujjana</i>), the
    disciple in higher training (<i>sekha</i>), and the one
    beyond training (<i>asekha</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, the
    worldling is of two kinds:&nbsp;&nbsp; one outside the
    Dispensation and one within the Dispensation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Herein, one outside the Dispensation who believes in kamma is
    one of right view on account of the view of kamma as one's
    own, but not on account of that which is in conformity with
    the truths, because he holds to the view of self.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    One within the Dispensation is of right view on account of
    both.&nbsp;&nbsp; The disciple in higher training is one of
    right view on account of fixed right view,<a href="#4"
    name="r4">[4]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; the one beyond training on
    account of (the right view) that is beyond training.<a
    href="#5" name="r5">[5]</a></p>
    <p>But here &quot;one of right view&quot; is intended as one
    possessing supramundane wholesome right view, which is fixed
    in destiny and emancipating.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence he
    said:&nbsp;&nbsp; whose view is straight, who has perfect
    confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma
    (<i>ujugata'ssa ditthi dhamme aveccappasadena samannagato
    agato imam saddhammam</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of its going
    straight without deviating to either extreme, or because of
    its going straight by removing all crookedness such as bodily
    crookedness, etc., supramundane right view is
    &quot;straight.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; One possessing that view
    also possesses perfect confidence, unshakable confidence, in
    the ninefold supramundane Dhamma.<a href="#6" name="r6">[6]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    And by becoming disentangled from all the thickets of (wrong)
    views, by abandoning all the defilements, by departing from
    the round of rebirths, by bringing the practice to its
    consummation, he is said to have come by the noble path to
    this &quot;true Dhamma&quot; proclaimed by the Enlightened
    One, that is, Nibbana, the plunge into the Deathless.</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">The Wholesome and the Unwholesome</font></h3>
    <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Understands the unwholesome (<i>akusalan ca
    pajanati</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; he understands the unwholesome
    called the ten courses of unwholesome kamma (action),
    penetrating this by way of function with the understanding
    that has Nibbana as its object as &quot;This is
    suffering.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Understands) the root of the
    unwholesome (<i>akusalamulan ca pajanati</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    And he understands the unwholesome root which has become the
    root condition of that (unwholesome), penetrating this, in
    the same way, as &quot;This is the origin of
    suffering.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method applies here
    also in regard to &quot;the wholesome&quot; and &quot;the
    root of the wholesome.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, as it is here,
    so in all the following sections, the understanding of the
    subject should be understood by way of function.</p>
    <p>In that way (<i>ettavata pi</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; by this
    much; by this understanding of the unwholesome,
    etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is one of right view (<i>sammaditthi hoti</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    he possesses supramundane right view of the kind
    aforesaid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose view is straight
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and has arrived at
    this true Dhamma:&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point the summary
    version of the teaching has been expounded.&nbsp;&nbsp; And
    this (part of) the teaching itself was brief; but for those
    bhikkhus it should be understood that the penetration (of the
    meaning) through right attention occurred in detail.</p>
    <p>But in the second section (Section 4) it should be
    understood that the teaching too, as well as the penetration
    through attention, is stated in detail.</p>
    <p>Herein, the bhikkhus [at the council at the Great
    Monastery held to rehearse the Pitakas]&nbsp;&nbsp;
    said:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In the brief exposition the two lower
    paths are discussed, in the detailed exposition the two
    higher paths,&quot; taking into account the passage at the
    end of the sections setting forth the detailed exposition
    that begins &quot;he entirely abandons the underlying
    tendency to lust.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Elder (presiding
    over the council) said:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In the brief
    exposition the four paths are expounded as a group, and also
    in the detailed exposition.&quot;<a href="#7" name="r7">[7]</a></p>
    <p>This query into the brief and detailed expositions which
    has been cleared up here should be understood in all the
    following sections in the way stated here.&nbsp;&nbsp; From
    here on we shall only comment on terms that are new or
    obscure.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>The Unwholesome Courses of
    Action</strong></font></p>
    <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, firstly, in the detailed exposition
    of the first section:&nbsp;&nbsp; as regards the passage
    beginning killing living beings is unwholesome (<i>panatipato
    kho avuso akusalam</i>), &quot;unwholesome&quot; should be
    understood by way of the occurrence of unwholesomeness, or as
    what is opposed to the wholesome, which is to be dealt with
    below (Section 6).&nbsp;&nbsp; As to characteristic, it is
    blameworthy and has painful result, or it is
    defiled.&nbsp;&nbsp; This, in the first place, is the comment
    upon the general terms here.</p>
    <p>But as regards the particular terms, the phrase killing
    living beings means the slaughter of a living being, the
    destruction of a living being.&nbsp;&nbsp; And here a living
    being (<i>pana</i>) is, according to ordinary usage, a being
    (<i>satta</i>); in the ultimate sense it is the life
    faculty.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Killing living beings&quot; is the
    volition to kill on the part of one who is aware, in respect
    of a living being, that it is a living being, and which
    (volition), manifesting itself through one or the other of
    the doors of body and speech, initiates activity resulting in
    the cutting off of the life faculty.</p>
    <p>In relation to beings such as animals, etc., which lack
    moral qualities (<i>guna</i>), it is less blameworthy in
    respect of small living beings and more blameworthy in
    respect of beings with large bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Why?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the magnitude of the effort
    involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; And when the effort involved is equal,
    because of the magnitude of the object (the being
    killed).&nbsp;&nbsp; In relation to beings such as humans,
    etc., who possess moral qualities, it is less blameworthy in
    respect of beings with few good qualities and more
    blameworthy in respect of beings with great
    qualities.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the size of the body and moral
    qualities are equal, however, it is less blameworthy when the
    defilements and activity are mild, and more blameworthy when
    they are strong:&nbsp;&nbsp; so it should be understood.</p>
    <p>There are five constituents for this (act of killing a
    living being):&nbsp;&nbsp; a living being, awareness that it
    is a living being, the mind to kill, activity, and the death
    (of the being) thereby.</p>
    <p>There are six means:&nbsp;&nbsp; one's own person,
    command, a missile, a fixed contrivance, a magical spell,
    supernormal power.</p>
    <p>To explore this matter in detail, however, would involve
    too much diffuseness.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore we shall not
    explore it in detail, or any other subject similar in
    kind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who wish to go into the matter may do
    so by looking it up in the Samantapasadika, the Vinaya
    Commentary.<a href="#8" name="r8">[8]</a></p>
    <p>Taking what is not given (<i>adinnadana</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    the carrying off of others' goods, stealing, robbery, is what
    is meant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, &quot;what is not given&quot;
    is another's possession, which the other may use as he likes
    without incurring penalty or blame.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Taking
    what is not given&quot; is the volition to steal on the part
    of one who is aware, in respect of another's possession, that
    it is another's possession, and which (volition) initiates
    activity resulting in the taking of that thing.</p>
    <p>That (taking of what is not given) is less blameworthy
    when the other's property is of low value, and more
    blameworthy when it is of high value.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Why?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the high value of the object
    (stolen).&nbsp;&nbsp; When the value of the objects is equal,
    the act is more blameworthy when the object belongs to one of
    outstanding qualities, and less blameworthy when the object
    belongs to one who, in comparison, is inferior with respect
    to moral qualities.</p>
    <p>There are five constituents of this act:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    another's possession, awareness that it is another's
    possession, the mind to steal, the activity, and the carrying
    off (of the object) thereby.</p>
    <p>There are six means:&nbsp;&nbsp; one's own person,
    etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; (as for killing). And these (acts of
    stealing) may be classed, according to the way in which they
    occur, by way of the following:&nbsp;&nbsp; taking by theft,
    by force, by concealment, by stratagem, by fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This here is in brief; the details, however, are given in the
    Samantapasadika.<a href="#9" name="r9">[9]</a></p>
    <p>Misconduct in sensual pleasures (<i>kamesu micchacara</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    here, &quot;in sensual pleasures&quot; (<i>kamesu</i>) means
    in regard to sexual intercourse.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;Misconduct&quot; is entirely reprehensible vile
    conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp; As to characteristic, sexual misconduct
    is the volition to transgress bounds occurring through the
    body door by way of unrighteous intent.</p>
    <p>Herein, out of bounds for men, firstly, are the twenty
    kinds of women, that is, the ten beginning with those
    protected by the mother, namely, &quot;protected by the
    mother, protected by the father, protected by the mother and
    father, protected by the brother, protected by the sister,
    protected by relatives, protected by the clan, protected by
    the law, under protection, entailing a penalty&quot;; and the
    ten beginning with those purchased with money, namely,
    &quot;one purchased with money, one who lives (with a man) by
    her own desire, one who lives (with a man) on account of
    wealth, one who lives (with a man) on account of cloth, one
    who is given (in marriage with the ceremony of) dipping the
    hand in water, one who has been (taken to wife and) relieved
    of her burden-carrying head-pad, one who is a slave and a
    wife, one who is a servant and a wife, one who is carried off
    in a raid, one engaged at so much a time.&quot;<a href="#10"
    name="r10">[10]</a></p>
    <p>Then, as concerns women, for the twelve kinds of women
    consisting of the two, namely, under protection and entailing
    a penalty, and the ten beginning with those purchased with
    money, other men are out of bounds.</p>
    <p>This sexual misconduct is less blameworthy when (the
    person) out of bounds is without good qualities such as
    virtue, etc., and more blameworthy when (the person)
    possesses good qualities such as virtue, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There are four constituents of this act:&nbsp;&nbsp; an
    object which is out of bounds, the mind to engage in that,
    the effort to engage, and consent to the union of sexual
    organs.<a href="#11" name="r11">[11]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    means is single:&nbsp;&nbsp; one's own person.</p>
    <p>False speech (<i>musavada</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;false&quot; (<i>musa</i>) is the verbal effort or
    bodily effort for destroying welfare (made) by one bent on
    deceiving.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;False speech&quot; is the
    volition initiating the verbal effort or bodily effort of
    deceiving another on the part of one intent on
    deceiving.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to another method,
    &quot;false&quot; means an unreal, untrue case,
    &quot;speech&quot; the communication of that as being real,
    true.&nbsp;&nbsp; As to characteristic, &quot;false
    speech&quot; is the volition of one desiring to communicate
    to another an untrue case as being true, which (volition)
    initiates such an act of communication.</p>
    <p>This is less blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is
    slight, and more blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is
    great.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, when it occurs on the part of
    householders who, not wishing to give away some belonging of
    theirs, say &quot;I do not have it,&quot; it is less
    blameworthy; when one who is a witness speaks (falsely) for
    the purpose of destroying another's welfare, it is more
    blameworthy.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of those gone forth,
    when it occurs by their saying as a joke, after they have
    obtained just a little oil or ghee, in the manner of the
    Puranas, &quot;Today the oil is flowing in the village just
    like a river,&quot; then it is less blameworthy; but for
    those who speak (as a witness) saying that they have seen
    what they have not seen it is more blameworthy.</p>
    <p>There are four constituents of this act:&nbsp;&nbsp; an
    untrue case, the mind to deceive, the appropriate effort, the
    communicating of that meaning to another.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    means is single:&nbsp;&nbsp; one's own person
    only.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is to be regarded as the performing of
    the action of deceiving another by means of the body or by
    means of something attached to the body or by means of
    speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; If, through that action, the other
    understands that meaning, one is bound by the kamma of false
    speech at the very moment of the volition initiating the
    action.</p>
    <p>Malicious speech, etc.:&nbsp;&nbsp; The kind of speech
    that creates in the heart of the person to whom it is spoken
    affection for oneself and voidness (of affection) for another
    is malicious speech (<i>pisuna vaca</i>). The kind of speech
    by which one makes both oneself and another harsh, the kind
    of speech which is also itself harsh, being pleasant neither
    to the ear nor to the heart -- that is harsh speech (<i>pharusa
    vaca</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; That by which one gossips idly,
    without meaning, is gossip (<i>samphappalapa</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Also, the volition that is the root cause of these gains the
    name &quot;malicious speech,&quot; etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that
    only is intended here.</p>
    <p>Therein, malicious speech is the volition of one with a
    defiled mind, which (volition) initiates an effort by body or
    by speech either to cause division among others or to endear
    oneself (to another).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is less blameworthy when
    the person divided has few good qualities, and more
    blameworthy when such a one has great qualities.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Its constituents are four:&nbsp;&nbsp; another person to be
    divided, the intention to divide, (thinking) &quot;Thus these
    will be separated and split&quot; or the desire to endear
    oneself, (thinking) &quot;Thus I shall become loved and
    intimate,&quot; the appropriate effort, the communicating of
    that meaning to that person.</p>
    <p>Harsh speech is the entirely harsh volition initiating an
    effort by body or by speech to wound another's vital
    feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an example given for the
    purpose of making it clear:&nbsp;&nbsp; A village boy, it is
    said, went to the forest without heeding his mother's
    words.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unable to make him turn back, she scolded
    him angrily, saying:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;May a wild buffalo
    chase you!&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a buffalo appeared before
    him right there in the forest.&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy made an
    asseveration of truth, saying:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Let it not
    be as my mother said but as she thought!&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The buffalo stood as though tied there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus,
    although the means (employed) was that of wounding the vital
    feelings, because of the gentleness of her mind it was not
    harsh speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; For sometimes parents even say to
    their children, &quot;May robbers chop you to
    pieces!&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet they do not even wish a lotus
    leaf to fall upon them.&nbsp;&nbsp; And teachers and
    preceptors sometimes say to their pupils, &quot;What is the
    use of these shameless and heedless brats?&nbsp;&nbsp; Drive
    them out!&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet they wish for their success
    in learning and attainment.</p>
    <p>Just as, through gentleness of mind, speech is not harsh,
    so through gentleness of speech, speech does not become
    unharsh; for the words &quot;Let him sleep in peace&quot;
    spoken by one wishing to kill are not unharsh
    speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; But harsh speech is such on account of
    harshness of mind only.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is less blameworthy
    when the person to whom it is spoken has few good qualities,
    and more blameworthy when such a one has great
    qualities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its constituents are
    three:&nbsp;&nbsp; another to be abused, an angry mind, the
    abusing.</p>
    <p>Gossip is the unwholesome volition initiating an effort by
    body or by speech to communicate what is
    purposeless.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is less blameworthy when indulged
    in mildly, and more blameworthy when indulged in
    strongly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its constituents are two:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    the being intent on purposeless stories such as the Bharata
    war or the abduction of Sita, etc., and the telling of such
    stories.<a href="#12" name="r12">[12]</a></p>
    <p>Covetousness (<i>abhijjha</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; It covets,
    thus it is covetousness; &quot;having become directed towards
    others' goods, it occurs through inclination towards
    them&quot; is the meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has the
    characteristic of coveting others' goods thus:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;Oh, that this were mine!&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is less
    blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case of taking
    what is not given.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its constituents are
    two:&nbsp;&nbsp; another's goods, and the inclination for
    them to be one's own.&nbsp;&nbsp; For even though greed has
    arisen based on another's goods, it is not classed as a
    (completed) course of kamma so long as one does not incline
    to them as one's own (with the thought), &quot;Oh, that this
    were mine!&quot;</p>
    <p>Ill will (<i>byapada</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; It injures welfare
    and happiness, thus it is ill will (<i>hitasukham byapadayati
    ti byapado</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Its characteristic is the mental
    defect (of wishing for) the destruction of
    others.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is less blameworthy and more
    blameworthy as in the case of harsh speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its
    constituents are two:&nbsp;&nbsp; another being, and the wish
    for that being's destruction.&nbsp;&nbsp; For even though
    anger has arisen based on another being, there is no breach
    of a course of kamma so long as one does not wish, &quot;Oh,
    that this being might be cut off and destroyed!&quot;</p>
    <p>Wrong view (<i>micchaditthi</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; It sees
    wrongly due to the absence of a correct grasp of things, thus
    it is wrong view.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its characteristic is the
    mistaken view that &quot;there is no (result from)
    giving,&quot; etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is less blameworthy and
    more blameworthy as in the case of gossip.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Moreover, it is less blameworthy when not fixed in destiny,
    and more blameworthy when fixed.<a href="#13" name="r13">[13]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Its constituents are two:&nbsp;&nbsp; a mistaken manner of
    grasping the basis (for the view), and the appearance of that
    (basis) in accordance with the manner in which it has been
    grasped.</p>
    <p>Now the exposition of these ten courses of unwholesome
    kamma should be understood in five ways:&nbsp;&nbsp; as to
    mental state (<i>dhammato</i>), as to category (<i>kotthasato</i>),
    as to object (<i>arammanato</i>), as to feeling (<i>vedanato</i>),
    and as to root (<i>mulato</i>).</p>
    <p>Herein, as to mental state:&nbsp;&nbsp; The first seven
    among these are volitional states only.&nbsp;&nbsp; The three
    beginning with covetousness are associated with volition.<a
    href="#14" name="r14">[14]</a></p>
    <p>As to category:&nbsp;&nbsp; The eight consisting of the
    first seven and wrong view are courses of kamma only, not
    roots.&nbsp;&nbsp; Covetousness and ill will are courses of
    kamma and also roots; for covetousness, having arrived at the
    (state of) a root, is the unwholesome root greed, and ill
    will is the unwholesome root hate.</p>
    <p>As to object:&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing living beings, because
    it has the life faculty as object, has a formation as
    object.&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking what is not given has beings as
    object or formations as object.&nbsp;&nbsp; Misconduct in
    sensual pleasures has formations as object by way of tangible
    object; but some say it also has beings as
    object.&nbsp;&nbsp; False speech has beings or formations as
    object; likewise malicious speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; Harsh speech
    has only beings as object.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gossip has either
    beings or formations as object by way of the seen, heard,
    sensed and cognized; likewise covetousness. Ill will has only
    beings as object.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrong view has formations as
    object by way of the states belonging to the three planes (of
    being).</p>
    <p>As to feeling:&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing living beings has
    painful feeling; for although kings, seeing a robber, say
    laughingly, &quot;Go and execute him,&quot; their volition
    consummating the action is associated only with
    pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking what is not given has three
    feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Misconduct (in sensual pleasures) has
    two feelings, pleasant and neutral, but in the mind which
    consummates the action there is no neutral
    feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp; False speech has three feelings;
    likewise malicious speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; Harsh speech has
    painful feeling only.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gossip has three
    feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Covetousness has two feelings, pleasant
    and neutral; likewise wrong view.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ill will has
    painful feeling only.</p>
    <p>As to root:&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing living beings has two
    roots, by way of hate and delusion; taking what is not given,
    by way of hate and delusion or by way of greed and delusion;
    misconduct, by way of greed and delusion; false speech, by
    way of hate and delusion or by way of greed and delusion;
    likewise for malicious speech and gossip; harsh speech, by
    way of hate and delusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Covetousness has one
    root, by way of delusion; likewise ill will.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Wrong view has two roots, by way of greed and delusion.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>The Unwholesome Roots</strong></font></p>
    <p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Greed is a root of the unwholesome,
    etc.:&nbsp;&nbsp; It is greedy, thus it is greed (<i>lubbhati
    ti lobho</i>); it offends against (it hates), thus it is hate
    (<i>dussati ti doso</i>); it deludes, thus it is delusion (<i>muyhati
    ti moho</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these, greed is itself
    unwholesome in the sense that it is blameworthy and has
    painful results; and it is a root of these unwholesome
    (deeds) beginning with killing living beings, for some in the
    sense that it is an associated originative cause, for some in
    the sense that it is a decisive support
    condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it is an unwholesome
    root.&nbsp;&nbsp; This too is said:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;One who
    is lustful, friends, overwhelmed and with mind obsessed by
    lust, kills a living being&quot; (A.3:71/i,216; text slightly
    different).&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method applies to the state
    of being unwholesome roots in the cases of hate and delusion.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>The Wholesome Courses of
    Action</strong></font></p>
    <p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstention from killing living beings is
    wholesome (<i>panatipata veramani</i>), etc.:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Here &quot;killing living beings,&quot; etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; have
    the same meaning as aforesaid.&nbsp;&nbsp; It crushes the
    hostile, thus it is abstention (<i>veram manati ti veramani</i>);
    the meaning is that it abandons the hostile.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Or:&nbsp;&nbsp; with that as the instrument one abstains (<i>viramati</i>),
    the syllable <i>ve</i> being substituted for the syllable
    vi.&nbsp;&nbsp; This here is, in the first place, the
    commentary on the phrasing.</p>
    <p>But as to the meaning, abstention is refraining (<i>virati</i>)
    associated with wholesome consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is
    stated thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;For one refraining from
    killing living beings, that which is on that occasion the
    leaving off, the refraining&quot; (Vibh.&nbsp;&nbsp; 285),
    that is the refraining associated with wholesome
    consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; As to kind, it is
    threefold:&nbsp;&nbsp; refraining in the presence of
    opportunity, refraining because of an undertaking, and
    refraining because of eradication (of defilements).</p>
    <p>Herein, refraining in the presence of an opportunity (<i>sampattavirati</i>)
    is to be understood as the refraining which occurs in those
    who have not undertaken any training rule but who do not
    transgress when an opportunity for doing so presents itself
    because they reflect upon their birth, age, learning, etc.,
    like the lay follower Cakkana in the island of Sri Lanka.</p>
    <p>When he was a boy, it is said, his mother developed an
    illness, and the doctor said, &quot;Fresh hare's flesh is
    needed.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Cakkana's brother sent him,
    saying, &quot;Go, dear, and hunt in the
    field.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went there.&nbsp;&nbsp; On that
    occasion a hare had come to eat the young corn.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    On seeing him it bolted swiftly, but it got entangled in a
    creeper and squealed &quot;kiri, kiri.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Guided by the sound, Cakkana went and caught it, thinking,
    &quot;I will make medicine for my mother.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Then he thought again, &quot;This is not proper for me, that
    I should deprive another of life for the sake of my mother's
    life.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; So he released it, saying &quot;Go
    and enjoy the grass and the water with the other hares in the
    forest.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; When his brother asked him,
    &quot;Did you get a hare, dear?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; he told him
    what had happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; His brother scolded
    him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He went to his mother and determined upon an
    asseveration of truth:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Since I was born I
    am not aware that I have ever intentionally deprived a living
    being of life.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Straightaway his mother
    became well.</p>
    <p>Refraining because of an undertaking (<i>samadanavirati</i>)
    is to be understood as the refraining which occurs in those
    who do not transgress in a particular case because they have
    undertaken training rules, giving up even their own lives in
    the undertaking of the training rules and in what is superior
    to that, like the lay follower who dwelt at Uttaravaddhamana
    Mountain.</p>
    <p>It is said that after undertaking the training rules from
    the Elder Pingala Buddharakkhita who lived in the Ambariya
    Monastery, he was plowing a field.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then his ox
    got lost.&nbsp;&nbsp; Searching for it, he climbed up
    Uttaravaddhamana Mountain.&nbsp;&nbsp; There a large serpent
    seized him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He thought, &quot;Let me cut off his
    head with this sharp axe.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he thought
    again, &quot;This is not proper for me, that I should break a
    training rule that I have undertaken in the presence of my
    honored teacher.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking up to the third
    time, &quot;I will give up my life but not the training
    rule,&quot; he threw the sharp hand axe that was slung on his
    shoulder into the forest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Straightaway the
    creature released him and went away.</p>
    <p>Refraining because of eradication (of defilements) (<i>samucchedavirati</i>)
    is to be understood as the refraining associated with the
    noble path.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the arising of this even the
    thought, &quot;I will kill a living being,&quot; does not
    occur to the noble persons.</p>
    <p>This refraining is called &quot;wholesome&quot; (<i>kusala</i>)
    because of the occurrence of wholesomeness (<i>kosalla</i>);
    or because of shedding the vile (<i>kucchitassa salanato</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Also, evil conduct is commonly called &quot;weeds&quot; (<i>kusa</i>)
    and it mows this down (<i>lunati</i>), thus it is called
    &quot;wholesome.&quot;</p>
    <p>As in the case of the unwholesome, so for these courses of
    wholesome kamma the exposition should be understood in five
    ways:&nbsp;&nbsp; as to mental state, as to category, as to
    object, as to feeling, and as to root.</p>
    <p>Herein, as to mental state:&nbsp;&nbsp; The first seven
    among these can be both volitions and abstinences; the last
    three are associated with volition only.</p>
    <p>As to category:&nbsp;&nbsp; The first seven are courses of
    kamma only, not roots. The last three are courses of kamma
    and also roots.&nbsp;&nbsp; For non-covetousness, having
    arrived at the (state of) a root, is the wholesome root
    non-greed; non-ill will is the wholesome root non-hate; and
    right view is the wholesome root non-delusion.</p>
    <p>As to object:&nbsp;&nbsp; The objects of these are the
    same as the objects of killing living beings,
    etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; For abstention is spoken of in relation to
    something which can be transgressed.&nbsp;&nbsp; But just as
    the noble path, which has Nibbana as object, abandons the
    defilements, so too should these courses of kamma, which have
    the life faculty, etc., as object, be understood to abandon
    the kinds of evil conduct beginning with killing living
    beings.</p>
    <p>As to feeling:&nbsp;&nbsp; All have pleasant feeling or
    neutral feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp; For there is no painful feeling
    which arrives at the wholesome.</p>
    <p>As to root:&nbsp;&nbsp; The first seven courses of kamma
    have three roots by way of non-greed, non-hate, and
    non-delusion in one who abstains by means of consciousness
    associated with knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have two roots in
    one who abstains by means of consciousness dissociated from
    knowledge.<a href="#15" name="r15">[15]</a> Non-covetousness
    has two roots in one who abstains by means of consciousness
    associated with knowledge, one root (in one who abstains) by
    means of consciousness dissociated from knowledge. Non-greed,
    however, is not by itself its own root.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same
    method applies in the case of non-ill will.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right
    view always has two roots, by way of non-greed and
    non-hate.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#16" name="r16">[16]</a></p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>The Wholesome Roots</strong></font></p>
    <p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-greed is a root of the wholesome (<i>alobho
    kusalamulam</i>), etc.:&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-greed is not greed;
    this is a term for the state that is opposed to
    greed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method applies in the case of
    non-hate and non-delusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these, non-greed
    is itself wholesome; and it is a root of these wholesome
    (courses of kamma) beginning with abstention from killing
    living beings, for some in the sense that it is an associated
    originative cause and for some in the sense that it is a
    decisive support condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it is a
    wholesome root.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method applies to the
    state of being wholesome roots in the cases of non-hate and
    non-delusion.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>Conclusion on the
    Unwholesome and the Wholesome</strong></font></p>
    <p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, summing up the meaning of all that has
    been set forth in brief and in detail, he states the
    concluding section beginning with the words when a noble
    disciple.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, has thus understood the
    wholesome (<i>evam akusalam pajanati</i>) means:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    has thus understood the unwholesome by way of the ten courses
    of unwholesome kamma as described.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same
    method applies in the case of the root of the unwholesome,
    etc.</p>
    <p>Up to this point, by a single method, emancipation as far
    as Arahantship has been expounded for one who has the Four
    Noble Truths as his meditation subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    How?&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the ten courses of unwholesome kamma
    with the exception of covetousness, and the (ten) courses of
    wholesome kamma, are the truth of suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    These two states -- covetousness and the greed which is a
    root of the unwholesome -- are, literally speaking, the truth
    of the origin.&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking figuratively, however,
    all the courses of kamma are the truth of suffering, and all
    the wholesome and unwholesome roots are the truth of the
    origin.<a href="#17" name="r17">[17]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    non-occurrence of both is the truth of cessation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The noble path fully understanding suffering, abandoning its
    origin, and understanding its cessation is the truth of the
    path.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus two truths are stated in their own
    nature and two are to be understood by way of the guideline
    of conversion.<a href="#18" name="r18">[18]</a></p>
    <p>He entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust (<i>so
    sabbaso raganusayam pahaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding
    thus the unwholesome, etc., he abandons in all ways the
    underlying tendency to lust.&nbsp;&nbsp; He abolishes the
    underlying tendency to aversion (<i>patighanusayam
    pativinodetva</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; and he removes in all ways
    too the underlying tendency to aversion, is what is
    meant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to this point the path of non-return is
    stated.<a href="#2" name="r19">[19]&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; He
    extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit
    &quot;I am&quot; (<i>asmi ti ditthimananusayam samuhanitva</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    he extricates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit
    which occurs in the mode of grasping the five aggregates as a
    group (with the notion) &quot;I am,&quot; due to failure to
    distinguish any state among them.</p>
    <p>Therein, by the phrase the underlying tendency to the view
    and conceit &quot;I am&quot; (<i>ditthimananusayam</i>) what
    is meant is the underlying tendency to conceit which is
    similar to a view (<i>ditthisadisam mananusayam</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    For this underlying tendency to conceit is similar to a view
    because it occurs (with the notion) &quot;I am&quot;;
    therefore it is stated thus.&nbsp;&nbsp; And one who wishes
    to understand this conceit &quot;I am&quot; in detail should
    look up the Khemaka Sutta in the Khandhiyavagga
    (S.22:89/iii,126ff.).</p>
    <p>By abandoning ignorance (<i>avijjam pahaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    having abandoned ignorance, the root of the round (of
    existence).&nbsp;&nbsp; And arousing true knowledge (<i>vijjam
    uppadetva</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; having aroused the true knowledge
    of the path of Arahantship which completely extricates that
    ignorance.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point the path of Arahantship
    is stated.<a href="#20" name="r20">[20]&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; He
    here and now makes an end of suffering (<i>ditth'eva dhamme
    dukkhass'antakaro hoti</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; in this very
    existence he becomes one who cuts off the suffering of the
    round.</p>
    <p>In that way too (<i>ettavatapi kho avuso</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    he marks off (this first part of) the teaching; by way of the
    attention and penetration stated in this exposition of the
    courses of kamma, is what is meant. The rest is as
    aforesaid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus he concludes the exposition by
    means of the path of non-return and the path of Arahantship.</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">THE FOUR NUTRIMENTS</font></h3>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>General</strong></font></p>
    <p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying, &quot;Good, friend,&quot;
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (etc.)
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; and has arrived
    at this true Dhamma&quot;:&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, having heard the
    Venerable Sariputta's exposition of the four truths under the
    heading of the wholesome and the unwholesome, the bhikkhus
    delighted in his words with the statement, &quot;Good,
    friend,&quot; and rejoiced with the mind that aroused that
    statement; what is meant is that they agreed by word and
    approved by mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, because the Elder was
    competent to give an exposition on the four truths in diverse
    ways -- as (the Blessed One) said:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;Bhikkhus, Sariputta is able to propound, to teach, the
    Four Noble Truths in detail&quot; (M.141/iii, 248); or
    because he had said &quot;in that way too,&quot; being
    desirous of giving a further exposition, the bhikkhus, being
    desirous of hearing the teaching of the four truths by
    another method, asked him a further question.&nbsp;&nbsp; By
    asking &quot;But, friend, might there be another
    way?&nbsp;&nbsp; Would there be another
    case?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; they asked another question
    additional to that question asked and answered (already) by
    the Venerable Sariputta himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or what is meant
    is that they asked a question subsequent to the previous
    one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, answering them, the Elder said,
    &quot;There might be, friends,&quot; and so on.</p>
    <p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, this is the elucidation of the
    terms that are not clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nutriment (<i>ahara</i>)
    is a condition (<i>paccaya</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; For a condition
    nourishes its own fruit, therefore it is called nutriment.<a
    href="#21" name="r21">[21]</a></p>
    <p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of beings that already have come to be (<i>bhutanam
    va sattanam</i>), etc.:&nbsp;&nbsp; Here come to be (<i>bhuta</i>)
    means come to birth, reborn; seeking a new existence (<i>sambhavesinam</i>)
    means those who seek, search for, existence, birth,
    production.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein, among the four kinds of
    generation,<a href="#22" name="r22">[22]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    beings born from eggs and from the womb are said to be
    &quot;seeking a new existence&quot; as long as they have not
    broken out of the eggshell or the placenta.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
    they have broken out of the eggshell or the placenta and
    emerged outside, they are said to have &quot;come to
    be.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moisture-born and the spontaneously
    born are said to be &quot;seeking a new existence&quot; at
    the first moment of consciousness; from the second moment of
    consciousness onwards they are said to have &quot;come to
    be.&quot;</p>
    <p>Or alternatively, &quot;come to be&quot; is born,
    reproduced; this is a term for those who have destroyed the
    cankers (<i>Arahants</i>), who are reckoned thus:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;They have come to be only, but they will not come to be
    again.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Seeking a new existence&quot;
    means they seek a new existence; this is a term for
    worldlings and disciples in higher training who seek a new
    existence in the future too, because they have not abandoned
    the fetter of being.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus by these two terms he
    includes all beings in all ways.</p>
    <p>For the maintenance (<i>thitiya</i>); for the purpose of
    maintaining. For the support (<i>anuggahaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    for the purpose of supporting, for the purpose of
    helping.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is merely a difference of words,
    but the meaning of the two terms is one only.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or
    alternatively, &quot;for the maintenance&quot; is for the
    non-interruption of this or that being by means of the serial
    connection of arisen states.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;For the
    support&quot; is for the arising of unarisen
    (states).&nbsp;&nbsp; And both these expressions should be
    regarded as applicable in both cases thus:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;For the maintenance and support of those that have come
    to be, and for the maintenance and support of those seeking a
    new existence.&quot;</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>The Four Kinds of Nutriment</strong></font></p>
    <p>Physical food as nutriment (lit.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;food
    made into a ball&quot;) (<i>kabalinkaro aharo</i>) is
    nutriment that can be swallowed after making it into a ball;
    this is a term for the nutritive essence which has as its
    basis boiled rice, junket, etc.<a href="#23" name="r23">[23]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Gross or subtle (<i>olariko va sukhumo va</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    it is gross because of the grossness of the basis, and subtle
    because of the subtlety of the basis.&nbsp;&nbsp; But because
    physical nutriment is included in subtle materiality, by way
    of its individual essence it is subtle only.<a href="#24"
    name="r24">[24]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; And also that grossness and
    subtlety should be understood relatively in respect of the
    basis.</p>
    <p>The nutriment of peacocks is subtle compared with the
    nutriment of crocodiles.&nbsp;&nbsp; Crocodiles, they say,
    swallow stones, and these dissolve on reaching their
    stomachs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Peacocks eat such animals as snakes,
    scorpions, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the nutriment of hyenas is
    subtle compared with the nutriment of peacocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    These, they say, eat horns and bones thrown away three years
    before, and these become soft as yams as soon as they are
    moistened with their saliva.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the nutriment
    of elephants is subtle compared with the nutriment of
    hyenas.&nbsp;&nbsp; For these eat the branches of various
    trees, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nutriment of the gayal buffalo,
    the antelope, the deer, etc., is subtler than the nutriment
    of elephants.&nbsp;&nbsp; These, they say, eat the sapless
    leaves of various kinds of trees, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    nutriment of cows is subtler than their nutriment; they eat
    fresh and dried grass.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nutriment of hares is
    subtler than their nutriment; that of birds is subtler than
    that of hares; that of barbarians is subtler than that of
    birds; that of village headmen is subtler than that of
    barbarians; that of kings and kings' ministers is subtler
    than village headmens'; that of a Wheel-turning Monarch is
    subtler than their nutriment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The earth deities'
    nutriment is subtler than that of a Wheel-turning
    Monarch.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nutriment of the deities of the Four
    Great Kings is subtler than that of the earth
    deities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus nutriment should be elaborated up
    to that of the deities who wield power over others'
    creations.<a href="#25" name="r25">[25]</a> But saying,
    &quot;Their nutriment is subtle,&quot; the end is reached.</p>
    <p>And here, in a basis that is gross, the nutritive essence
    is limited and weak; in one that is subtle, it is
    strong.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus one who has drunk even a full bowl
    of gruel is soon hungry again and desirous of eating
    anything; but after drinking even a small amount of ghee, he
    will not want to eat for the whole day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein,
    it is the basis that dispels fatigue, but it is unable to
    preserve; but the nutritive essence preserves, though it
    cannot dispel fatigue.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when the two are
    combined they both dispel fatigue and preserve.</p>
    <p>Contact as the second (<i>phasso dutiyo</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The sixfold contact beginning with eye-contact should be
    understood as the second of these four kinds of
    nutriment.&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is the method of the teaching
    itself; therefore it should not be inquired into here, saying
    &quot;For this reason it is the second, or the
    third.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mental volition (<i>manosancetana</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    volition (<i>cetana</i>) itself is stated. Consciousness (<i>vinnanam</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    any kind of consciousness whatever.</p>
    <p>It may be asked here:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If the meaning of
    condition is the meaning of nutriment, then, when other
    conditions also exist for beings, why are only these four
    stated?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be said in
    reply:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It is because they are the special
    conditions for personal continuity.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
    physical nutriment is the special condition for the material
    body of beings that eat physical nutriment; as regards the
    group of mental constituents, contact is (the special
    condition) for feeling, mental volition for consciousness,
    and consciousness for mentality-materiality.&nbsp;&nbsp; As
    it is said:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Just as, bhikkhus, this body
    has nutriment for its maintenance, is maintained in
    dependence on nutriment, and without nutriment is not
    maintained&quot; (S.46:2/v,64); and likewise:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;With contact as condition, feeling;
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with formations as
    condition, consciousness;
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with consciousness as
    condition, mentality-materiality&quot; (S.12:1/ii,1, etc.).</p>
    <p>What is this nutriment, and what does it
    nourish?&nbsp;&nbsp; Physical nutriment nourishes the
    materiality with nutritive essence as eighth;<a href="#26"
    name="r26">[26]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; contact as nutriment
    nourishes the three feelings; mental volition as nutriment
    nourishes the three kinds of being; consciousness as
    nutriment nourishes the mentality-materiality of
    rebirth-linking.</p>
    <p>How?&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as it is placed in the mouth,
    physical food as nutriment brings into being the eight kinds
    of materiality (aforesaid).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then each lump of
    cooked rice ground by the teeth, on being swallowed, brings
    into being unit after unit of the eight kinds of
    materiality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it nourishes the materiality
    with nutritive essence as eighth.</p>
    <p>But with contact as nutriment, when contact productive of
    pleasant feeling arises it nourishes pleasant feeling;
    contact productive of painful feeling nourishes painful
    feeling; contact productive of neither-painful-nor-pleasant
    feeling nourishes neither-painful-nor-pleasant
    feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in all ways contact as nutriment
    nourishes the three kinds of feeling.</p>
    <p>In the case of mental volition as nutriment, kamma leading
    to sense-sphere being nourishes sense-sphere being; kamma
    leading to fine-material and immaterial being nourishes its
    respective kind of being.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in all ways mental
    volition as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of being.</p>
    <p>But with consciousness as nutriment, it is said that it
    nourishes, by way of conascence condition, etc., the three
    (immaterial) aggregates associated with itself at the moment
    of rebirth-linking and the thirty kinds of materiality that
    arise by way of triple continuity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus
    consciousness nourishes the mentality-materiality of
    rebirth-linking.<a href="#27" name="r27">[27]</a></p>
    <p>And here, by the words &quot;mental volition as nutriment
    nourishes the three kinds of being,&quot; only the wholesome
    and unwholesome volition accompanied by taints is meant; by
    the words &quot;consciousness nourishes the
    mentality-materiality of rebirth-linking,&quot; only
    rebirth-linking consciousness is meant.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,
    these are to be understood indiscriminately as nutriments as
    well because they nourish the states that are associated with
    them and originated by them.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>The Four Functions</strong></font></p>
    <p>As regards these four kinds of nutriment, physical food as
    nutriment accomplishes the function of nutriment by
    sustaining, contact by contacting (touching), mental volition
    by accumulating, consciousness by cognizing.</p>
    <p>How?&nbsp;&nbsp; Physical food as nutriment, by
    sustaining, is for the maintenance of beings by maintaining
    the body.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this body, though generated by
    kamma, is sustained by physical food and stands for ten years
    or a hundred years up to the end of the
    life-span.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like what?&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a child
    which, though given birth by the mother, is nurtured by the
    milk, etc., given to him to drink by the wet-nurse and thus
    lives long.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, as a house is supported by a
    prop.&nbsp;&nbsp; This too has been said
    (untraced):&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Great king, just as, when a
    house is collapsing, they prop it up with other timber, and
    that house, being propped up by other timber, does not
    collapse, so too this body is supported by nutriment,
    persists in dependence upon nutriment.&quot;</p>
    <p>Thus physical food as nutriment accomplishes the function
    of nutriment by sustaining.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accomplishing it
    thus, physical food as nutriment becomes a condition for two
    material continuities, namely, for that originated by
    nutriment and that kammically acquired.<a href="#29"
    name="r28">[28]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a condition for the
    kamma-born materiality by becoming its preserver.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It is a condition for that originated by nutriment by
    becoming its producer.</p>
    <p>Then contact, by contacting the object which is the basis
    for pleasure, etc., is &quot;for the maintenance of
    beings&quot; by causing the occurrence of pleasant feeling,
    etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mental volition, accumulating by way of
    wholesome and unwholesome kamma, is &quot;for the maintenance
    of beings&quot; because it provides the root of
    existence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consciousness, by cognizing, is
    &quot;for the maintenance of beings&quot; by causing the
    occurrence of mentality-materiality.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>The Four Dangers</strong></font></p>
    <p>Now, while these are accomplishing their function of
    nutriment by sustaining, etc., four dangers are to be
    seen:&nbsp;&nbsp; the danger of desire in the case of
    physical food as nutriment; the danger of approach in the
    case of contact; (the danger) of accumulating in the case of
    mental volition; and (the danger) of launching [into a new
    existence here or there by way of taking
    rebirth-linking]&nbsp;&nbsp; in the case of consciousness.</p>
    <p>What are the reasons (for this)?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because,
    having aroused desire for physical food, beings face cold,
    etc., to undertake such work as checking, accounting, etc.,
    and incur not a little suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; And some who
    have gone forth in this dispensation seek nutriment through
    such improper means as the practice of medicine, etc., and
    they are to be censured here and now, and hereafter they
    become &quot;recluse ghosts&quot; in the manner described
    thus in the Lakkhana Samyutta:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And his
    outer robe was burning, blazing,&quot; etc.<a href="#29"
    name="r29">[29]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, desire
    itself is to be understood as the danger in physical food as
    nutriment.</p>
    <p>Those who approach contact, who find gratification in
    contact, commit crimes in respect of others' guarded and
    protected belongings, such as their wives, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When the owners of the goods catch them with their
    belongings, they cut them into pieces or throw them onto a
    rubbish heap, or hand them over to the king; and then the
    king has various tortures inflicted upon them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    And with the breakup of the body, after death, a bad
    destination is to be expected for them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus this
    entire danger -- that pertaining to the here and now and that
    pertaining to the afterlife -- has come about rooted in
    contact.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, approach is to be
    understood as the danger in the case of the nutriment
    contact.</p>
    <p>The entire danger in the three realms of existence has
    come about by the accumulation of wholesome and unwholesome
    kamma and is rooted in that (accumulation).&nbsp;&nbsp; For
    this reason, accumulation is to be understood as the danger
    in the nutriment mental volition.</p>
    <p>And in whatever place rebirth-linking consciousness
    launches (the new existence), in that same place it is reborn
    by seizing the rebirth-linking
    mentality-materiality.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it is produced, all
    dangers are produced, for they are all rooted in
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, launching is to be
    understood as the danger in the nutriment consciousness.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>The Four Similes</strong></font></p>
    <p>In regard to these nutriments with their dangers, for the
    sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment physical food,
    the Fully Enlightened One taught the simile of son's flesh in
    the passage beginning thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Suppose,
    bhikkhus, a couple, a man and his wife,
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sake of
    eliminating desire for the nutriment contact, he taught the
    simile of the flayed cow in the passage beginning
    thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a flayed
    cow &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the
    sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment mental volition,
    he taught the simile of the charcoal pit in the passage
    beginning thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Suppose, bhikkhus, there
    was a charcoal pit
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for the
    sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment consciousness,
    he taught the simile of the man struck with three hundred
    spears in the passage beginning thus:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a thief, a crook
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot;<a href="#30" name="r30">[30]</a></p>
    <p>Therein, taking the essential meaning, there follows a
    brief interpretation of the meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple, it
    is said, a man and his wife, took their son and set out on a
    desert trail a hundred yojanas long,<a href="#31" name="r31">[31]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    with only limited provisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; When they had gone
    fifty yojanas their provisions ran out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhausted
    by hunger and thirst, they sat down in some scanty
    shade.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the man said to his wife:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;My dear, for fifty yojanas on all sides there is
    neither a village nor a town.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, though a
    man can do many kinds of work, such as plowing, guarding
    cattle, etc., it is not possible for me to do
    that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, kill me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eat half of my
    flesh, and having made the other half into provisions for the
    journey, cross out of the desert together with our son.&quot;</p>
    <p>The wife said:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Dear husband, though a
    woman can do many kinds of work, such as spinning thread,
    etc., it is not possible for me to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Come,
    kill me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eat half of my flesh, and having made
    the other half into provisions for the journey, cross out of
    the desert together with our son.&quot;</p>
    <p>Then the man said:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My dear, the death of
    the mother would mean the death of two, for a young boy
    cannot live without his mother.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if we both
    live, then we can beget another child again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Come
    now, let us kill our child, take his flesh, and cross out of
    this desert.&quot;</p>
    <p>Then the mother said to the son:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Dear,
    go to your father.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went, but the father
    said:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;For the sake of supporting this child
    I incurred much suffering through such work as plowing,
    guarding cattle, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot kill the
    boy.&nbsp;&nbsp; You kill your son.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he
    said:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Dear, go to your
    mother.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the mother said:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;Longing for a son I incurred much suffering by
    observing the cow-observance, the dog-observance, praying to
    the gods, etc., not to speak of bearing him in my womb.<a
    href="#32" name="r32">[32]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not possible
    for me to kill him.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she
    said:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Dear, go to your father.&quot;</p>
    <p>The boy died from going back and forth between the father
    and the mother.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing him dead, they wept, and
    having taken the flesh as described above, they
    departed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because that flesh of their son was
    repulsive to them for nine reasons, it was not eaten for
    enjoyment nor for intoxication nor for making (the body)
    strong and beautiful, but only for the purpose of crossing
    out of the desert.</p>
    <p>For what nine reasons was it repulsive?&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Because it was the flesh of their own offspring, the flesh of
    a relative, the flesh of a son, the flesh of a dear son, the
    flesh of a youngster, raw flesh, not beef, unsalted,
    unspiced.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore the bhikkhu who sees the
    nutriment physical food thus, as similar to son's flesh,
    eliminates the desire for it.<a href="#33" name="r33">[33]</a></p>
    <p>This, in the first place, is the interpretation of the
    meaning of the simile of son's flesh.</p>
    <p>Then, as regards the simile of the flayed cow:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If a cow were stripped of its skin from the neck to the
    hooves and then set free, whatever it would rest upon would
    become a basis of pain for it, since it would be bitten by
    the small creatures living there.<a href="#34" name="r34">[34]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    So too, whatever physical basis or object contact stands upon
    as its support becomes a basis for the felt pain originating
    from that basis or object.<a href="#35" name="r35">[35]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Therefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment contact thus, as
    similar to a flayed cow, eliminates the desire for
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the interpretation of the meaning of
    the simile of the flayed cow.</p>
    <p>Then, as regards the simile of the charcoal pit:<a
    href="#36" name="r36">[36]&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; The three realms
    of being are like a charcoal pit in the sense of a great
    burning heat (lit., a great fever).&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the two
    men who grab hold (of a weaker man) by both his arms and drag
    him towards it, is mental volition in the sense that it drags
    one towards the realms of being.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore a
    bhikkhu who sees the nutriment mental volition thus, as
    similar to a charcoal pit, eliminates the desire for
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the interpretation of the meaning of
    the simile of the charcoal pit.</p>
    <p>Then, as regards the simile of the man struck with three
    hundred spears:<a href="#37" name="r37">[37]&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;
    The hundred spears that strike the man in the morning make a
    hundred wound openings in his body, and without remaining
    inside they pierce through and fall on the other side; and so
    with the other two hundred spears as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus
    his whole body is cut again and again by the spears which
    come without piercing him in a place where another has
    already struck.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no measuring the pain
    arisen in him from even one of the wound openings, not to
    speak of three hundred wound openings.</p>
    <p>Therein, the time of the generation of the rebirth-linking
    consciousness is like the time of being struck by a
    spear.&nbsp;&nbsp; The production of the aggregates is like
    the production of the wound openings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The arising
    of the various kinds of suffering rooted in the round (of
    existence) once the aggregates have been born is like the
    arising of suffering on account of the wound openings.</p>
    <p>Another method of interpretation (is as
    follows):&nbsp;&nbsp; The rebirth-linking consciousness is
    like the thief.&nbsp;&nbsp; His mentality-materiality
    conditioned by consciousness is like the wound openings
    created by the striking of the spears.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    arising of the various kinds of suffering by way of the
    thirty-two types of torture and the eighty-nine types of
    diseases in regard to consciousness conditioned by
    mentality-materiality -- this should be regarded as like the
    arising of severe pain for that man conditioned by the wound
    openings.</p>
    <p>Therefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment consciousness
    thus, as similar to one struck by three hundred spears,
    eliminates the desire for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the
    interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the man struck
    by three hundred spears.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>Full Understanding</strong></font></p>
    <p>Thus by eliminating desire in regard to these nutriments,
    he also fully understands these four nutriments.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When these have been fully understood, the entire basis (for
    them) has also been fully understood.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this
    has been said by the Blessed One (S.12:63/ii,99-100):</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Bhikkhus, when the nutriment physical food has been
        fully understood, lust for the five cords of sensual
        pleasure has been fully understood.&nbsp;&nbsp; When lust
        for the five cords of sensual pleasure has been fully
        understood, there exists no more any fetter bound by
        which the noble disciple might come back to this world.</p>
        <p>Bhikkhus, when the nutriment contact has been fully
        understood, the three feelings have been fully
        understood.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the three feelings have been
        fully understood, there is nothing further for the noble
        disciple to do, I say.</p>
        <p>Bhikkhus, when the nutriment mental volition has been
        fully understood, the three kinds of craving have been
        fully understood. When the three kinds of craving have
        been fully understood, there is nothing further for the
        noble disciple to do, I say.</p>
        <p>Bhikkhus, when the nutriment consciousness has been
        fully understood, mentality-materiality has been fully
        understood.&nbsp;&nbsp; When mentality-materiality has
        been fully understood, there is nothing further for the
        noble disciple to do, I say.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>The Arising and Cessation of
    Nutriment</strong></font></p>
    <p>With the arising of craving there is the arising of
    nutriment (<i>tanhasamudaya aharasamudayo</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is the meaning:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;With the arising of
    craving in the previous (existence) the arising of the
    nutriments occurs at rebirth-linking (in this
    existence).&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; How?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because at the
    moment of rebirth-linking there is the nutritive essence
    produced among the thirty types of materiality that have
    arisen by way of triple continuity.<a href="#38" name="r38">[38]&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;
    This is the kammically acquired physical food as nutriment
    produced by craving as its condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the
    contact and volition associated with the rebirth-linking
    consciousness, and that mind or consciousness itself -- these
    are the kammically acquired nutriments of contact, mental
    volition and consciousness produced by craving as their
    condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in the first place, the arising
    of the nutriments at rebirth-linking should be understood as
    occurring with the arising of craving in the previous
    existence.</p>
    <p>But because the nutriments that are kammically acquired
    and those that are not kammically acquired have been
    discussed here combined, (the principle of) the arising of
    nutriment with the arising of craving should be understood to
    apply also to those that are not kammically
    acquired.&nbsp;&nbsp; For there is nutritive essence in the
    kinds of materiality that are aroused by the eight types of
    consciousness accompanied by greed;<a href="#39" name="r39">[39]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    this is the nutriment physical food that is not kammically
    acquired yet is produced by conascent craving as its
    condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the contact and volition
    associated with the consciousness accompanied by greed, and
    that mind or consciousness itself -- these are the nutriments
    of contact, mental volition and consciousness that are not
    kammically acquired yet are produced by craving as their
    condition.</p>
    <p>With the cessation of craving there is cessation of
    nutriment (<i>tanhanirodha aharanirodho</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; By
    this there is set forth the cessation of nutriment by the
    cessation of the craving that had become the condition for
    both nutriment that is kammically acquired and that which is
    not kammically acquired.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest (should be
    understood) by the method stated, but there is this
    difference.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here the four truths are stated
    directly, and as here, so in all the following
    sections.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore one who is unconfused in mind
    can deduce the truths throughout in what follows.<a
    href="#40" name="r40">[40]</a></p>
    <p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; And in all the following sections the
    delimiting phrase In that way too, friends (<i>ettavata pi
    kho avuso</i>) should be construed according to the principle
    that has been expounded.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, in the first
    place, this is the interpretation of it (in the present
    context).&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In that way
    too&quot;:&nbsp;&nbsp; what is meant is:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;the attention and penetration stated by way of the
    teaching concerning nutriment.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same
    method throughout.</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">The Four Noble Truths</font></h3>
    <p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, delighting and rejoicing in the
    Elder's words, after saying as before &quot;Good,
    friend,&quot; the bhikkhus asked a further question, and the
    Elder answered them by another exposition.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
    method is found in all the following sections.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Therefore, from here onwards, we shall explain the meaning
    only of the particular exposition he states in reply, without
    touching upon such words (as are already explained).</p>
    <p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the brief exposition of this teaching,
    in the phrase (he) understands suffering (<i>dukkham pajanati</i>),
    &quot;suffering&quot; is the truth of suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But regarding the detailed exposition, whatever needs to be
    said has all been said already in the Visuddhimagga in the
    Description of the Truths (XVI,13-104).</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">Aging and Death</font></h3>
    <p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp; From here onwards the teaching is given by
    way of dependent arising (<i>paticca samuppada</i>).</p>
    <p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein, in the section on aging and
    death, firstly as to the term their (<i>tesam tesam</i>) --
    this should be understood as a collective designation in
    brief for the many kinds of beings.&nbsp;&nbsp; For if one
    were to state (the aging of individuals such as) the aging of
    Devadatta, the aging of Somadatta, etc., one would never come
    to an end of beings.&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is no being not
    included by this term &quot;their.&quot;<a href="#41"
    name="r41">[41]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore it was said
    above:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This should be understood as a
    collective designation in brief for the many kinds of
    beings.&quot;</p>
    <p>In the various (<i>tamhi tamhi</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a
    collective designation for the many (different) orders by way
    of destiny and birth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Orders of beings (<i>sattanikaye</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    an indication of the nature of what is designated by the
    collective designation.</p>
    <p>Aging, old age (<i>jara jiranata</i>), etc.:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As regards these, &quot;aging&quot; is the description of the
    nature; &quot;old age&quot; is the description of the aspect;
    &quot;brokenness,&quot; etc., are descriptions of the
    function with respect to the passage of time; and the last
    two terms are descriptions of the normal
    (process).&nbsp;&nbsp; For this is indicated as to nature by
    this term aging (<i>jara</i>); hence this is a description of
    its nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is indicated as to aspect by this
    term old age (<i>jiranata</i>); hence this is a description
    of its aspect.&nbsp;&nbsp; Brokenness (<i>khandicca</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    by this it is indicated as to the function of causing the
    broken state of teeth and nails on account of the passage of
    time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Grayness (<i>palicca</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; by
    this it is indicated as to the function of causing the head
    hairs and body hairs to turn gray.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrinkling (<i>valittacata</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    by this it is indicated as to the wrinkled state of the skin
    after the withering of the flesh.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the three
    terms beginning with brokenness are descriptions of function
    with respect to the passage of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; By these
    evident aging is shown, which becomes evident by the showing
    of these alterations.&nbsp;&nbsp; For just as the course
    taken by water or wind or fire is evident from the damaged
    and broken state, or the burnt state, of the grass and trees,
    etc., and yet the course that has been taken is not the
    water, etc., itself, so too the course taken by aging is
    evident through brokenness of teeth, etc., and it is
    apprehended by opening the eyes, but the brokenness, etc.,
    themselves are not aging, nor is aging cognizable by the eye.</p>
    <p>Decline of life, weakness of faculties (<i>ayuno samhani
    indriyanam paripako</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; By these terms it is
    indicated by means of the normal (process) known as the
    exhaustion of the life-span and the weakening of the eye
    faculty, etc., that has become manifest with the passage of
    time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence these last two are to be understood
    as descriptions of its normal (process).</p>
    <p>Therein, because the life-span of one who has reached
    aging is dwindling, aging is called &quot;decline of
    life&quot; as a metaphor (for the cause stated in terms) of
    its effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; And because the eye faculty,
    etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; -- which at the time of youth were quite
    clear and could easily grasp even subtle objects -- become
    deficient, obscure, unable to grasp even gross objects when
    one has reached old age, therefore it is called
    &quot;weakness of faculties&quot; also as a metaphor (for the
    cause stated in terms) of its effect.</p>
    <p>This aging, thus described, is all of two kinds, evident
    and concealed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein, the aging of material
    phenomena, shown by brokenness, etc., is called evident aging
    (<i>pakatajara</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the case of
    immaterial phenomena, because their alteration in such a way
    is not visible, their aging is called concealed aging (<i>paticchannajara</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Therein, the brokenness that is seen is simply color (<i>vanna</i>)
    because of the ease of comprehending such things as the
    teeth, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having seen this with the eye and
    reflected on it with the mind door, one knows aging
    thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;These teeth have been afflicted by
    aging,&quot; just as one knows the existence of water below
    when one has noticed the heads of cows, etc., bound to the
    place where the water is located.</p>
    <p>Again, aging is twofold thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; as continuous
    and as discrete.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein, continuous aging (<i>avicijara</i>)
    is the aging of such things as gems, gold, silver, coral, the
    sun and moon, etc.; it is so called because of the difficulty
    of perceiving in such things distinct changes in color, etc.,
    at regular intervals, as we can in the case of living beings
    passing through the decade of childhood, etc., and in the
    case of vegetation (lit.&nbsp;&nbsp; non-breathing things)
    such as flowers, fruits, buds, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The meaning
    is:&nbsp;&nbsp; aging that progresses without
    interval.&nbsp;&nbsp; Discrete aging (<i>savicijara</i>) is
    the aging of the things other than those, i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp; of
    the aforesaid things (living beings and vegetation); it is so
    called because it is easy to perceive in them distinct
    changes in color, etc., at regular intervals.&nbsp;&nbsp; So
    it should be understood.</p>
    <p>Following this (in the definition of death) the term their
    (<i>tesam tesam</i>) should be understood by the method
    stated above (in the definition of aging).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then,
    in the expression passing, passing away, etc., passing (<i>cuti</i>)
    is said by way of what has the nature to pass away; this is a
    collective designation (applying) to one-, four-, and
    five-aggregate (existence).&nbsp;&nbsp; Passing away (<i>cavanata</i>)
    is the indication of the characteristic by a word expressing
    the abstract state.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dissolution (<i>bheda</i>) is
    an indication of the occurrence of the breaking up of the
    aggregates (at the time) of passing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Disappearance (<i>antaradhana</i>) is an indication of the
    absence of any manner of persistence of the aggregates (at
    the time) of passing, as they are broken like a broken pot.</p>
    <p>Dying (<i>maccu marana</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; death which is
    called dying.&nbsp;&nbsp; By this he rejects the idea of
    death as complete annihilation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Completion of
    time (<i>kalakiriya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; time is the destroyer,
    and this (completion of time) is its activity.&nbsp;&nbsp; By
    this he explains death in conventional terminology.</p>
    <p>Now, to explain death in (terms valid in) the ultimate
    sense, he next says the dissolution of the aggregates (<i>khandhanam
    bhedo</i>), etc.<a href="#42" name="r42">[42]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    For in the ultimate sense it is only the aggregates that
    break up; it is not any so called being that
    dies.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when the aggregates are breaking up
    convention says &quot;a being is dying,&quot; and when they
    have broken up convention says &quot;(he is) dead.&quot;</p>
    <p>Here the dissolution of the aggregates is said by way of
    four- [and five-]&nbsp;&nbsp; constituent being; the laying
    down of the body (<i>kalevarassa nikkhepo</i>) by way of
    one-constituent being.<a href="#43" name="r43">[43]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Or alternatively, the dissolution of the aggregates is said
    by way of four-constituent being; the laying down of the body
    should be understood by way of the other two
    (i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp; one- and five-constituent
    being).&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the existence
    of the body, that is, the material body, in those two realms
    of being.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or else, because in the realm of the
    Four Great Kings, etc., the aggregates simply break up and
    they do not lay anything down, the dissolution of the
    aggregates is said with reference to them.<a href="#44"
    name="r44">[44]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; The laying down of the body
    occurs among human beings, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; And here, because
    it is the cause for the laying down of the body, death is
    called the laying down of the body.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the
    meaning should be understood.</p>
    <p>So this aging and this death are what is called aging and
    death (<i>iti ayan ca jara idan ca maranam idam vuccat'avuso
    jaramaranam</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; this is spoken of as
    &quot;aging and death&quot; by combining the two into one.</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">Birth</font></h3>
    <p>26.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on birth, in regard to the
    phrase birth, &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their
    coming to birth, etc., birth (<i>jati</i>) is in the sense of
    being born; this is stated with reference to those
    (conceived) with incomplete sense bases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming
    to birth (<i>sanjati</i>) is in the sense of the act of
    coming to birth; this is stated with reference to those
    (conceived) with already complete sense bases.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Precipitation (or descent, <i>okkanti</i>) is in the sense of
    being precipitated (descending).&nbsp;&nbsp; This is stated
    with reference to those born from the egg and from the womb,
    for they take rebirth-linking as though descending and
    entering the egg shell or the placenta.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Generation (<i>abhinibbatti</i>) is in the sense of being
    generated.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is stated with reference to those
    born from moisture or those of spontaneous birth, for these
    are generated as soon as they become manifest.</p>
    <p>Now comes the exposition in (terms valid in) the ultimate
    sense. Manifestation (<i>patubhava</i>) is the
    arising.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the aggregates (<i>khandhanam</i>) is
    to be understood as (the arising) of one aggregate in the
    one-constituent realm of being, of four aggregates in
    four-constituent realms, and of five aggregates in
    five-constituent realms.&nbsp;&nbsp; Obtaining (<i>patilabha</i>)
    is the manifestation in continuity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bases (<i>ayatananam</i>)
    should be understood as comprising the sense bases arising
    (at conception) in this or that realm.&nbsp;&nbsp; For when
    the sense bases become manifest, then they are said to be
    obtained.</p>
    <p>This is called birth (<i>ayam vuccat'avuso jati</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    by this phrase he comes to the conclusion on birth taught in
    both conventional terms and in the ultimate sense.</p>
    <p>With the arising of being (<i>bhavasamudaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    but here one should understand kammically active being as the
    condition for birth.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest by the method
    stated.</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">Being</font></h3>
    <p>30.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on being, sense-sphere
    being (<i>kamabhava</i>) is kammically active being and
    resultant being.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein, kammically active being
    (<i>kammabhava</i>) is kamma itself that leads to
    sense-sphere being.&nbsp;&nbsp; For that is called
    &quot;being&quot; as a designation of the cause in terms of
    its effect, because it is the cause for resultant being, as
    when it is said:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The arising of Buddhas is
    bliss&quot; and &quot;The accumulation of evil is
    painful&quot; (Dhp.&nbsp;&nbsp; 194, 117).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Resultant being (<i>upapattibhava</i>) is the group of
    kammically acquired aggregates produced by that
    kamma.&nbsp;&nbsp; For that is called &quot;being&quot;
    because it exists there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus this kamma and this
    result are both spoken of conjointly as &quot;sense-sphere
    being.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method applies to
    fine-material being and immaterial being (<i>ruparupabhava</i>).</p>
    <p>With the arising of clinging (<i>upadanasamudaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But here clinging is a condition for wholesome kammically
    active being only by way of decisive support; it is a
    condition for unwholesome kammically active being by way of
    both decisive support and conascence.<a href="#45" name="r45">[45]&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;
    For all resultant being it is a condition only by way of
    decisive support. The rest by the method stated.</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">Clinging</font></h3>
    <p>34.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on clinging, in regard to
    the phrase &quot;clinging to sense pleasures,&quot; etc.,
    clinging to sense pleasures (<i>kamupadana</i>) is analyzed
    thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; by this one clings to the object of sensual
    pleasure, or this itself clings to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or
    alternatively:&nbsp;&nbsp; that is a sensual pleasure and it
    is clinging, thus it is clinging to sensual
    pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is firm grasping (<i>dalhagahana</i>)
    that is called clinging.&nbsp;&nbsp; For here the prefix <i>upa</i>
    has the sense of firmness.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a designation
    for the lust for the five cords of sensual
    pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the brief account
    here.&nbsp;&nbsp; The detailed account should be understood
    by the method stated thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Therein, what is
    clinging to sensual pleasures?&nbsp;&nbsp; The sensual desire
    in regard to sensual pleasures,&quot; etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    (Dhs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1214).</p>
    <p>So too, that is a view and clinging, thus it is clinging
    to views (<i>ditthupadana</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Or
    alternatively:&nbsp;&nbsp; it clings to a view, or by this
    they cling to a view.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the subsequent view
    clings to the previous view and thereby they cling to the
    view.&nbsp;&nbsp; As it is said:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Self and
    the world are eternal; only this is true, anything else is
    false,&quot; etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; (M.102/ii, 233).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is a designation for the whole field of (wrong) views
    except clinging to rituals and observances and clinging to a
    doctrine of self. <a href="#46" name="r46">[46]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is the brief account here.&nbsp;&nbsp; The detailed
    account should be understood by the method stated
    thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Therein, what is clinging to
    views?&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing given,&quot; etc.
    (Dhs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1215).</p>
    <p>So too, by this they cling to rituals and observances, or
    this itself clings to them, or that is a ritual and
    observance and clinging, thus it is clinging to rituals and
    observances (<i>silabbatupadana</i>). For when one adheres to
    the idea that the cow ritual or cow observance brings
    purification, that itself is a clinging.<a href="#47"
    name="r47">[47]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the brief account
    here.&nbsp;&nbsp; The detailed account should be understood
    by the method stated thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Therein, what is
    clinging to rituals and observances?&nbsp;&nbsp; (The idea)
    of recluses and brahmins outside here (i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    outside the Buddha's dispensation) that purity (is achieved)
    by rules,&quot; etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Dhs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section
    1216).</p>
    <p>Now they assert in terms of this, thus it is a
    doctrine.&nbsp;&nbsp; By this they cling, thus it is
    clinging.&nbsp;&nbsp; What do they assert?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or
    what do they cling to?&nbsp;&nbsp; Self.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    clinging to a doctrine about a self is the clinging to a
    doctrine of self (<i>attavadupadana</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Or
    alternatively:&nbsp;&nbsp; by this a mere doctrine of self is
    clung to as self, thus it is clinging to a doctrine of
    self.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a designation for personality view
    with its twenty cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the brief account
    here.&nbsp;&nbsp; The detailed account should be understood
    by the method stated thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Therein, what is
    clinging to a doctrine of self?&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the
    uninstructed worldling who has no regard for noble
    ones,&quot; etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Dhs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1217).</p>
    <p>With the arising of craving (<i>tanhasamudaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    here, craving is a condition for clinging to sensual
    pleasures either by way of decisive support or by way of
    proximity, contiguity, absence, disappearance and repetition.<a
    href="#48" name="r48">[48]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; But for the rest
    (it is a condition) by way of conascence, etc.,
    too.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest by the method stated.</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">Craving</font></h3>
    <p>38.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on craving, craving for
    forms &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; craving for
    mind-objects (<i>rupatanha
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dhammatanha</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    these are names for the kinds of craving which occur in the
    course of a javana cognitive process (<i>javanavithi</i>) in
    the eye door, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a name derived from the
    father, such as Setthiputta (&quot;merchant's son&quot;) or
    Brahmanaputta (&quot;brahmin's son&quot;), their names are
    derived from the object, which is similar to the father [as
    being the cause (<i>hetu</i>) of it only, not as is the case
    with &quot;eye-contact,&quot; which is like a name derived
    from the mother in that (the eye like the mother in relation
    to her son) is a cause by its nature as a physical support (<i>nissayabhava</i>)].</p>
    <p>And here, craving for forms is craving that has forms as
    its object, craving in regard to forms.&nbsp;&nbsp; When this
    occurs by finding gratification in visible forms through its
    nature as sensual lust, it is craving for sensual pleasure (<i>kamatanha</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When it occurs by finding gratification in visible forms,
    thinking &quot;Form is permanent, lasting, eternal,&quot;
    through its nature as lust accompanied by the eternalist
    view, then it is craving for being (<i>bhavatanha</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When it occurs by finding gratification in visible form,
    thinking &quot;Form is annihilated, destroyed, and does not
    exist after death,&quot; through its nature as lust
    accompanied by the annihilationist view, then it is craving
    for non-being (<i>vibhavatanha</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it is
    threefold.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as craving for form, so too
    craving for sound, etc., (are each threefold
    too).&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus there are eighteen modes of
    craving.&nbsp;&nbsp; These eighteen in respect of internal
    visible form, etc., and in respect of external visible form,
    etc., come to thirty-six.&nbsp;&nbsp; So thirty-six in the
    past, thirty-six in the future, and thirty-six at present
    make up a hundred and eight.</p>
    <p>Or there are eighteen based on internal form, etc.,
    thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;On account of the internal there is
    (the notion) 'I am,' there is (the notion) 'I am such and
    such,' &quot; and so on; and there are eighteen based on
    external form, etc., thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;On account of
    the external there is (the notion) 'I am,' there is (the
    notion) 'I am such and such,' &quot; and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Thus there are thirty-six.&nbsp;&nbsp; So thirty-six in the
    past, thirty-six in the future, and thirty-six at present
    make up thus the hundred and eight modes of craving (<i>tanhavicaritani</i>;
    see A.&nbsp;&nbsp; 4:199/ii, 212).</p>
    <p>Again, when a classification is made, they reduce to only
    six classes of craving -- in terms of their objects, forms
    and the rest -- and to only three types of craving -- craving
    for sensual pleasure and the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Craving should be known by the wise<br>
        Through description and when described<br>
        In detail; it (should be known) again<br>
        Through classification of the detail.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>With the arising of feeling there is the arising of
    craving (<i>vedanasamudaya tanhasamudayo</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But here the word &quot;feeling&quot; is intended as
    resultant feeling.<a href="#49" name="r49">[49]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    How is that the condition for craving in respect of the six
    sense doors?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of its ability to produce
    gratification.&nbsp;&nbsp; For it is through the
    gratification in pleasant feeling that beings become enamored
    of that feeling, and after arousing craving for feeling and
    being seized by lust for feeling, they long only for a
    desirable visible form in the eye door.&nbsp;&nbsp; And on
    getting it, they find gratification in it, and they honor
    painters, etc., who provide such objects.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Likewise, they long only for a desirable sound, etc., in the
    ear door, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; And on getting it, they find
    gratification in it, and they honor musicians, perfume
    makers, cooks, spinners and the teachers of the various
    crafts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like what?&nbsp;&nbsp; Like those who,
    being enamored of a child, out of love for the child honor
    the wet-nurse and give her suitable ghee, milk, etc., to eat
    and drink.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest by the method stated.</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">Feeling</font></h3>
    <p>42.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on feeling, classes of
    feeling (<i>vedanakaya</i>) means groups of
    feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeling born of eye-contact
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feeling born of
    mind-contact (<i>cakkhusamphassaja vedana
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manosamphassaja
    vedana</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; because of what has come down in the
    Vibhanga thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There is feeling born of
    eye-contact that is wholesome, that is unwholesome, that is
    indeterminate&quot; (Vibh.&nbsp;&nbsp; 15), the wholesome,
    unwholesome and indeterminate feelings that occur in the eye
    door, etc., are named after the physical base, which is
    similar to a mother, just as some are named after their
    mother, such as &quot;Sariputta (Lady Sari's son),&quot;
    &quot;Mantaniputta (Lady Mantani's son),&quot; etc.</p>
    <p>But the word meaning here is this:&nbsp;&nbsp; feeling
    born of eye-contact (<i>cakkhusamphassaja vedana</i>) is
    feeling that is born with eye-contact as the
    cause.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method throughout.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This, in the first place, is the all-inclusive
    explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp; But by way of resultant, in the
    eye-door there are two eye-consciousnesses, two mind
    elements, three mind-consciousness elements; feeling should
    be understood as what is associated with these.<a href="#50"
    name="r50">[50]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This method also applies in
    the ear door, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mind door, (feeling) is
    associated only with the mind-consciousness elements.</p>
    <p>With the arising of contact (<i>phassasamudaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But here the arising in the five doors of the feelings that
    have the five physical bases (as their support) occurs with
    the arising of the conascent eye-contact.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the
    rest, eye-contact, etc., are conditions by way of decisive
    support.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mind door, the arising of
    feelings (on the occasion) of registration and of the
    doorless feelings (on the occasions) of rebirth-linking,
    life-continuum and death occurs with the arising of the
    conascent mind-contact.<a href="#51" name="r51">[51]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The rest by the method stated.</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">Contact</font></h3>
    <p>46.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on contact, eye-contact (<i>cakkhusamphassa</i>)
    is contact in the eye.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method
    throughout.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eye-contact
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; body-contact (<i>cakkhusamphasso
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kayasamphasso</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    up to this point ten kinds of contact have been stated,
    namely, the wholesome- and unwholesome-resultants having the
    five physical bases (as their support).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Mind-contact (<i>manosamphassa</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; by this (he
    indicates) the remaining twenty-two kinds of contact
    associated with the mundane resultant (types of
    consciousness).<a href="#52" name="r52">[52]</a></p>
    <p>With the arising of the sixfold base (<i>salayatanasamudaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The arising of this sixfold contact should be understood to
    occur by way of the arising of the six bases beginning with
    the eye-base.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest by the method stated.</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">The Sixfold Base</font></h3>
    <p>50.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on the sixfold base, as
    regards the eye-base (<i>cakkhayatana</i>), etc., whatever
    should be said has all been said already in the Visuddhimagga
    in the Description of the Aggregates and in the Description
    of the Bases (XIV, 37-52; XV, 1-16).</p>
    <p>With the arising of mentality-materiality (<i>namarupasamudaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But here the arising of the sixfold base should be understood
    to occur from the arising of mentality-materiality according
    to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga in the Description
    of Dependent Arising, as to which mentality, which
    materiality, and which mentality-materiality are a condition
    for which base (XVII, 206-219).</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">Mentality-Materiality</font></h3>
    <p>54.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on mentality-materiality,
    mentality (<i>nama</i>) has the characteristic of bending (<i>namana</i>);
    materiality (<i>rupa</i>) has the characteristic of being
    molested (<i>ruppana</i>).<a href="#53" name="r53">[53]&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;
    In the detailed section, however, feeling (<i>vedana</i>) is
    to be understood as the feeling aggregate, perception (<i>sanna</i>)
    as the perception aggregate, and volition, contact and
    attention (<i>cetana phasso manasikaro</i>) as the formations
    aggregate.&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is certainly the case that
    other states are included in the formations aggregate, still
    these three are found in all classes of consciousness, even
    the weakest.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why the formations aggregate
    is here pointed out only by means of these three.</p>
    <p>The four great elements (<i>cattari mahabhutani</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    this is a designation for the four -- earth, water, fire and
    air.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason why these are called &quot;great
    elements,&quot; and other determinations concerning them, are
    all stated in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of the
    Materiality Aggregate.<a href="#55" name="r54">[54]</a></p>
    <p>Derived from the four great elements (<i>catunnan ca
    mahabhutanam upadaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; derived from (<i>upadaya</i>)
    = having clung to (<i>upadayitva</i>); &quot;having
    grasped&quot; is the meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some also say
    &quot;depending upon&quot; (<i>nissaya</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; And
    here the reading is completed by adding the word
    &quot;existing&quot; (<i>vattamanam</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    Pali uses the genitive (in the term for the elements) in the
    sense of a group.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the meaning here should
    be understood thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; the materiality that exists
    derived from the group of the four great elements.</p>
    <p>Thus materiality taken altogether is to be understood as
    consisting of all the following:&nbsp;&nbsp; the four great
    elements beginning with the earth element, and the
    materiality that exists derived from the four great elements,
    stated in the canonical Abhidhamma to be of twenty-three
    kinds by analysis into the eye-base, etc.<a href="#55"
    name="r55">[55]</a></p>
    <p>With the arising of consciousness (<i>vinnanasamudaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But here the arising of mentality-materiality should be
    understood to occur with the arising of consciousness
    according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga in the
    Description of Dependent Arising, as to which consciousness
    is a condition for which mentality, for which materiality,
    and for which mentality-materiality (XVII,
    186-202).&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest by the method stated.</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">Consciousness</font></h3>
    <p>58.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on consciousness,
    eye-consciousness (<i>cakkhuvinnana</i>) is consciousness in
    the eye or consciousness born from the eye.&nbsp;&nbsp; So
    also with ear-, nose-, tongue- and
    body-consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; But with the other one,
    i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp; mind-consciousness (<i>manovinnana</i>),
    mind itself is consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a
    designation for the resultant consciousness of the three
    (mundane) planes of existence except for the two groups of
    fivefold consciousness.<a href="#56" name="r56">[56]</a></p>
    <p>With the arising of formations (<i>sankharasamudaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But here the arising of consciousness should be understood to
    occur with the arising of formations according to the method
    stated in the Visuddhimagga, as to which formation is a
    condition for which consciousness (XVII, 175-185).</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">Formations</font></h3>
    <p>62.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on formations, a formation
    (<i>sankhara</i>) has the characteristic of forming (<i>abhisankharanalakkhana</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But in the detailed section, the bodily formation (<i>kayasankhara</i>)
    is a formation that proceeds from the body.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
    is a designation for the twenty kinds of bodily volition --
    the eight sense-sphere wholesome and twelve unwholesome --
    that occur by way of activation in the bodily door.<a
    href="#57" name="r57">[57]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; The verbal
    formation (<i>vacisankhara</i>) is a formation that proceeds
    from speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a designation for the (same)
    twenty kinds of verbal volition that occur by way of breaking
    into speech in the door of speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mental
    formation (<i>cittasankhara</i>) is a formation that proceeds
    from the mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a designation for the
    twenty-nine kinds of mental volition -- the mundane wholesome
    and unwholesome -- that occur in one sitting alone in
    thought, and which do not cause activation of the bodily and
    verbal doors.<a href="#58" name="r58">[58]</a></p>
    <p>With the arising of ignorance (<i>avijjasamudaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But here ignorance should be understood as a condition for
    the wholesome by way of decisive support and for the
    unwholesome by way of conascence as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    rest by the method stated.</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">Ignorance</font></h3>
    <p>66.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on ignorance, not knowing
    about suffering (<i>dukkhe annanam</i>) means not knowing
    about the truth of suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a
    designation for delusion (<i>moha</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; The same
    method with respect to &quot;not knowing about the origin of
    suffering,&quot; and so on.</p>
    <p>Herein, not knowing about suffering should be understood
    in four ways: as to containment (<i>antogadhato</i>), as to
    physical basis (<i>vatthuto</i>), as to object (<i>arammanato</i>),
    and as to concealment (<i>paticchadanato</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Thus, because of being included in the truth of suffering, it
    (&quot;not knowing&quot; or ignorance) is contained in
    suffering; and the truth of suffering is its physical basis
    by being its support condition; and (the truth of suffering)
    is its object by being its object condition; and it conceals
    the truth of suffering by preventing the penetration of its
    real characteristic and by not allowing knowledge to occur in
    regard to it.</p>
    <p>Not knowing about the origin (of suffering) should be
    understood in three ways:&nbsp;&nbsp; as to physical basis,
    as to object, and as to concealment. And not knowing about
    cessation and the way (to cessation) should be understood in
    one way only:&nbsp;&nbsp; as to concealment.&nbsp;&nbsp; For
    non-knowledge only conceals cessation and the way by
    preventing the penetration of their real characteristics and
    by not allowing knowledge to occur in regard to
    them.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is not contained in them because it
    is not included in this pair of truths.&nbsp;&nbsp; And these
    two truths are not its physical basis because they are not
    conascent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor are they its object because of its
    non-occurrence on account of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the last
    pair of truths are difficult to see because of their
    profundity, and non-knowledge, which is blind, does not occur
    there.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the first (pair of truths) is profound
    in the sense of opposition because of the difficulty in
    seeing the characteristic of their intrinsic nature; it
    occurs there by way of obsession by the perversions.</p>
    <p>Furthermore:&nbsp;&nbsp; About suffering (<i>dukkhe</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    to this extent ignorance is indicated as to inclusion, as to
    physical basis, as to object, and as to function.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    About the origin of suffering (<i>dukkhasamudaye</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    to this extent, as to basis, as to object, and as to
    function.&nbsp;&nbsp; About the cessation of suffering (<i>dukkhanirodhe</i>)
    and about the way leading to the cessation of suffering (<i>dukkhanirodhagaminiya
    patipadaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; to this extent, as to
    function.&nbsp;&nbsp; But without distinction, (in each
    instance) ignorance is described in terms of its intrinsic
    nature by the phrase &quot;not knowing.&quot;</p>
    <p>With the arising of the taints (<i>asavasamudaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But here the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being
    are conditions for ignorance by way of conascence, etc.; the
    taint of ignorance, only by way of decisive
    support.&nbsp;&nbsp; And here the ignorance that had arisen
    previously should be understood as the taint of
    ignorance.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a decisive support condition
    for the ignorance that arises subsequently.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    rest by the method stated.</p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">The Taints</font></h3>
    <p>70.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on the taints, with the
    arising of ignorance (<i>avijjasamudaya</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Here ignorance is a condition for the taint of sensual desire
    and the taint of being by way of decisive support, etc.; (it
    is a condition) for the taint of ignorance only by way of
    decisive support.&nbsp;&nbsp; And here the ignorance that
    arises subsequently should be understood as the taint of
    ignorance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The previously arisen ignorance itself
    becomes a decisive support condition for the subsequently
    arisen taint of ignorance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest by the
    aforesaid method.</p>
    <p>This section is stated by way of showing the condition for
    the ignorance which heads the factors of dependent
    arising.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stated thus, the undiscoverability (<i>anamataggata</i>)
    of any beginning of samsara is established.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    How?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because with the arising of the taints there
    is the arising of ignorance, and with the arising of
    ignorance there is the arising of the taints.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Thus the taints are a condition for ignorance, and ignorance
    is a condition for the taints.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having shown this,
    (it follows that) no first point of ignorance is manifest,
    and because none is manifest the undiscoverability of any
    beginning of samsara is proven.<a href="#59" name="r59">[59]</a></p>
    <h3><font color="#800080">Conclusion</font></h3>
    <p>Thus in all this sutta sixteen sections have been
    stated:&nbsp;&nbsp; the section on the courses of kamma, the
    section on nutriment, the section on suffering, and the
    sections on aging and death, birth, being, clinging, craving,
    feeling, contact, the sixfold base, mentality-materiality,
    consciousness, formations, ignorance and the taints.</p>
    <p>As to these, in each individual section there is a twofold
    analysis -- in brief and in detail -- amounting to thirty-two
    cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in this sutta, in these thirty-two
    cases, the Four (Noble) Truths are expounded.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Among these, in the sixteen cases stated in detail,
    Arahantship is expounded.</p>
    <p>But according to the opinion of the Elder, the four truths
    and the four paths are expounded in the thirty-two cases.<a
    href="#60" name="r60">[60]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in the entire
    Word of the Buddha comprised in the five great Nikayas, there
    is no sutta except for this Discourse on Right View where the
    Four (Noble) Truths are explained thirty-two times and where
    Arahantship is explained thirty-two times.</p>
    <p>That is what the Venerable Sariputta said (<i>idam
    avoc'ayasma Sariputto</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp; The Venerable
    Sariputta spoke this Discourse on Right View, having adorned
    it with sixty-four divisions -- thirty-two expositions of the
    four truths and thirty-two expositions of
    Arahantship.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bhikkhus were satisfied and
    delighted in the Venerable Sariputta's words.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>In the Papancasudani, the Commentary to
        the Majjhima Nikaya, the Explanation of the Discourse on
        Right View is concluded.</strong></em></p>

    <h2><font color="#000080">Notes:</font></h2>
    <p><a name="1">1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The term sammaditthi is
    ordinarily used to mean simply a state, the path factor of
    right view.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, however, the Pali expression is
    used as a masculine noun to mean, in the first instance, a
    person possessing right view; hence it has been rendered
    &quot;one of right view.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commentator
    contrasts this unusual usage of the term with the more common
    usage where sammaditthi signifies a state (<i>dhamma</i>),
    that is, the path factor rather than the individual endowed
    with that state. [<a href="#r1">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="2">2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The knowledge of kamma as
    one's own (<i>kammassakatanana</i>) is often expressed in the
    Suttas thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I am the owner of my kamma,
    the heir of my kamma, I spring from my kamma, I am bound to
    my kamma, I have kamma as my refuge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever
    kamma I perform, good or bad, of that I am the
    heir.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, it is knowledge of the
    moral efficacy of action, of the fact that one's willed deeds
    fashion one's destiny.&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowledge in conformity
    with the truths (<i>saccanulomikanana</i>) is conceptual
    knowledge of the Four Noble Truths, accompanied by
    understanding and acceptance of them. [<a href="#r2">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="3">3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The understanding or wisdom
    (<i>panna</i>) connected with the paths and fruits is
    supramundane because its object is the supramundane dhamma,
    Nibbana, and because it leads to the overcoming of the world.
    [<a href="#r3">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="4">4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; A disciple in higher
    training (<i>sekha</i>) is one at any of the three lower
    levels of sanctity -- a stream-enterer, once-returner, or
    non-returner -- or one who has reached their respective
    paths.&nbsp;&nbsp; His right view is said to be fixed in
    destiny (<i>niyata</i>) because it necessarily leads to final
    liberation. [<a href="#r4">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="5">5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The &quot;one beyond
    training&quot; (<i>asekha</i>) is the Arahant, so called
    because he has completed the threefold training in virtue,
    concentration and wisdom. [<a href="#r5">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="6">6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ninefold supramundane
    Dhamma:&nbsp;&nbsp; the four paths, the four fruitions, and
    Nibbana. [<a href="#r6">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="7">7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The interpretation of
    &quot;the bhikkhus&quot; and &quot;the Elder&quot; is offered
    by Sub.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cy., which also presents an alternative
    interpretation, based on the commentary to the Vatthupama
    Sutta (M.7) according to which the bhikkhus are the pupils of
    the Elder Mahasangharakkhita and &quot;the Elder&quot; is the
    Elder Mahasangharakkhita. [<a href="#r7">^</a>]</p>

    second parajika offence. [<a href="#r9">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="10">10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The meaning of several of
    these terms, obscure in the original Pali, has been
    elaborated with the aid of the Sub.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cy. [<a
    href="#r10">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="11">11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consent (<i>adhivasana</i>)
    is included to cover the case where one of the partners is
    initially an unwilling victim of another's assault, but
    during the course of union consents to the act and thereby
    becomes a participant. [<a href="#r11">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="12">12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are references to
    the two great classics of Hindu India, the Mahabharata and
    the Ramayana. [<a href="#r12">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="13">13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrong views of fixed
    destiny (<i>niyata micchaditthi</i>) are views which deny the
    moral efficacy of action or which tend to undermine the
    foundations of morality.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the most common
    examples, see D.2/i, 52-56, and M.76/i, 515-18. [<a
    href="#r13">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="14">14</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The chief factor in the
    first seven courses of kamma is volition; the other three
    courses are identical with the mental factors of greed,
    hatred and wrong view, which are associated with volition in
    the states of consciousness in which they arise. [<a
    href="#r14">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="15">15</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This refers to the
    Abhidhamma classification of consciousness, according to
    which wholesome sense-sphere consciousness is of eight types,
    four associated with knowledge, four dissociated from
    knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp; The abstinences, according to the
    Abhidhamma, occur in sense-sphere consciousness only one at a
    time on occasions when one deliberately abstains from some
    wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; In supramundane consciousness all three
    abstinences -- right speech, right action and right
    livelihood -- occur together simultaneously. [<a href="#r15">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="16">16</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right view is synonymous
    with the mental factor of wisdom (<i>panna</i>) or
    non-delusion (<i>amoha</i>); it is always accompanied by the
    other two wholesome roots, though the latter do not
    necessarily occur in conjunction with right view. [<a
    href="#r16">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="17">17</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Literally, or in the
    strict sense (<i>nippariyayena</i>), only covetousness and
    greed, being synonyms of craving (<i>tanha</i>), count as the
    origin of suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in a looser or
    figurative manner of exposition (<i>pariyayena</i>) all the
    roots are the truth of the origin, since as roots of kamma
    they help to sustain the round of rebirth and suffering. [<a
    href="#r17">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="18">18</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The guideline of
    conversion (<i>avattahara</i>) is one of the methods of
    deduction in the exegetical guide, the
    Nettippakarana.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to this guideline, an
    expositor of a sutta is to extract from a particular text a
    standard doctrinal concept belonging to a dichotomy, and then
    taking this concept as a basis, he is to show that the other
    member of the dichotomy is also implied by the passage under
    consideration, and therefore &quot;turns up&quot; when the
    first member is mentioned. [<a href="#r18">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="19">19</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The path of non-return (<i>anagamimagga</i>)
    is stated because this path eradicates all sensual lust and
    aversion. [<a href="#r19">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="20">20</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The path of Arahantship
    is implied by the eradication of conceit and ignorance and by
    the arousing of true knowledge. [<a href="#r21">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="21">21</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The verb <i>aharati</i>
    normally means &quot;to bring,&quot; but here it is rendered
    as &quot;nourish&quot; to underscore its connection with <i>ahara</i>,
    nutriment. [<a href="#r21">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="22">22</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the four <i>yoni</i>
    or modes of generation, see M.12/i, 73. [<a href="#r22">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="23">23</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the
    Abhidhamma, the nutriment proper is the material phenomenon
    called nutritive essence (<i>oja</i>), while the solid food
    ingested is the mere &quot;basis&quot; (<i>vatthu</i>) of the
    nutritive essence. [<a href="#r23">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="24">24</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The point is that while
    in conventional terms food substances are distinguished as
    gross or subtle, this distinction is made in terms of the
    physical base only.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Abhidhamma classifies
    nutritive essence as subtle materiality (<i>sukhumarupa</i>);
    it contrasts with gross materiality (<i>olarikarupa</i>),
    which includes only the five sense organs and their objects.
    [<a href="#r24">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="25">25</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the highest realm
    among the sense-sphere heavens.&nbsp;&nbsp; Above this come
    the Brahma realms, where physical nutriment is non-existent.
    [<a href="#r25">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="26">26</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the simplest kind
    of material group (<i>rupakalapa</i>) recognized by the
    Abhidhamma theory of matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; It consists of the
    four primary elements, along with color, smell, taste, and
    nutritive essence.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the more complex material
    groups also contain these eight phenomena as their
    foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Material groups in a living organism
    require an input of nutriment in order to endure in
    continuity. [<a href="#r26">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="27">27</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Conascence condition (<i>sahajatapaccaya</i>)
    is the condition whereby the conditioning state contributes
    to the arising or maintenance of another state, the
    conditionally arisen state, when the latter arises
    simultaneously with itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consciousness is a
    conascence condition for the three other mental aggregates --
    feeling, perception and mental formations -- both at rebirth
    and during the course of life.&nbsp;&nbsp; At rebirth it is
    also a conascence condition for the &quot;triple
    continuity,&quot; i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp; the three material decads
    of body-sensitivity, sexual determination and the
    heart-base.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of these consists of the
    above-mentioned eight material units along with physical life
    and, as the tenth factor, the material phenomenon after which
    it is named. [<a href="#r27">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="28">28</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kammically acquired
    materiality (<i>upadinnarupa</i>) is matter that is born of
    kamma.&nbsp;&nbsp; It includes the physical sense faculties,
    the life faculty, masculinity, femininity, and the coexisting
    material phenomena in the same group.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though such
    types of matter are produced by kamma rather than by
    nutriment, they require nutriment to sustain them in
    continuity. [<a href="#r28">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="29">29</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lakkhana Samyutta
    (S.19/ii, 254-62) describes the torments experienced by
    beings in the realm of the petas or &quot;afflicted
    spirits.&quot; [<a href="#r29">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="30">30</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; These similes are taken
    from the Puttamamsa Sutta, the Discourse on Son's Flesh
    (S.12:63/ii, 97-100).&nbsp;&nbsp; See Nyanaponika Thera, The
    Four Nutriments of Life (BPS Wheel No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 104/105,
    1967), pp.&nbsp;&nbsp; 19-40, for the sutta along with its
    commentary. [<a href="#r30">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="31">31</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; A <i>yojana</i> is about
    seven miles. [<a href="#r31">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="32">32</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cow-observance and
    the dog-observance are forms of self-mortification which
    ascetics of the Buddha's time practiced in the hope of
    purification; see M.57/i, 387.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently, women
    also observed them for short periods in the hope they would
    make them fertile. [<a href="#r32">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="33">33</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The commentary to the
    Puttamamsa Sutta develops this analogy in greater detail than
    the present commentary. [<a href="#r33">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="34">34</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sutta elaborates as
    follows:&nbsp;&nbsp; If the cow stands, the creatures in the
    air attack it; if it leans against a wall, the creatures in
    the wall attack it; if it lies down, the creatures in the
    ground attack it; if it enters a pool of water, the creatures
    in the water attack it. [<a href="#r34">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="35">35</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact arises from the
    coming together of an object, a physical basis or sense
    faculty (<i>vatthu</i>), and the corresponding type of
    consciousness. [<a href="#r35">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="36">36</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The simile as given in
    the sutta is this:&nbsp;&nbsp; Two strong men grab hold of a
    weaker man by both arms and drag him towards a blazing
    charcoal pit.&nbsp;&nbsp; He wriggles and struggles to get
    free because he knows that if he is thrown into the pit, he
    will meet death or deadly pain. [<a href="#r36">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="37">37</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The king's men arrest a
    thief and bring him before the king.&nbsp;&nbsp; The king
    orders him struck with a hundred spears in the morning,
    another hundred at noon, and a third hundred in the
    evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; The man survives but experiences deadly
    pain. [<a href="#r37">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="38">38</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; See note 27. [<a
    href="#r38">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="39">39</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The eight types of
    consciousness accompanied by greed are distinguished by the
    presence or absence of wrong view, by their accompanying
    feeling which may be pleasant or neutral, and by whether they
    are spontaneous or prompted. [<a href="#r39">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="40">40</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle of the Four
    Noble Truths can be discerned in the format of the
    exposition:&nbsp;&nbsp; a particular item X, the arising of
    X, the cessation of X, and the way to the cessation of X. [<a
    href="#r40">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="41">41</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Pali the repetition <i>tesam
    tesam</i>, lit.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;of them, of them,&quot; is
    understood to imply complete inclusiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    same applies to <i>tamhi tamhi</i>, &quot;in that, in
    that,&quot; just below. [<a href="#r42">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="42">42</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereas the previous
    definitions were framed in conventional terminology, those
    valid in the ultimate sense (<i>paramatthato</i>) define
    their subject solely in terms of &quot;ultimate
    realities&quot; such as aggregates and sense bases. [<a
    href="#r42">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="43">43</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The various realms of
    existence are analyzed as threefold on the basis of the
    number of aggregates existing there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    One-constituent being is the non-percipient realm (<i>asannibhumi</i>),
    which includes only the aggregate of material
    form.&nbsp;&nbsp; Four-constituent being is the four
    immaterial realms, which contain the four mental aggregates
    but not the aggregate of material form.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Five-constituent being comprises all other realms, in which
    all five aggregates are present. [<a href="#r43">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="44">44</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that in the
    sense-sphere heavens, at death the beings simply dissipate
    into thin air, without leaving behind any corpse. [<a
    href="#r44">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="45">45</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Decisive support
    condition (<i>upanissayapaccaya</i>) and conascence condition
    (<i>sahajatapaccaya</i>) are the two chief conditions among
    the twenty-four conditions of the Patthana or Abhidhammic
    system of conditional relations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Decisive support
    holds between a conditioning state and a conditioned state
    that it helps to arise across an interval of
    time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Conascence condition holds between a
    conditioning state and a conditioned state that arise
    simultaneously.&nbsp;&nbsp; See also note 27 above. [<a
    href="#r45">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="46">46</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinging to rituals and
    observances and clinging to a doctrine of self are both types
    of wrong view, but as they are enumerated as individual kinds
    of clinging in their own right, they are not included under
    clinging to views. [<a href="#r46">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="47">47</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; See above, note 32. [<a
    href="#r47">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="48">48</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are conditional
    relations that hold between successive mind-moments in the
    javana phase of a single cognitive process (<i>cittavithi</i>).
    [<a href="#r48">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="49">49</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Resultant feeling alone
    is intended here because this is an exposition of the round
    of existence, and in the formula of dependent arising the
    factors from consciousness through feeling are classified as
    the resultant phase of the round. [<a href="#r49">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="50">50</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two eye-consciousness
    elements are the wholesome-resultant and the
    unwholesome-resultant; the two resultant mind elements are
    the wholesome-resultant and the unwholesome-resultant
    receiving consciousness (<i>sampaticchanacitta</i>); the
    three resultant mind-consciousness elements are three types
    of investigating consciousness (<i>santiranacitta</i>). [<a
    href="#r50">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="51">51</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The registration
    consciousness (<i>tadarammanacitta</i>) is a resultant type
    of consciousness that occurs through any of the sense
    doors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its function is to register the datum that
    had been the object of the preceding javana
    series.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rebirth, life-continuum (<i>bhavanga</i>)
    and death consciousnesses are resultants that are considered
    to be &quot;doorless&quot; (<i>advarika</i>) because they
    occur at an inner subliminal level, not through the
    intercourse of sense organs and sense objects. [<a
    href="#r51">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="52">52</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This refers to the
    Abhidhamma classification of thirty-two types of resultant
    consciousness, of which twenty-two remain besides the ten
    types of sense-consciousness, five resultants of the
    unwholesome and five of the wholesome.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    details are not necessary here. [<a href="#r52">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="53">53</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; These two definitions
    involve word plays difficult to reproduce in
    English.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ven. Nanamoli has a note suggesting,
    half flippantly, &quot;minding&quot; for namana and
    &quot;mattering&quot; for ruppana. [<a href="#r53">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="54">54</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact the Visuddhimagga
    discusses the four great elements not in its chapter on the
    Description of the Aggregates (Ch.&nbsp;&nbsp; XIV), but in
    the chapter on the meditation subject called the definition
    of the elements (Ch.&nbsp;&nbsp; XI). [<a href="#r54">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="55">55</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some instances of derived
    materiality are:&nbsp;&nbsp; the five sense faculties, color,
    sound, smell, taste, the life faculty, sexual determination,
    nutritive essence, space, etc. [<a href="#r55">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="56">56</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The three planes of
    existence were enumerated in Section 30.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only
    resultant consciousness is taken into account here because
    this is an exposition of the round. [<a href="#r56">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="57">57</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The figures for the types
    of consciousness again come from the Abhidhamma.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    These types of consciousness can come to expression either
    through the door of bodily action or the door of speech, or
    they can remain within and not gain outer expression. [<a
    href="#r57">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="58">58</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nine types of
    volition which do not come to expression by body or speech
    are the five volitions of the five fine-material-sphere
    jhanas and the four of the four immaterial-sphere jhanas. [<a
    href="#r58">^</a>]</p>
    <p><a name="59">59</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Elsewhere the Buddha
    says:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A first point of ignorance cannot be
    discovered, of which it can be said:&nbsp;&nbsp; Before that
    there was no ignorance and it came to be after that&quot;
    (A.10:61/v,113).&nbsp;&nbsp; In that sutta the Buddha cites
    the five hindrances as the condition for ignorance, but as
    these in turn presuppose ignorance, the vicious cycle is
    again established. [<a href="#r59">^</a>]</p>
