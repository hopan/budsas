    <blockquote>
        <p><em>[After spending time with the Western monk Ajahn
        Amaro, one is left with the unique feeling of having been
        in the presence of a truly happy man, and one whose
        happiness is born of wisdom. Ordained by Ajahn Chah in
        1979, Ajahn Amaro has spent most of his life as a monk at
        the Amaravati monastery in England. In recent years he
        has lived in Northern California for several months each
        winter. Soon Ajahn Amaro will be taking up permanent
        residence in California on 120 acres of forested land in
        the Redwood Valley of Mendocino County where a Theravadan
        monastery will be established. The land was gifted to
        Ajahn Sumedho, abbot of Amaravati, and to the Sanghapala
        Foundation by the founder of the City of Ten Thousand
        Buddhas, Master Hua, who passed away this past Spring.
        The following interview with Ajahn Amaro was conducted by
        Wes Nisker and Terry Vandiver in March of 1995, on the
        porch of Ajahn Amaro's residence in Sonoma County,
        California.]</em></p>

    <p><em><strong>INQUIRING MIND:</strong></em><em> How would
    you assess the study of Buddha Dharma and the practice of
    meditation now being taught in the West?</em></p>
    <p><strong>AJAHN AMARO:</strong> In the West people tend to
    separate their meditation practice from their lives. Ajahn
    Chah emphasized that &quot;if you have time to breathe you
    have time to meditate.&quot; You breathe when you walk. You
    breathe when you stand. You breathe when you lie down.</p>
    <p>I think part of the problem in the West is the emphasis on
    retreats. If you do a lot of intensive retreats you will
    develop strong concentration. Many of the people I meet in
    America have been doing retreats for 15-20 years and they are
    really quite accomplished concentrators. But I'm afraid they
    have not found much freedom.</p>
    <p>Notice how the word &quot;sitting&quot; has become
    synonymous with meditation or with practicing Dharma. Sitting
    is the operative word, meaning, &quot;I am here on my
    cushion, my eyes are closed, the world has dissolved into
    emptiness.&quot; We have learned how to concentrate our minds
    and then to push out our worldly irritations and
    responsibilities. We create this great space inside and
    become very good at getting rid of thoughts and feelings.
    Meditation can thus become rather like being in a shooting
    gallery with the little ducks. You can become a great
    marksman or markswoman, shooting down the thought ducks and
    the feeling ducks.</p>
    <p><em><strong>IM:</strong></em><em> Is this emphasis on
    intensive meditation retreats unique to the West? Or is it
    imported from Asian traditions?</em></p>
    <p><strong>AA:</strong> One reason for the retreat emphasis,
    at least in vipassana circles, is due to the Asian systems
    that have fostered many of our teachers and styles of
    practice. Goenka-ji and Mahasi Sayadaw's disciples emphasize
    a very controlled retreat situation as the primary path.
    Retreat, retreat, retreat. Those teachers have had enormous
    influence and have helped tens of thousands of people, but I
    think that their style has led to this imbalance, the
    unhealthy separation between life and retreat.</p>
    <p>Of course, if you go on retreats for 20 years you can
    create tremendous inner space. But it can become almost like
    a police state. You just clear the streets of all the unruly
    inhabitants of your mind. And while you may get them off the
    streets, the guerrillas will still be active underground. So
    when you leave the retreat, you begin to experience your
    ordinary life as difficult and turbulent. Then you can't wait
    to get to the next retreat. I am speaking very generally
    here, and maybe exaggerating a bit, but I think I am
    describing a pattern that many of your readers will
    recognize.</p>
    <p><em><strong>IM:</strong></em><em> In contrast, Ajahn Chah
    and teachers in the Thai forest tradition did not emphasize
    retreats so much, and placed equal importance on community
    and daily life.</em></p>
    <p><strong>AA:</strong> Ajahn Chah would have us do periods
    of intensive practice, but we would still go out on alms
    round in the morning and there would always be work to do
    around the monastery. So even the times of intensive, formal
    practice were not so separated from life or so completely
    free of stimulus.</p>
    <p>When you focus on creating a clear, subjective, interior
    space, then your life is built around trying to be in that
    space with as few distractions as possible. That space then
    becomes a counterpoint to the external world. Even though we
    might have great brightness of mind or experiences of
    selflessness within that space, those states exist in
    counterpoint to our family, our society, and the entire
    phenomenal and physical world. We are losing half the
    picture. Furthermore, our peace and happiness becomes
    completely dependent on conditions.</p>
    <p>I have recently been addressing this issue through the
    story of the Buddha's enlightenment. During the course of the
    night, as the story goes, the Buddha-to-be made his vow not
    to get up from his seat until he was completely enlightened.
    The Lord of Illusion, Mara, tried to disturb his meditation
    with fearful and sensual images but was unsuccessful. By the
    end of the night, the Buddha's realization into truth was
    complete, but although he was fully awakened the armies of
    Mara were still around him.</p>
    <p>Then Mara asked him, &quot;What right do you think you
    have to claim enlightenment?&quot; The Buddha then reached
    down and touched the earth, invoking the Earth Mother who
    appeared and said, &quot;This is my true son and he has done
    everything necessary to claim complete and full
    enlightenment. He is the supremely awakened one.&quot; Then
    from her hair she produced a great flood of water which
    washed away the armies of Mara, who eventually returned
    carrying flowers and other offerings.</p>
    <p>I think the story is saying that if our liberation is
    simply a subjective, mental, interior experience then we are
    only half-cooked. Wisdom has to reach out into the world.
    Even the Buddha has to make that gesture of humility and ask
    the earth for her blessing. In order for the armies of Mara
    to really be dispelled, we have to open our eyes and step out
    of that blissful interior space. For liberation to be
    finalized we have to touch the earth.</p>
    <p><em><strong>IM:</strong></em><em> What prompted you to
    become a Buddhist monk?</em></p>
    <p><strong>AA:</strong> When I first visited Ajahn Cha's
    monastery in Thailand, I found a group of Westerners like
    myself, with very similar backgrounds, who were living in the
    forest doing Buddhist meditation practice. And they all
    seemed remarkably cheerful.</p>
    <p>When they explained their way of life and the basis of
    their practice, it made perfect sense to me. Previously I had
    assumed that freedom came from having no rules and no
    boundaries. I'd never really questioned that premise, even
    though trying to live that way had been painful and
    difficult. These monks suggested that I look for freedom
    where it could actually be found. They pointed out that the
    material world is filled with limits, and you don't look for
    that which is boundless in the place where you find
    limitation. They explained that by living a life which is
    disciplined, simple, and harmless one could discover the true
    freedom that lies within us. Upon hearing their words, my
    immediate reaction was, &quot;How could I have been so
    stupid?&quot; I felt simultaneously embarrassed and relieved.</p>
    <p><em><strong>IM:</strong></em><em> Did the monk's life live
    up to your initial expectations?</em></p>
    <p><strong>AA:</strong> Absolutely. Even though the last
    thing I would have planned for myself was a lifetime of
    celibacy and renunciation, what I discovered was a new
    delight in simplicity and the deep satisfaction that comes
    from not actively seeking satisfaction. It is a strange but
    sweet irony that in the monastery I find the very delight
    that I was so rabidly searching for outside the monastery. It
    just looks like I've given up everything, but actually, the
    inner experience is one of great delight. In fact, this
    monk's life is a feast! When I was first ordained I used to
    think, &quot;I don't deserve this,&quot; or &quot;I'm not
    going to get away with this for very long.&quot;</p>
    <p><em><strong>IM:</strong></em><em> Are there any particular
    difficulties that you encounter as a Buddhist monk in the
    West? How do you feel walking around in robes in this
    culture?</em></p>
    <p><strong>AA:</strong> For me it has always seemed like the
    most normal thing in the world. I think, to a degree, we all
    feel like outsiders in life. We all feel slightly different
    from other people in one way or another, and being dressed
    like a Buddhist monk in the West is just another form of
    being different.</p>
    <p>Besides, even though we are Buddhist monks and nuns, we
    are only alien when we are outside the monastery. Inside the
    monastery it is normal to have a shaved head and wear brown
    robes. The women have shaved heads and the men wear skirts.</p>
    <p>Living as part of a Buddhist monastic community makes all
    the difference, whether you are in the West or the East.
    Ajahn Chah always emphasized the Sangha, the community, as a
    method of practice in and of itself. It wasn't a matter of
    living with a bunch of other people just in order to do
    meditation practice. The life of the community of monks and
    nuns was itself a method of practice and a method of
    liberation. Although Ajahn Chah did teach individual
    meditation techniques, over and over again he stressed the
    importance of community. I think that is one of the reasons
    why our monasteries have succeeded in the West.</p>
    <p>Also, when you live in a community, then the monastic
    traditions make a lot of sense. They work and they work well.
    We aren't just trying to sustain some archaic Asian system as
    a curio or a formality. The life of renunciation -- living on
    alms, wearing the same robes as everyone else -- and all of
    the rules are methods whereby we train ourselves. Through
    those forms the heart can be liberated.</p>
    <p><em><strong>IM:</strong></em><em> Most Westerners don't
    seem to be very attracted to community as a path. Perhaps one
    reason is because that path clashes with our cultural belief
    in the primacy of the individual, the importance of going it
    alone.</em></p>
    <p><strong>AA:</strong> I would agree. Community life is
    about setting aside my own desires for the sake of the group.
    It's <em><strong>self</strong></em>-sacrifice. To the
    individualist, that sounds like death. But the training in
    communality is, for many Westerners, a blessed shift in
    perspective. Because what makes us suffer most of all in life
    is having &quot;me&quot; at the center of it all. Our society
    supports and validates that attitude, which has led to deep
    feelings of alienation and insecurity.</p>
    <p>When we learn how to surrender our own urges and biases,
    we are not inherently giving up our freedom or denigrating
    our individuality. Being able to listen and to yield to other
    people is a way of recognizing our relationship with them and
    our interdependence with all the life of the planet. As we
    let go of our selfish demands we begin to recognize the
    vastness of our true nature. That dynamic is extremely
    important in the full development of spiritual life.</p>
    <p><em><strong>IM:</strong></em><em> Do you feel there are
    significant differences between being a monk in Europe or
    America and being a monk in Asia?</em></p>
    <p><strong>AA:</strong> One of the great blessings of
    Buddhist monasticism in the West is that it becomes free of
    the formalism, ritualism, and cultural accretions of Asia. In
    many ways, it is much easier for Westerners to get to the
    essence of the teachings. Even our Asian teachers have
    remarked on this. They say, &quot;You are really lucky. We
    have all this cultural baggage that we have to work through
    with our students.&quot; Westerners don't know anything about
    the &quot;ism&quot; of Buddhism before we start our studying
    and training.</p>
    <p><em><strong>IM:</strong></em><em> On the other hand,
    Western monks and nuns don't get as much support from the lay
    population as their Asian brothers and sisters.</em></p>
    <p><strong>AA:</strong> Yes, and that respect and support is
    very sweet. When I go to Thailand, I get treated like a
    visiting dignitary. In the West we still have to earn our
    respect. I've had people say to me, &quot;What do you do for
    a living? What do you contribute to the Gross National
    Product?&quot;</p>
    <p><em><strong>IM:</strong></em><em> You should just tell
    them you are working on the Subtle National Product.</em></p>
    <p><strong>AA: </strong>I respond by asking them what makes a
    nation healthy? Does it depend on how many sacks of wheat it
    exports or how many tons of steel it sells? Or does the
    health of a nation include the well-being of individuals, and
    furthermore, is that well-being only dependent on their
    physical health and comfort, or does it also involve their
    peace of mind? I try to expand the definition of national
    well-being.</p>
    <p><em><strong>IM:</strong></em><em> What are the hardest
    monastic rules to keep when you are living in Western
    culture?</em></p>
    <p><strong>AA:</strong> It is different for different people,
    I think, but for many of us the hardest rules are those
    around celibacy, maintaining a kind of evenness in our
    relationships with other people. And it's not just about
    refraining from sexual intercourse. Ordinary human affection
    and friendliness can easily lead to a flow of emotion that
    suggests something more intimate. While there is nothing
    wrong with that flow between human beings, when you have
    taken vows of celibacy, then that suggestiveness or
    flirtation is in violation of your commitment.</p>
    <p><em><strong>IM:</strong></em><em> What about
    entertainments? Do you miss listening to music?</em></p>
    <p><strong>AA:</strong> Not much, although I used to be a big
    music fan and listened to it all the time. Now that I don't
    deliberately listen to it, I find that when I do happen to
    hear music, it's as if I'm hearing it for the first time.
    Music used to be such a constant presence in my life that it
    had lost its power. If I hear it now, it has an astonishing
    quality of freshness. I am with every note, every phrase.</p>
    <p>When we adopt the renunciate life we aren't condemning the
    world of the senses, per se, because that leads to aversion
    and negativity. Instead we are learning to accept whatever is
    offered to us with full appreciation. Whatever arrives is
    received and cherished, but we don't try to add anything. I
    think many people listen to music because they love the place
    that the music takes them to, which is the present moment.
    You are not thinking about anything else; you are
    experiencing the harmony, balance, and rhythm that the music
    suggests. But all of those qualities are present in a
    meditative mind. If we need music in order to get us there,
    then when there isn't music (or delicious food or beautiful
    surroundings or whatever it might be), we are likely to feel
    bereft. We immediately start to look for another experience
    that will take us to that place of beauty.</p>
    <p>What the precepts do is to shut the door on all our
    habitual sources of satisfaction so that our entire attention
    is directed inward. That is where we discover a beauty and
    clarity, and a vastness of being which is unshakable,
    independent of circumstances and conditions. Then when we
    hear a piece of music, or see a beautiful blue sky or the
    fine shape of a tree, that's an extra.</p>
    <p>Believe it or not, I became a monk because I am a hedonist
    at heart. The fun began when I became a monk. I am not trying
    to be flip by saying this. For me at least, being a monk is
    the way I can most enjoy my life, and I do mean en-joy. My
    life is en-joyed, filled with joy as an ongoing experience.</p>
    <p><em><strong>IM:</strong></em><em> Everybody is going to
    want to ordain after they read this interview!</em></p>
    <p><strong>AA:</strong> That's fine. But remember that the
    joy only comes after the self-surrender and sacrifice. I
    think a a culture, we are afraid of sacrifice. We feel that
    we must own and accumulate things in order to be complete,
    and not just material objects but people and relationships as
    well. It is hard for us to understand that letting go is not
    a loss, not a bereavement. Of course, when we lose something
    that is beautiful or dear to us, there is a shadow that
    crosses the heart. But we enlighten that shadow with the
    understanding that the feeling of loss is just the karmic
    result of assuming that we owned anything in the first place.
    The renunciate life is based on the realization that we can
    never really possess anything.</p>
