<div align=center><p><font COLOR="#0000FF"><font SIZE=+1>ORIGINS AND TEACHINGS</font></font></p></div>

<p>In the year 563 B.C., on the border of modern day Nepal and India, a
prince was born to a ruler of a minor kingdom, the Sakyan. His name was
Siddhartha Gotama and, at the age of thirty five, he attained, after six
years of struggle and through his own insight, full enlightenment or Buddhahood.
The term 'Buddha' is not a name for a god or an incarnation of a god, despite
Hindu claims to the contrary, but is a title for one who has realised through
good conduct, mental cultivation and wisdom the cause of life's vicissitudes
and the way to overcome them. Buddhism is, perhaps, unique amongst the
world's religions in that it does not place reliance for salvation on some
external power, such as a god or even a Buddha, but places the responsibility
for life's frustrations squarely on the individual. The Buddha said:</p>

<blockquote>
<i><b>By oneself, indeed, is evil done;<br>
By oneself is one defiled.<br>
By oneself is evil left undone;<br>
By oneself, indeed, is one purified.<br>
Purity and impurity depend on oneself.<br>
No one purifies another</b></i>. (1.)
</blockquote>

<p>His teaching can be summarised as:</p>

<blockquote>
<b><i>Not to do any evil,<br>
To cultivate good,<br>
To purify one's mind,<br>
This is the Teaching of the Buddhas.</i></b> (2.)
</blockquote>

<div align=center><p><font COLOR="#0000FF"><font SIZE=+1>THE SPREAD OF

BUDDHISM</font></font></p></div>

<p>Today, Buddhism is almost extinct in India, the land of its birth. It
fell victim to the Arab (Muslim) invaders, led by Muhammad Kasim, in 712
A.D.</p>

<p>'His soldiers slaughtered a large number of 'samanis' (sramanas) who
'shaved their heads and beards'.---- Toward the end of the 8th century
the Arabs swooped down upon the prosperous monasteries of Gujarat and destroyed
the Buddhist University at Valabhi on the sea coast.' (3.)</p>

<p>However, during the reign, in India, of Asoka (273 - 276 B.C.) Buddhism
spread outside India to Sri Lanka and, possibly, Burma (Myanmar)*. It was
later adopted by Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. These countries constitute
the stronghold of the Theravada or the orthodox school of Buddhism. Another
major school, the Mahayana or reformed school, which had its roots in India
in the fifth century B.C. spread to China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam, during
the early centuries of the current era. An offspring of the Mahayana school,
the Vajrayana or Tantric school took root in Tibet in the seventh century
and later spread to Mongolia, parts of China and currently has pockets
of followers in Korea (Chingak and Chongji sects) and Japan (Shingon sect).</p>



<p>*' <i>According to the tradition preserved in the Ceylonese Chronicles,
two Buddhist Monks, named Sona and Uttara, were sent by Emporer Asoka to
preach Buddhism in Suvarna-bhumi, which is generally identified with Burma.
There is, however, no reliable evidence to show that Sona and Uttara were
actually sent as missionaries by Asoka, and the location of Suvarna-bhumi
is also not beyond dispute. For, while some identify it with Burma, others
place it in Siam or take it to denote, broadly the whole of Indo-China.
Barring the story of Uttara and Sona there is no other evidence that Buddhism
flourished in Burma before the fifth century A.D.' </i>(4.)</p>

<div align=center><p><font COLOR="#0000FF"><font SIZE=+1>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
THE MAJOR SCHOOLS</font></font></p></div>

<p>The essential teachings of the Buddha are accepted as pivotal to all
schools of Buddhism, however, they differ mainly on the emphasis that they
place on certain aspects of the teaching and in their interpretation of
the rules (Vinaya) governing the conduct of the clergy (Sangha). The Theravada
school claims to adhere strictly to the original teachings of the Buddha
as contained in the Pali cannon (scriptures) and it emphasises the goal
of personal salvation (Arahant ideal) for the individual follower. The
Sangha of the Theravada is expected to observe to the letter the 227 rules
laid down in the Vinaya, which includes eating only prior to midday and
refraining from handling money. Four of these 227 rules, if broken, entail
expulsion of the transgressor from the monastic order. They are: killing
a human being, sexual intercourse, stealing and falsely claiming supernormal
powers. </p>

<p>The Mahayana school is less rigid in its interpretation of the Teachings
and emphasises the importance of the follower's becoming a Buddha for the
salvation of all living beings (Bodhisattva ideal). The Sangha observes
strict vegetarianism (unlike the Theravada where vegetarianism is optional)
but eat in the evening. This change of eating rules became necessary when
the Teaching spread to colder climates. The post-midday meals are regarded
as medicine. The rule prohibiting the handling of money has been seen by
the Mahayana Sangha as impractical in today's world, and it has been reinterpreted
as not amassing wealth, whilst a transgression of the celibacy rule entails
only demotion in some sects of the Mahayana. Other Mahayana sects, notably
in Korea and Japan, admit married priests. </p>

<p>The Vajrayana school is essentially the same in its interpretation of
the Teachings as the Mahayana but it stresses the importance of the K Iacceptance
of a personal Guru (teacher) who initiates his followers into the, so-called,
secret teachings (Tantra). Neither the Theravada nor the mainstream Mahayana
schools accept that there are such things as 'secret teachings' in Buddhism.
The Gelugpa sect of the Vajrayana is the only Tibetan sect that insists
on the celibacy of its clergy.</p>


<div align=center><p><font COLOR="#0000FF"><font SIZE=+1>BUDDHISM COMES
TO AUSTRALIA</font></font></p></div>

<p>Apart from the traditional Koorie (Aboriginal) religion, which has existed
on Australian soil for at least 40,000 years, it is suggested, by some
anthropologists, that Buddhism may have been the earliest non-indigenous
religion to reach our shores. Between 1405 and 1433, the Chinese Ming Emporers
sent an armada of sixty two large ships under the command of Cheng Ho,
to explore the south. Evidence exists that several ships of this armada
landed on the Aru islands, 480 kilometres north of Arnhem Land, but whether
they set foot on the mainland is not confirmed. Professor A.P.Elkin seems
convinced that certain Koorie practices such as the belief in reincarnation,
psychic phenomena and mental cultivation can only be explained in the light
of early contacts with the Orient. Unfortunately, no hard evidence exists
to support his hypothesis.(5.)</p>

<p>In 1882, a ship called the &quot;Devonshire&quot; arrived in Mackay,
Queensland, where two hundred and seventy five Sri Lankans were landed.
Two days later, another two hundred and twenty five Sri Lankans disembarked
at Burnett, to be met by an angry group of 'Anti-Coolie Leaguers' who pelted
stones at them. This violence was met with retaliation by the Sri Lankans
who drew knives to protect themselves. This racist encounter later came
to be known as the 'Battle of Burnett'.(6.) A certain Bastion Appo is recorded
as having sworn an oath on a 'Buddhist Bible' when bringing assault charges
against an Australian in a Mackay Court in 1885. This 'Buddhist Bible'
is thought to have been a Buddhist textbook which the Sri Lankans had brought
with them. (7.)</p>

<p>During the 1890's, almost five hundred Sri Lankans, mainly pearlers,
settled on Thursday Island and established the first Buddhist temple in
Australia. It is thought to have occupied the site where the post office
now stands. All that remains to remind us of this Buddhist community are
two Bodhi trees (Ficus religiosa) descendents of the original tree under
which the Buddha sat, when he attained Enlightenment, more than 2,500 years
ago. Despite his minor flirtation with Buddhism, it was Alfred Deakin who
introduced the Immigration Restriction Bill in 1901 which was the forerunner
of the notorious White Australia Policy. (8.) This heralded the decline
of Buddhism in Australia for the next fifty years. </p>

<p>It was not until the early 1950's, inspired by the visit of the American
born Buddhist nun, Dhammadinna, that the Buddhist Society of New South
Wales was formed under the Presidency of Leo Berkeley, a Dutch born Sydney
businessman. This society is the oldest Buddhist organisation extant in
Australia. Its membership was and still is comprised mainly of people of
Anglo-European ethnic background. </p>

<p>In November, 1960, a lineage holder in the Chinese Cha'an (Zen) sect
arrived in Sydney, where he stayed until the end of 1971. He was the famous
master Hsuan Hua. (9.) He gained the impression that there were no Buddhists
among the local Chinese community as he was largely ignored and, was, at
one stage, on the verge of starvation due to the lack of support. At the
end of 1961, he left for California, where, with the support of his many
followers he established a monastic centre known as the 'City of Ten Thousand
Buddhas'.</p>

<p>It was not until the 1970's and 1980's that true ethnic Buddhism made
its appearance and became firmly established in New South Wales.</p>

COMMUNITIES OF NEW SOUTH WALES</font></font></p></div>

<p><font COLOR="#8000FF"><font SIZE=+1>The Burmese</font></font></p>

<p>In 1987, Sydney's small Burmese community rented a cottage at North
Parramatta to serve as a temporary Buddhist Vihara (monk's residence and
place of worship) as the first step towards establishing a permanent Burmese
temple in the Sydney area. The Abbot, Venerable Sayadaw U Zagarabhivamsa,
took up residence there in January, 1988. He is a highly respected teacher
and scholar, being formerly a professor at Nalanda Buddhist Institute in
India. In 1989, larger premises were purchased by the Burmese Buddhist
Society at Merrylands, also in the Parramatta district from where it currently
conducts its activities. Many of the local Burmese community are middle
class professionals, some of Chinese ethnic background, who were expelled
by Ne Win during one of his purges of non-ethnic Burmese.</p>

<p><font COLOR="#8000FF"><font SIZE=+1>The Chinese</font></font></p>

<p>On January 23rd, 1972, Eric Liao, a Chinese businessman, formed the
Chinese Buddhist Society of Australia. Initially, he invited Venerable
Somaloka to conduct services in a garage adjacent to his home. With the
assistance of Bill Jong, another businessman, he acquired more central
and suitable premises in Dixon Street, in Sydney's Chinatown district.
This newly established temple in Dixon Street was later named &quot;Prajna
Temple&quot;. A tragic fire destroyed the premises on November 14th, 1985.
All that remained after the fire was the statues of Sakyamuni Buddha, Kwan
Yin Bodhisattva, Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva and approximately one thousand
books, including the Tripitaka (Buddhist cannonical literature). The abbot
of the temple, Venerable Sik Chee Ming, and his supporters later re-established
the temple at Hornsby, a northern Sydney suburb. In 1989, premises in Dixon
Street, vacated by the Chinese See Yup Society, were acquired and the central
Chinese community, again, has a place of worship. </p>

<p>The form of Mahayana Buddhism followed by most Chinese and, indeed,
the Vietnamese, is a fusion of Cha'an (Zen) and Pure Land (Messianic Buddhism).
As Paul Croucher (10) observes:</p>

<p>'<i>The elemental Chinese religion is, of course, a kind of nature polytheism,
onto which aspects of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism have been grafted.
The Chinese brought with them a syncretic blend of beliefs and practices
in which the demarcations were ill-defined and the influence of Buddhism
only mild. As in China, those who identified themselves with Buddhism probably
amounted to no more than one per cent of the population. Most were content
to wear 'a Confucian crown, a Taoist robe, and Buddhist sandals', and when
pressed had some difficulty in describing the religion they practised.'</i></p>


<p>Although a small number of the Chinese Buddhist community in Sydney

is very devout, the greater number is quite pragmatic regarding religion

and regard it as solely of use in rites of passage.A monk who eschews non-

Buddhist practices amongst his congregation is Venerable Tsang Hui, who

arrived in Australia from Taiwan in 1977. In 1979, from a rented house

in Redfern, an inner city suburb, he established the Hwa Tsang Monastery.

Being a qualified school teacher as well as a Buddhist monk, he employed

the 'skillful means' of attracting young people to the Monastery by conducting

classes in academic subjects. The monastery later moved to Greenacre, where

regular religious services were conducted and later to a second location

at Homebush, where a new monastery has been built. In addition to conducting

religious observances, the monastery continues to attract many high school

students to its daily classes in Buddhism, chemistry, Chinese language,

English, general science, physics and mathematics. Due to these special

classes, many of the students gained places at Sydney's universities and

have later graduated to the professions. As an outcome of these Buddhist

students attending the universities, joined by overseas students studying

in Australia, university Buddhist societies were formed in the early eighties.

The first student society was the University of New South Wales Buddhist

Society, also known as UNIBUDS, which was founded, in 1981, with Venerable

Tsang Hui's support. It was followed a year later by the formation of the

Sydney University Buddhist Society.The proposed development for the recently

opened Hwa Tsang Monastery at Homebush, in the Strathfield Municipality,

created a furore among some of the older Australian residents of the district.

Although figures are not available for the Strathfield Municipality alone,

the 1986 Commonwealth Census reveals that in the Inner West Region of Sydney,

of which the Strathfield Municipality forms a part, 10,513 residents are

of Asian ethnic background - a not insignificant number. (11) An intensive

letterboxing campaign under the names of H.J.Heath and Marie Heath J.P.

(next door neighbors of Ven.Tsang Hui) stated:</p>



<p><i>If this type of development is allowed in A2 Class residential area

your street may be next, or even the back garden next door. The value of

your home, your most valuable asset will be eroded. What some people or

organisations would like to put in our garden suburb!!! It WAS called &quot;Oasis

in the West&quot; in our Council's Centenary year JUST three years ago!!!

I know that most of us have worked all our adult life to own a place of

our own to relax in, in the evening of our life. Not to be faced with a

fight to maintain our peace and tranquility and protect our landscape and

view, and the sight of native birds feeding in our garden and nestled in

the many trees, that would be affected by this proposed development. Please

act now, you have only until 4 p.m. Friday 19th August, to protest in writing.

You may view the plan and model as suggested in the letter (from the Council),

but your own intelligence will paint in your mind's eye this hideous development

to a back garden landscape. </i>(12)</p>



<p>The Strathfield Municipal Council, noted as one of the most conservative

councils in Sydney, despite receiving 890 individual letters and a petition

contaning 840 signatures supporting the application and a petition, organised

by the Heaths, containing 273 signatures opposing it, unanimously rejected

the Monastery's development application, so an appeal was lodged with the

Land and Environment Court of N.S.W.. Venerable Tsang Hui stressed that

should the Buddhist community accede to the Council's decision without

putting up a fight, the door would be open to all other Councils to reject

development applications for religious premises from the minor religions.

Mr.Justice Cripps of the N.S.W. Land and Environment Court ruled, on June

the first, 1989, in favour of the Monastery's development application.

He stated in his judgement:</p>



<p><i>It became plain that the intensity of the opposition to the subject

development was, in some instances, influenced by the circumstance that

the religious institution was a Buddhist monastery. All residents were

at pains to volunteer that their views were not &quot;racist&quot; and

I accept their assessment of their objections. The question of what does

or does not qualify as &quot;racism&quot; was not explored in the proceedings

but because the word was bandied about during the course of the hearing,

I feel bound to express my opinion that I do not think any objector is

a &quot;racist&quot; just because he or she objects to a Buddhist temple

functioning next door or in the near vicinity. It was stated explicitly

by some and was implicit in the evidence of others that the opposition

would not have been so intense had a comparable Christian establishment

been proposed. By way of illustration, none of the residents seems to be

duly concerned about the activities of the Lutheran church (nearly opposite).</P> 
<P>It is made clear by the evidence,

there is a need for the monastery in the sense that there are many people

who wish to congregate as Buddhists. The subject land is zoned residential

but churches and educational establishments are permissible in residential

areas. There are many churches in residential areas in Sydney, some of

which have functions and undertake activities more intrusive than the subject

proposal. It is, of course, not possible to speculate on the attitude Mr.

and Mrs.Heath will have to the development if it proceeds. I am, however,

confident that most other people who have expressed hostility to the concept

will, with the passage of time, accept the monastery in the same way they

presently accept the Lutheran church. </i>(13.)</p>




<p>Reluctant to accept the umpire's decision, the Heath's formed an organisation

called 'Strathfield Overdevelopment Saviours (S.O.S.)' which enlisted the

support of the local State Member of Parliament, Paul Zammit, who possibly

saw political mileage in siding with racists. He requested the Council

to seek further legal advice in the hope that an appeal could be lodged

against the judgement. In a letter to the Town Clerk, he wrote:</p>



<p><i>I therefore respectfully request Council to urgently call an extra-ordinary

Council meeting to discuss this matter in the hope that a second legal

opinion be obtained with the full knowledge of certain inconsistencies

and possible moral turpitude that have come to light. Should Council decide

to proceed to hold this meeting I strongly urge that S.O.S., on behalf

of the residents, attend this meeting.</i> (14.)</p>



<p>A copy of this letter was circulated to the local residents. When Ven.Tsang

Hui's solicitor queried Zammit regarding his allegation of I'moral turpitude',

he suggested that he suspected that the signatures on the Monastery's petition

were faked. He withdrew this comment after it was suggested that a defamation

action could result unless he did. The Town Clerk wrote to the N.S.W. Minister

for Local Government and Planning, Mr.Hay, requesting that he overturn

the Court's decision. The Minister replied:</p>



<p><i>I have noted the Council's views on the development, however, the

council has presented its case to the Land and Environment Court and I

have no power to overrule decisions of the court. It is therefore inappropriate

for me to meet with the council to discuss the issues. Should the council

wish to pursue the proposal further within the court, it should seek further

legal advice. </i>(15.)</p>



<p>The Council's 'further legal advice' was that there were no grounds

for an appeal. Many councils and citizens of Australia still seem slow

or resistant to accepting the policy of multi- culturalism. This causes

much hurt, not to mention expense, in our new citizens and causes them

to feel that one law applies to old Australians whilst the new have a constant

battle for the acceptance of their lifestyles and culture. </p>



<p>The Hwa Tsang Monastery is not alone in facing trials and tribulations

with Councils and local residents. The Taiwan based Fo Kwang Shan organisation,

is currently constructing a huge multi-million dollar complex on a ten

hectare site at Wollongong, south of Sydney. After a minor battle with

the Wollongong City Council over its increasing the originally agreed price

for the land, (16.) a bitter newspaper debate ensued in the 'Letters to

the Editor' collumn. Fortunately, they had the support of the then Lord

Mayor, Alderman Frank Arkell, who was also the local State Member of Parliament,

so they are currently proceeding with the project which will comprise three

prayer halls, two meditation halls, twenty classrooms, a dining hall for

500 people as well as sleeping quarters. Fo Kwang Shan also maintains centres

in Hong Kong and in Los Angeles. This latter centre was the venue for the

16th Conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists in 1988, the first

time that it was held outside Asia.</p>



<p>Another ethnic Chinese religious group, whose members are mainly refugees

from the Indo-Chinese countries, has constructed a temple at Bonnyrigg,

west of Sydney, which is one of the largest in Australia. This is the Confucianist,

Buddhist cum Taoist lay organisation, the Australian-Chinese Buddhist Society.

Future plans involve the construction of a school for the young and a retirement

village for the elderly. This temple is one of the few serving the Indo-Chinese

community which is completely privately funded.</p>



<p><font COLOR="#8000FF"><font SIZE=+1>The Khmer (Cambodians)</font></font></p>



<p>Resulting from the genocide wrought on the Cambodian people by Pol Pot

and his Khmer Rouge henchmen and the consequent invasion and occupation

of Cambodia by the armed forces of the Peoples Republic of Vietnam, many

refugees fled to the freedom of Thailand. These people, who, under the

fanatical policies of the Khmer Rouge, were forced to labour for sixteen

hours a day with little food, had lost all of their possessions. Many of

their relatives and friends, especially the educated, the professionals

and the monks, had been slaughtered. They looked to the compassionate J

Hcountries of the 'West' for resettlement so that they could resume what

was left of their shattered lives. Australia accepted many of these industrious

people and the various Governments provided some assistance in their resettlement.

Buddhism is central to the lifestyle of the Khmer people and their fondest

wish, after their arrival in Australia was to have a Buddhist monk to minister

to their spiritual and social needs. Due to the genocide, very few monks

survived to satisfy this need. In the mid 1980's, the Venerable Long Sakkhone,

a Cambodian Buddhist monk arrived to take up residence in Sydney. The community

rented a rather run-down cottage in Fairfield, a Western suburb of Sydney,

to serve as a temporary monk's residence and temple. The then Minister

for Housing in the N.S.W. Government, the Hon.Frank Walker, later arranged

for the lease of a tract of land adjacent to a large shopping Plaza at

Bonnyrigg to the Khmer Community of N.S.W. for the purpose of constructing

a community centre and temple. Construction of the first stage of this

Cambodian centre, comprising a community hall, office and amenities block

as well as a monk's residence has already been completed and was officially

opened by the Premier of N.S.W., the Hon.Nick Greiner on Saturday the 10th

of February, 1990. The temple building, itself, being large, complex and

expensive will have to wait for another day. The Khmer community is divided

politically, with some supporting Prince Norodom Sihanouk (FUNCINPEC),

others Son San (KPNLF), whilst a small number support the Vietnamese 'puppet'

government of Hun Sen, however, they are united in their devotion to Theravadin

Buddhism and, irrespective of how poor their circumstances in their new

countryp, they F Dgenerously support the temple and the religion generally.

One would imagine that, in the light of the horrific experiences suffered

by the Khmer community prior to their arrival in Australia, psychosis would

be prevalent. Such is not the case, however. The Khmer people attribute

this to their devotion to the teachings of the Buddha and are thus accepting

of change, sorrow and their karmic circumstances.</p>



<p><font COLOR="#8000FF"><font SIZE=+1>The Koreans</font></font></p>



<p>During the past 600 years, Buddhism has undergone turmoil in Korea.

Cha'an (Zen) Buddhism was introduced from China in 372 A.D. and fused with

the indigeonous Shamanism. (17.) The Choson kings, who ruled from 1392

until Japan annexed Korea in 1910, favoured Neo-Confucianism and ruthlessly

suppressed Buddhism, forcing it out of the cities and towns and confining

the temples to the remote mountains. During the Japanese occupation, Buddhism

again gained favour but the celibate monks were forced to marry. Following

liberation in 1945, the main sect, Chogye, re-instituted celibacy for its

clergy whilst several of the minor sects persisted with married priests.

Following the Korean war, Korea came under American influence and an influx

of Christian missionaries, especially of the aggressive fundamentalist

variety, invaded Korea. What was formerly a Buddhist stronghold, now sees

half of its population following Christianity. The results of this turmultuous

period in Korean history has, to a significant degree, manifested itself

amongst the Korean Buddhist migrants in Australia. Early in the 1980's,

the Korean Dharmakaya Society was formed at Summer Hill, a western suburb

of Sydney. In 1984, a monk, Venerable Jin Sang Sunim, arrived from Korea

and premises were leased at Earlwood to serve as a residence and temporary

temple, known originally as Hong Boep Sa and later renamed Dharma Sa. Venerable

Jin Sang left Australia early in 1985 and was replaced by Venerable Jang

San Sunim, who arrived on the first of April, 1985. An uneasy relationship

developed between the monk and the Committee of the temple. By October,

the dissent had become so untenable that the Venerable Jang San was forced

to leave the temple, together with those members of the congregation who

remained loyal to him. By December, 1985, a new Korean temple, Bul Kwang

Sa, was established at Summer Hill with Venerable Jang San as its Abbot.

His visa expired early in 1986 and he returned to Korea. After returning

to Australia in January, 1988, as a permanent resident, he resumed his

duties of ministry to the spiritual needs of the Korean community at the

Bul Kwang Temple. The Committee of the Korean Dharmakaya Society later

sponsored a Bhikshuni (female monk), Venerable Jung O Sunim, in October,

1986, to take over as resident spiritual teacher. Again, conflict arose

between Jung O Sunim and the temple committee and she was dismissed in

September, 1988. Many of her supporters severed their connection with the

Korean Dharmakaya Society and established yet another temple, Kwan Eum

Sa, at Belmore, an inner Western suburb, with Ven.Jung O Sunim as its presiding

abbot. Yet another Bhikshuni, Venerable Ja Young Sunim, arrived in 1989

to serve the needs of the Korean Dharmakaya Society. The Society has since

vacated its Earlwood premises and established itself at Campsie, Sydney's

main centre of Korean migrants. Meanwhile, trouble arose at the Bul Kwang

Temple at Summer Hill. An assistant monk, Venerable Dok Jong Sunim had

joined Venerable Jang San. The President felt that, as he and the committee

were meeting the expenses of the temple, the monks should confine their

activities to performing ceremonies and all major decisions should be vested

in the committee. The situation became so tense that Venerable Jang San

formed the opinion that the temple was serving more as a Korean social

club, providing a venue for Koreans to meet and discuss issues back home.

He felt that they had no real interest in practising Buddhism so he returned

to Korea in mid 1989, leaving Venerable Dok Jong to conduct the religious

ceremonies. Soon afterwards Venerable Dok Jong Sunim also departed, leaving

the Bul Kwang Temple without any monks to serve the congregation. Many

people in the Korean Buddhist community feel a deep sense of shame over

the turbulent history of Korean Buddhism in Australia. Moves have been

initiated by the new committee of the Dharma Sa Temple (Korean Dharmakaya

Society) to unite the three temples and to resolve the past differences

which have been so damaging to the progress of Korean Buddhism in Australia.

With a spirit of goodwill the Korean community is striving for reconciliation

and, hopefully, they will leave in the past what belongs in the past and

will firmly establish the Korean Buddhist tradition in their new home.

Won Buddhism, a fairly recent evangelical sect from Korea, is currently

establishing itself in Sydney. A nun from this order arrived in 1990. Won

Buddhism is a fusion of Son (Zen) and Confucianism and has, as its object

of worship, a circle, symbolising the Void which 'contains everything and

is perfect' (7), rather than the traditional Buddha Image. Won Buddhism

is celebrating the centenary of the birth of its founder, the Venerable

Master Sotaesan, in 1991. </p>



<p><font COLOR="#8000FF"><font SIZE=+1>The Lao </font></font></p>



<p>Lao society is inseparable from Buddhism - they have been Buddhist for

nearly a thousand years. 95% of the country are rice farmers and rural

life revolved around the village Wat (temple) where the monk acted as teacher,

doctor and spiritual adviser. Throughout the feudal and colonial periods,

the Sangha - the order of monks - remained the main institution in the

country. The monks were held in tremendous esteem as moral and spiritual

arbiters as well as the most learned of the community. (19.)</p>



<p>In 1975, the Pathet Lao defeated the army of the royalist Buddhist monarchy

and many Lao people fled from the communist tyranny across the Thai border.

Many have since settled in Australia. The community divided into two factions

- one supporting the former monarchy and the other, feeling dominated by

the educated middle class, wishing to follow an independent path. In the

mid eighties, the Lao refugees welcomed the arrival of their first monks

to serve the spiritual needs of their community. The Lao Community Advancement

Co-operative, the pro-monarchist group, purchased a two storied premises

at Cabramatta West, known as Wat Prayort Keo Dhammananaram, to serve as

a temporary residence for their monks and a meeting place for religious

observances. They were later granted, by the N.S.W. Government, the lease

on some land at Bonnyrigg for the purpose of, eventually, establishing

a temple and community centre. The Foundation Stone Laying Ceremony was

held on Sunday, 20th of August, 1989 and construction is scheduled to commence

early in 1990. For many years the independent Lao Association of N.S.W.,

rented premises on the Hume Highway at Cabramatta as a temple and residence

for their Abbot, Ven.Thongsoun Phantha-Oudom and their monks. The temple,

known as Wat Buddhalavarn later became independent from the Lao Association

and the Abbot was appointed as President. Early in 1988, a cottage was

purchased to serve as a temporary Vihara (residence and temple) until land

for a temple could be acquired. Moves were made in 1988 to unite the two

Lao temples but, although the monks from both temples strongly supported

it, suspicions about the motives for the merger still lingered amongst

the laity, especially those from Wat Buddhalavarn, and such a conjunction

now seems more remote than ever. The occasional combined ceremonies, that

occured before the attempted merger, have now completely ceased.</p>

<p>June, 1985 saw the arrival of Venerable Mahinda, who had a long association

with both the Buddhist Missionary Society (B.M.S.) in Kuala Lumpur and

the Singapore Buddhist Mission, on a one month missionary lecture tour

of the eastern States of Australia. Whilst here, he realised the fertile

ground ready for cultivating the Dhamma (the Buddha's teaching). An application

was lodged, prior to his return to Malaysia, for his permanent residence

visa. This was granted and he returned in July, 1986. </p>




<p>He was appointed Bikkhu (monk) in Charge of the Hock Cheng See Buddhist

Vihara at Ambarvale, a suburb of Campbelltown, south of Sydney. This Vihara

had previously been purchased by some monks from Malacca, Malaysia and

the trustees had invited Ven.Mahinda to use it as his residence. It was

in August, 1986, that Venerable Mahinda suggested that an Australian Buddhist

Mission could be set up on similar lines to the B.M.S. and the Singapore

Buddhist Mission. During its formative years the Mission has organised

several meditation retreats, Buddhist Youth Camps with participants from

several ethnic groups including Australian born, Burmese, Cambodian, Malaysians,

Sri Lankans and Vietnamese. The aim of the camps was not only to plant

the seeds of Dhamma so that future Bodhi trees might grow but to promote

mutual understanding and friendship among the diverse groups who make up

our multi-cultural Australian community. In 1989, the Mission sponsored

the two year visit to Australia of Ven.Acharn Yantra, a famous Thai meditation

master and, in 1990, is sponsoring the visit of a senior Sri Lankan monk

to minister to Sydney's small Sri Lankan community. The Mission's main

aim is to complement rather than to duplicate the activities already being

so ably performed by the other Buddhist organisations.</p>

<p>On the 9th of May, 1971, Venerable Ratmalane Somaloka, a Sri Lankan

born monk, arrived in Sydney to become the first permanent resident member

of the Buddhist Sangha in Australia. He ministered mainly to Buddhists

of European ethnic origin. In May, 1973, the Australian Buddhist Vihara

was opened at Katoomba, in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. This was

the first Buddhist temple in New South Wales and the culmination of a dream

of Venerable Somaloka and his devotees. Despite the optimism which greeted

the founding of Australia's first Buddhist Vihara, since then, all has

not been a bed of roses. A sign on the gate of the Vihara, &quot;Private

Property&quot;, is a significant indicator of its policies. Despite the

Sri Lankan origins of Venerable Somaloka, the local Sri Lankan Buddhist

community was discouraged from visiting the Vihara. It was only after the

arrival of Venerable Pemananda, another monk from Sri Lanka, who was invited

to assist in the activities of the Vihara, that the Sri Lankan community

was granted limited access. The Bhikkhu (monk) who followed Ven.Pemananda's

stay, Ven.Suganananda, was most unimpressed with the exclusiveness of the

Vihara's policies and threatened to leave unless visitors were granted

freer access. Some Blue Mountain's residents who wished to study the Dhamma

(the Buddha's teachings) and to practice meditation claim that they were

actively discouraged from attending the Vihara. As the result of an alleged

breach of a major Vinaya rule by Somaloka, many of the original supporters

have since withdrawn from its activities. Currently, the majority of Sri

Lankan Buddhists, who follow the Theravadin school, attend the Thai temple

or the Australian Buddhist Mission. </p>

<p>In 1975, a magnificent Victorian house, now known as Wat Buddharangsee,

was purchased in the inner city suburb of Stanmore. The opening ceremony,

on Vesak Day, 25th of May, 1975, was performed by His Royal Highness, Crown

Prince Vajiralongkorn, in the presence of His Highness Ven.Somdet Phra

Nyanasamvara, the Buddhist Patriarch and ten visiting Bhikkhus (monks)

from Thailand. Although Wat Buddharangsee is essentially a Thai monastery,

Ven.Phra Khru Sukumaphirak, the abbot, has ensured that it serve the needs

of the Lao, Khmer, Malaysian and Sri Lankan communities as well as a significant

group of Anglo- Europeans who regularly attend the nightly meditation sessions.

Wat Buddharangsee has proved to be one of the most popular Buddhist meeting

places, in the true spirit of multiculturalism, in the Sydney area. Such

has been its success, that it has rapidly become too small to adequately

serve its large congregation so, a large tract of land was purchased at

Leumeah, south of Sydney, where a traditional Thai-style forest monastery,

Wat Pa Buddharangsee, was opened in May, 1988. The Stanmore premises has

been retained to serve the needs of the inner city Buddhist community.

<p><font COLOR="#8000FF"><font SIZE=+1>The Tibetans</font></font></p>




<p>Sydney's Tibetan community, numbering less than twenty, must constitute,

perhaps, the smallest of the ethnic groups, yet, Tibetan Buddhist organisations

make up one third of the many Buddhist organisations in Sydney. Tibetan

Buddhism attracts many followers of Anglo-European background. Many of

the local Tibetans were formerly Buddhist monks either in Tibet or in India

following the Chinese occupation so they are often called upon to serve

as teachers or translators for visiting lamas. Many of the Anglo-European

followers have joined with the Tibetan community in protests at the Chinese

genocide and persecution of the Tibetan clergy. The Tibetans are saddened

and disappointed with the Australian Government's neglect of the plight

of their country, prefering not to offend the Beijing regime lest it affect

our trade. They have a strong supporter in the N.S.W. Attorney General,

John Dowd, however, who has often bravely spoken out about the complacency,

of both the Liberal and Labour Parties, about the Tibetan situation.</p>



<p><font COLOR="#8000FF"><font SIZE=+1>The Vietnamese</font></font></p>



<p>At the end of 1979, a group of Vietnamese refugees met at a restaurant

in Glebe, an inner city suburb, and formed the Vietnamese Buddhist Society

of N.S.W. The first religious ceremonies organised by the Society were

held at the Thai temple, Wat Buddharangsee, at Stanmore. Premises at Lakemba,

a western suburb, were later leased by the Society, to serve as a temporary

temple, prior to the arrival of their monk, Venerable Thich Bao Lac. Problems

with the local council and racism from the local residents forced the Society

to seek Government assistance to find a more suitable place and to establish

a more permanent place of worship. Land at Bonnyrigg, an outer western

suburb, was leased to the Society by the Housing Commission of N.S.W..

Today, on this land stands the first, purpose built, Buddhist temple in

metropolitan Sydney, the Phap Bao Temple. A large statue of the Bodhisattva

Kwan Yin forms a dominating landmark at the entrance to the temple. Actually,

the first Vietnamese monk to arrive in Australia was the senior teacher,

Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue, who set foot on our soil in 1980. In 1981,

he formed the Vietnamese Buddhist Federation of Australia, which currently

has branch temples in all Australian States with the exception of Tasmania,

which has very few Vietnamese refugees. At its Biennial Conference in 1987,

the name of the Federation was changed to the United Vietnamese Buddhist

Congregations of Australia. He established the Phuoc Hue Temple in a large

garage at the rear of a cottage in Fairfield, which served as a monk's

residence. Again, racism and the local council's insensitivity to the needs

of the refugee communities, forced the Vietnamese Buddhist Federation to

seek Government assistance in finding a suitable place for a temple to

serve the spiritual needs of Sydney's large Vietnamese Buddhist community.

The then Premier of N.S.W., the Hon.Barrie Unsworth, responded by making

available an unused school premises at Wetherill Park, an outer western

suburb. The foundation stone for the new Phuoc Hue Temple was laid by him

in October, 1987. A splendid temple premises, which will be a major showpiece

of Sydney, is currently under construction on this former school land.

The Vietnamese community is divided politically, hence the two temples.

The Phap Bao Temple was established by Vietnamese who were in Australia,

as students or diplomats prior to the 1975 fall of Saigon. The Phuoc Hue

Temple serves the 'boat people', who view those, who didn't personally

experience Communist oppression, with suspicion. They claim that many of

the people from the Phap Bao Temple are not vigorous enough in their opposition

to the current government in Vietnam. Both F Dtemples support a youth movement

called &quot;The Young Buddhist Family&quot; which is similar to and affiliated

with the Boy Scout Movement.</p>



<p><font COLOR="#8000FF"><font SIZE=+1>The Administrative Structure</font></font></p>



<p>Traditionally, Buddhist temples are autonomous, although, in 1902, Thailand

instituted the Buddhist Order Act, which brought the Sangha under its own

bureaucratic control. Laos and Cambodia followed suit (20). An attempt

was made, in Sydney, in 1988, to institute a Sangha Council as an advisory

and administrative body, but due to the diversity of Buddhist traditions

with differing Sangha rules and few of the monks having a common language,

it became unworkable and was eventually disbanded. As previously mentioned,

the Vietnamese Buddhists in Australia have established the United Vietnamese

Congregations of Australia as an umbrella body. With few exceptions, the

Vietnamese temples in all States of Australia are affiliated with this

body which meets biennialy to elect its council, <b><i>The Buddhist Council of N.S.W.</i></b> was established in 1985 to service the needs

of the local Buddhist organisations. During its relatively short history,

the Council had gained the respect and support, not only of the members

of the Buddhist community, but especially that of both the Commonwealth

and State Governments. The Council provided assistance and advice to the

Buddhist community generally, but the bulk of its work involved support

to the special needs of the ethnic Buddhist communities. Council was the

co-ordinating body for the organisation and resource supply for the teaching

of Dharma to Buddhist students in N.S.W. State Schools. Combined Vesak

celebrations (Buddha's Birthday) were organised each year, bringing together,

in a greater spirit of understanding, the many traditions that comprise

the Sydney Buddhist community. The Council maintained liason with various

Government Departments and acted as a lobby group to promote the rights

and interests of all Buddhists. Although it boasted a membership of twenty

three organisations, at it Annual General Meeting in 1989, it was unable

to gain a quorum and its operations were temporarily suspended, however,

at a well attended meeting called in September, 1990 to consider the future

of the Council, a new committee was elected and a revised constitution

ratified. A feature of the re-established Council is a Sangha Committee

to act as a consultative and advisory body. A national body, the Buddhist

Federation of Australia, was formed in 1952, but it has failed to gain

the support of the majority of Australia's Buddhist organisations, having

only seventeen member organisations in the whole of Australia in 1989.

Its bi-ennial conference, due to be held in January, 1989, had not been

held by the time of writing this paper - nearly two years after its due

date. </p>



<p><font COLOR="#8000FF"><font SIZE=+1>Buddhists and Australian Society</font></font></p>



<p>According to the 1986 Commonwealth Census (21), 80,387 people in Australia,

of whom 35,114 resident in New South Wales, listed their religion as Buddhist.

This showed an a significant increase since 1981 when 35,073 Buddhists

were listed for Australia. As the question pertaining to religion was the

only non-compulsory question on the form, the actual numbers could be considerably

greater. Many ethnic Buddhists believe, quite wrongly, that Australia is

a Christian country and to indicate a deviation from the norm could be

disadvantageous. Although the Christians are numerically the major religious

grouping in Australia and carry the highest profile, Australia is a secular

society and has no state religion. There is also a bias against Buddhists

in the general Australian population as indicated in a recent Government

survey which showed that Buddhists were second only to Muslims as Australia's

least popular religious group. It should be noted that Asians, the majority

of whom are Buddhists, are fairly recent arrivals in, what may be considered,

significant numbers. They have replaced the Greeks, Italians and 'Balts'

as the whipping boys for Australia's ills. McAllister and Moore conclude

that:</p>



<p>There must always be a group that is marginalised, against which frustration

could be vented. This, of course, implies that the removal of one 'out'

group will merely witness its replacement by another group in a continuous

cycle. (21.)</p>



<p>This prejudice has been amply demonstrated earlier in this article by

the problems encountered by the Chinese and Vietnamese Buddhist groups,

especially at local government level.</p>



<p><font COLOR="#8000FF"><font SIZE=+1>Conclusions</font></font></p>



<p>Buddhism is, traditionally, non-proselytising and has always advocated

respect for the teachings and the followers of other faiths, however, it

seems opportune for Buddhists to, at least, inform the Australian public

of the teachings of the Buddha. This would, to some degree, overcome the

suspicion and prejudice and would demonstrate that Buddhists pose no threat

to Australia's cultural values but rather have a significant contribution

to make to its enhancement. Due to the unique meeting of various Buddhist

schools of thought and ethnic traditions in Australia, the Buddhist community,

itself, must become aware of the differences so that a spirit of mutual

respect and co-operation can operate. May I conclude with the words of

the former Premier of New South Wales, Barrie Unsworth, spoken at a State

reception for the Buddhist community in 1987:</p>



<p>Yours is an ancient philosophy that has had a beneficial influence on

the development of the world. As a movement for peace, moderation and tolerance,

you have always been and remain contemporary. That is why you are most

welcome in New South Wales, as fellow citizens and as seekers and teachers

of truth. As followers of his Path, you bring to your new life in New South

Wales that same spirit of tolerance, gentleness and kindness that has continued

through more than two and a half thousand years of your culture. That spirit

is entirely complementary to the path of multiculturalism that I see as

the future of this State.</p>
