        the previous talk I spoke of emptiness as being an important subject but
        the occasion didn't permit me to give it the special attention necessary
        for a thorough understanding. So, as some aspects of this subject of
        emptiness remain obscure, today I have come to talk about it especially.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Emptiness is the most difficult to
        understand of all the Buddhist Teachings because it is their innermost
        heart. Being called a heart it must obviously be something subtle and
        profound. Its understanding does not lie within the scope of mere
        conjecture or the sort of pondering that ordinary people are accustomed
        to. It can only be understood by determined study.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most essential meaning of the word
        'study' is of the unceasing, dedicated observation and investigation of
        whatever arises in the mind, be it pleasant or unpleasant. Only one
        familiar with observation of mind, can really understand Dhamma. One who
        merely reads books cannot understand and what's more, may even go
        astray. But one who tries to observe things going on in the mind and
        always takes that which is true in his or her mind as a standard has no
        way to get muddled. Such a person will be able to comprehend Dukkha and
        the cessation of Dukkha and ultimately will understand Dhamma. Then if
        books are read they will be understood well.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the moment of birth to the time of
        death we must train ourselves in this way, examining the contact of the
        mind with objects that surround it and the nature of the results of that
        contact, for in the natural process there will inevitably be both
        pleasure and pain and observing them will make the mind wiser and more
        resilient. To keep observing that nature of our thoughts generates a
        mind emptied of Dukkha, and so is the very best knowledge there is.
        Through it we gain familiarity with the realization or awareness of
        emptiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our spiritual disease is not a disease
        of the brain or nervous system but is an illness affecting
        truth-discerning awareness (<i>satipanna</i>), that which knows our life
        and the world as they truly are. So it refers to Ignorance or the wrong
        understanding that springs from ignorance and causes the wrong actions
        that lead to Dukkha, even if physically and mentally we are quite
        healthy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we are suffering from Spiritual
        Disease with what must we treat it? We must treat it with emptiness.
        What's more, emptiness (<i>sunnata</i>) is not only the cure for the
        disease but is also freedom from the disease. There is nothing beyond
        emptiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The medicine which cures the disease is
        the knowledge and practice that gives birth to emptiness. When emptiness
        has appeared it will be the sure of the disease and after the recovery
        from the disease there will be nothing save emptiness, the state void of
        Dukkha and void of the mental defilements that are the cause of Dukkha.
        This emptiness, which has that wide breadth of meaning, is
        self-existent: nothing can touch it, develop it or improve it, or do
        anything to it. Thus it is a timeless state for it knows neither birth
        nor death. Its 'being' is not the same as the being of things which are
        born and die but since we have no other word to use, we say that it has
        being characterized by immutable emptiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If anyone realizes, that is to say if
        anyone's mind realizes this thing, then it will be the medicine that
        cures the disease, a state timelessly empty. It is true health.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Please keep trying to grasp the meaning
        of this word, or sunnata as it is in Pali, as I explain it point by
        point.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Firstly, consider the point that the
        Buddha declared that every word that he, the Tathagata, (one who is gone
        to Suchness), spoke referred to the subject of emptiness. He spoke of no
        other matter, either directly or indirectly. Any talk unconnected with
        the subject of emptiness is not the speech of the Tathagata but of
        disciples of a later time who liked to speak at great length to show how
        clever and articulate they were.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One can, if one wants to, add much more,
        for example: That emptiness is the absence of self or what belongs to a
        self for the word emptiness has a whole host of applications. Although
        the characteristic of emptiness remains constant, its expressions are
        innumerable. That being so, we will aim to examine emptiness only as the
        absence of Dukkha and the defilements that are the cause of Dukkha and
        as the absence of the feeling that there is a self or that there are
        things which are the possessions of a self. This is emptiness as it
        relates to our practice of Dhamma.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we enquire which of the Buddha's
        utterances dealing with this matter can be taken as authoritative
        statements we fill find in many places the Buddha taught us to know how
        to look on the world as being empty, as in the phrase &quot;Sunnato
        lokam avekkhassu mogharaja sada sato&quot; which means &quot;You should
        look on the world as being empty&quot;. If you can be always aware of
        the emptiness of the world, death will not find you.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">These words of the Buddha enjoining us
        to see the world as being empty show that it is the highest thing.
        Anyone who wants to be without problems concerning Dukkha and death,
        should look on the world, i.e. on all things, as they truly are, namely
        as empty, neither &quot;I&quot; nor &quot;mine&quot;. The statements of
        the Buddha that follow on from this show the benefits: 'Nibbana paranam
        sunnam' and 'Nibbanam paramam sukham', which translate as 'Nibbana is
        the supreme emptiness' and 'Nibbana is the supreme happiness'. You must
        understand that Nibbana, the remainderless extinction of Dukkha, means
        the same as supreme emptiness, and that it is possible to know and
        realize an emptiness that is not supreme, an emptiness that is in some
        way deficient or false. The truth-discerning awareness must be so
        impeccably clear that one has not the slightest feeling of
        &quot;self&quot; or &quot;belonging to a self&quot; for it to be called
        paramam sunnam, supreme emptiness. Supreme emptiness is Nibbana because
        it completely extinguishes the things that are on fire, the stream or
        whirlpool of flowing and changing phenomena. Thus the supreme emptiness
        and the supreme extinction are one and the same thing.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;These words of the Buddha
        enjoining us to see the world as being empty show that it is the highest
        thing. Anyone who wants to be without problems concerning Dukkha and
        death, should look on the world, i.e. on all things, as they truly are,
        namely as empty, neither &quot;I&quot; nor &quot;mine&quot;. The
        statements of the Buddha that follow on from this show the benefits:
        'Nibbana paranam sunnam' and 'Nibbanam paramam sukham', which translate
        as 'Nibbana is the supreme emptiness' and 'Nibbana is the supreme
        happiness'. You must understand that Nibbana, the remainderless
        extinction of Dukkha, means the same as supreme emptiness, and that it
        is possible to know and realize an emptiness that is not supreme, an
        emptiness that is in some way deficient or false. The truth-discerning

        the stream or whirlpool of flowing and changing phenomena. Thus the
        supreme emptiness and the supreme extinction are one and the same thing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for the saying that Nibbana is the
        supreme happiness, it is an expression in the language of relative
        truth, a sort of enticing propaganda in the language of the common man
        used because in general people are infatuated with happiness, they want
        nothing else. So it is necessary to tell them that Nibbana is happiness
        and what's more, is the supreme happiness. But truly speaking Nibbana is
        greater than happiness, beyond it. It is emptiness. It can't be said to
        be either happiness or suffering because it lies beyond both the
        suffering and the happiness known by the common man. But when one speaks
        like this, people don’t understand, and so it is said instead, in the
        language of the worldly, that it is ultimate happiness. This being so,
        when using the word happiness you must be careful to use it in its
        proper sense. It is not the happiness that people generally see or
        aspire to. It is a different sort of happiness, it is the state empty of
        every single thing that proliferates, flows and changes. Thus it is
        truly lovely, truly refreshing and truly desirable. For if there is
        still flowing and changing, a constant swaying and rocking, how can
        there be happiness?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the feelings of pleasure arising
        from contact with the various sense-objects are illusory, they are not
        ultimate happiness. The happiness of the common man is not the supreme
        happiness of Nibbana that is emptiness. So in hearing the phrase
        'Nibbana is the supreme happiness', don't go jumping to the conclusion
        that Nibbana is exactly what you are looking for and start dreaming
        about it without taking into consideration that it is also the supreme
        emptiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The saying of the Buddha which deals
        with the practice in regards to emptiness is the one that is the heart
        of the Buddhist Teachings; 'Sabbe dhamma nalam abhinivesaya' which
        translates literally as 'No dhamma whatsoever should be grasped at or
        clung to'. If one amplifies the meaning a little it may be rendered as
        'no one should grasp or cling to anything as being I or mine'. 'No one'
        means that there are no exceptions; 'should grasp or cling' means to
        give rise to ego-consciousness; 'as being I' refers to the feeling
        called ahamkara, the grasping at a (nonexistent) soul or abiding
        ego-entity; 'as being mine' refers to the feeling called mamamkara, the
        grasping as phenomena as being connected to ego. So don't have ahamkara
        or mamamkara with regard to anything at all starting from a worthless
        speck of dust up to valuable objects such as diamonds, sapphires, gems
        and the objects of sensual desire and on to things higher than that -
        Dhamma, it's theory, practice and attainment, the Path-Realization,
        their Fruits and Nibbana. Nothing whatsoever should be clung to as being
        &quot;I&quot; or &quot;mine&quot;. This is the heart of the Buddhist
        Teachings and was affirmed to be so by the Buddha himself.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So don't have ahamkara or mamamkara with
        regard to anything at all starting from a worthless speck of dust up to
        valuable objects such as diamonds, sapphires, gems and the objects of
        sensual desire and on to things higher than that - Dhamma, it's theory,
        practice and attainment, the Path-Realization, their Fruits and Nibbana.
        Nothing whatsoever should be clung to as being &quot;I&quot; or
        &quot;mine&quot;. This is the heart of the Buddhist Teachings and was
        affirmed to be so by the Buddha himself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">He said that to have heard the phrase
        'sabbe dhamma nalam abhinivesaya' is to have heard every phrase of the
        Teachings, to have put it into practice is to have done every practice;
        and to have reaped the fruits of that practice is to have reaped every
        fruit of the Buddhist Teachings. So we don't have to be afraid that
        there is too much to understand. The Buddha made the comparison that the
        things he had realized were as many as all the leaves in the forest but
        those which he had brought out to teach were a single handful. The
        'single handful' he was referring to was this principle of not grasping
        at or clinging to anything as self or as belonging to a self.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To have heard this phrase is to have
        heard every phrase because all subjects are condensed within it. Of all
        the things that the Buddha taught there wasn't one that didn't deal with
        Dukkha and the elimination of Dukkha. Grasping and clinging are the
        cause of Dukkha. When there is grasping and clinging there is suffering.
        The practice is to make the non-arising of grasping and clinging final
        and permanent, so that the mind is unceasingly empty. Just that is
        enough. There is nothing else to do.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">'This practice is every practice'. Try
        to think if there's anything that remains to be practiced. At any moment
        that any person, whether it's Mr. Smith or Mrs. Jones or anyone at all,
        has a mind that is free of grasping and clinging, what will there be
        present in their minds? Please think it over. We can take it step by
        step from the Triple Refuge to virtuous conduct, samadhi and the
        discernment of truth, on to the Path Realizations, their Fruits and
        Nibbana. At that moment they have reached the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
        Sangha for to have a heart free of the mental defilements and Dukkha is
        to be one with the heart of the Triple Gem. They have reached them
        without having to shout out 'Buddham saranam gacchami' or any of the
        rest of it. Crying out 'Buddham saranam gacchami' and so on is just a
        ritual ceremony of entrance and is an external matter; it doesn't
        penetrate to the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha in the heart. If at any
        moment any person at all has a mind empty of grasping at and clinging to
        'I' and 'mine', even if it is only for an instant, it means that the
        mind has realized emptiness. It is pure, radiant and at peace. It is one
        and the same thing as the heart of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
        Sangha. Thus at any moment that one has a mind empty in this way one has
        taken refuge, one has reached the Triple Gem.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If at any moment any person at all has a
        mind empty of grasping at and clinging to 'I' and 'mine', even if it is
        only for an instant, it means that the mind has realized emptiness. It
        is pure, radiant and at peace. It is one and the same thing as the heart
        of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. Thus at any moment that one
        has a mind empty in this way one has taken refuge, one has reached the
        Triple Gem.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To move onto giving dana (alms) and
        making donations. The meaning of giving dana and donations is to
        relinquish, to end all grasping at and clinging to things as being 'I'
        or 'mine'. As for giving in order to receive a much greater reward, such
        as a tiny amount and asking for a mansion up in heaven, that's not
        giving, it's just a business deal. Giving must be without strings
        attached, a casting off of things that we grasp at and cling to as being
        'I' and 'mine'. At the moment that one has a mind empty of
        ego-consciousness then one has made the supreme offering, for when even
        the self has been given up, what can there be left? When the 'I-feeling'
        has come to an end then the 'mine-feeling' will vanish by itself. Thus
        at any moment that a person has a mind truly empty of self, when even
        the self has been completely relinquished, he or she has developed
        giving to its perfection.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To move onto Sila (Virtuous Conduct),
        one who has an empty mind, free of grasping at and clinging to a
        (non-existent) self, is one whose bodily and verbal actions are truly
        and perfectly virtuous. Any other sort of sila is just an up and down
        affair. We make resolutions to refrain from this and abstain from that
        and then we can't keep them. It's an up and down affair because we don't
        know how to let go of self and the possessions of self right from the
        start. There being no freedom from self there can be no real sila, or if
        there is, it is inconsistent. It is not ariyakantasila, the virtuous
        conduct that is of contentment to the Noble Ones, it is worldy sila,
        continually up and down. It can never become transcendental <i>sila</i>.
        Whenever the mind is empty, even if it is only for a moment, or if it's
        for a day or a night or however long, for that length of time one has
        true sila.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for samadhi, an empty mind is the
        supreme samadhi, the supremely focused firmness of mind. The straining
        and striving sort of samadhi isn't the real thing and the <i>samadhi </i>that
        aims at anything other than non-clinging to the five khandas is <i>micchasamadhi</i>
        (wrong or perverted <i>samadhi</i>). You should be aware that there is
        both <i>micchasamadhi </i>and <i>sammasamadhi</i> (right and correct <i>samadhi</i>).
        Only the mind that is empty of grasping at and clinging to 'I' and
        'mine' can have the true and perfect stability of <i>sammasamadhi.</i>
        One who has an empty mind has correct <i>samadhi</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here we reach <i>panna</i> (the
        discernment of truth). It is clearly indicated that knowing or realizing
        emptiness, or being emptiness itself is the supreme panna because at the
        moment the mind is empty it is supremely keen and discerning. In
        contrast, when delusion and ignorance enter and envelope the mind
        causing grasping at and clinging to things as self or possessions of
        self then there is the supreme foolishness. If you think it over you
        will easily see for yourself quite clearly that when these things have
        left the mind there can be no foolishness. When the mind is empty of
        foolishness, empty of 'I' and 'mine', there is perfect knowing or panna.
        So the wise say that emptiness and panna, the discernment of truth (or
        satipanna-truth-discerning awareness) are one. It's not that they are
        two similar things, they are one and the same thing. True or perfect
        panna is emptiness, absence of the foolish clinging of delusion. Once
        the mind is rid of delusion it discovers it's primal state, the true
        original mind which is panna or truth-discerning awareness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The word &quot;mind&quot; (<i>citta</i>)
        is being used here in a specific way. Don't confuse it with the 89
        cittas or 121 cittas of the <i>Abhidhamma</i>. They are a different
        matter. That which we call original mind, the mind that is one with
        panna refers to the mind that is empty of grasping at and clinging to
        self. Actually, this state shouldn't be called mind at all, it should be
        called emptiness, but since it has the property of knowing we call it
        mind. The various schools call it by various names but strictly speaking
        it's enough to say that the true fundamental nature of mind is
        satipanna, truth-discerning awareness, absence of grasping and clinging.
        Thus emptiness lies in perfect <i>panna</i>.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If at any moment any person at all has a
        mind empty of grasping at and clinging to 'I' and 'mine', even if it is
        only for an instant, it means that the mind has realized emptiness. It
        is pure, radiant and at peace. It is one and the same thing as the heart
        of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. Thus at any moment that one
        has a mind empty in this way one has taken refuge, one has reached the
        Triple Gem.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now we are going on to the Path
        Realizations, their Fruits and Nibbana. Here the progressively higher
        levels of emptiness reach their culmination in Nibbana, which is called
        paramasunnata or paramam sunnama -supreme emptiness. So now you may see
        that right from taking refuge onto dana, sila, samadhi and panna there
        is nothing other than emptiness, non-clinging to self. Even the Path
        Realizations, their Fruits and Nibbana itself do not exceed emptiness,
        but are its highest, supreme level.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consequently, the Buddha declared that
        having heard this teaching is to have heard all the teachings, to have
        put it into practice is to have done all the practices, and to have
        reaped the fruits of that practice is to have reaped all fruits. The
        meaning of the word &quot;emptiness&quot; is an essential point that you
        must try to keep in mind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now let us consider that all things are
        included in the word '<i>dhamma</i>'. '<i>Dhamma'</i> means 'thing', <i>sabbe
        dhamma</i> means 'all things'. You must be clear when you use the term
        'all things' as to what it signifies. 'All things' must refer to
        absolutely everything without exception, whether worldly or spiritual,
        material or mental. Even if there was something outside of these
        categories it would still be included in the term 'all things' and would
        still be a dhamma. So I would like you all to observe that:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The worlds of material objects i.e. all
        realms of material objects are dhammas. The mind that is aware of all
        worlds is a dhamma. If the mind and the world come into contact, that
        contact is a dhamma. Any result of that contact whether it be feelings
        of love, hate, dislike or fear or <i>satipanna</i>, the clear seeing of
        things as they truly are, these are all dhammas. Right or wrong, good or
        bad, they are al dhammas. If <i>satipanna</i>, gives rise to various
        interior knowledge’s, those knowledge’s are dhammas. If those
        knowledge’s lead to the practice of sila, samadhi and panna or any
        other type of practice, that practice is a dhamma. The results of
        practice, abbreviated as the Path Realizations, their Fruits and
        Nibbana, even these are dhammas.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To sum up, all things are dhammas.
        'Dhamma' encompasses everything from the truly peripheral, the world of
        material objects, up to the results of Dhamma practice, the Path
        Realizations, their Fruits and Nibbana. Seeing each of these things
        clearly is called seeing 'all things' and regarding all things the
        Buddha taught that none whatsoever should be grasped at or clung to.
        This body cannot be grasped at or clung to. Even more so the mind; it is
        even a greater illusion. Thus the Buddha said that if one is determined
        to cling to something as self, it would be better to cling to body
        because it changes more slowly. It is not as deceptive as the mind, that
        which we call <i>namadhamma</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Mind&quot; here does not refer to the
        mind previously spoken of as being one and the same thing as emptiness,
        but to mentality, the mind known by ordinary people. The contact between
        the mind and the world results in various feelings of love, hate, anger
        and so on. These are dhammas which are even less to be grasped at or
        clung to than the dhammas of form because they are illusions, born of an
        illusion rising in the realm of defilements. Grasping and clinging to
        them is extremely dangerous.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught that even
        truth-discerning awareness should not be grasped at or clung to because
        it is merely a part of Nature. Attaching to it will give rise to fresh
        delusion; there will be a person who has truth-discerning awareness,
        there will be MY truth discerning awareness. Due to this attachment the
        mind will be weighed down with grasping and clinging, and lurch about in
        accordance with the changes that these things undergo; then there will
        be Dukkha. Knowledge should be looked upon as simply knowledge. If one
        deludedly grasps at or clings to it, it will give rise to the various
        kinds of 'Attachments to Rites and Rituals' (<i>samyojanna</i>) and one
        will experience Dukkha without realizing why.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Practicing Dhamma is similar -its just
        practice. It is a truth of nature that results always arise in
        proportion to the practice done. If one grasps at or clings to it as
        being 'I' or 'mine' then one falls into more error, creates another
        spurious self, and experiences Dukkha no differently than if one were
        clinging to something as gross as sexual desire.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Reaching the Path Realizations, their
        Fruits and Nibbana; They are dhammas, parts of nature that are
        'such-as-they-are'. Even emptiness is part of nature. If one grasps at
        it or clings to it then it is a false Nibbana, a false emptiness because
        Nibbana, true emptiness, is ungraspable. Thus it may be said that on
        grasping at Nibbana or emptiness one deviates from it immediately.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">All these examples demonstrate that
        there is absolutely nothing at all apart from dhammas.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The word &quot;<i>dhamma&quot;</i>
        signifies <i>nature</i>. This interpretation is in line with the
        etymology of the word, for the word dhamma means 'a thing which
        maintains itself'. Dhammas are divided into two categories -those which
        flow and change and those that do not. Those that flow and change due to
        some generative force maintain their existence within that flow and
        change i.e. they are the stream of transformation itself. That which
        being devoid of the necessary causal factors does not flow and change is
        Nibbana or emptiness. It is able to maintain itself without change i.e.
        it is the state of changelessness itself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the sort of dhamma which undergoes
        transformation and the sort that doesn't are both merely dhammas, things
        which maintain themselves in certain states. So there is nothing more
        than nature, nothing more than the elements of nature, and how can mere
        dhammas be 'I' or 'mine'? In this context, 'dhammas' means nature, the
        natural, or in other words, dhammas are tathata, they are as they are,
        they can't be any other way. There are only dhammas. 'All things' are
        nothing but dhammas; there are no dhammas apart from 'all things'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">True Dhamma, no matter what part, topic,
        level or kind must be one with emptiness, completely void of self.
        Therefore we must look for emptiness in all things, or as we call them
        for short, dhammas. To speak in terms of logic:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">all things = dhamma<br>
          all things = emptiness<br>
          dhammas = emptiness</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It can be put a number of ways, but the
        important point to understand is that there is nothing apart from our
        empty nature. Nothing whatsoever should be grasped at or clung to as
        being 'I' or 'mine'. So from this it can be clearly seen that emptiness
        is the nature of things. It is only by ending every kind of delusion
        that it can be discerned. To see emptiness there must be panna that is
        undeluded and undefiled.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a further category of dhammas -
        the dhammas of avijja, of false knowing, reactions arising from the
        contact of the mind with the world of materiality. As was said earlier,
        when the dhamma which is mind comes into contact with the dhamma which
        is materiality, a reaction takes place in the form of feeling. In
        regards to that feeling one may follow either the path of avijja or of
        vijja (clear knowing). Its form will depend in the external conditions
        and the nature of that group of sankharas (dhammas). Thus it's just
        another dhamma, a dhamma of ignorance, the grasping and clinging to an
        illusory self and to things as belonging to self. Don't forget that it's
        just a dhamma. it's true essence is emptiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Avijja is emptiness just as much as are
        vikka or Nibbana -they are all equally dhammas. If we look on them this
        way we will see their emptiness of self continually. Dhammas of this
        level, even though they are one and the same thing as emptiness may
        still result in avijja, may still cause the illusion of self to arise in
        consciousness. So we should be aware of the dhammas of grasping and
        clinging and ignorance, which are also included in the phrase 'all
        things'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we really know all things, this
        ignorant grasping and clinging won't take place. If we don't know them
        and just blindly follow our stupid and deluded animal instincts, it
        opens the doors to the dhammas of avijja over and over again.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We who have grasping and clinging like
        an inheritance that has been passed down for an immeasurable time may
        see that from the moment of our birth we received training from those
        around us, some intentional and some unintentional, solely in the ways
        of ignorance, solely in the ways of grasping at self and the belongings
        of self. Never once have we trained in the ways of selflessness.
        Children receive that sort of training. They are taught only in terms of
        self. Originally, at birth a child's mind doesn't have much sense of
        self, but it learns it from it's environment. As soon as it open's it's
        eyes or is conscious of anything, it is taught to cling to it as my
        father, my home, my food, and even the dish it eats from is MINE, no one
        else can use it. This unplanned process, the arising of
        ego-consciousness and its continual development and growth, follows it's
        own laws. As for the contrary feeling of selflessness, it never arises.
        Thus by the time the child has grown up and aged he is stuffed full of
        grasping and clinging and the mental defilements which are their cause,
        so that for him or her, ego is life, life is ego. When the instinct to
        clinging to self is ordinary life, that life is inseparable from Dukkha;
        it is heavy and oppressive, entangling, constricting, smothering,
        piercing and burning, all symptoms of Dukkha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the instinct of clinging to self is
        ordinary life, that life is inseparable from Dukkha; it is heavy and
        oppressive, entangling, constricting, smothering, piercing and burning,
        all symptoms of Dukkha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it follows that if there is grasping
        and clinging, even if it's to goodness, then that is Dukkha. In this
        sense that which is the world assumes to be goodness is false or evil.
        Goodness is still Dukkha, it has the Dukkha appropriate to it, because
        it's not empty, it's disturbed. Only when there is emptiness and one is
        beyond goodness can there be freedom from Dukkha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore the main principle of the
        Buddhist Teachings, as elucidated in the phrase <i>'sabbe dhamma nalam
        abhinivesaya'</i> is nothing other than the complete elimination of the
        grasping at or clinging to things as being self or as belonging to self.
        There is nothing beyond that.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we are completely identified with
        grasping, when we and grasping are truly just one thing, what can we do?
        Who can help the mind when it is in such a state? The answer to this
        question is again nothing else but mind. It's already been stated that
        there is nothing other than dhammas: falseness is a dhamma, correctness
        is a dhamma, Dukkha is a dhamma, the extinguishing of Dukkha, the tool
        to remedy Dukkha is a dhamma, the mind is a dhamma and the body is a
        dhamma. Therefore, there being nothing other than dhammas, the answer
        must lie in the mind itself, depending on a mechanism compatible to it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whether there is merit or demerit is up
        to us. If contact with the world leads to truth-discerning awareness
        then it is merit (punna). If contact with the world leads to an increase
        in foolishness and delusion than it's demerit (papa).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we observe, we can see that everyone
        is born equal -each and everyone of us have eyes, ears, a nose, a
        tongue, a body and mind and outside each one of us there are forms,
        sounds, smells, tastes, tactile and mental objects: everyone of us has
        the opportunity to contact those things and we all contact them in
        exactly the same way. So why is there this division between those who
        follow the path of foolishness, of demerit and harm, and those who
        follow the path of wisdom, of merit and benefit?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a good side to it in the sense
        that these harmful dhammas are a real protection for people, on the
        principle that if we experience suffering we become chastened, we
        remember it. It's like the child who tries to take hold of the fire.
        Once it has seen the consequences it is unlikely to do it again. With
        material things it is easy, but as for taking hold of the fire that is
        grasping and clinging, the fires of greed, aversion and delusion, most
        of us aren't even aware that we're taking hold of the fire at all. On
        the contrary, we misguidedly believe them to be loveable and desirable
        and so we are not chastened, we don't learn our lesson.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's only one remedy and that is to
        be aware of the true nature of these dhammas, to know that THESE DHAMMAS
        ARE A FIRE, THAT THEY CANNOT BE GRASPED OR CLUNG TO. This is to be on
        the path of truth-discerning awareness, learning one's lesson,
        remembering that whenever anything is grasped at as &quot;I&quot; or
        &quot;mine&quot;, fire is ignited. It is not a fire that burns the hand,
        but a fire that consumes the mind and heart. Sometimes it burns so deep
        that we aren't even aware that it's a fire at all or that it is burning,
        and so we sink into the fiery mass that is <i>Vattasamsara </i>(the
        round of birth and death). It is the very hottest fire there is, hotter
        than an electric oven. If we don't look on things like a child who has
        tried to take hold of fire and refuses to do so again, it can be like
        that.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the Buddha explained that when the
        painful consequences of grasping and clinging are seen, the mind will
        relax its grip. So the question is, have we seen the painful
        consequences of grasping yet? If we haven't, then we haven't relaxed our
        grip, then we are not empty. On another occasion, the Buddha taught that
        whenever one sees emptiness, then one finds contentment in Nibbana. Only
        when one begins to see the non-existence of self will mind learn to find
        contentment in the ayatana of Nibbana. Anything which can be known
        through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body or mind is called an ayatana.
        Nibbana is called ayatana here because it is merely an object of
        knowledge. How can we be so foolish as not to see it? We will be able to
        know it from the moment that we see the state empty of self, because on
        the relaxation of grasping and clinging we will be content with the
        ayatana of Nibbana. But it's difficult, for as I've said, our life is
        one of constant grasping and clinging and when there is no abatement of
        that grasping there is no emptiness and so no contentment with the
        ayatana of Nibbana.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can see the truth of this point by
        taking a look at other religions. Other religions do not have the word
        attavadupadana (grasping and clinging to dhammas as being 'I' or
        'mine'). Why is this so? It is because they teach a self to be grasped
        at and clung to. Not regarding such grasping as wrong it becomes right,
        in fact it becomes the goal of the religion or sect. They teach the
        attainment of Self. In the Buddhist Teachings however, attavadupadana is
        specified as a defilement, as foolishness and delusion, and the Buddhist
        practice lies in complete relinquishment. Consequently the teaching of
        anatta is found only in Buddhism. Unlike the sects which teach a self to
        be grasped at or to be attained, we teach the complete destruction of
        self-consciousness so as to perceive the state of anatta, the state
        empty of self in all things.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So anatta is talked about only by
        Buddhists. Knowledge and understanding can arise only in those people
        who have been taught that all things are anatta and should not be
        grasped at or clung to. If one is taught that there is a self that must
        be grasped at and clung to, then there is no way that one can practice
        to realize the non-existence of self.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus we must examine the point that just
        as it is necessary to see the danger of fire in order to be afraid of
        being burnt, so also must we see the dangers of those things which are
        the root-causes of all fires, the fires of greed, aversion and delusion,
        of grasping and clinging, in order to become gradually bored with and
        averse to them, and be able to relax our grip on them without thought of
        lighting any more fires.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here we reach the word 'emptiness' of
        which it was said that having seen it one will find contentment in
        Nibbana, We must thoroughly understand that on the first level of
        emptiness is absence of the feeling of 'I' and 'mine'. If those feelings
        are still present then the mind is not empty, it is 'disturbed' by
        grasping and clinging. We will use these two words to help our memories:
        'empty' meaning free of the feeling of self or that things belong to a
        self; and 'disturbed' meaning confused, depressed, in turmoil with
        feeling 'I' and 'mine'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What are the characteristics of the
        state empty of ego-consciousness? In the scriptures there is a teaching
        of the Buddha which lists four points:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <i>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">Na aham kavacini</font></i><font face="Times New Roman">
          - feeling that there is nothing that is me. <i>Na kassaci kincanam
          kisminci</i> - without worry or doubt that anything might be me. This
          makes one pair, the second pair is: <i>Na mama kavacini</i> - feeling
          that there is nothing that is 'mine'. <i>Kisminci kincanam natthi</i>
          - without worry or doubt that anything might be 'mine', (Anenjasappaya
          Sutta, Majjhima Nikaya)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We are aware that there is nothing that
        is 'me' but sometimes there is a remainder of anxiety that there is
        something that is 'mine'. We feel there is nothing that is mine but we
        can't help doubting that there may in fact be something. There must be
        an absolute, unshakably clear awareness that there is nothing that is
        self and nothing that we need to worry about as possibly being self;
        there is nothing that belongs to self and nothing we need to keep
        worrying about or doubting or waiting for as being ours.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the moment that anyone's mind is
        freed from these four things the Buddha held that to be emptiness. The
        commentary sums it up concisely as <i>'ne attanena'</i> - not taking
        things to be self and <i>'na attaniyena'</i> - not taking things to
        belong to self, and that is sufficient. Try to imagine what it would be
        like for grasping consciousness not to be present. One doesn't look on
        anything anywhere as ever having been, as currently being, or as having
        the potential to be a self or belong to a self. There is no self in the
        present and no basis for anxiety regarding self in the past or future.
        The mind has realized emptiness through seeing clearly that there is
        nothing at all that can fulfill the meaning of the words 'self' or
        'belonging to self.' All things are dhammas, simply parts of nature.
        This is the mind that is identical with emptiness. If we say that the
        mind has attained or realized emptiness it leads some people to
        understand that the mind is one thing and emptiness another. To say that
        the mind comes to know emptiness is still not particularly correct.
        Please understand that if the mind was not ONE AND THE SAME THING AS
        EMPTINESS there would be no way for emptiness to be known. THE MIND IN
        ITS NATURAL STATE IS EMPTINESS, it is an alien foolishness that enters
        and obstructs the vision of emptiness. Consequently, as soon as
        foolishness departs, the mind and emptiness are one. The mind then knows
        itself. It doesn't have to go anywhere else knowing objects, it holds to
        the knowing of emptiness, knowing nothing other than the freedom from
        'self' and 'belonging to self'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is this emptiness that is the single
        highest teaching of the Buddha, so much so that in the Samyutta Nikaya
        the Buddha says that there are no words spoken by the Tathagata that are
        not concerned with sunnata. He says in that sutta that the most profound
        teaching is that which deals with emptiness, any other subject is
        superficial. Only the teaching of sunnata is so profound that there must
        be a Tathagata enlightened in the world for it to be taught.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In another section of the Samyutta
        Nikaya the Buddha says that emptiness is the dhamma that is always of
        the most benefit and support to lay people. There is the account, one
        that I have related many times in other places, of a group of wealthy
        laypeople going to visit the Buddha and asking for dhamma that would be
        of eternal benefit to householders, those hampered by wife, husband and
        children, wearers of sandlewood paste and perfumes. In reply the Buddha
        taught them this sutta, taught about <i>sunnata</i>. When they objected
        that it was too difficult he came down only to the level of <i>Sotapattiyamka</i>
        - the practice leading to stream-entry (entry to the stream that flows
        to Nibbana, attainment of the first stage of holiness) i.e. the genuine
        realization of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, and of ariyakantasila -the
        virtuous conduct that is of contentment to the Noble Ones. In fact they
        were being lured into a trap by the Buddha and were neatly caught in the
        snare. To speak in coarse every day terms he completely swindled them.
        They said they didn't want sunnata so the Buddha gave them instead
        something which could not escape it, the lasso that would pull them into
        it. For there is only one way to truly realize the Buddha, Dhamma and
        Sangha and to have the virtuous conduct that is of contentment to the
        Noble Ones, and that is to be continually seeing the futility of
        grasping and clinging.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now do you think the Buddha was wrong in
        saying that sunnata is a matter for lay people? If He was right, then
        these days we must be crazy, utterly wrong, because we believe that
        sunnata is not a matter for us householders, but is a matter for those
        who are going to Nibbana, wherever that is. That's how people talk. But
        the Buddha is talking in a different way, saying that this subject of
        sunnata is of direct benefit and welfare to lay people. So who is right
        and who is wrong? If the Buddha is right then we must agree to
        investigate the truth of His words and the way to do so is to examine
        which people have the most suffering and distress, whose minds are most
        in the middle of the blast furnace. It's none other than lay people.
        That being so, who most needs something to extinguish that fire, to
        completely destroy Dukkha in every aspect? Again, it is lay people.
        Those that are in the heat of the fire must look for the means of
        extinguishing it here in its midst, because there is no place to
        struggle and escape to, everything is fire. Thus one must find the point
        of absolute coolness right here in the midst of the fire. That point is
        emptiness, the absence of self and belongings of self, sunnata.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lay people must try to discover sunnata
        and dwell within its sphere. If one is unable to live right at its
        central point, at the very least one should dwell within its sphere,
        have a reasonable knowledge of it. This then is counted to be of eternal
        benefit to laypeople.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This group of people asked what would be
        of eternal benefit to them and the Buddha answered:
        'sunnatappatisamyutta lokuttara dhamma' - dhammas endowed with sunnata
        transcend the world. To transcend the world is to transcend the fire. To
        be endowed with <i>sunnata </i>is to be empty of clinging to things as
        self or as belonging to self. So the saying <i>sunnatappatisamyutta
        lokuttara dhamma</i> is a gift from the Buddha directly to laypeople.
        Please consider anew how necessary it is that one gives attention to
        this subject and whether it is in fact the only subject that needs to be
        spoken of. In the <i>Samyutta Nikaya</i> it is clearly affirmed that
        sunnata is Nibbana and that Nibbana is <i>sunnata</i>, the freedom from
        defilements and Dukkha. Therefore Nibbana, too, is a fit subject for
        laypeople. If laypeople still don't know the meaning of Nibbana, if they
        have not yet dwelt within its sphere, then they live in the midst of the
        fire more than any other group.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The meaning of the word Nibbana clearly
        extends to the absence of mental defilements, the causes of Dukkha. So
        that any moment that our minds are empty of 'self' and 'belonging to
        self' then that is Nibbana. For example, at this moment as you sit here
        I will attest that everyone, or almost everyone, has a mind empty of the
        feelings of 'I' and 'mine' because there is nothing engendering them. In
        listening attentively you give no opportunity for self-consciousness to
        arise. So look and see whether or not the mind is empty of 'I' and
        'mine'. If there is some emptiness (and I merely use the word some, it's
        not completely or unchangeably empty) then you are dwelling within the
        sphere of Nibbana. Even though it is not absolute or perfect Nibbana, it
        is Nibbana just the same.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhammas are of many meanings, levels and
        stages. The <i>Nibbana-dhamma</i> lies in the mind of each one of you at
        the moment that you are to some degree empty of the feeling of 'I' and
        'mine'. So please be aware of this ego-less feeling, remember it well
        and keep it with you when you return to your home. Sometimes when you
        have arrived at home it will feel like you have entered someone else's
        house, or doing some work at home you will feel like you are helping out
        with someone else's work, at someone else's home. This sort of feeling
        will increase more and more and the Dukkha that used to be associated
        with home and work will be no more. You will abide with a mind empty of
        'self' and 'belonging to a self' at all times. This is to take Nibbana
        or <i>sunnata</i> as the holy charm constantly hanging from our neck. It
        is a protection against every kind of suffering, danger and ill-fortune.
        It is the genuine holy charm of the Buddha, anything else is just a
        fake.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Speaking to you like this you will soon
        be accusing me of giving you a big sales pitch. Don't think of me as
        someone hawking the wares of the Buddha in the marketplace, think rather
        that we are all companions in Dukkha, in birth, old age, sickness and
        death and that we are all disciples of the Buddha. If anything is spoken
        to stimulate interest it is with good intentions. But if anyone has any
        truth-discerning awareness they will be able to see for themselves
        without having to believe me, and that seeing will more and more open
        the way for further study towards the ultimate truth. If that is the
        case, then we must move out study onto the subject of <i>dhatu</i>
        (elements).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The word dhatu has the same meaning as
        the word <i>'dhamma'</i>. Etymologically the words have the same root <i>'dhr'</i>,
        which means 'maintain'. A dhatu is something that can maintain itself.
        Just as with dhammas, changing dhatus maintain themselves through change
        and unchanging dhatus maintain themselves through changelessness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What sort of elements do you know that
        could correlate to emptiness? Students of physics and chemistry know
        only about the material elements, the pure elements of which there are
        over a hundred, and more being discovered all the time. It's impossible
        for these elements to be emptiness, or at least it would take a profound
        interpretation of those things to see them as empty, because they are
        merely material elements or rupadhatu. But there are immaterial
        elements, arupadhatu, elements of mind or consciousness, which lie
        beyond the domain of physics and chemistry. One must study the Buddha's
        science before one can know the immaterial, formless elements, which are
        a matter of mind and heart. So far then we have ascertained two groups
        of elements.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In which element will that which is
        called emptiness abide? If anyone thinks that emptiness is a material
        element his friends will die laughing. Some people think that it is an
        immaterial or formless element and here the Noble Ones will die
        laughing. Emptiness is neither a material nor immaterial element. There
        is a third kind of element which lies beyond the ken of ordinary people.
        The Buddha called it <i>'nirodhadhatu'</i>. The words vatthudhatu or
        rupadhatu refer to materiality whether visible forms, sounds, odors,
        tastes, tactile objects or whatever. <i>Arupadhathu</i> refers to the
        mind and heart, to mental processes, the thoughts and feelings that
        arise in the mind. There is only one kind of element not included in
        these two categories, an element that is their complete antithesis and
        annihilation. Consequently the Buddha sometimes called it '<i>nibbanadhatu'</i>
        sometimes <i>'nirodhadhatu'</i> and sometimes <i>'amatadhatu'</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The words nirodhadhatu and nibbanadhatu
        both mean extinguish, it is the extinguishing element, the element that
        extinguishes all other elements. <i>Amatadhatu</i> means the 'element
        that does not die'. All other elements die, it is their nature to die. <i>Nirodhadhatu</i>
        is not tied to birth and death but is, on the contrary, the utter
        extinction of the other elements. <i>Sunnata </i>is that which dwells in
        this element and so it might be called <i>sunnatadhatu</i>, for it is
        the element that brings all elements to emptiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one is to understand those things
        called dhatu well enough to understand the Dhamma they must be studied
        in this way. Don't be deceived into thinking that knowing the elements
        of earth, water, wind and fire is sufficient, they are a matter for
        children. Those elements were spoken of and taught before the time of
        the Buddha. One must go on to know <i>vinnanadhatu</i>, the immaterial
        consciousness-element, <i>akasadhatu</i>, the space element and <i>sunnatadhatu</i>,
        the emptiness element that is the utter extinction of earth, water,
        fire, wind, consciousness and space. The element of emptiness is the
        most wonderful element in all the Buddhist teachings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To sum up: earth, water, wind and fire
        lie in the group of <i>rupadhatu</i>. The mind, consciousness and mental
        process lie in the group of <i>arupadhatu</i>. As for Nibbana, this <i>sunnatadhatu</i>,
        it lies in the group of <i>nirodhadhatu.</i> You must find a quiet time
        to sit and look at all of the elements and see clearly that there are
        only these three kinds. Then you will begin to discover Nibbana-dhatu
        and understand more of that anatta or sunnata that we are presently
        addressing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we may lay down the principle that in
        the grasping at and clinging to 'I' and 'mine' there is rupadhatu and
        arupadhatu and in their absence there is nirodhadhatu. To reverse it one
        may say that if nirodhadhatu enters the mind one sees only emptiness,
        the state free of 'I' and 'mine' manifests itself clearly. If another
        element enters one will see it as form, name, visible object, sound,
        smell, taste, tactile object, feeling, memory, thought, consciousness
        and so on, the whole confusing crowd, each one having a part to play in
        the arising of clinging, if not as love then as hate.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus we all have just two dominant moods
        -satisfaction and dissatisfaction. We are accustomed to only these two.
        We have only been interested in gaining that which is felt to be
        desirable and to flee or destroy that which is felt to be disagreeable.
        It is unceasing disturbance, the mind is never empty. For the mind to be
        empty we must go beyond, overcome all the disturbing elements and come
        to dwell in the element of emptiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another way that the Buddha talked about
        elements in order to show their properties was to make a threefold
        division. He spoke first of nekkhamadhatu (the element of renunciation)
        as the cause for the withdrawal from sensuality; secondly of arupadhatu
        as the cause for the withdrawal from materiality and thirdly of
        nirodhadhatu as the cause for the withdrawal from the conditioned.
        Seeing nekkhamadhatu, the element of renunciation, is the cause for the
        withdrawal from sensuality because it is the antithesis. Seeing the
        element that is the antithesis of sensuality is called seeing
        nekkhamadhatu. Being unconsumed by the fire of sensuality is
        nekkhamadhatu. The mind that withdraws from sensuality is a mind that
        contains nekkhamadhatu.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Beings that are able to free themselves
        from sensuality attach to the beautiful and pleasurable things that are
        unconnected with gross sensuality but are still in the realm of form,
        albeit on a refined level, as for example, rishis, munis and yogis who
        get attached to the pleasures of rupajhana (absorptions of the
        Fine-Material Sphere). Or on a more mundane level perhaps we see old
        people attached to antiques or exquisite potted plants. Although these
        things are unconnected with the crudest sensuality, such people may be
        even more lost than those lost in sensuality, they are attached to
        material form and unable to give it up.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So what else will one get attached to if
        one can free oneself of the attachment to materiality? One will attached
        to causally conditioned things that lie beyond it, i.e. all the
        beneficial dhammas. We don't have to talk of the harmful dhammas here,
        nobody wants them, but of the virtuous and virtuous actions that one
        projects will earn one a rebirth as a wonderful being up in heaven.
        People dream about this endlessly. But being born in heaven is sankhata
        ( a conditioned state). We are all so caught up in being this or that
        kind of self and having this or that possession of self. Being the self
        of an animal is no good so we want a human self. Seeing that being human
        is no good we want to become a celestial being. That's no good so we
        want to become a brahma-god. Seeing that being a brahma-god is no good
        we want to become a mahabrahma-god. There's a self there all the time,
        its all sankhata. Only on the discovery of nirodhatu can we withdraw
        from the conditioned.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus <i>nirodhadhatu</i> is the final
        element, it is the element of extinguishing. It is the utter
        extinguishing of 'I' and 'mine'. If there is an absolute and final
        extinction (<i>anupadisesanibbanadhatu</i>) then one becomes an arahant.
        If the extinction is incomplete (<i>sa-upadisesanibbanadhatu</i>) then
        one becomes one of the lesser Noble Ones, for there is still a remnant
        of ego, it is not the true ultimate emptiness of <i>paramamsunnam</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To summarize: we must know the dhatus,
        the true constituents of all things. Please understand them according to
        the main principle whereby there is rupadhatu: elements with form;
        arupadhatu: elements without form; nirodhahatu: the element which is the
        extinguishing of both the form and formless elements. We can confidently
        assert that there is nothing outside the scope of these three words.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We are learning something about the
        Buddha's science, the science that encompasses the physical, mental and
        spiritual spheres. It enables us to have an utterly thorough knowledge
        of all things that precludes any further grasping at them. And it is
        this that must be the meaning of emptiness for us.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now I'll expand on a few points in order
        to round off our understanding of emptiness. In the Uppannasaka Sutta of
        the Majjhima Nikaya the Buddha calls sunnata 'mahapurisavihara'. This
        translates as meaning that emptiness is the abode of the Great Man. The
        Great Man does not have a wandering restless mind that spins this way
        and that, as does the mind of the ordinary man. The Great Man has a mind
        that dwells in emptiness, with emptiness, is itself emptiness. That
        being so, sunnata is the abode or temple of the Great Man i.e. of the
        Buddha and the arahants. To say that emptiness is their abode means that
        they live it and breathe it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha stated that He, the
        Tathagata, dwelt and passed His life in sunnatavihara. When he was
        teaching Dhamma His mind was empty of 'self' and 'belonging to self'.
        When he was on alms-round or doing his daily tasks His mind was empty.
        When he was enjoying Himself in His free time (divahara or sukhavihara)
        He was dwelling empty of 'self' and 'belonging to self'. Thus He
        affirmed to Sariputta that the Tathagata passed His life in
        sunnatavihara.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here we are not talking about the
        ordinary unenlightened person but of the Great man, of the Buddha -how
        He lived and in what abode He dwelt. If you want to see the Buddha's
        dwelling place, don't go thinking that it's a building made of bricks
        and mortar or something in India. You should think of the abode called
        sunnatavihara or mahapurisavihara.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The supreme emptiness is not the
        momentary flash that we may experience sitting here, which has
        disappeared by the time we get home. Sunnatavihara refers to the
        ultimate emptiness and so another word is used, a rather long one - <i>paramanuttarasunnata</i>.
        It is composed of three words: <i>parama + anuttara + sunnata</i>, and
        it means &quot;supreme unsurpassable emptiness&quot;. In the technical
        literature of Dhamma, this point relates to the cetosamadhi devoid of
        nimttas (mind-created phenomena that may occur when the mind is
        concentrated) where the mind lacking any nimitta is radiantly pure to
        the extent of being free of the asavas (cankers, intoxicants, outflows,
        mental defilements defined in terms of the way they flow out in response
        to conditions - asavas of sense-desire, for existence, views and
        ignorance.) This condition may be of a kind that can be regressed from
        or it may be permanent. If at any moment that there is this kind of
        cetosamadhi where there are no nimittas to be clung to as self or as
        belonging to self, then that radiant mind, free of the asavas, is called
        paramanuttarasunnata and is the natural, unforced state of the arahants.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we unenlightened people are ever
        going to be true adepts we must be able to attain this cetosamadhi. Even
        if we don't end the asavas once and for all it will be an occasional
        freedom from them. It will be borrowing something of the Buddha and the
        arahants to have a look at so we don't lose heart. For that which we
        call emptiness or enlightenment or Nibbana is both of the sort that is
        obtained absolutely and finally and is also of the temporary uncertain
        sort that we ordinary folk may know. There is even a third sort, which
        occurs by coincidence. At times when our surroundings are particularly
        conducive the mind may be empty for an hour or two. But the important
        thing is that we set our minds on practicing to the best of our
        abilities to make the mind empty.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The term paramanuttarasunnata as used by
        the Buddha means the utter destruction of greed, aversion and delusion,
        the grasping at and clinging to things as self or as belonging to self,
        and thus has the same meaning as samucchedapahana or 'final
        abandonment'. Consequently when speaking of the highest level of sunnata
        the Buddha used this term, supreme unsurpassable emptiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we gradually lower our eyes from this
        summit of emptiness we will be able to understand its lesser levels.
        Directly below the peak of paramanuttarasunnata are the following:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">- nevasannanasannayatana<br>
          - akincannayatana<br>
          - vinnanancayatana<br>
          - akasanancayatana<br>
          - pathavisanna<br>
          - arannasanna</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Looking downwards from the summit it is
        hard to understand so we will start from the bottom and gradually raise
        our eyes to the peak.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The very first level is arannasanna,
        which means the perception of forest. For example, If we live where it
        is noisy and confusing and then imagine it to be a forest as if it truly
        is one and we really have entered it. We can imagine the forest to be
        empty and tranquil, free from disturbing noises. Merely imagining the
        forest is already one sort of emptiness, but an emptiness that is
        child's play.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Higher than arannasanna is pathavisanna,
        whereby we, for example, create the perception of earth. We can become
        conscious of all phenomena as being merely the earth element.
        Pathavisanna can eradicate craving for the sense pleasures of visible
        forms, sounds, odors, tastes and tactile objects. It is something the
        young should try.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here if we wish to ascend further we
        must create the perception of <i>akasanancayatana</i>, i.e. create the
        feeling that there is nothing but infinite space. Space is indeed one
        kind of emptiness but it is not true sunnata. Sunnata is of a higher
        order than vacant, empty space. You don't have to be interested in that
        sort of emptiness. Pay attention to the subtler level of sunnata whereby
        we can create the perception that there is nothing but infinite
        consciousness. The perception that there is nothing but the infinite
        consciousness element is called <i>vinnanancayatana</i>. If we ascend
        even higher we reach the kind of sunnata called akincannayatana where we
        mentally create utter nothingness. We don't allow the mind to focus on
        anything, we fix it on nothingness. However there still remains the
        feeling that there is nothingness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One step further on lies <i>nevasannanasannayatana</i>,
        non-perceiving perception. It's said that it is neither like being alive
        nor being dead. To say that there is perception would be false. To say
        that there is no perception would also be false. There is no labeling or
        interpretation of experience. There is awareness without perception. It
        is so subtle that to call a person in this state alive would be false,
        to call him dead would be false.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">These six levels of emptiness are not
        the same as <i>paramanuttarasunnata</i>. The Buddha spoke of them merely
        to demonstrate the various gradations of emptiness. None of them are the
        emptiness that is the abode of the Great Man. They are the sorts of
        emptiness that rishis and munis had been groping after since before the
        time of the Buddha. Once having discovered them they would get stuck in
        them, unable to get beyond them. It was like that until the Buddha found
        the true sunnata which is the abode of the Great Man, the supreme
        unsurpassable emptiness that I have been speaking of.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The commentaries call the experiences of
        sunnata '<i>sunnataphassa</i>'. We know only the contact (phassa) of the
        eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind with visible forms, sounds,
        odors, tastes, tangible and mental objects. We have never had
        sunnataphassa, the contact with sunnata because we know only of the
        rupadhatu and arupadhatu, we know nothing of nirodhadhatu.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we come to know nirodhadhatu we
        will experience a new sensation, that which the commentators call
        sunnataphassa. It is the name of the Noble Path on the level that truly
        destroys mental defilements. When we have developed our practice to the
        point that it is destroying defilements, there is sunnataphassa. It is
        like touching sunnata with our hand, our minds come into contact with
        emptiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Emptiness as contact relates to the
        Noble path of one for whom <i>anattanupassana</i> (the insight that
        there is no self nor anything belonging to a self, that there are merely
        dhammas and natural process) is growing continually. If the Noble Path
        is of this nature it is called <i>sunnato</i> and any contact that takes
        place on that path is called <i>sunnataphassa</i>. <i>Anattanupassana</i>,
        the cause of that state, is a consequence of <i>Dukkhanupassana</i>, the
        insight into <i>Dukkha</i>. <i>Dukkhanupassana</i> is like having once
        tried to take hold of fire knowing that it's not at all something to put
        your hand in, or knowing that no dhammas whatsoever should be clung to
        because once taken hold of, they become a fire. If spiritually we are
        well conversant with the way fire burns and consumes, how it constricts,
        envelops, pierces and entangles then that is <i>Dukkhanupassana</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here we must consider that some people
        object that if you haven't reached Nibbana you can't know anything about
        it, just as if you've never been to Europe you can't even have seen it.
        But Nibbana is not a material object, it is a matter of the mind and
        heart. As I have said, right now most of your minds are empty. This is
        already a taste. Be diligent in seeing that.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consequently in the scriptural
        exposition of the practice of mindfulness of breathing, in the section
        dealing with cittanupassana where it discusses the method of looking
        intently at the mind, it says that if mind has lust one knows that mind
        has lust; if mind has aversion one knows the mind has aversion; if the
        mind has delusion one knows the mind has delusion; if the mind is
        depressed then one knows that the mind is depressed; if the mind is not
        depressed one knows that mind is not depressed; if the mind is released
        then one knows that mind is released (vimutti); if mind is not released
        one knows that mind is not released.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the mind is released then it is
        empty. If it is not released then it is not empty. Let us look at our
        mind that is either released i.e. empty of all things or caught i.e.
        grasping at and clinging to something. Even at the initial level of
        practice the teaching is to look at the mind that is empty or vimutti.
        It is something that is there to be seen within, it is not something to
        be figured out according to books that we've read.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nibbana or sunnata is there for us to
        see, even while we are still unenlightened. There is the emptiness
        called tadangavimutti that just happens to arise, as it is now, when the
        external conditions are right. If we concentrate the mind in the correct
        way so that it is completely undisturbed and at ease (more so, one may
        say, than experiencing any kind of worldly pleasure) then this is
        vikkhambhanavimutti, release by suppression. So even without the
        samucchedavimutti or final release of the arahant, we still have a
        sample of emptiness to examine, a sample of the wares of Buddha. If you
        are interested you can find such a sample yourself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, we should practice
        mindfulness of breathing stage by stage, developing kayanupassana
        (contemplation of body) vedananupassana (contemplation of feelings)
        cittanupassana (contemplation of mind) and dhammanupassana
        (contemplation of mind objects) It is a constant tasting of emptiness
        from start to finish. Finally, we will understand emptiness through
        seeing the painful consequences of grasping and clinging.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the mind will immediately turn to
        find contentment with the ayatana of Nibbana. So in this way we are able
        to see emptiness continually, before actually reaching the supreme
        level. There is a progress that follows its own law or the law of nature
        itself. When having firmly comprehended something by oneself the
        resulting knowledge is firm. It does not sway unstably like false
        knowledge or knowledge gained by listening to others.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We don't have to do anything very much
        to make ourselves happy, we don't have to go to any great trouble. All
        we have to do is empty our minds of greed, aversion and delusion, or in
        other words to make it empty of grasping at and clinging to 'I' and
        'mine'. When the mind is empty of greed, aversion and delusion, then it
        is truly empty and all Dukkha comes to an end. Even kamma will of itself
        come to an end.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Anguttara Nikaya, the Buddha
        states that when the mind is empty of greed, aversion and delusion,
        empty of 'I' and 'mine' then kamma ends by itself. This means that
        kamma, vipaka (its result) and the mental defilements which are the
        cause for the creation of kamma, spontaneously and simultaneously come
        to an end. So don't be afraid of kamma, to fear that means we are ruled
        by our kamma. Rather, we should take an interest in emptiness. If we
        have created emptiness with regards to 'I' and 'mine', kamma will
        utterly disintegrate and there will be no way that we will have to
        follow its dictates.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's due to this very point that someone
        like Angulimala, a murderer, could become an arahant. Don't explain
        wrongly as is often done, the Buddha's reply to Angulimala, &quot;I have
        already stopped. It is you that have not stopped.&quot; Don't explain
        that 'not stopped' means that Angulimala became a saint because he
        stopped killing people. Anyone that explains like that is badly
        representing the Buddha because when the Buddha used the word 'stop'
        here, he was referring to the stopping of 'I' and 'mine', to the
        stopping of clinging and grasping, or in other words to emptiness. So it
        is emptiness that is the stopping and it is the only kind of stopping
        that could have made Angulimala an arahant. If it was just stopping
        killing people that would make one an arahant why are not all those
        people who do not kill arahants? It is because cessation, the true
        stopping, is the emptiness where there is no self to dwell anymore. That
        is true stopping. If there is still a self then you can't stop.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we should understand that the word
        'empty' is the same as the word 'stop', the single word by which the
        Buddha was able to enlighten Angulimala, even though the killer's hands
        were still red with blood and around his neck hung the 999 finger bones
        of his victims. For kamma to end by itself, to reach the stopping, we
        must rely on this single term: empty of 'I' and 'mine', not grasping at
        or clinging to dhammas.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This action of making the mind empty may
        be called <i>Buddhist yoga</i>, for ensuring that there is emptiness in
        our action is <i>raja yoga</i>, the highest level at the summit of yoga
        (spiritual endeavor). But although we borrow the word raja yoga from
        Vedanta, in that tradition it is concerned with the realization of an
        ultimate self. However the Buddha taught that yoga means
        ariyasaccadasanna, which means that there is yoga in the Buddhist
        teachings but it is the clarification of emptiness, making it manifest.
        So any action that is conducive to the manifestation of emptiness may be
        called yoga. If one wishes to use the word yoga or is interested in it
        in any way it should be understood in this manner for it to be Buddhist
        yoga, i.e. causing the manifestation of ultimate truth. It should be
        taken in and used in every mental action so as to stop the grasping at
        and clinging to 'I' and 'mine'. Thus we take the word yoga from another
        tradition and adapt it's meaning 'appropriately'. Take for example the
        word <i>kammayoga</i> - being unselfish, acting unreservedly for the
        benefit of others, we too have this yoga. If there is no
        ego-consciousness then whatever we do will be kammayoga. Even with this
        very basic kind of yoga - making merit, doing good, sacrificing for
        others and helping mankind, these actions must be performed with a mind
        empty of 'I' and 'mine'. So we don't have to seek after other kinds of
        yoga for they all come down to this one yoga, the spiritual endeavor of
        putting an end to self and the belonging to self, or in other words,
        making emptiness manifest.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">All this rather lengthy explanation has
        been aimed at elucidating the single word emptiness. To be empty of
        defilements is to be empty of this feeling of 'I' and 'mine' and then
        the emptiness that is freedom from Dukkha is assured, for to be empty of
        defilements is to be empty of Dukkha. To be empty of 'I' and 'mine'
        alone is to be empty of all things. That state of emptiness is not the
        element of earth, water, fire or air or any of those kinds of things. It
        is only nirodhadhatu, voidness of 'I' and 'mine', the extinction of
        kamma, the defilements and Dukkha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last point that we must consider is
        that, as was said at the beginning, emptiness exists in relation to all
        things. Don't forget that 'all things' are nothing other than dhammas
        and that dhammas are nothing but nature or suchness. They are already
        empty of self or the belongings of self. The dhammas of foolishness,
        delusion and ignorance emerge continually, because our culture and the
        way we live encourages the dhammas of ego and unknowing. They don't
        encourage the dhammas of knowledge. Consequently we undergo the
        punishment for our 'original sin', our original misguided action,
        continually and automatically from the time of its occurrence wthout
        ever learning our lesson. The young aren't conscious of it, the
        middle-aged aren't conscious of it and even many of the old are
        unconscious of it. We should at least be able to realize it in middle
        age or old age so as to escape the punishment, emerge from the cage of
        vattasamara and reach that boundless place of clarity and space.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddhist Teachings spread to
        China, the Chinese of those days were intelligent and wise enough to
        accept it and there arose teachings such as those of Hui Nang and Huang
        Po in which explanations of mind and Dghamma, of Buddha, the Way and
        emptiness were extremely terse. There emerged the key sentence that
        mind, Buddha, Dhamma, the Way and emptiness are all just the same thing.
        This one sentence is enough, there is no need to say anything more. It
        is equivalent to all the scriptures. Now, that is a statement that
        particularly those of us studying and practicing in the old style have
        no way at all of understanding. It might be beneficial for us to feel a
        little ashamed on this account. The Chinese went on to say that
        'emptiness is by nature always present but that we don't see it. I may
        prove this by saying once again that at this moment everyone sitting
        here has a mind that is by nature empty but not only do you not see it,
        but what's more, you will not accept that this is emptiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Huang Po scolded that this is like
        someone having a diamond attached to their forehead without knowing it,
        who goes searching all around the world or perhaps outside the world in
        hell, heaven or the Brahma worlds, making an offering of a penny and
        expecting to go to heaven and satisfy every desire. Not seeing that
        which is stuck in our forehead, we seek all around the world, or if
        that's not enough in other realms. So please, just for awhile, look very
        closely to see what is there at your forehead and how to go about
        putting your hands on it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When speaking of the way to take hold of
        the diamond the Chinese teachers spoke even more profoundly,
        &quot;There's no need to do anything. Just be still and the mind will
        become empty by itself&quot;. This phrase, &quot;Just be still. There's
        no need to do anything&quot;, has many meanings. Our minds are naughty
        and playful. The mind wanders out of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and
        body, gathering sense-objects, and having accepted them within, is
        stupid enough to allow the dhammas of ignorance to 'climb into the
        drivers seat', so that there is nothing but grasping and clinging to 'I'
        and 'Mine'. This is called being naughty, refusing to be still.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Being still' means not admitting
        sense-objects into the mind but being content to let them founder like
        waves on the shore. For instance, when the eye sees form, if there is
        merely the seeing, then that is called not admitting visible forms into
        the mind and similarly with the other sense organs. If you can't do that
        and vedana, feeling of satisfaction and dissatisfaction arise, let it
        stop just there, don't allow desires based on those feelings to develop.
        If it stops there its still possible to be still. But if we act to
        extend a feeling of satisfaction then in a moment 'I' and 'mine' emerge.
        Or if we act in response to a feeling of dissatisfaction then there will
        be Dukkha. it is called not being still.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the 'being still' of Hui Neng refers
        to that very practice that the Buddha taught, of seeing that nothing
        whatsoever should be grasped at or clung to as 'I' or 'mine'. If there
        is nothing whatsoever to be clung to, what possible purpose can there be
        in busying and confusing ourselves, rushing about after the things that
        disturb, rather than just being still?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We must look for this emptiness that is
        truly worthy of our aspiration. To say that there is a kind of emptiness
        that gives rise to cessation, purity, clarity and peace is still to be
        speaking in the realm of convention. Truly speaking, there is nothing
        other than emptiness, there is only this one thing. It is not the cause
        of anything else. It IS Buddha, it IS Dhamma, it IS Sangha, it IS the
        Way. It IS purity, clarity and peace. All these things are present in
        emptiness, because if we have reached the supreme, we don't have to do
        anything. By being still the Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, purity, clarity,
        peace, Nibbana -everything will be present in that very immutable state.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">An extremely simple method that Huang Po
        used to teach dull people how to recognize emptiness was to give them a
        riddle (koan) 'Look at the mind of a child before its conception'. I
        would like to present all of you with this riddle. Look at the child's
        mind. Before it is conceived in the womb where is it? If you can find it
        you will easily be able to find emptiness, just as if taking hold of
        that which is already there in your forehead.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To sum up - this one subject of
        emptiness covers all of the Buddhist Teachings, for Buddha breathed with
        emptiness. Emptiness is the theoretical knowledge, it is the practice
        and it is the fruit of practice. If one studies one must study
        emptiness; and if one receives the fruit it must be emptiness, so that
        finally one attains that thing which is supremely desirable. There is
        nothing beyond emptiness. When it is realized, all problems end. It is
        not above, it is not below, it is not anywhere -I don't know what to say
        about it, better shut up! Suffice to say that emptiness is the supreme
        happiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But you must be very careful regarding
        the phrases 'Nibbana is the supreme happiness' and 'Nibbana is the
        ultimate emptiness'. You must grasp their meaning correctly, don't take
        the word happiness to mean the happiness that you have formerly enjoyed,
        like the sect before Buddha's time who took</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">THE WAY TO PRACTICE IN ORDER TO ABIDE
        WITH EMPTINESS</font></p>
        </b><font size="6">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I</font></font><font face="Times New Roman">n
        the last talk I explained all the various principles associated with
        emptiness. Now there remains only to speak of the ways to practice in
        order to abide with emptiness, ways that will be useful to all people,
        even those who are uneducated or haven't studied the texts for
        themselves.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Regarding the matter of 'abiding with
        emptiness' we will have to look at the meanings of a number of words in
        some detail, in particular the words 'know' and 'realize' and the
        phrases 'see clearly', 'abide with' and 'to be empty'. To speak in
        everyday language:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">we know = we know emptiness<br>
          we see clearly = we see emptiness clearly<br>
          we abide with = we abide with emptiness<br>
          we are empty = we are empty with emptiness; i.e. we are emptiness
          itself.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">How do all these phrases differ in
        profundity? In what way can they be looked at so as to have the same
        meaning or level of meaning?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">First of all, to take the phrase 'we
        know emptiness', most people will think that means that we have studied
        and discussed it. If our knowing is merely that much then we don't know
        emptiness correctly. The word 'know' in Dhamma-language doesn't refer to
        the knowing that comes from study or listening or anything like that.
        Such knowing, even if we are sure that we fully understand, is not
        complete. The words 'know' and 'understand' in ordinary everyday
        language are solely a matter of reading and studying and listening, of
        thought and logical consideration. Those techniques cannot be employed
        to know emptiness. The knowing of emptiness refers to the awareness of
        emptiness in a mind that is truly empty. For there to be knowing of
        emptiness, emptiness must be experienced at the moment of knowing, it
        must be a moment of direct realization. This then is called 'knowing
        emptiness'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">After we've heard something a couple of
        times, going off and thinking about it and then considering logically
        that it could be possible or that it may well be like that, is not yet
        the knowing that is meant here, it is the knowing and understanding of
        worldly language. Please take the word 'know' as it is used here in the
        particular sense it has in the Buddhist Teachings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To know Dhamma means that Dhamma is
        truly present and that we are aware of it. Similarly to know emptiness
        means that emptiness is manifest in the awareness. So I have encouraged
        people over and over again that at any moment that the mind has any
        measure of emptiness, even if it's not finally or perfectly empty, to
        keep recognizing it. Actually, on any one day emptiness is there
        repeatedly and even if its not a fixed, absolute emptiness it's still
        very good, if we take the trouble to observe it. If we take an interest
        in this sort of emptiness right from the start, it will generate a
        contentment with emptiness that will make it easy to practice to attain
        the real thing. Therefore the phrase 'we know emptiness' refers to
        having emptiness manifest in awareness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The phrase 'seeing emptiness clearly' is
        the same. It is seeing with more and more clarity and precision. When we
        have become aware of the mind's emptiness we contemplate it, focus our
        awareness on it until there is a clear penetrative seeing of it, or in
        other words, a thorough knowing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The meaning of the phrase 'we realize
        emptiness' is once again the same. It refers to the moment of
        realization. in conventional terms it's said that 'we' realize emptiness
        but in fact it is the mind that realizes. It is awareness that is the
        'one who is aware' and that realizes, emptiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for the phrase 'abiding with
        emptiness' it refers to sunnatavihara. Living and breathing with
        constant awareness of emptiness is called 'abiding with emptiness'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The phrase 'being empty' means that
        there is no feeling of 'self' or 'belonging to a self', there is no
        feeling of 'I' and 'mine', the creations of craving and grasping. Being
        void of these things is 'being empty'. What is it that is empty. Once
        again it is the mind that is empty, emptied of the feelings of 'self'
        and of 'belonging to self', both in their crude and subtle forms. If the
        mind is empty to the degree of being free of even the refined self it is
        said that the mind itself is emptiness. This agrees with the teaching of
        some other Buddhist traditions that mind is emptiness, emptiness is
        mind; emptiness is Buddha, emptiness is Dhamma, Dhamma is emptiness.
        There is only one thing. All the myriad things that we are acquainted
        with are nothing but emptiness. I will make this clear by looking into
        the word 'empty' once more.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The word 'empty' or 'emptiness' is
        pointing at two things, two characteristics.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Firstly, it refers to the characteristic
        of all things. Please fix in your minds that the characteristic of all
        things is emptiness. This phrase 'all things' must be understood
        correctly as encompassing every single thing, both rupadhammas and
        namadhammas, everything from a speck of dust up to Nibbana. It must be
        well understood that in a speck of dust there is emptiness or absence of
        self, absence of a permanent, independent entity. Gold, silver, and
        diamonds have the characteristic of absence of a permanent, independent
        entity. Going on to the heart and mind, thoughts and feelings, each
        thing is characterized by emptiness, absence of a permanent, independent
        entity. The study and practice of the Dhamma has the characteristic of
        absence of a permanent, independent entity. Finally the Path
        realizations, their Fruits and Nibbana itself all have this same
        characteristic. Even a sparrow flying to and fro has the same
        characteristic of emptiness but we don't see it. So who is to blame but
        ourselves? Please think this over, contemplate it, observe and ponder
        over it until you perceive that all things display the characteristic of
        emptiness it's just that we don't see it. It's like the old Zen riddle,
        or koan as they call it, that 'An ancient pine tree is proclaiming the
        dhamma'. That old pine tree is displaying emptiness, the emptiness that
        it shares with all things but people don't see it, don't hear it's
        Dhamma teaching, its proclamation of the characteristic of emptiness.
        This then is the word 'empty' in its first sense as relating to all
        things.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <i>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">[NOTE: The word 'to KNOW'- to directly
          perceive with the senses or mind, to recognize. (re-COGNIZE)]</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The word 'empty' in the second sense
        refers to the characteristic of the mind that is free from all grasping
        and clinging. Regarding this point please understand that ordinarily,
        although mind is empty of self, it doesn't realize that it empty,
        because it is constantly enveloped and disturbed by the conceptual
        thought that feeds on sense contact. Consequently, the mind is neither
        aware of its own emptiness nor the emptiness of all things. But whenever
        the mind completely throws off that which is enveloping it, the grasping
        and clinging of delusion and ignorance, and detaches from it completely,
        then the mind through its non-clinging has the characteristic of
        emptiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The two sorts of emptiness, the
        emptiness of the non-clinging mind and the emptiness of all things are
        related. Because all things do truly have the characteristic of being
        empty of a self, a permanent, independent entity to be grasped at or
        clung to, we are able to see the truth of emptiness. If in fact they
        weren't empty of self, then it would be impossible to see their
        emptiness. But as it is, on the contrary, although all things are empty
        we see everyone of them as not-empty. The mind that is enveloped by
        defilements and ignorance grasps at and clings to all of them as self,
        even a speck of dust. Even a tiny particle of dust is conceived to be an
        independent entity, a 'second person'. We label the second person, the
        various things that surround us, as being this and being that, and in
        every case see them as being permanent independent entities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore we must know absolutely
        correctly the meaning of the word 'empty' which to sum up, is to know
        that firstly it is the characteristic of all things and secondly it is
        the characteristic of the non-clinging mind. The first emptiness is an
        object of knowledge or realization. The second emptiness is the empty
        mind, the characteristic of the mind that is empty through realizing the
        truth of emptiness. Thus the mind seeing emptiness in all things
        disintegrates of itself, leaving only emptiness, everything as I have
        said from a speck of dust up to Nibbana. Material objects, people,
        animals, time and space, every sort of dhamma melt into emptiness
        through knowing the truth of this point. This is the meaning of the word
        empty.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What I have said so far should have been
        enough for all of you to have observed or grasped for yourself that the
        word 'empty' is equivalent to the remainderless extinction of 'I' and
        'mine', the utter destruction of self.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The self is merely a condition that
        arises when there is grasping and clinging in the mind. We don't see it
        as empty, but see it as self, because that grasping and clinging with
        ignorance and defilement. There being ignorance or unknowing in the mind
        grasping arises by itself, it's not that we make a deliberate effort or
        consciously establish a self. When the mind contains avijja, it
        inevitably experiences all things as being independent entities, with no
        need for there to be any deliberate intention.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If authentic knowing takes place, the
        seeing of all things as they truly are, then we will see the truth that
        emptiness is the remainderless extinction of self. So it can be laid
        down as a principle that 'empty' means the remainderless extinction of
        self. That being so we should give some attention to understanding the
        'remainderless extinction' correctly.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is the extinction with remainder
        and what is the extinction without remainder? Extinction with remainder
        means a mere change of shape or form: although one form is extinguished
        there remains the germ of a new one. There is still grasping and
        clinging continually in the mind, first this thing and then that.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The truth discerning-awareness or
        knowledge of Dhamma which has not yet reached it's peak, can only
        extinguish some types of grasping, sometimes. Some people may be of the
        opinion that dust is not an independent entity but that a sparrow is.
        Others may see that trees and animals are not independent entities but
        take people to be so. In seeing people as independent entities or as
        selves, some will say that the body is not-self but the mind is. This is
        called incomplete extinction; some aspects are extinguished but others
        are left behind as self. One may reach the point of saying that the mind
        is not-self but that some good qualities of the mind, such as virtues
        are. Or one may believe that if these are not-self then that which is
        beyond time, the Nibbana-element is self. This sort of extinguishing
        always leaves a seed. Whenever we sweep out the whole lot, even the
        Nibbana-element as not-self that action is called true remainderless
        extinction of ego or self.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore the phrase 'the remainderless
        extinction of ego' means the non-arising of ego-consciousness. In terms
        of practice it means preventing its arising, and to practice in this
        manner consistently may also be called the remainderless extinction of
        ego. Correct or impeccable practice refers to the practice whereby
        ego-consciousness has no way of arising in the future, in other words,
        not allowing it to arise at any moment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What has been said so far should be
        enough for everyone to understand the phrase 'birth of ego'. Birth here
        does not mean the birth from a mother's womb but the birth in the
        vastness of the mind. So please understand that the feeling 'I am I'
        that arises is born in the mind, and 'birth' is not the birth of the
        physical body.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It must be understood that even though
        the body has emerged from the womb, physical birth may be considered to
        be completely meaningless until there is a mental birth, a birth of
        ego-consciousness. The body is just a lump of matter until there is
        until there occurs the grasping and clinging to self. At that moment the
        birth of that lump of flesh is brought to completion. At the moment that
        self-consciousness arises in a child it is said to be born. As soon as
        that feeling is absent then it 'dies' and reverts to being a lump of
        flesh once more. As long as there is no other feeling able to stimulate
        the creation of self, there is no birth; it's the same as if the child
        is dead. But all of a sudden if there is contact with a sense-object and
        self-consciousness arises again, then there is a new birth, and then
        shortly afterwards another death. So it can be said that in a single day
        a child is born many times.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The way to practice in order to live
        with emptiness lies right here, right in the practice of preventing
        self-consciousness arising in this lump of flesh. This is the main
        point. As for the details, one must look to see quite clearly how to do
        the practice and at what moments or occassions to practice. These two
        points must be explained together. Consequently, in order to facilitate
        our understanding we will divide practice up into three occasions or
        times:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. The 'ordinary times'.<br>
            2. The moments of sense-contact.<br>
            3. The moment of physical death.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">How should we practice on the first
        occasion in the 'normal times' when there is no association with sense
        objects? These 'ordinary times' are the occasions when we are doing some
        kind of work alone, relaxed and unconcerned, and perhaps at times
        performing our daily tasks or of practicing some kind of formal
        meditation. There is no problem due to sense-contact. We may be doing
        some worldly task, or if it's in our spare time reading a book or even
        thinking about something, as long as the mind is undisturbed by
        sense-contact. At such times our practice must be the study and
        clarification of the way in which things are empty and the way in which
        to make the mind empty and undeluded by all things. Think about it,
        study it for yourself, enquire from others and discuss it regularly.
        Keep doing it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is another kind of short cut
        particularly for lay people who have never ordained or studied the
        scriptures and for those who cannot read at all. It has the same meaning
        and aim, the knowledge of the emptiness of all things, but with such
        people we don't use the word emptiness or they will not understand. We
        tell them to make a point of contemplating what there is worth having
        and what there is that is worth being. Gaining wealth, possessions,
        prestige and power, what is worth gaining, what is worth having? Being a
        human being, being a millionaire, being a beggar, being a king, being a
        king's subject, being a celestial being. what is worth being, what about
        it is worth being?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">First of all we must understand the
        words 'have' and 'be' correctly. These words refer directly to grasping
        and clinging. To fulfill the meaning of the words 'have' or 'gain' there
        must be a grasping at something to make ours. For instance if we take
        diamonds and jewels and pile them up so they completely fill a room and
        there is no clinging to them as being ours or that we are their owners,
        it's the same as if there was no possession or gain. The pile of
        precious stones stands there without meaning. But if grasping at 'I'
        occurs, that 'I have got them,' 'I have them and they are mine', then
        that is having or gaining. Please understand these words in this way.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I'll ask again, what is there worth
        having? What is there worth gaining? What is there that having been
        possessed won't cause it's owner to suffer? Every single thing that
        there is will burn up it's owner, pierce, strangle and entangle him,
        envelop and oppress him should he start to 'have' or 'to be'. But should
        the precious stones stand piled up filling the room and he has no
        feeling of having or being, then there is no burning, entangling and
        strangling of any kind. This is called not-having and not-being. So what
        is there, that having possessed it or having become it we will be free
        from Dukkha?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once there is the feeling of having or
        being, we don't have to be in the room with the stones, we can be in a
        forest or in a country on the other side of the world and the mind will
        still experience Dukkha. Try having children living in America, you'll
        see that if you cling to 'I' and 'mine' they will be able to give you
        sleepless nights or even a nervous breakdown.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Please make it a habit to regularly
        contemplate what is worth having and what is worth being; what is there
        that once possessed or once become, will not cause us Dukkha. When we
        discover the truth that there is absolutely nothing that is worthy of
        the feelings of having or being, then we become even-minded towards all
        things. Whatever action we perform, be it arranging, having, collecting,
        using or whatever, we just do what needs to be done. So don't let the
        mind have or become! Keep in mind the principle of doerless doing:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">The doing is done but no doer is
            there.<br>
            The path has been walked but no walker is there.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This verse refers to the arahant, the
        one who has practiced Dhamma, or who has walked the Noble Path to its
        very end and who has reached Nibbana, but with no walker and no
        practicer to be found.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The principle of doerless doing must be
        taken up and utilized in our daily lives. Whether we're eating, sitting,
        laying down, standing, walking, using, seeking, whatever we are doing we
        must have enough truth-discerning awareness to prevent the arising of
        the feeling of 'I' - the feeling that 'I' am the doer, 'I&quot; am the
        eater, the walker, the sitter, the sleeper or the user. We must make the
        mind constantly empty of ego, so that emptiness is the natural state and
        we abide with the awareness that there is nothing worth having or being.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhamma can be practiced in conjunction
        with our daily tasks and the to and fro that they entail. There is no
        need to separate Dhamma from everyday life. It is a very high practice.
        If there is mindfulness and self-awareness, not only will our work be
        successful and free from error, but at the same time, Dhamma in our
        hearts will develop and grow greatly. Not-having and not-gaining will be
        the normal state of the mind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for 'being' it's much easier.
        Consider what there is that having become there is no Dukkha? This can
        be a formula for reflection. It is the essential point. The word 'being'
        just as with the words 'have and 'gain', refers only to the being that
        is accompanied by upadana, by grasping and clinging to the 'I am'. If a
        room is piled full of gold and we have no feeling of being it's owner
        there is no gaining or having and no being. Although the ownership
        rights and social conventions recognized by laws of the world have a
        certain validity, in our true hearts we shouldn't be misled into taking
        those relative truths to be ultimate. For instance when there is a birth
        it is, conventionally speaking, natural that the one who gives birth
        becomes a mother and the one born a child. However, if one doesn't take
        oneself to be a mother then one won't be a mother. Because one deludedly
        presumes oneself to be a mother one becomes one. Mother chickens, mother
        dogs, mother cows, all sorts of mothers consider themselves to be
        mothers and feel it natural to love their young. It's not necessary for
        them to create or nurture such feelings, these are instincts natural to
        animals.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But those with truth-discerning
        awareness are on a higher level. They have the knowledge of the way to
        destroy the grasping and clinging that arises from such ignorance.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now some people will think: &quot;Not
        let us feel ourselves to be mothers! How cruel and heartless! Won't you
        let us love our children?&quot; Listen carefully: It doesn't mean that
        at all. It means that it is possible to be a mother and perform a
        mothers duties with truth-discerning awareness. It's not necessary to be
        a mother with grasping and clinging, the cause of every kind of Dukkha.
        It's not necessary to suffer unhappiness, the heart break and tears.
        That suffering is indeed the price of not knowing how to be a mother, of
        being a mother is a way that does not conform with Dhamma</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When one is a mother one must have the
        Dukkha of a mother; when one is a son or daughter one must have the
        Dukkha of a son or daughter; when one is a father one must have the
        Dukkha of a father. Try asking your self 'Is being a mother a pleasure?'
        Those of you old enough to have had a full experience of parenthood,
        think over what it's like. How will you answer? Even if you don't say
        anything outright, probably every one of you will shake your heads. Is
        being a mother a pleasure? Is being a father a pleasure? This is
        something that you should study and be naturally and habitually
        conscious of at the times when the mind is not occupied with
        sense-contact.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Is it a pleasure to be a husband? is it
        a pleasure to be a wife? Think it over for yourselves. Those who have
        fully experienced being husband and wives will all shake their heads.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Is it a pleasure to be male? is it a
        pleasure to be female? If your truth-discerning awareness is following
        step by step and becoming increasingly refined, you will all shake your
        heads. To be female is to have the Dukkha of being female. To be male is
        to have the Dukkha of a male.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Is it a pleasure to be a child? Is it a
        pleasure to be an adult? Young children will probably say, 'Yes it's
        fun' but we who are now adults, we who are now old, look back and ask
        yourselves 'Was it really a pleasure? Children have the Dukkha of
        children and adults have the Dukkha of adults if there is grasping and
        clinging.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To expand this further -is to be a human
        being a desirable thing? Is it worth being? Or is is worth being an
        animal? To be anyone of a pair of opposites or to be nothing at all,
        which is better? To be a man, to be a denizen of hell, are they worth
        being?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To take another pair: Is this person you
        are, worth being? Or is it worth being a deva in heaven? These questions
        are a measure of truth discerning awareness, of whether or not one sees
        grasping and clinging fully and truly. Those who have seen the painful
        consequences of grasping and clinging will shake their heads in the same
        way; for to be a person one must have the Dukkha of a person, if one is
        a deva one must have the Dukkha of a deva. If we are empty, not taking
        ourselves to be anything at all, then we are neither a person or a deva
        and so the Dukkha of being either of those things is absent. Those who
        have realized the truth will all shake their heads.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To be more specific, is it worth being a
        good person? Is it worth being a bad person? If one asks who wants to be
        a good person there is likely to be a forest of raised hands. Such
        people don't yet see that if one clings to being a good person then one
        must have the Dukkha of being a good person. exactly in the same way
        that a bad person will have the Dukkha appropriate to being a bad
        person. When there is grasping and clinging at being, then there is not
        happiness at all, for that state of being will be weighed down by a
        heaviness of some sort or another. Even if some kinds of Dukkha do not
        show themselves openly, if there are pleasures and distractions there
        will be the Dukkha of having, being and gaining, of ambitiously striving
        to be this or that.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In truth, nature fools us into taking on
        Dukkha, an obvious example being the case of Dukkha that arises from
        propagating the species, from giving birth. It fools us so much that
        people actually enthusiastically volunteer. If they were to see the
        truth for themselves they would probably have nothing to do with this
        deception of nature. is it a pleasure to be a good person? Is it a
        pleasure to be a bad person? Think about it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Coming even closer, is it worth it being
        a fortunate person? Is it worth it being an unfortunate person? The
        hasty and uncircumspect are likely to raise their hands immediately,
        saying that being fortunate is extremely pleasant, but those who have
        fully experienced good fortune will shake their heads. One who is
        fortunate must endure the Dukkha of one who takes himself to be
        fortunate in exactly the same way that the one who is unfortunate must
        endure the Dukkha appropriate to one who is unfortunate.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Coming closer still. Is it worth it
        being a happy person? Is it worth it being an unhappy person? There will
        be a real forest of raised hands here, even more than before, all asking
        to be a happy person. On the other hand, those who have been happy, who
        have fully experienced being happy, will shake their heads. You may not
        understand this section so let me repeat, people who are happy must have
        the Dukkha of people with happiness. Regarding this point you must bear
        in mind that it is the worldly who establish the conventions as to the
        nature of happiness: that the one who has money and power enjoys every
        sort of sense-pleasure is the happy person. But if we look closely we
        will see that such a person suffers Dukkha in an appropriate fashion, a
        'fishbone' forms in the flesh of his pleasure. Even with the more subtle
        happiness that arises from samadhi and the meditative absorptions of the
        rishis and munis, if the feeling that 'I am happy' arises, then too it
        will form a 'fishbone' in the flesh of that happiness that will stick in
        the enjoyers throat. Those who grasp at and cling to the happiness of
        rupajhana suffer accordingly.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consequently, there is the injunction to
        renounce lust for form and lust for the formless, the first two of the
        higher fetters (samyojana) that prevent us from becoming arahants. If
        there is clinging to the idea that we have happiness, even if it's the
        happiness that arises from Dhamma, it will cause a fine kind of ‘fishbone'
        to stay stuck in the throat, so that the true Dhamma cannot be
        discerned.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Grasping at Nibbana as being 'my' self
        or 'my' happiness is impossible. One may say, if one wishes, that
        Nibbana is the supreme happiness and that one grasps Nibbana as being
        'I' or 'mine', that I have happiness of Nibbana or I have attained
        Nibbana. But these are mere rationalizations, in fact it can't happen.
        One who still grasps and clings cannot possibly attain Nibbana. If
        anyone takes himself to be the enjoyer of the happiness of Nibbana it
        can only be counterfeit Nibbana. True Nibbana, is not of a nature that
        can be grasped that way.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we drive out happiness! We drive it
        out right from the happiness of children, the happiness of adults, of
        young men and young women and the elderly, the happiness of the powerful
        and influential, right up to the happiness of being a deva, of having
        meditative absorptions and attainments and finally to Nibbana. If we
        deludedly consider 'I am happy' then we must suffer accordingly. Those
        who have realized the truth see this. Those who have not are in turmoil,
        ambitiously and hungrily striving for wealth, power and sense pleasures,
        or on a higher level, greedily striving for insight, meditative
        absorptions and attainments, pushing so much that some end up in a
        mental hospital. That in itself demonstrates the dangers of grasping and
        clinging to happiness. Young children will not understand this point but
        adults should.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now we'll give some thought to another
        pair of opposites. Is being born a pleasure? Is dying a pleasure? Choose
        one or other of the pair. Which is more enjoyable, being born or dying?
        If we really understand Dhamma we'll shake our heads, we'll want neither
        birth nor death. However, although people don't usually want to die,
        they do want to be born. They want birth without death and what's more,
        they want eternal life or if they must die they want to be reborn. This
        is indeed grasping and clinging. Only from the time when there is
        neither birth nor death, when the mind is empty, will there be an end to
        Dukkha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why not try thinking this over when you
        are lying down or walking, in the moments that the mind is not occupied
        by sense-contact. When you're doing something or being something, why
        not try thinking in this way?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">W hen you're suffering and exhausted
        with being a mother, why don't you ever feel that it's unpleasant? Being
        a husband, being a wife, being any of the things that I've mentioned,
        when you are disturbed and upset by that state of being, why don't you
        ever feel it to be utterly unpleasant? You still find it pleasant even
        when it brings you to tears.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We must contemplate well that we want
        neither birth nor non-birth, for neither is empty. If we cling to
        non-birth then it too is not empty. This section, concerning birth and
        non-birth, the final pair, is the hardest to understand and the hardest
        to practice. We want neither birth nor non-birth and through not
        grasping at or clinging to either of them there is an emptiness. having
        spoken continually of having and being, of not-having and not-being, we
        reach birth and non-birth and almost immediately grasp at non-birth.
        Thus at the final stage our practice must be to advance to the point
        that our knowledge of non-birth dissolves, without becoming an object of
        grasping and clinging. Then true emptiness will appear, that which is
        neither birth nor non-birth, or in other words true non-birth, the
        remainderless extinction. Speaking in this way may seem to be splitting
        hairs or quibbling but the meaning is unequivocal, there is the definite
        difference between those two kinds of non-birth. So don't cling to the
        idea that Nibbana is non-birth and is wonderful and amazing in this way
        and that or that vattasamsara (the wheel of birth and death) is a
        plethora of fun filled births. There must be no grasping or clinging on
        either side for there to be emptiness and genuine non-birth. The
        practice at the normal times must be of this nature continually.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for the moments when we are doing the
        great work of kammatthana, the most technical aspect of the practice of
        Samadhivipassana, whereby one examines the painful consequences of
        grasping and clinging, it too is a matter of being empty. A large part
        of kammatthana practice depends on following instructions, it's not
        something an unlearned person can do on his own, and thus there are many
        guidelines and explanations. You may read these for yourselves or bring
        to mind those you have formerly heard. All of the points that I have
        been making here are included in the practice at the ordinary times.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second occasion is the moment of
        contact with sense-objects. When visible forms, sounds, odors, flavors
        and tangible objects contact the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and body we
        must practice letting phassa stop at phassa and let vedana stop at
        vedana, in the way that I have previously explained in many places and
        many occasions at the beginning of these talks. Letting phassa stop at
        just phassa is an extremely high level of practice. On the ordinary
        level, phassa develops into vedana and then we stop it just there,
        without allowing the further development of craving and grasping, of 'I'
        and 'mine'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some of the articulate talkers in
        monastery halls and teachers in Buddhist colleges say that stopping just
        at phassa is impossible, that there is always the development of vedana.
        That is because they cling to the written word. it's not the truth.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In fact, the Buddha taught that when
        seeing forms there should be just the seeing, when smelling odors just
        the smelling, tasting flavors just the tasting and touching tangible
        objects just the touching. If you can do it then there is no you, the
        ego is not born. It is the end if Dukkha, immutable emptiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is sufficient to observe one's
        reactions at the times that we glance in the direction of some neutral
        form or other. Try casting you eyes on the door or a window and you'll
        notice that there is merely phassa, there are no feelings of
        satisfaction or dissatisfaction. When visible forms, sounds, odors,
        flavors and tangible objects enter as contact let them stop there in the
        same way.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let it be like the soldier asleep by the
        side of a piece of artillery. When a shell is fired he merely registers
        the sound without feeling anything and just goes on happily sleeping. No
        matter how heavy the shelling he is not startled or disturbed. There is
        just the sound of the piece of artillery contacting his ear and then
        ceasing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Can you let phassa stop at phassa in
        that way when you hear the sound of a man or the sound of a woman or the
        sound of a loved one? If you can then you are really adept. Here animals
        may be more accomplished then we are because they lack all the excess
        mental baggage carried by humans. If we wish to reach the peak of
        excellence then we must train ourselves to let phassa remain as merely
        phassa.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But if you can't do it and admit defeat,
        you can still stop at vedana. as soon as there is a feeling of comfort
        or discomfort, of satisfaction or dissatisfaction, then extinguish it
        just there, without giving birth to the various kinds of desire that
        spring from the urges of carving and clinging. This is the practice on
        the occasion of contact with sense-objects.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now in the short remaining time I would
        like to talk about the practice on the third occasion, the moment when
        the mind is extinguished and the body breaks up and dies. How can we
        practice so as to be empty at that time? For this matter we must depend
        on taking 'remainderless extinction' as our basic principle in life.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The natural death of the aged is
        something definite and sure. When someone reaches old age it's said that
        they have little time left. What can be achieved in that short remaining
        time? So as to be in time, those who are old and unlearned, who don't
        have the time to study very much and whose brains aren't as good as they
        were, can hold to this very principle of remainderless extinction of the
        'I', that I have been speaking of.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Make it natural to yourself to see that
        being a person is not pleasant, being a deva is not pleasant, being a
        father or a mother is not pleasant, being a son or a daughter is not
        pleasant, a husband, a wife, a servant, a master, a victor, a loser, a
        good person, a bad person, a fortunate person or an unfortunate person
        -none of them is pleasant, none of them is any fun. Then the mind will
        hold no hope of having or being anything at all. The phrase 'absence of
        hope' may be used in regard to the attainment of arahantship, but it is
        not the designation of the foolish and lazy, it's a different matter
        altogether. It is the absence of hope of one who with true wisdom sees
        that there is nothing in this or in any world that one would wish to
        have or to be.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So what path will be taken by the mind
        of a person without hope? It won't take any path at all because it sees
        that nothing is worth wishing for. Thus it lays the way for its own
        death. There being no desire to have or be anything, it dissolves into
        emptiness. This is the skillful means to cheat nature a little. When the
        time of death has truly arrived, we give rise to the feeling that
        nothing anywhere is worth having or being. If that feeling is present in
        the mind at the moment of death then one will inevitably reach Nibbana
        through the act of dying itself. It's really a good deal - putting down
        a tiny amount of capital certain of great results!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let great scholars of the land come and
        test out what it's like for the mind to meet death with the authentic
        feeling that nothing anywhere is worth having or being. Death will be
        disintegration accompanied by nirodhadhatu. The mind will be transformed
        into nibbandhatu through physical death. If a grandma or grand-dad are
        unlearned and inarticulate but have this single feeling it is enough.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the time of death arrives let this
        single feeling that nothing anywhere is worth having or being be
        present. You should remember that close to death the mind will gradually
        slip away. As the body runs down nearing its end, consciousness will
        gradually disappear. You will forget more and more until you forget
        everything. You won't know what time it is, whether it’s day or night;
        you won't be able to tell where you are or whose house you are in, you
        won't even be able to remember your name or even the most basic daily
        chants properly. But the way for you to stay as the companion of the
        mind until the end, is to be aware that nothing is worth having and
        nothing is worth being. Volunteer for the remainderless extinction! Let
        that feeling of volunteering for the remainderless extinction, that
        readiness to accept it, be a partner of the mind until the very end.
        With this skillful means the mind will be able to dissolve itself into
        the emptiness that is Nibbana. This is the practice at the moment of
        physical death for those of little knowledge. With it an unlearned
        grandma or grand-dad can reach the final extinction. We call it the
        skillful means of turning a fall from a ladder into a measured leap.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The body must inevitably break up, it's
        old, it has reached its end. This is to have fallen from the ladder. As
        one falls one leaps on, leaps on to the remainderless extinction by
        establishing in the mind the feeling that nothing is worth having and
        nothing is worth being. It may be called leaping in the right direction.
        There is no pain of any sort. There is, on the contrary, the best
        possible results, attainment of remainderless extinction. It is to be
        adept. It is to know how to fall from the ladder. It's not like the
        foolish people who, when they fall from a ladder, break their necks and
        all their limbs. Even those who have studied a lot and travel about,
        giving articulate talks in monastery halls, can still fall from the
        ladder and break their bones. They can't compare with those who have
        been interested in the right way, even if it's only in this one matter.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now in the event of accidental death,
        such as getting run over by a car, having a building collapse on top of
        you, being gored in the rear by a bull or getting blown up by an atom
        bomb, what should you do? If you have even a little intelligence you'll
        see that it's exactly the same. If there is even a tiny amount of
        awareness left, in that moment resolve on the remainderless extinction.
        Through having previously developed the feeling that there is nothing
        worth having or being, until it is completely fluent and natural to you,
        on reaching the moment of death, you will be able to bring it to mind
        for a split second before the end. For example, someone run over by a
        car doesn't die immediately, there is always an interval even if it's
        only a fraction of a second or a single thought-moment, and for the
        flash of feeling resolving on remainderless extinction that is plenty of
        time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now suppose that death occurs in an
        instant with no feeling at all, well that itself is the remainderless
        extinction! As I have already explained we have already trained in the
        normal times to keep this feeling that nothing is worth having or being
        constantly in the mind, so that when the body meets death with no
        opportunity to think or feel anything, that awareness already being
        present there will be the remainderless extinction. But if there is even
        one thought-moment or half a second, then we can think comfortably. So
        don't be cowardly, don't be afraid! Don't let cowardice and fear sap our
        strength: &quot;please may I go with you doctor&quot;, &quot;take me to
        the hospital&quot; and so on. If you go you'll die there just the same,
        it's a waste of time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Against unnatural death, dying not
        wanting to die, dying unexpectedly, the sublime Dhamma can not only
        provide an infallible protection, but can provide Nibbana right here
        under the wheels of the car, beneath the collapsing building, at the
        horns of the bull or in the pile of bodies charred by the atomic blast.
        There is no violent unnatural death, instead there is Nibbana.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who have studied a little, know a
        little, right down to grandma and grand-dad who can't read are all
        capable of understanding this teaching and should keep training in this
        correct understanding.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now as for the death of those of perfect
        knowledge and truth-discerning awareness, those who have studied
        sufficiently and are proficient both in the theory and practice of
        Dhamma, for such people it doesn't have to be a matter of leaping as
        they fall from the ladder. They are deathless from the start, from
        before any illness. Through having attained a high level of Dhamma since
        long before, they have no death.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If a person has such abundant knowledge
        then when the time of death truly arrives, his preparations will be much
        better than those who have to leap as they fall from the ladder. Knowing
        how to establish mindfulness and self-awareness that is incorruptible he
        may laugh contemptuously at death. it might be called descending the
        ladder rung by rung and is the way of the one with perfect knowledge.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now I should like to talk about the way
        that the sick and diseased should prepare themselves for death. When one
        knows that death is inevitable, such as when suffering from a terminal
        illness like tuberculosis, one should make the very best of it with
        mindfulness and self-awareness, without cowardice or fear.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I'd like to relate to you an account I
        once came across of the way that people in the time of Buddha prepared
        for death. For those people who kept the precepts of Virtuous Conduct
        fasting was not at all difficult because they were used to abstaining
        from an evening meal on Uposatha days. When their illness reached the
        point that they felt that they had no more than ten days left they would
        stop eating. Not like us. These days, if someone is close to death we go
        out and look for the most expensive and delicious foods, so that some
        people even die prematurely from the food. Their efforts to avoid food
        were for the purpose of having a mind completely undisturbed. When the
        body starts to run down it loses it's ability to digest food and so
        anything consumed turns to poison, making the mind restless and
        confused.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So they prepared themselves for death by
        abstaining from food and taking only water or medicine. As death got
        closer, they would stop taking even water or medicine in order to focus
        their mindfulness and truth-discerning awareness, so as to die in the
        way of remainderless extinction.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">People who cling to goodness and virtue
        prepare themselves to die by clinging to goodness and virtue. The wise
        prepare themselves to let go and meet the remainderless extinction.
        There is nothing that they want: injecting drugs to extend their lives
        would be a great irritation. This is relinquishing the body (sankharas).
        Relinquishing the body while still alive they prepare to make the best
        of its disintegration by acquiescing in remainderless extinction.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for us these days, we mill around the
        doctor in a tumult, sometimes until the room is packed tight, trying to
        get the dying person to take medicines or eat or have injections. We try
        to do so many things that the sick person becomes anxious and flustered
        and has no peace of mind. He doesn't know how he is going to die or
        whether in fact he will die at all. There is nothing but doubt and
        anxiety. The sick person does not experience victory over death, he does
        not realize emptiness or the remainderless extinction that I have been
        speaking of.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unlike the people of the Buddha's time,
        people today usually look for the most comfortable bed, the most
        comfortable room, the most expensive foods and medicines, and then die
        with a great fuss. They want to go on living, to put off their death
        even if it's only for a single minute. They start having all sorts of
        injections and treatments and die with no mindfulness or self-awareness.
        It is the action of delusion.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To die in the right way we must be brave
        with Dhamma and die having victory over death, die realizing emptiness
        in the last second of life. Please remember well, there is an
        opportunity right up to the last moment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">These then are the ways of practice
        divided into three moments or occasions.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. The 'normal' times when we are
          doing our normal tasks.<br>
          2. The moments of sense contact -how to deal with it so as to produce
          emptiness.<br>
          3. The moment of death - what to do when the five 'aggregates' khandas
          meet their inevitable disintegration.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are things that should be brought
        up and thought about, spoken about and discussed regularly in the same
        way that we can chat about radio and television programs, and the
        general goings-on of the world. People who like boxing can get so
        excited talking about it that they can't get the words out quickly
        enough. Why is it that we can talk about those things all day and night
        and yet when it comes down to something as important as this we don't
        discuss it at all? Why don't we ever talk about fighting with death, of
        having victory over it and being free of both death and birth? If we did
        it would become much easier straight away. If we talk about and discuss
        these things as much as we discuss other matters, in no great time the
        practice will become truly easy. If we follow the correct method
        everything will be easy, even attaining Nibbana or leaping as we fall
        from the ladder.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To sum up, we must understand correctly
        the meanings of the phrases 'empty', 'realizing emptiness', 'abiding
        with emptiness', 'being naturally empty' and 'being emptiness' itself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Emptiness is present in all things: it
        is their characteristic. If the mind is empty of grasping at and
        clinging to all things, then it is itself emptiness, the remainderless
        extinction of 'I' and 'mine' and there is no more birth.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here I will bring to an end this talk on
        the practice that leads to 'emptiness'.</font></p>
