  <b><font color="#000080"><p></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">1. From
  John Kahila (talk.religion.buddhism newsgroup):</font></b><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Are all Buddhists vegetarians?</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">No. The First Precept admonishes us to refrain from
  killing, but meat eating is not regarded as an instance of killing, and it is not
  forbidden in the scriptures. (We are speaking here mainly of the Pali scriptures. Some of
  the Mahayana scriptures, notably the Lankavatara Sutra, take a strong position in favor of
  vegetarianism. <em>Also see Note below</em>) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As recorded in the Pali scriptures, the Buddha did not
  prohibit consumption of meat, even by monks. In fact, he explicitly rejected a suggestion
  from Devadatta to do so. In modern Theravada societies, a bhikkhu who adheres to
  vegetarianism to impress others with his superior spirituality may be committing an
  infringement of the monastic rules. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, the Buddha categorically prohibited
  consumption of the flesh of any animal that was &quot;seen, heard or suspected&quot; to
  have been killed specifically for the benefit of monks (Jivaka Sutta, Majjhima Nikaya 55).
  This rule technically applies only to monastics, but it can be used as a reasonable guide
  by devout lay people. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To understand this &quot;middle path&quot; approach to
  meat-eating, we have to remember that there were no &quot;Buddhists&quot; in Shakyamuni's
  time. There were only mendicants of various kinds (including the Buddha's disciples), plus
  lay people who gave them alms out of respect without necessarily worrying about the brand
  name of the teachings. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If meat was what a householder chose to offer, it was to
  be accepted without discrimination or aversion. To reject such an offering would be an
  offense against hospitality and would deprive the householder of an opportunity to gain
  merit -- and it could not benefit the animal, because it was already dead. Even the Jains
  may have had a similar outlook during the same period of history, despite the strict
  doctrine of ahimsa. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vegetarianism could not become a source of serious
  controversy in the bhikkhu sangha until the rise of fixed-abode monastic communities in
  which the monks did not practice daily alms-round. Any meat provided to such a community
  by lay people would almost certainly have been killed specifically for the monks. That may
  be one reason for the difference in Mahayana and Theravada views on meat eating -- the
  development of monastic communities of this type occurred principally within Mahayana. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The issue of meat eating raises difficult ethical
  questions. Isn't the meat in a supermarket or restaurant killed &quot;for&quot; us?
  Doesn't meat eating entail killing by proxy? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Few of us are in a position to judge meat eaters or anyone
  else for &quot;killing by proxy.&quot; Being part of the world economy entails
  &quot;killing by proxy&quot; in every act of consumption. The electricity that runs our
  computers comes from facilities that harm the environment. Books of Buddhist scriptures
  are printed on paper produced by an industry that destroys wildlife habitat. Worms,
  insects, rodents and other animals are routinely killed en masse in the course of
  producing the staples of a vegetarian diet. Welcome to samsara. It is impossible for most
  of us to free ourselves from this web; we can only strive to be mindful of entanglement in
  it. One way to do so is to reflect on how the suffering and death of sentient beings
  contributes to our comfort. This may help us to be less inclined to consume out of mere
  greed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">All of that having been said, it cannot be denied that the
  economic machine which produces meat also creates fear and suffering for a large number of
  animals. It is useful to bear this in mind even if one consumes meat, to resist developing
  a habit of callousness. Many Buddhists (especially Mahayanists) practice vegetarianism as
  a means of cultivating compassion. The Jivaka Sutta hints that one could also make a good
  case for vegetarianism starting from any of the other brahmaviharas (loving-kindness,
  sympathetic joy, equanimity). Interestingly, it is loving-kindness rather than compassion
  that is mentioned first in the Jivaka Sutta. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you are considering trying out vegetarianism for the
  first time, we suggest discussing it with someone who has experience. There are a few
  issues that ought to be considered regarding balanced diet, etc. </font></p>
  <b><font color="#000080"><p></font><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Note (by Binh Anson):</b>
  The Lankavatara Sutra, although recorded the Buddha's teaching in Lanka (Sri Lanka), is
  essentially a product of later Mahayana development. According to H. Nakamura (Indian
  Buddhism, 1987), there are several versions of this sutra, one fairly different in content
  from the other. Most scholars concluded that this sutra was likely compiled in 350-400 CE.
  In addition, according the the popular Zen master D.T. Suzuki (The Lankavatara Sutra - A
  Mahayana Text, 1931), the chapter dealing with meat eating was indeed added much later in
  subsequent versions. He also agreed that this sutra was not the authentic words by the
  Buddha, but was compiled much later by unknown authors following Mahayana's philosophy.</em></font><b><font

  <hr>
  <p></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">2. From Ven. S. Dhammika
  (Australian BuddhaNet):</font></b><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Vegetarianism</i></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are differences of opinion between Buddhists on this
  issue so we will attempt to present the arguments of those who believe that vegetarianism
  is necessary for Buddhists and those who do not. Vegetarianism was not a part of the early
  Buddhist tradition and the Buddha himself was not a vegetarian. The Buddha got his food
  either by going on alms rounds or by being invited to the houses of his supporters and in
  both cases he ate what he was given. Before his enlightenment he had experimented with
  various diets including a meatless diet, but he eventually abandoned them believing that
  they did not contribute to spiritual development. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Nipata Sutta underlines this point when it says that
  it is immorality that makes one impure (morally and spiritually), not the eating of meat.
  The Buddha is often described as eating meat, he recommended meat broth as a cure for
  certain types of illness and advised monks for practical reasons, to avoid certain types
  of meat, implying that other types were quite acceptable. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, Buddhists gradually came to feel uncomfortable
  about meat eating. In 257 BC King Asoka said that in contrast to before, only two peacocks
  and a deer were killed to provide food in the royal kitchens and that in time even this
  would be stopped. By the beginning of the Christian era meat eating had become
  unacceptable, particularly amongst the followers of the Mahayana although the polemics
  against it in works like the Lankavatara Sutra indicates that it was still widespread or a
  least a point of controversy <em>(see footnote in the previous section)</em>. Tantric text
  dating from the 7th and 8th centuries onward, frequently recommend both drinking alcohol
  and eating meat and both are considered fit to offer to gods. This was probably as much an
  expression of the freedom from convention which Tantra taught as it was a protest against
  Mahayanists to whom practices like abstaining from drink and meat had become a substitute
  for genuine spiritual change. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today it is often said that Mahayanists are vegetarian and
  Theravadins are not. However the situation is a little more complex than that. Generally
  Theravadins have no dietary restrictions although it is not uncommon to find monks and lay
  people in Sri Lanka who are strict vegetarians. Others abstain from meat while eating
  fish. Chinese and Vietnamese monks and nuns are strictly vegetarian and the lay community
  try to follow their example although many do not. Amongst Tibetans and Japanese Buddhists,
  vegetarianism is rare. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists who insist on vegetarianism have a simple and
  compelling argument to support their case. Eating meat encourages an industry that causes
  cruelty and death to millions of animals and a truly compassionate person would wish to
  mitigate all this suffering. By refusing to eat meat one can do just that. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who believe that vegetarianism is not necessary for
  Buddhists have equally compelling although more complex arguments to support their view:
  (1) If the Buddha had felt that a meatless diet was in accordance with the Precepts he
  would have said so and in the Pali Tipitaka at least, he did not. (2) Unless one actually
  kills an animal oneself (which seldom happens today) by eating meat one is not directly
  responsible for the animal's death and in this sense the non- vegetarian is no different
  from the vegetarian. The latter can only eat his vegetables because the farmer has
  ploughed his fields (thus killing many creatures) and sprayed the crop (again killing many
  creatures). (3) While the vegetarian will not eat meat he does use numerous other products
  that lead to animals being killed (soap, leather, serum, silk etc.) Why abstain from one
  while using the others? (4) Good qualities like understanding, patience, generosity and
  honesty and bad qualities like ignorance, pride, hypocrisy, jealousy and indifference do
  not depend on what one eats and therefore diet is not a significant factor in spiritual
  development. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some will accept one point of view and some another. Each
  person has to make up his or her own mind. </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em>Is there something spiritually
  wholesome about being a vegetarian?</em></strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I'm aware there are some people whom are vegetarians here.
  Being somewhat health conscious myself, I'm almost one too. However, I can see that there
  are some seem to hold a view that I think they might like to reconsider -- i.e. the view
  that there is something spiritually wholesome about being a vegetarian. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To all those who hold such a view, please read this: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the suttas (discourses) clearly shows, the Buddha
  himself -- with his great wisdom -- did not ask his disciples, renunciate or lay, to be
  vegetarians. And so, you might like to reconsider that view that there is something
  spiritually wholesome about being a vegetarian. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha himself was not a vegetarian. And so, you might
  like to reconsider that view that there is something spiritually wholesome about being a
  vegetarian. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some may argue that somewhere along the line someone might
  have modified the suttas. It would seem quite unlikely, as the Suttas (of the Theravada
  tradition at least) are brought to the present by a very large group of monks, not
  individuals. As such they can check each other for deviations. One person can't change
  anything without the agreement from others. For about 500 years the purity of the suttas
  was maintained by the oral tradition by large groups of chanting monks. When it eventually
  had to be put into writing in the first century due to wars, the monks who have such faith
  and respect for the Buddha would certainly have made much effort to ensure accuracy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Assuming that despite all that, some people did attempt to
  modify the suttas, it wound have been quite impossible as there's *not* even a *single*
  trace in the voluminous Tipitika (the Vinaya, Sutta, and Abhidhamma Pitakas) which even
  suggests that the Buddha advised on being vegetarians. And so, you might like to
  reconsider that view that there is something spiritually wholesome about being a
  vegetarian.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even if the above cannot convince you, try asking yourself
  this: &quot;Why do I consider being a vegetarian to be spiritually wholesome?&quot; You
  may say that &quot;If I eat meat, I would be indirectly encouraging killing of
  animals&quot;; or that, &quot;If I eat meat, I would be indirectly a killer&quot;; or that
  &quot;If I'm a vegetarian, it would mean that less animals will be killed.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Noble considerations, I must admit. But let's examine this
  further to gain a better perspective. Try asking yourself this: &quot;Where do my
  vegetables come from?&quot; &quot;From farms,&quot; you might say. To prepare the soil for
  cultivation, wouldn't it have to be tilled? And when the plants are grown, wouldn't
  pesticides have to be sprayed? Wouldn't all that kill lots of animals, though they may be
  smaller and seem insignificant to humans? Don't they suffer too? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some may still continue to argue that one should get one's
  vegetables from hydroponic farms. A good argument, I must admit. But let's examine this
  further to gain a better perspective. Such farms use much water -- for the sake of the
  plants, for the sake of washing things, for the sake of keeping the place clean, and
  others. Wouldn't such use of water kill lots of animals too, though they may be smaller
  and seem insignificant to humans? Don't they suffer too? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And let's consider the boxes and pipes in which such
  farming is so dependent upon, and also the materials to built the green houses. They need
  to be manufactured. And so indirectly factories are needed; and so lands need to be
  cleared. Wouldn't all that kill lots of animals too, though they may be smaller and seem
  insignificant to humans? Don't they suffer too? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The machines and equipment needed by the factories too
  needs to be manufactured. And so indirectly more factories are needed; and so more lands
  need to be cleared. Wouldn't all that kill lots of animals too, though they may be smaller
  and seem insignificant to humans? Don't they suffer too? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's also further consider the supply of electricity,
  water, telecommunication services, and other infrastructures. Just consider all that needs
  to be done to supply those things. Wouldn't all that kill lots of animals too, though they
  may be smaller and seem insignificant to humans? Don't they suffer too? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And consider all those transporting this and that here and
  there that goes about to set up the factories and the factories for the factories, the
  infrastructures for all those factories, so that materials can be supplied to them, so
  that the boxes and pipes and the material to build the green houses can be made for the
  hydroponic farms, and that they may be sent to the farms, so that hydroponic vegetables
  can be cultivated, so that you may buy and eat them. Wouldn't all that kill even lots more
  animals, though they may be smaller and seem insignificant to humans? Don't they suffer
  too? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wouldn't it then be proper to consider that &quot;If I eat
  only vegetables I too would be indirectly encouraging killing of animals;&quot; or that,
  &quot;If I don't eat meat, I would be indirectly a killer too;&quot; or that &quot;If
  don't eat meat, it wouldn't mean that less animals will be killed. And in fact perhaps
  more are killed.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I could go on and on, but I should assume that you should
  get the message by now. And so, you might like to reconsider that view that there is
  something spiritually wholesome about being a vegetarian. We must understand: We live in
  'samsara'; and it's not called 'samsara' for no reason. In this world, there IS suffering.
  That the Buddha has declared. Its cause too has been declared. So has its end. And so has
  the way to the end of sufferings. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having drawn such reasonable arguments, some may *still*
  insist on arguing further that eating meat may reduce our craving (tanha), and so there
  must be something spiritually wholesome about being a vegetarian. I'd ask: &quot;Who says
  meat tastes better than vegetables?&quot; Have you tasted meat without any additives
  before? A raw carrot would taste much better. I myself can easily have more craving for
  chocolates than meat. I'd say durian (a local fruit) tastes much better. So it would not
  be proper to say that eating meat may reduce our craving. Besides, having aversion over a
  neutral thing such as meat seems quite unnecessary and even obstructive to one's spiritual
  progress. And so, you might like to reconsider that view that there is something
  spiritually wholesome about being a vegetarian. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consider what the Buddha said: &quot;Action (kamma) is
  intention (cetana).&quot; When we eat meat we do not think: &quot;Oh, may they kill more
  animals so that I may have more meat to eat. Never mind if being have to suffer and
  die.&quot; When we eat vegetables, fruits and other non-meat food, we do not think:
  &quot;Oh, may they plant more of such food. Never mind if beings have to suffer and
  die.&quot; When we eat, our intention is to eat. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, we may try practicing a few things: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">- We may be moderate with our intake. Not indulge more
    than what we really need. That's what the Buddha advised, and there is something
    spiritually wholesome about this; and not simply not eat meat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">- We may choose to eat only &quot;at the right time&quot;
    (dawn to noon). This is encouraged even for lay people on certain days. That's what the
    Buddha advised, and there is something spiritually wholesome about this; and not simply
    not eat meat. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">- When we eat we may eat mindfully, chew mindfully, taste
    mindfully and swallow mindfully. This would then help us eat without craving and
    strengthen our mindfulness. That's what the Buddha advised, and there is something
    spiritually wholesome about this; and not simply not eat meat. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you choose to be a vegetarian, well go ahead. Do check
  with other knowledgeable vegetarians about having a balanced vegetarian diet. You need to
  make sure that you have adequate protein, B12, and zinc. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But for your own sake, do not hold to that view that there
  is something spiritually wholesome about being a vegetarian. Also, it would certainly not
  be wise to think oneself superior due to one's choice of food. Check yourself whenever you
  see others eat meat. Furthermore, it would be definitely improper to impose such wrong
  view upon others. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This message has been written to inform, and not criticize
  or offend. Hope it has been regarded in proper light.</font></p>

  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>4. &nbsp;From John Bullitt </strong><em>(Access-to-Insight,
  <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/">http://www.accesstoinsight.org</a> ) <strong>&nbsp;
  &nbsp;</strong></em></font></p>
  <p><strong><em><font face="Times New Roman">Are Buddhists vegetarian?</font></em></strong></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some are, some aren't. As far as I know, there is no
  evidence in the Pali Canon to suggest that the Buddha prohibited his lay followers from
  eating meat. The first of the five precepts concerns the intentional act of depriving a
  living being of life, but has nothing to do with consuming the flesh of an animal that is
  already dead. From the Theravada Buddhist perspective, the choice of whether or not to eat
  meat is thus purely a matter of personal preference. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although Theravada monks are indeed forbidden to eat
  certain kinds of meat,[1] they are not expected to practice vegetarianism, since their
  food is provided by the generosity of lay supporters,[2] who may or may not themselves be
  vegetarian.[3] Theravada monks are not required to eat everything that is placed in their
  alms-bowl, so a monk intent on pursuing vegetarianism may simply ignore the meat in his
  bowl. In parts of Asia where vegetarianism is unheard of, however, vegetarian monks would
  soon face a choice: eat meat or starve. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Taking part in killing for food (hunting, fishing,
  trapping, etc.) is definitely incompatible with the first precept, and should be avoided. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But what if I eat -- or just purchase -- meat: aren't I
  simply encouraging someone else to do the killing for me? How can this possibly be
  consistent with the Buddhist principle of non-harming, that cornerstone of Right Resolve?
  [4] This is tricky. I personally believe it would be wrong to order someone, &quot;Please
  kill that chicken for me!&quot;, since it incites that person to break the first
  precept.[5] Surely this is unskillful kamma. (Keep this in mind whenever you're tempted to
  order fresh shellfish at a restaurant.) But purchasing a piece of dead animal meat is
  another matter. Although my purchase may indeed help keep the butcher in business, I am <i>not</i>
  asking him to kill on my behalf. Whether he kills another cow tomorrow is his choice, not
  mine. This is a difficult but important point, one that reveals the fundamental
  distinction between personal choices (choices aimed at altering my own behavior) and
  political ones (those aimed at altering others' behavior). Each one of us must discover
  for ourselves where lies the boundary between the two. It is crucial to remember, however,
  that the Buddha's teachings are, first and foremost, tools to help us learn to make good
  personal choices (kamma); they are not prescriptions for political action. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We could not survive long in this world without bringing
  harm of one sort or another to other creatures. No matter how carefully we trod, countless
  insects, mites, and other creatures inadvertently perish under our feet with every step.
  Where, then, do we even begin to draw the line between &quot;acceptable&quot; and
  &quot;unacceptable&quot; harm? The Buddha's answer was very clear and very practical: the
  five precepts. He didn't ask his followers to become vegetarian (although many do
  gradually lose an appetite for meat); he simply asked us to observe the precepts. For many
  of us, this is challenge enough. This is where we begin. </font></p>
