    religious practice, none exemplifies Buddhism better than the practice of meditation.
    Anesaki and Takakusu claim that meditation is &quot;...the universal method of mental
    culture of all Indian religious schools, &quot;(1) and Edward Conze writes,
    &quot;meditational practices constitute the very core of the Buddhist approach to life....
    On the way to Nirvaa.na they serve to promote spiritual development, to diminish the
    impact of suffering, to calm the mind and to reveal the true facts of existence.&quot;(2)</font><p><font
    face="Times New Roman">This article is an attempt to analyze the structure of Buddhist
    meditation within the Paali suttas. Our contention is that this structure is built around
    two foci--control and freedom. The ultimate aim of Buddhist meditation is freedom from the
    bondage of attachment to sense objects. This liberating state of being is reached through
    a process of consciousness control (samaadhi) and insight into the real nature of the
    world (vipassanaa). While Theravaada Buddhism tends to distinguish samaadhi and vipassanaa
    as two separate types of meditation, both aim to achieve enlightenment (sambodha) .
    Furthermore, as this article will show, they may be seen as basically complementary rather
    than as mutually exclusive methods.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The structure of Buddhist meditation, which emerges from a
    study of the Paali suttas, may be depicted by an hourglass figure(3):</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The path to enlightenment begins with a general awareness
    and proceeds to a greater and greater degree of consciousness refinement. This process
    produces decreasing degrees of attachment to the world of sense objects. The jhaanas
    represent a transition from a narrowing of consciousness to its eventual expansion
    resulting in a condition of &quot;hedonic neutrality,&quot; that is, upekkhaa. In this
    state the consciousness is totally freed (cetovimutti) from those conditions which qualify
    ordinary states of mind. It is characterized as immeasurable, nothingness, emptiness, and
    signless. In this mind-freed state, the knowledge of enlightenment (pa~n~naavimutti) is
    fully realized. Or, in a better knowledge of engligtenment (pa~n~n- aavimutti) is fully
    realized. Or, in a better known idiom, one has attained nibbaana.</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">SATI AND MINDFUL AWARENESS</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The process of meditation and the control of consciousness
    begin with sati and sampaja~n~na, two practically inseparable terms in the Paali canon.(4)
    They are widely discussed in the Pi.takas and later commentaries, and according to</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">a contemporary Buddhist one of the suttas devoted entirely
    to an exposition of sati and sampaja~n~na is among the most highly respected and
    frequently memorized Buddhist texts in Ceylon.(5) The Paali word sati is related to
    Sanskrit sm.rti, meaning &quot;remembered&quot; or &quot;recollected.&quot; In Hinduism
    the word has come to stand for a body of &quot;remembered&quot; literature (for example,
    the Epics, suutras, Puraa.nas) in contrast to &quot;revealed&quot; or `sruti texts (for
    example, Sa^mitaas, Braahma.nas, Upani.sads). The term in Paali has taken on, not only the
    connotation of something called to mind or remembered, but also mindfulness, intentness of
    mind, or wakeful- ness.(6) Nyaa.naponika interprets sati as &quot;bare attention&quot; and
    sampaja~n~na as &quot;clear comprehension.&quot;(7) Sati as bare attention has a threefold
    value of helping the mind to know, shape, and liberate itself.(8) Its knowing function is
    to analyze the objects of existence through dissection and discrimination and realize the
    conditioned and conditioning nature of all phenomenal entities. Sati shapes individual's
    lives by causing reflective action rather than immediate responses. Thus the mind gains a
    new power and a new freedom from control by habitual action-response. As Nyaa.naponika
    expresses it, &quot;Right Mindfulness recovers for man the lost pearl of his freedom
    snatching it from the jaws of the dragon Time.&quot;(9) The third value of sati is the
    freeing of the mind. Paradoxically the control of attention and reflection liberates the
    mind rather than confining it, for it is sati that produces the insight (vipassanaa) into
    the true nature of things. This realization leads to detachment from ordinary
    preoccupation with the objects and goals of the mundane world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If sati, or bare attention, is a discipline of the
    consciousness appropriate to the act of meditation itself, sampaja~n~na call be understood
    as the integration of sati with right knowledge (~naa.na) or wisdom (pa~n~naa).
    Sampaja~n~na is applied to intentionality and action in particular, and more generally to
    the awareness that at no time is there an abiding personality or ego behind one's
    intentions and actions. The sampaja~n~na dimension of mindfulness emphasizes the fact that
    the fundamental nonbeingness (anattaa) of life is not limited to a serene moment of
    detached and quiet meditation, but conditions every act and thought of the individual.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Within the Nikaayas there are three suttas devoted
    entirely to a discussion of sati and sampaja~n~na: the Mahaasatipa.t.thaana Suttanta of
    the Diigha Nikaaya,</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">the Satipa.t.thaana Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaaya and the
    forty-seventh chapter of the Sa^myutta Nikaaya (Kindred Sayings on the Arisings of
    Mindfulness). The first Sutta in particular will serve as our guide for a more detailed
    exposition of sati.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Mahaasatipa.t.thaana Suttanta is nearly identical with
    the Satipa.t.tana Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaaya with the exception of an exposition of the
    Four Noble Truths at its conclusion. We are told at the beginning of this dialogue that
    the only path leading to the purification of beings, of passing beyond grief and
    lamentation, of the dying out of suffering and misery and the realization of nibbaana is
    the fourfold setting up of mindfulness.(10) In order to come to grips with the full
    dimension of sati these four stages of mindfulness must be analyzed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the first place, mindfulness demands a control of the
    body (kaaya) which overcomes the desire and misery typical of the world.(11) This end is
    accomplished by practices of meditation and concentration. The bhikkhu is to isolate
    himself, assume a posture of meditation, and practice breathing exercises with a total
    consciousness of every act so that the bodily organism will be tranquilized.(12)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness of the body begins with awareness of
    respiration. The Buddhist preoccupation with respiration exercises represents a continuity
    with earlier Indian thought. In the late.Rg Veda and the Braahma.nas, breath was one of
    the objects of cosmogonic speculation, the life force through which it was thought the
    world might have come into being.(13) Breathing exercises (praa.naayaama) also played an
    important role in Hindu ha.tha yoga. There the practice was eventually to arrest the
    movement of inhalation and exhalation. The purpose of breath control in yoga, however, was
    not merely to gain power over respiratory functions but access to higher states of
    consciousness. Thus Bhoja's commentary on the Yoga Suutras of Pata~njali reads: &quot;All
    the functions of the organs being preceded by that of respiration--there being always a
    connection between respiration and consciousness in their respective
    functions--respiration, when all the functions of the organs are suspended, realizes
    concentration of consciousness on a single object.&quot;(14)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Breathing exercises as the initiation of sati seem to have
    a dual function not unlike that in the practice of ha.tha yoga, namely, to engender
    control over the body but also to produce an awareness of the real nature of the</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">body. As Nyaa.naponika Thera observes, the mindfulness of
    breathing is both a subject for ''tranquility-meditation&quot; (samathabhaavanaa) as well
    as an act used for the development of insight (vipassanaabhaavanaa).(15)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Following the initiation of mindfulness through breathing
    exercises, the Mahaasatipa.t.thaana Suttanta moves to contemplation of various aspects of
    the body and its functions. They are in brief: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) mindfulness of bodily postures; <br>
      2) contemplation of the parts of the body, <br>
      3) reflection on the constituent elements of the body, and <br>
      4) the so-called cemetery contemplations. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Turning first to the mindfulness of bodily postures the
    bhikkhu is enjoined to contemplate (anupassanaa) the body internally and externally as
    something that comes into being and passes away again.(16) Furthermore, such contemplation
    should accompany every act so that &quot;...when [the bhikkhu] is walking, [he] is aware
    of it thus:--`I walk'; or when he is standing, or sitting, or lying down, he is aware of
    it.&quot;(17) The purpose of the mindfulness of the bodily postures is to gain the
    knowledge (~naa.na) that he dwells independent, grasping after nothing in the world.(18)
    Awareness of bodily postures, therefore, should produce such a total self-awareness in the
    adept that &quot;In going, standing, sitting, sleeping, watching, talking or keeping
    silence he knows (sampajaana) what he is doing.&quot;(19) This total self-knowledge is
    directed toward two ends: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) an acknowledgment of the impermanence of the body (its
      arising and decay); and <br>
      2) an independence (anissito) from any attachment to the phenomenal world.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The contemplation of the parts of the body is an extension
    of mindfulness regarding the body and its functions. It begins with an enumeration of
    various physical organs and bodily products ranging from hair to the heart to urine. This
    description of the body and its parts is likened to a bag filled with various kinds of
    grain which can be separated out and identified: &quot;...And a keen-eyed man... reflects
    as he pour(s) them out:--'that's rice, that's paddy, those are beans,' and so forth. Even
    so, bhikkhus, does a brother reflect on the body from the soles of the feet below upward
    to the crown of the head, as something enclosed in skin and full of divers
    impurities.&quot;(20)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Reflection on the parts of the body becomes even more
    discriminating or analytical, however. From physical parts, the bhikkhu moves his
    attention to the fundamental bases (dhaatu) or constituent elements of which the body is
    composed. In the Theravaada scheme of things these basic elements are</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">four--earth, water, heat, and air. Mindfulness of the fact
    that the body is composed of these elements is likened to the butcher who, when he has
    slain an ox, displays the carcass piece by piece.(21) There appears to be a twofold
    purpose behind the development of mindfulness regarding the various parts and constituent
    elements of the body: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) the knowledge that no abiding ego exists in the body
      but only those parts that can be observed and inferred from this observation, and <br>
      2) the essentially &quot;vile&quot; and impermanent nature of the body.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This second purpose is carried to even greater extremes in
    the fourth aspect of bodily mindfulness, the cemetery contemplations. Here the bhikkhu is
    enjoined to contemplate his own body as though it were undergoing ever increasing degrees
    of decomposition after death. Initially he contemplates a body abandoned in a graveyard
    which is swollen and turning black and blue; then a body which has been partially eaten by
    wild animals; and finally a body which has been reduced to a mere heap of bones.(22) All
    of these contemplations are symbols of the transient nature of the body.(23)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second stage of mindfulness is to arrive at the same
    degree of awareness of the true nature of the feelings (vedanaa) as was developed by the
    body. The bhikkhu must be able to distinguish among feelings that are pleasurable (sukha)
    , painful (dukkha), or neutral as well as feelings concerning either spiritual (saamisa)
    or material (niraamisa) things.(24) All of these types of vedanaa are subject to arising
    and dying away, just as is the body; hence, they are transient, ephemeral. Mindfulness of
    feelings, consequently, just as mindfulness regarding the body, produces a detachment, an
    independence from the things of this world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After subjecting the body (kaaya) and the feelings
    (vedanaa) to the kind of objective scrutiny that leads to an understanding of their true
    nature, the bhikkhu developing mindfulness turns his attention to citta, &quot;...the
    ever-changing, ever-active continuance of consciousness, or reacting
    intelligence&quot;(25)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">and also to dhamma, the ideas, cognizable objects or
    presentations beyond the stage of mere sensory reaction.(26) Regarding the citta or
    conscious thinking process the monk must become aware of its various modes, for example,
    lustful, dull, intelligent, attentive, or distrait. That this awareness or knowledge of
    the states of the mind is for the purpose of control is illustrated by the following
    passage from the Vitakkasanthaana Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaaya:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">...if while the monk is attending to the thought function
    and form of those thoughts, there still arise evil unskilled thoughts associated with
    desire and associated with aversion and associated with confusion, ...that monk, his teeth
    clenched, his tongue pressed against his palate, should by his mind subdue, restrain and
    dominate his mind (citta).(27)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through awareness directed toward the mind, the monk is
    enabled both to understand and subdue or control the mind or consciousness (citta). It is
    recognized that citta as well as kaaya and vedanaa comes into being but then passes
    away.(28)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Regarding the dhamma or ideas, the Mahaasatipa.t.thaana
    Suttanta specifically mentions five groups: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) the five hindrances (niivara.na), <br>
      2) the five groups (khandha), <br>
      3) the five spheres of sense (aayatana) , <br>
      4) the seven factors of enlightenment and, <br>
      5) the four Aryan truths. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All of these groups of dhamma are to be reflected upon
    with the same scrutiny as body, feelings, and mind with the intent purpose of leading the
    monk to an independence where he grasps after nothing in the world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Directing his attention toward the five aggregates
    (khandha) , the bhikkhu considers individually their arising and passing away until in a
    state of non-grasping he attains to mindfulness. Contemplating the six aayatanas or the
    internal and external spheres of sense, the monk is made aware that any fetters that bind
    him to the world are a result of the coming together of the organs of sense and the
    objects of sense. By his analysis he becomes of the arising and the putting aside of all
    fetters. Of the seven factors of enlightenment the bhikkhu must grow aware &quot;... if
    they are subjectively present, or absent, and he is aware of how there comes an uprising
    of any factor not hitherto uprisen, and of how there comes a full development of such
    factors when it has arisen.&quot;(29) Finally the Mahaasatipa.t.thaana Suttanta expounds
    the four Aryan truths, which must also be considered in terms of the same pattern of their
    arising and passing away.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What in belief is the purpose of sati-sampaja~n~na? In
    general terms mind- fulness produces a profound self-awareness. More specifically it is
    intended to produce a detachment from the world of sense through controlling the sensory
    inputs, and realizing the fundamental impermanence or nonbeingness (anattaa) of existence.
    Mindfulness, therefore, offers both a theoretical and practical means for the
    &quot;...realization of that liberating truth of no-self (anattaa), having the two aspects
    of egolessness and voidness of substance.&quot;(30) This realization is a &quot;lived
    understanding.&quot; That is, it is arrived at through a carefully graded program in which
    control of the senses is coupled with an objective, discriminating knowing. The method of
    mindfulness conjoins psychomental programming, epistemological shifts, and ontological
    transformation. It lays the groundwork for later developments, in the meditative life.</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">SAMAADHI AND ONEPOINTEDNESS</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Samaadhi represents a greater degree of control over the
    mind or consciousness (citta, vi~n~naa.na) than sati. As the word itself (sam-aa-dhaa)
    denotes, samaadhi is a bringing together, a concentration of the mind in contrast to the
    more general practice of mindfulness (sati). In early Buddhism the important relationship
    between samaadhi as the process whereby one concentrates his thoughts and controls his
    consciousness and siila or the ethical and moral behavior of the religious man is a
    general assumption. For our purposes, however, samaadhi has crucial implications for the
    higher goals of the salvation-quest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Subha Sutta of the Diigha Nikaaya the young
    Brahman, Subha, asks AAnanda to expound the doctrine regarding samaadhi. The resulting
    answer includes elements which overlap with other categories of this exposition, but
    several points are made which will serve as a basis for our discussion of samaadhi.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the first place the sutta affirms that one practices
    samaadhi by guarding the doors of the senses.(31) This particular practice is described as
    follows: when the monk sees an object with his eye he is not grasped either by its general
    appearance or by its details; he restrains whatever factor might cause the arising of evil
    elemental reactions; so restraining his sense of sight he attains mastery over his sense
    of sight.(32) In a similar fashion he controls his other sense organs: &quot;... when he
    hears a sound with his ear, or smells an odor with his nose or tastes a flavor with his
    tongue or feels a touch with his body, or cognizes (vi~n~naaya) a phenomenon (dhamma) with
    his mind he is not grasped either by the general appearance or the details of
    it.&quot;(33) By so restraining all of his senses, including the manas or conscious mind,
    he experiences an unblemished happiness. Having so restrained and guarded all the sense
    organs so that no element (dhamma) of the mundane world may claim him, the bhikkhu is now
    mindful (sati) and with clear comprehension (sampaja~n~na). As described in the Subha
    Sutta, therefore, samaadhi begins when the senses are no longer subject to the rule of the
    objects of sense.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Cuu.lavedalla Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaaya the
    layman Visakha asks the nun Dhammadinnaa, &quot;What is concentration (samaadhi), what are
    the distinguishing marks of concentration, what is the development of
    concentration?&quot;(34) To this question the wise nun replies that samaadhi is
    onepointedness of mind (cittassa ekaggataa), its marks the four objects of mindfulness,
    its requisites the four right efforts and that whatever leads to the increase of these is,
    in effect, the development of concentration. (35) This passage points to the close
    relationship between sati and samaadhi. That is, concentration appears to presuppose the
    four objects of mindfulness. Samaadhi, however, goes beyond the awareness of impermanence
    and sensory detachment produced by sati. It is a refined control of the consciousness, a
    concentration of the mind to a single point, thereby eliminating all extraneous thoughts.
    Buddhaghosa in applying the definition cittassa ekaggataa to samaadhi elaborates as
    follows: &quot;[samaadhi] is the centering of the consciousness and
    consciousness-concomitants evenly and rightly on a single object.&quot;(36) The man of
    concentrated (samaadhi) and one-pointed (ekaggataa) mind, therefore, stands in stark
    contrast to the profane man who is &quot;empty-headed, frivolous and loose in
    talk.&quot;(37)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Cuu.lavedalla Sutta's exposition of samaadhi also says
    that the requisites of concentration are the four right efforts. The four right efforts
    are described in various parts of the Nikaayas as follows: checking the rise of evil and
    wrong states of consciousness not yet arisen; shedding evil and wrong states that have
    already arisen; encouraging the rise of right states not yet arisen; ensuring that right
    states which are already there shall be multiplied and developed.(38) The four right
    efforts are frequently mentioned as one of the formula truths reported to have been
    perceived by the Buddha and passed on to his disciples.(39) While this formula does indeed
    point to a relationship between samaadhi and the production and retion of right
    constituent states of conscious being, it raises the broader issue of the place of
    samaadhi in a variety of conceptual structures illustrative of an enlightened state of
    mind. For instance all of the five iddhipaadas, the paths to the attainment of supranormal
    powers, are dependent on samaadhi.(40) The five forces (indriyaani) or organs of spiritual
    sense include samaadhi which is described by one Buddhist scholar as &quot;the dominant
    faculty, which brings about concentration of thoughts and makes the adept rise higher and
    higher in meditations.&quot;(41) Samaadhi is also the sixth of the seven factors leading
    to enlightenment,(42) and it has already been pointed out that concentration is one of the
    three major divisions of the Noble Eightfold Path. On the basis of the crucial role played
    by samaadhi in the formulae cited, it is arguable that concentration of mind is the
    necessary step to the attainment of a higher truth and the powers accompanying it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist adept who chooses the way of samaadhi begins
    his religious quest with a general awareness of the nature of the self and reality but
    must move beyond the state of objective detachment produced by this mindfulness. He must
    progress to a unity of concentration which eliminates the flow of sensory material into
    his conscious mind. By such a concentrated effort he is able to rise to higher forms of
    apperception, to a mystic intuition of a reality veiled to ordinary perception.(43)</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">JHAANA, STAGES TO THE ULTIMATE</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist meditation progresses from samaadhi to jhaana, or
    from concentration and onepointedness to the gradual expansion of the consciousness to
    hithertofore unexperienced dimensions. In the Paali Suttas, jhaana is often found as part
    of the formula of the four jhaanas, where it is translated as mental absorption or trance.
    By carefully analyzing this formula and the contexts in which it occurs, the significance
    of jhaana in relationship to the control of consciousness and saving-knowledge will become
    clear.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Brahmajaala Sutta a discussion of the four jhaanas
    occurs within the context of the question, &quot;How may the self or soul (atta) attain to
    the highest Nibbaana in this visible world?&quot; It is in answer to this question that an
    explication of the four jhaanas is set forth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this sutta it is accepted as an a priori condition of
    phenomenal existence that the self is subject to kaama or sensuous desires. It is also the
    case that sensuous desires are characterized by impermanence (anicca) . Phenomenal
    existence, therefore, necessarily involves suffering since sensory pleasures are
    constantly subject to change. The only way one can hope to achieve happiness and joy
    (piitisukha) is by cutting off kaama. In the first jhaana this state is accomplished by
    detachment (viveka) accompanied by reflection and investigation (vitakka-vicaara) . In
    order to understand this jhaana these three terms must be studied in some detail.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The term viveka has a threefold significance: a physical
    separation from the world in the sense of &quot;seclusion&quot;; an intellectual
    separation in the sense of &quot;discrimination&quot;; and an ethical separation in the
    sense of the mind (citta) &quot;being separate from the World.&quot;(44) For instance, in
    the Mahaasu~n~nataa Sutta the Buddha tells AAnanda that a bhikkhu who delights in society
    cannot enjoy well-being or emancipation of mind (cetovimutti) but that such happiness
    demands renunciation, solitude, and enlightenment (sambodha).(45) The Buddha claims that
    as a Tathaagata he has reached such a state of isolation (viveka) by dismissing thoughts
    of all attendant phenomena and by developing and dwelling in a state of emptiness
    (su~n~nataa).(46) The sutta goes on to say that a monk who likewise desires to develop and
    dwell in inward emptiness should calm, tranquilize, focus and concentrate his mind
    inwardly.(47) This sutta clearly indicates that viveka implies both a physical separation
    from the delights of ordinary worldly intercourse as well as an isolation of the mind
    (citta). It is interesting to note that the resultant separation is described as a
    condition of inward emptiness (su~n~nataa) since in the later Maadhyamika tradition the
    perspective on this important term will shift from a psychophysical emphasis to an
    ontological one.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Na.lakapaana Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaaya, viveka
    is described in terms of separation from sensuous desires and from the evil constituents
    of being. This separation is said to result in the attainment of joy and happiness. The
    Tathaagata who has reached such a state has overcome the attachments to the mundane world
    known as the aasavas, which produce the suffering of &quot;birth, old age and
    death.&quot;(48) Viveka, then, means a detachment from the world of sense with its
    accompanying desires and kammic resultants of rebirth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The terms vitakka and vicaara should be taken together. In
    fact T. W. Rhys Davids contends that by examining the use of these two words in earlier
    and later works, one concludes that they once had synonymous meanings.(49) They came to
    have slightly different intentions, however, with vitakka referring in particular to
    initial thought or observation and vicaara denoting continuing or sustained investigation
    and reflection. Together they are used to indicate &quot;...the whole of the mental
    process of thinking.&quot;(50)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Upakkilesa Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaaya both
    vitakka and vicaara are related to concentration (samaadhi). The Buddha is recorded as
    saying that by developing samaadhi in several modes beginning with vitakka and vicaara, he
    gained the knowledge (~naa.na) and the vision (dassana) that his final liberation
    (vimutti) was assured. Vitakka and vicaara, therefore are important to the concentration
    (samaadhi) of one's thoughts and act as one of the first steps toward the attainment of
    the apperception (dassana) of ultimate reality. They share with viveka the characteristics
    of directing the individual away from mere sensory reality. Thus in the Dasuttara Suttanta
    of the Diigha Nikaaya the eight thoughts (vitakka) of the great man (mahaapurisa) include
    the limitation of desires, detachment, and mental concentration.(51) As we shall see,
    however, vitakka can become dangerous. As the Sakkapa~nha Suttanta of the Diigha Nikaaya
    points out, vitakka can become a mental preoccupation which causes desire (chanda),(52)
    the root of attachment to the mundane World.(53)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In sum, the first jhaana is depicted primarily as a
    condition of detachment. It involves a physical, intellectual, and ethical separation from
    the phenomenal world. An important phase of the development of the concentration necessary
    to acquire the first jhaana is careful thought and analysis of one's self and the
    surrounding world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second jhaana is achieved when observation and
    investigation (vitakka and vicaara) are suppressed. In this stage these two mental
    functions are said to be o.laarika or gross, implying that they are necessarily involved
    in the empirical world. The second jhaana is characterized by joy and happiness
    (piitisukha) , born not of viveka or detachment but of samaadhi, translated by Rhys Davids
    in this passage as &quot;serenity.&quot;(54) This state is further characterized by a
    tranquil inner nature and a concentrated mind or heart.(55)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as the first jhaana was labeled gross (o.laarika)
    since it involved vitakka and vicaara, the second acquires the same rubric because it is
    characterized by joy (piiti) and an exhilaration of the heart.(56) The qualities which are
    found in one who attains to the third jhaana are equanimity (upekkhaa) and mindfulness
    (sati), &quot;self-possession&quot; (sampajaana), dispassion (viraaga), and an abiding
    happiness. Finally in the fourth jhaana the attention of the heart on happiness is
    transcended as is a concern with its opposite, dukkha or suffering.(57) Similarly the
    polarity of somanassa and domanassa or mental distress is overcome. The last jhaana is,
    therefore, composed of pure equanimity and mindfulness (upekkhaasatiparisuddhi)(58) and is
    &quot;a state where some maintain the complete happiness, in the visible world, of a
    living being.&quot;(59)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fourfold jhaana formula appears again in the
    Saama~n~naphala Sutta, the discourse on the fruits of the life of a sama.na or recluse. In
    this sutta the discussion of the jhaanas is preceded by an overcoming of the five
    hindrances or niivara.nas and is followed by the acquisition of supranormal powers or
    iddhi and abhi~n~naa (supranormal knowledge) as well as the overcoming of the aasavas. To
    understand more fully the role of jhaana within the scope of Buddhist soteriology, we
    shall examine in some detail the most important of the concepts in this sutta, namely,
    niivara.na, iddhi, abhi~n~naa, and aasava.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The classical formula of the five niivara.nas(60) as found
    in the Saama~n~naphala Sutta and elsewhere in the Nikaayas (for example, Diigha III, 49)
    is described as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) coveting the world, <br>
      2) malevolence and the desire to injure, <br>
      3) stolidity and slothfulness, <br>
      4) excitement and misdeeds and <br>
      5) wavering or doubt.(61) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One must overcome these hindrances so that in each case
    the mind may be purified. Separated from sensuous desires and evil elemental impulses the
    sama.na is enabled to enter into the sequence of the four jhaanas previously
    described.(62) With the exception of the fifth niivara.na the concern of this formula is
    clearly with those emotions which tend toward unreflective involvement in the phenomenal
    world. As Sa^myutta Nikaaya 5:83 puts it, the niivara.nas are conducive &quot;...to the
    still more becoming and growth thereof.&quot;(63) Involvement in the becoming of the
    phenomenal world supposes lack of insight or ignorance described as blindness and loss of
    sight. One who has not overcome the niivara.nas obviously is unable to acquire any degree
    of knowledge beyond that granted through the agency of the senses in dependence on the
    empirical world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Saama~n~naphala Sutta makes clear, however, that one
    who passes through the jhaanas transcends an ordinary involvement in the phenomenal world
    exemplified by the niivaranas. Through attaining the four jhaanas the consciousness or
    mind (citta) is made pure (parisuddha), freed from blemish, devoid of evil (kilesa),(64)
    stable and immovable.(65) The citta is thereby freed to direct itself toward the
    &quot;insight that comes from knowledge.&quot;(66) This insight is simply that this body
    (kaaya) has a form (ruupa) composed of the four great elements; that it is a result of a
    human birth; that it is perpetuated by partaking of foods; that it is impermanent and
    subject to dissolution and disintegration; and that consciousness itself (vi~n~na.na)
    depends on the body and is bound up with it.(67) With the citta purified and collected,
    the sama.na has the mental power to be able to create (maya) with it another body (a~n~na
    kaaya) than the body subject to the frailties described above. As the text describes this
    process it is &quot;... as if a man were to pull out a reed from its sheath. He would
    know: `this is the reed, this the sheath. The reed is one thing, the sheath another. It is
    from the sheath that the reed has been drawn forth.' And similarly were he to take a snake
    out of its slough, or draw a sword from its scabbard.&quot;(68)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The notion of manomaya or mental power has significant
    possibilities for this study; however, on the basis of the Paali texts it is difficult to
    arrive at a specific interpretation. In general the term denotes being made or formed by
    the mind, particularly as though magically made.(69) For example, the Brahmajaala Sutta
    refers to the evolution of the world system to the point where most beings have been
    reborn in the &quot;World of Radiance&quot; and &quot;there they dwell made of mind
    (manomaya), feeding on joy, radiating light from themselves, traversing the air [and]
    continuing in glory....&quot;(70) A similar association of manomaya with a heavenly realm
    is found in the Apa.n.naka Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaaya. There it is stated that the
    corporeal gods are a product of manomaya.(71) The two passages cited above clearly refer
    to the magical power of the mind by relating manomaya to the mythological realms of
    Buddhism. Indeed, manomaya's earliest meaning may have been magically oriented--the notion
    that mano was responsible for the attainment of heavenly rewards of some form or another;
    however, we find that manomaya comes to assume both ethical and ontic connotations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For instance, the Dhammapaada opens with the following two
    verses:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">Mind is the forerunner of (all evil) states. Mind is
      chief; mind-made are they. If one speaks or acts with wicked mind, because of that,
      suffering follows one, even as the wheel follows the hoof of the draught-ox.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mind is the forerunner of (all good) states. Mind is
      chief; mind-made are they. If one speaks or acts with pure mind, because of that,
      happiness follows one, even as one's shadow that never leaves.</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this passage the ethical and the ontic are definitely
    related in terms of mind, that is, the mind appears as the center point. It has, as it
    were, the power to create the &quot;self.&quot; The ethical dimension stems from this
    fact. If the mind is ignorant and impure, one will suffer; if, on the other hand, the mind
    is enlightened and pure, one will attain happiness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having overcome the five hindrances, attained the four
    mental absorptions and the power of manomaya, the sama.na now acquires iddhi or
    supranormal power, and abhi~n~na or supranormal knowledge. The term iddhi is of
    pre-Buddhistic origin. In different contexts it may be used in the Paali texts to describe
    the potency of a king, a rich noble, a hunter, etc.(72) In the Saama~n~naphala Sutta,
    eight modes of iddhi are mentioned: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) the power of becoming one or many, <br>
      2) the ability to become invisible, <br>
      3) passing through objects such as walls and hills, <br>
      4) penetrating through solid ground, <br>
      5) the power to walk on water, <br>
      6) traveling cross-legged in the sky, <br>
      7) touching the moon and the sun, <br>
      8) reaching Brahmaa heaven.(73)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above listed iddhis acquired by the Buddhist adept
    have striking similarities with the archaic phenomenon of shamanism.(74) The coincidence
    of characteristics between these two religious practitioners has been studied by Mircea
    Eliade in his monograph, Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstacy.(75) In particular he
    points to the &quot;identity in expression&quot; between the superhuman experiences of the
    Buddhist yogin and the archaic symbolism of ascent and flight found so frequently in
    shamanism.(76) Symbols of ascent and flight are especially important since they illustrate
    the ecstatic experience at which</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">shamanism aims. The shaman through the medium of this
    experience obtains a superhuman state of being enhancing him with such powers as flight,
    especially for the purpose of reaching otherworldly realms. The magical aspect of this
    power is well illustrated by our particular text, which specifically indicates that prior
    to the acquisition of iddhi, the sama.na has exercised the power of manomaya, the
    &quot;magic&quot; of his mind, in order to create &quot;another body.&quot; It would
    appear that the iddhi which follow are powers of that &quot;other body&quot; created as a
    result of passing through the four jhaanas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The possible shamanistic and, hence, magically oriented
    origin of iddhi is furthered by what appears to be a growing suspicion on the part of
    early Buddhism toward the public display of paranormal or superhuman psychic powers, In
    the Kevaddha Sutta of the Diigha Nikaaya the Buddha is represented as warning against the
    use of magical wonders because they might be confused with the use of magical charms
    practiced in Gandhaara.(77) He is made to say, &quot;It is because I perceive danger in
    the practice of mystic wonders, that I loath, and abhor, and am ashamed thereof.&quot;(78)
    In the Vinaya Pi.taka it is stated that a monk should not display psychic powers before
    the laity beyond the powers of ordinary men.(79) The Sampasaadaniiya Sutta of the Diigha
    Nikaaya makes it clear that there are indeed two types of iddhi, one which is termed
    ignoble and the other noble.(80) The ignoble are those powers discussed above in the
    Sama~n~naphala Sutta and elsewhere in the Nikaayas.(81) In the Sampasaadaniiya Sutta the
    iddhis are labeled ignoble since they are concomitant with mental intoxicants and worldly
    aims.(82) In other words, it is possible to employ the fruits of the jhaana or the iddhi
    in such a manner that the mundane world, rather than being transcended, becomes even more
    attractive and one's involvement within it is deepened even further. Iddhi produced
    through manomaya may become the occasion of a descent into the actual or phenomenal world
    rather than ascent into the real or noumenal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In contrast to the ignoble powers, all of which involve
    some superhuman power, the Sampasaadaniiya Sutta describes the noble powers as follows:
    &quot;When a bhikkhu can, if he so desire, remain unconscious of the disgust amid what is
    disgusting; or conscious of disgust amid what is not disgusting; or unconscious of disgust
    amid what is both disgusting and the opposite; or, avoiding both that which is disgusting
    and the opposite, should remain indifferent to them as such, mindful and
    understanding.&quot;(83) As should be expected, the</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">noble iddhis overcome the mental intoxicants (aasavas) and
    the worldly aims instead of becoming further embroiled in them. Rather than representing
    the superhuman or the magical, Aryan powers stand for control of sa~n~naa or perceptions
    and lead to an indifference (upekhaka) toward the disgusting and the nondisgusting, those
    polarities which qualify our perception of the phenomenal world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The transformation of iddhi from an archaic, magical
    meaning is further illustrated by the Janavasabha Suttanta of the Diigha Nikaaya
    describing the four ways in which iddhi is developed. They are: concentration and effort
    with desire (chanda-samaadhi), concentration and effort with energy (viriya-samaadhi),
    concentration and effort with a &quot;dominant idea&quot; (citta-samaadhi), concentration
    and effort with investigation (viima.msaa-samaadhi) .(84) Here we find a progression not
    to a state of ecstasy leading to powers of invisibility and flight, but rather a
    progression from desire (chanda) to investigation (viima.msaa), or from motivation and
    effort to a more refined and sophisticated use of the mind. It appears that iddhi as the
    fruit of jhaana becomes, rather than supernatural powers acquired in shamanistic trance, a
    discriminating understanding (viima.msaa) of the phenomenal world engendering a detached
    objectivity (upekhaka) in the face of the polarities of impure/pure, loathsome/
    nonloathsome, disgusting/nondisgusting typical of the phenomenal or mundane world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to iddhi, the Saama~n~naphala Sutta indicates
    that other powers are acquired by the sama.na who has overcome the niivara.nas and
    acquired the jhaanas. These powers are said to be the heavenly or divine ear; discernment
    of various types of minds or citta; knowledge of previous existences; the heavenly or
    divine eye with which the adept &quot;...sees beings as they pass away from one form of
    existence and take shape in another....&quot;(85) These supranormal powers eventually
    developed into a stereotyped list of six abhi~n~naas (higher knowledge). They appear in
    the Dasuttara Suttanta of the Diigha Nikaaya as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) the iddhis in their various modes described above; <br>
      2) &quot;deva-hearing&quot; by which the adept &quot;hears sounds both heavenly and human,
      far and near&quot;;<br>
      3) a mind that &quot;...understands the minds of other beings, other persons...&quot;; <br>
      4) an ability to recall to mind &quot;...the various temporary states as he lived in days
      gone by...&quot;;<br>
      5) &quot;deva-sight&quot; by which &quot;he discerns the pageant of beings faring
      according to their deeds&quot;;<br>
      6) the realization and knowledge of the extinction of the &quot;intoxicants&quot;
      (aasavas) and the attainment of freedom.(86)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can discern in this list an amalgam of two different
    types of abhi~n~naa. In the first instance there is the type illustrated by the occurrence
    of the supranormal powers in the Saama~n~naphala Sutta. There the abhi~n~naas are acquired
    as the result of jhaana through the power of manomaya. In particular, however, abhi~n~naa
    seems to express a psychic or mental power in contrast to the extraordinary physical power
    of the iddhis. For example, the heavenly ear and the divine eye would appear above all
    else to indicate a heightened mode of perception enabling the adept to arrive at a
    supranatural knowledge bordering on omniscience. Thus iddhi and abhi~n~naa seem to
    complement each other, the one pointing to physical power, the other to mental power. It
    is just such a mutually supporting role, for example, that iddhi and abhi~n~naa play in
    the Akankheyya Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaaya.(87)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is, on the other hand, another type of abhi~n~naa in
    the Dasuttara Suttanta list, a &quot;higher knowledge&quot; of the destruction of all
    attachments to the mundane and of the realization of ultimate reality or nibbaana. This
    aspect of the abhi~n~naas is found in the Samyutta Nikaaya, where they are preceded by the
    &quot;middle path&quot; and followed by enlightenment and nibbaana.(88) Or, again in the
    A^nguttara Nikaaya where it is said that the abhi~n~naas lead to full emancipation,(89)
    and the Diigha where we find that they are contrary to priestly superstitions and vain
    (sophistical) speculations.(90) In other words, abhi~n~naa, at this level, is insight into
    the truth claims of Buddhism regarding the nature of reality. It may be that the two
    seemingly different types of abhi~n~naa represent a synthesis of a more popular and
    &quot;primitive,&quot; magically oriented tradition with the more sophisticated, ethically
    oriented tradition of the priests. It is difficult to assert, as the Paali Text Society
    Dictionary does, that the more magically oriented understanding of abhi~n~naa is
    later.(91) Perhaps all that can be safely said is that in the Nikaayas the two traditions
    came to be amalgamated. That is to say, it was expected that as a person gained detachment
    from the phenomenal world he not only gained a &quot;higher knowledge&quot; (abhi-j~naa),
    but supranormal powers (iddhis) as well.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having destroyed the niivara.nas, attained the jhaanas,
    the iddhis, and abhi~n~naas, the Sama~n~naphala Sutta goes on to say that the sama~n~naa
    is then able to destroy the &quot;deadly floods&quot; or &quot;intoxicants&quot; (aasavas)
    that are part of the attachment of the profane man to the mundane world. In this sutta the
    aasavas are enumerated as kaama (sensual desire), bhaava (becoming or desire for future
    life), and avijjaa (ignorance of the four noble truths).(92) One of the most famous
    passages referring to the intoxicants is contained in a formula repeated throughout the
    Nikaayas, the Mahaaparinibbaana Sutta in particular. It illustrates the interrelationship
    of conduct (siila), concentration (samaadhi), and understanding (pa~n~naa) in overcoming
    the aasavas. After affirming that concentration must be accompanied by right conduct and
    understanding by concentration, the passage concludes that the mind (citta) of the
    individual surrounded by a profound understanding (pa~n~naa) of the nature of reality will
    be freed (vimuccati) from being &quot;poured out&quot; (aasava) into the mundane world
    through sensual desires, the wish for a life of continual becoming, false views, and
    ignorance of his true state of being.(93)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The aasavas, as do the niivara.nas, serve to clarify that
    from which the jhaanas free a man. Fundamentally it is the mundane, specifically as the
    world of sensuous desire, becoming, anger, worry, dullness, stupidity; or, in other words,
    ignorant, unthinking involvement in and attachment to the empirical world. The jhaanas
    represent stages by which an individual attains a power of mind (manomaya) which
    represents a new order of being, &quot;another body&quot; (a~n~na kaaya) as the text
    states it. This new being is g raphically illustrated by certain powers the texts describe
    partially in the terms of a popular, magical tradition and partially in terms of the
    higher knowledge represented by the Buddhist analysis of existence. We may conclude that
    the jhaanas preserve two types of knowledge in relationship to the salvation quest:
    ecstasy and a mode of knowledge characterized by viima.msaa, vitakka, and vicaara or more
    rational and discriminating forms of thinking. Knowledge as power, then, comes to take on
    a rather particular meaning. It is power over the world of becoming and change, but it is
    also the power of new being.</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">UPEKKHAA AND THE UNLIMITEDS</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have seen in our discussion of jhaana that upekkhaa
    (equanimity) appeared in the third stage and that in the fourth there remained only sati
    (mindfulness) and upekkhaa. Having discussed the former term, we now turn to an
    examination of upekkhaa. The word upekkhaa is derived from the Sanskrit root iik.s,
    meaning to gaze or look at, plus the prefix upa; hence, the word literally means to
    overlook or neglect.(94) Its meaning is extended, however, to denote patience, equanimity,
    or indifference. The Paali Text Society Dictionary defines upekkhaa as, &quot;hedonic
    neutrality or indifference, the zero point between joy and sorrow.&quot;(95) A. B. Keith
    notes that upekkhaa, as a quality of the third and fourth jhaana, does not actually
    connote a hedonistic sense of indifference but rather an intellectual neutrality. Thus,
    upekkhaa, at least in its jhaanic context, is an impartial tolerance in regard to all
    mental states.(96)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A broad survey of the uses of upekkhaa in the Theravaada
    tradition is given by Edward Conze as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) neutral feelings which are neither pleasant nor
      unpleasant, <br>
      2) an attitude of &quot;serene unconcern&quot; or sameness of thought arising from the
      practice of concentration or jhaana, <br>
      3) the final stage of worldly wisdom just prior to reaching the Path when evenmindedness
      toward all conditioned beings is achieved, <br>
      4) the equanimity of the Arahant who retains a natural state of purity, <br>
      5) the equanimity of the Arahant as contrasted with the dull indifference of ignorant men,
      and<br>
      6) an attitude or impartiality providing an antidote to ill will and sensuous greed.(97)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Nikaayas themselves we discover that upekkhaa is
    used frequently in the formula of the four brahma vihaaras or the abodes of brahmaa. The
    brahma vihaaras are four &quot;states of mind&quot; that result, after death, in a rebirth
    in the heavenly worlds of brahmaa.(98) There is disagreement among Buddhist scholars as to
    the origin of the brahma vihaaras. T. W. Rhys Davids contends that they were almost
    certainly exclusively Buddhist, (99) whereas E. J. Thomas believes they show a direct
    connection with Brahmanical practices since they occur in the Yoga Suutras.(100)
    Regardless of origin, however, the brahma vihaaras are important as modes of heightened
    awareness, although they are not in themselves the highest goal of nibbaana.(101)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another term used in the Nikaayas to define the brahma
    vihaaras is appaman~naa or &quot;infinite feelings.&quot;(102) This term is applied to
    these states of mind or categories of consciousness dealing with mind expansion.
    Mahasudassana Suttanta of the Diigha Nikaaya reports the following attainments of
    &quot;the Great King of Glory&quot; after reaching the fourth jhaana: &quot;And he let his
    mind pervade one quarter of the world with thoughts of love; and so the second quarter and
    so the third and so the fourth. And thus the whole wide world, to pervade with heart of
    love, far-reaching, grown great, and beyond measure, free from the least trace of anger or
    ill will.&quot;(103) And in a similar fashion he pervaded the whole world with a
    consciousness of compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. The brahma vihaaras in
    general and upekkhaa in particular represent, if you will, universal states of
    consciousness. They are one of the somewhat paradoxical outcomes of the process of
    meditation and the control of the mind which has been described in the Nikaayas, a process
    that becomes even more refined in a later period. This outcome of Buddhist meditation is
    seemingly paradoxical in that the progression from sati to samaadhi, and even into the
    jhaanas, was primarily a narrowing down of the consciousness. But the narrowing of the
    consciousness was for the purpose of its ultimate liberation. The refinement of the mind
    was important primarily for the elimination of attachment to the objects of sense and
    concomitantly to develop such mental control that the mind developed the power to
    construct a new reality (manomaya). That is to say, the purpose of meditation in the
    Nikaayas is to free the mind from dependence on sensory objects so that it can be expanded
    to realities which defy empirical definition. Upekkhaa, therefore, becomes the last
    element in the seven factors of enlightenment and is a characteristic shared by both
    Arahants and buddhas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps the significance of the difference in
    consciousness implied by upekkhaa and ordinary states of consciousness can be best
    demonstrated by referring to two Nikaaya texts. The Sa.laayatanavibha^nga Sutta of the
    Majjhima Nikaaya lists six indifferences (upekkhaa) . A worldly indifference is
    &quot;...the indifference on seeing a thing which appertains to the ignorant and foolish
    average man...such indifference...fails to transcend the thing seen...&quot;(104) By way
    of contrast the indifference of renunciation arises when &quot;...on discerning the
    transitory nature of things seen and their mutability, instability and annihilation,
    indifference arises from causal understanding.&quot;(105) Upekkhaa denotes, therefore, a
    transcendence of the thing seen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Assuming that meditation frees the mind from dependence on
    the mundane world, to what is it freed? The answer must of necessity be in abstract terms,
    and the person who is looking for a concrete definition of the knowledge of ultimates is
    bound to be disappointed; however, one answer given by the Nikaayas is found in the
    Mahaavadella Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaaya. There, in a conversation between Saariputta
    and Ko.t.thita the Great, Saariputta discusses four &quot;freedoms&quot; of the mind
    (cetovimutti): appamaa.naa (immeasurable) , aaki~nca~n~naa (nothingness) , su~n~nataa
    (emptiness), animittaa (signless).(106) All four of these characteristics of the
    cetovimutti are identical in that they connote a state or condition of nonattachment. They
    also point beyond themselves to a reality beyond definition, a reality that can be known
    but not in the way that people ordinarily know. The whole thrust of Buddhist meditation,
    therefore, is to produce a condition of consciousness in which ultimate reality can be
    known directly, just as objects are perceived directly in the phenomenal world. The
    Buddhist way of coming to know ultimate reality is to produce a condition of being in
    which reality can be perceived directly. It is because the</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">reality to be known is &quot;other&quot; than that which
    is ordinarily known that the process of meditation--sati, samaadhi, jhaan and upekkhaa--is
    undergone. The cognizing apparatus must be transformed since, indeed, to reach nibbaana
    involves a total transformation of consciousness and being.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The process of meditation described in the Paali suttas
    provides the proper context for a discussion of Buddhist epistemology. Epistemology in
    Buddhism is basically a soteriological and not a philosophical problem. To understand the
    Theravaada view of knowledge (vi~n~naana and pa~n~naa) demands a serious study of the
    structure of Buddhist meditation. This essay has attempted such a study. It has argued
    that within the progressive refinement of consciousness developed in the Buddhist
    meditative process, discriminating and analytical modes of knowledge played a decisive
    role, both in terms of understanding the true nature of things as well as in producing a
    state of detachment. It has further argued that meditation leads to a state of
    consciousness in which only a nondiscriminating mode of knowledge is appropriate. Such
    knowledge might be labeled mystical or intuitive but, finally, as the texts themselves
    point out, it is without any proper designation (animittaa)./.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(23) The preoccupation of early Buddhism with the notion
      of death offers some interesting possibilities of interpretation other than the rather
      obvious one given in the text. It might, for instance, be an outgrowth of archaic
      shamanistic practices, for the shaman is one who above all else is qualified by a
      knowledge of death. On this point see Mircea Eliade, Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of
      Ecstasy, trans. Willard R. Trask (New York: Pantheon Books, 1964), p. 509f (hereinafter
      cited as Eliade, Shamanism). On the other hand, in the dialectic between the sacred and
      the profane, death plays a very important role. For example, as Vatn Gennep and others
      point out, rites of initiation marking a passage from a &quot;profane&quot; state to a
      &quot;sacred&quot; state are not infrequently signaled by a symbolic recreation of death
      on the part of the initiate. Arnold Van Gennep, The Rites of Passage (Chicago: The
      University of Chicago Press, 1961), p. 75f.</font></p>
