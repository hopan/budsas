    <h3><font color="#000080">I. Beginner's Questions</font></h3>
    <p><b><i>Q.1: Why does a monk wear the robe? Why do some wear
    brown robes and others wear yellowish brown?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> The Lord Buddha gave this reflection about why a
    monk wears a robe:</p>
    <p>Properly considering the robe, I use it: simply to ward
    off cold, to ward off heat, to ward off the touch of flies,
    mosquitoes, simply for the purpose of covering the parts of
    the body which cause shame.</p>
    <p>In the Lord Buddha's time, 2,500 years ago, clothing was
    made without complex machinery. (Although simple
    'sewing-frames' are mentioned in the texts, which the monks
    would have used at robe-making - Ka.thina - time.) So the
    pattern of the robe is very simple and designed so that it
    can be made up out of patches of cloth, for discarded rags
    were often used after washing and dyeing. This 'yellow robe'
    is considered the banner of the arahant and emblem of
    Buddhism. For the ordinary Theravaadin bhikkhu it is a
    privilege to be able to wear this robe, continuing the
    tradition and practising to be worthy of it. There are rules
    as to the robes' size, colour, how they are sewn, type of
    cloth used, etc., and how bhikkhus can acquire them.</p>
    <p>The colour of the robes depends on the dye used. Until
    very recently, this would have been natural vegetable dye
    found in the jungle from roots or trees. (In NE Thailand, for
    example, we used the heartwood of the jack-fruit tree.)
    Nowadays chemical dyes are more used and sometimes give that
    more vivid orange colour that one sees in Bangkok. The colour
    white is used by Buddhist devotees to show their commitment
    to keeping the Precepts -- usually the Eight Precepts -- on
    Observance Days. (White robes are also worn by the anagarika,
    or postulant before he becomes a monk.)</p>
    <p><b><i>Q.2: Why do monks eat from the bowl? Can lay people
    serve soup to monks in normal bowls? Can they serve fruits or
    desserts on plates instead of putting them in the monk's
    bowl?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> The Lord Buddha gave this reflection about
    finding and eating food:</p>
    <p>Properly considering alms food, I use it: not playfully,
    nor for intoxication, nor for putting on weight, nor for
    beautification; but simply for the survival and continuance
    of this body, for ending its afflictions, for the support of
    the chaste life, (thinking) I will destroy old feelings (of
    hunger) and not create new feelings (from overeating). Thus I
    will maintain myself, be blameless, and live in comfort.</p>
    <p>The alms bowl is another practical symbol of Buddhism,
    and, like the robes, another requisite of the bhikkhu.
    Although every bhikkhu is given an alms bowl (and a set of
    robes) when he becomes a monk, not all of them will actually
    go on an alms round and only a minority -- usually they are
    the forest meditation bhikkhus -- will eat from their bowl
    sitting on the floor. Therefore many monks will eat using
    plates and dishes, while some will eat sitting on the floor
    at a small table and others at a normal western-style table.
    One should not feel shy about asking a monk as to his normal
    way of eating and then fit in with that. Those forest
    bhikkhus who keep the austere practices (dhutanga or tudong)
    will be stricter about only using one eating vessel. This can
    simplify life and remind the bhikkhu that although food is
    necessary for bodily health he does not have to indulge in an
    obsession with taste. (It also saves washing-up time.)</p>
    <p><b><i>Q.3: Why do monks live in the forest?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> In India during the Lord Buddha's time much of
    the land was covered in forests and groves and this was where
    the wandering mendicants of the different orders would pursue
    their religious practices. The Lord Buddha spoke of the 'foot
    of a tree' as the basic shelter for bhikkhus, and this is
    usually still affirmed to every newly ordained bhikkhu.
    Later, monasteries were established and well-endowed, and the
    focus shifted to a more settled life. Mostly only the 'forest
    monks' now live in the forest where it is quiet and conducive
    to meditation. Many more monks will live in the village
    monastery or go to a monastery in the town to study the
    scriptures. The Lord Buddha said this about the basics of
    shelter, whether in the forest or city:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Properly considering the lodging, I use it: simply to
        ward off cold, to ward off heat, to ward off the touch of
        flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun and reptiles; simply for
        protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the
        enjoyment of seclusion.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Q.4: How does one who wants to become a monk find
    out how to go about getting the robe and bowl, etc.?<br>
    Q.5: What is the procedure for a lay man to ordain?<br>
    Q.6: How does one who wants to sponsor any newly ordained
    monk/nun with the necessities go about doing so?<br>
    Q.7: How does a teacher assess and decide if one is suitable
    for ordination?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> In fact getting the robes and bowl is not so
    much a problem for once the candidate is accepted by a
    preceptor, the preceptor will know where suitable requisites
    may be found. The question should be more about the qualities
    necessary to become a monk and I have explained some of these
    in the section on Becoming a Bhikkhu.</p>
    <p>If the candidate's intention is right and he is not
    disqualified by other factors, he should find a senior monk
    who can advise him on the places where he might ordain and
    perhaps recommend him to a preceptor. If the candidate lives
    in a non-Buddhist country, he can write for details to the
    country where he is interested in staying. Bhikkhus are often
    travelling and giving Dhamma talks around the world and they
    would generally be very happy to make suggestions about this.</p>
    <p>In certain communities there is a 'postulancy' period when
    the candidate first wears white robes as an anagarika and
    after a year (or two) may then be given either novice
    (saama.nera) or full bhikkhu ordination. Once he is accepted
    for this, all the requisites should be provided. (In some
    monasteries the candidate is provided with the cloth but has
    to learn to sew his own robes.) Similarly for the lay person
    wanting to help supply requisites to the new monk, the best
    way is to ask details from a senior monk who will explain and
    help. In some Buddhist countries there are even special shops
    to supply these requisites but whether this is suitable will
    depend on the monastery of ordination.</p>
    <p><b><i>Q.8: How does a lay woman ordain? Does she become
    ordained only by bhikkhunii?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> The Theravadin lineage no longer has an
    'officially recognized' bhikkhunii-ordination. There are
    other forms for lay women that still involve 'leaving the
    home life' and keeping Eight or Ten Precepts as a dasasiila
    mata nun. Finding a suitable place is quite difficult but
    several groups are trying to develop places conducive to
    Dhamma practice for such nuns. (For example, Amaravati
    Buddhist Monastery in England.</p>
    <p><b><i>Q.9: Instead of letting the monks go on alms-round
    during rainy days, can the lay people request to bring daana
    [the food offering] to the monks?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> Some bhikkhus take a daily alms-round as a
    special practice (dhuta nga or tudong) and will normally
    always want to go. Many other monks will be happy to receive
    food brought to them. Please ask or observe how the monk
    practises. There is no harm in offering to bring the food,
    for if the monk prefers to walk on an alms-round he can
    explain about that.</p>
    <p><b><i>Q.10: Is there a minimum and maximum number of
    layers [of clothing] a monk can wear? Does the rule alter
    with the weather?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> There is a minimum in that the bhikkhu must be
    properly and modestly dressed, especially in public. During
    the cold season in India, the Buddha allowed a double-layered
    outer robe (sa nghaati) to be used and so -- using the Great
    Standards as a guide -- in even colder climates extra layers
    may be allowable. In countries where hypothermia may be a
    danger, the use of extra layers seems sensible -- especially
    if this cuts down on heating and medical expenses. (That a
    bhikkhu lives as frugally as possible is a major aspect of
    the Vinaya.) However, it is generally felt very important
    that the traditional robes remain the basic dress and 'extra
    layers' should not obscure this.</p>
    <p><b><i>Q.11: Is it [acceptable] that the ordained one
    requests some basic necessities such as food, drink,
    medicine, shelter, blankets, reasonable form of transport due
    to weakness (health reason)? How should one approach a monk
    or nun if one wants to offer necessities to them?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> There are definite conditions that allow a
    bhikkhu to ask for help. These would be when he is ill, or in
    danger, or when he has been formally offered help.</p>
    <p><b><i>Q.12: Is it [acceptable] for one to offer basic
    necessities to monks or nuns without first asking them?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> Yes, generosity is a virtue highly praised by
    the Buddha and was often the first virtue he mentioned. It
    goes against the general modern selfish attitude of 'getting
    is better than giving' and leads on to contentment and the
    calm that can lead to deep meditation and wisdom. So, if it
    makes one happy to make an offering then one can do so
    without asking first. However, the offering should also be
    endowed with wisdom so that one gives something that is
    useful and not beyond one's family's means.</p>
    <p><b><i>Q.13: Why do we bow to monks/nuns and the Buddha
    Statue?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> The yellow robe worn by monks is an emblem and
    reminder of the Triple Gem, as is the Buddha Statue.
    Therefore one is really bowing to the Buddha, Dhamma and
    Sangha, not to some person or statue. There are two aspects
    to bowing -- the bodily action and the mind. If one bows
    because it gives one the opportunity to demonstrate one's
    faith in the Triple Gem, because it seems the right thing to
    do, and because it leads the mind to calm, then it will be
    beneficial. If one bows without reason or because one feels
    that one must do so for appearances sake, then it is a rather
    empty gesture. (Even so one's appreciation can grow.) When I
    bow three times to the Buddha Statue or to senior monks, I
    mentally recollect 'Buddho', then 'Dhammo' and then 'Sa ngho'
    and also have mindfulness of the bodily posture as it bends
    forward and the head touches the floor. However, in Western
    countries this is often misunderstood and can be the source
    of quite a lot of embarrassment. It is up to the persons
    themselves to decide what is appropriate under the different
    circumstances.</p>
    <p><b><i>Q.14: Is it [acceptable] to put two hands together
    [in añjalii] when paying respect to monks/nuns and Buddha
    Statue, or should one bow to show more respect?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> One should show respect from one's heart in the
    way that seems best to oneself, recollecting the Triple Gem
    and doing it mindfully. No good monk (or Buddha statue) is
    going to take offence if one does not bow.</p>
    <p><b><i>Q.15: Why do monks shave their heads?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> When the prince who was to become the Buddha
    left his palace to seek a way beyond ageing, sickness and
    death, it is said that one of the first things that he did
    was to shave off his hair and beard and put on the yellow
    cloth . Buddhist monks always completely shave their head and
    beard, showing their commitment to the Holy Life
    (Brahmacariya) of one gone forth into the homeless life. (In
    India some ascetics tear out their hair, while others never
    touch it so that it becomes a tangled mass.) A rule states
    that a bhikkhu should not allow his hair to grow beyond a
    certain length or time, so he will shave usually at least
    once a fortnight or month, sometimes more frequently. To do
    this he uses his razor, which is also one of his requisites.
    'Hair-of-the-head' (kesaa) is one of the five parts of the
    body mentioned in the ordination ceremony and is used to
    recollect the true nature of the body. The bhikkhu is also
    not allowed to dye or pluck out any grey hairs, for they are
    useful reminders of old-age and impermanence. (Just consider
    how much time and money is wasted by people trying to make
    their hair remain beautiful and young-looking.)</p>

    <h3><font color="#000080">II. Frequently Asked Questions</font></h3>
    <p><b><i>FAQ.1: When a bhikkhu is sick and especially so in
    emergency cases, is he allowed to be attended to by female
    medical staff; e.g. female nurse, woman doctor, especially if
    the woman doctor is the only doctor/surgeon on duty? How does
    the Vinaya allow for this?<br>
    FAQ.2: It has been observed that in the Burmese, Sri Lankan,
    Tibetan and Mahayana traditions, women are allowed to make an
    offering directly to the monks. Yet Thai Buddhist monks are
    not allowed to accept offerings directly from women. Is it
    because it is against the Vinaya rules or a different
    interpretation of the rules?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> The Vinaya Rule specifies that if a bhikkhu
    touches or is touched by a woman, it is an offence -- a very
    serious offence -- only if the bhikkhu is overcome by lust,
    with altered mind . However, the practising bhikkhu knows
    that as his mind changes so quickly, he has to be extremely
    cautious about involving himself in doubtful situations. It
    is better to be safe than sorry, even if this may seem
    over-scrupulous. In emergency situations the bhikkhu will
    have to decide for himself and be sure to take care of his
    thoughts. In Thailand it is a tradition (not strictly a rule)
    that the monk uses a 'receiving cloth' to emphasize that
    there is no touching.</p>
    <p><b><i>FAQ.3: What is the rule if an eight-precepter
    unintentionally comes into [direct physical] contact with
    another lay person or eight-precepter or ten-precepter or
    monk or nun of opposite gender?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A</b>: As with the preceding cases with bhikkhus, there
    is no fault if there is no wrong intention.</p>
    <p><b><i>FAQ.4: It is mentioned in the Vinaya rules that a
    monk is not allowed to reside under the same roof with a
    woman. How does that apply to multistoried (condominiums,
    flats, apartments) and multi-compartment buildings (terrace
    houses), where the flats, terrace houses, share one roof?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> This has become a complex question with various
    interpretations because of modern conditions. The spirit of
    the rule is very important -- avoiding possibilities of
    intimacy -- while the interpretation will depend on the monk
    and the circumstances. In countries without proper
    monasteries there will always have to be something of a
    compromise.</p>
    <p><b><i>FAQ.5: The Vinaya rules disallow monks from touching
    or handling money. As such, in Buddhist countries monks must
    have a Kappiya [attendant] to handle money for them. However,
    if a monk has to travel and does not have a Kappiya, under
    such circumstances do the Vinaya rules allow him to handle
    money personally? This is a problem especially in
    non-Buddhist countries.</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> While it may be a problem or inconvenience, the
    rules are there to protect and remind the monk about
    dangerous, unskilful actions. If the monk becomes
    increasingly involved with money there is a tendency for the
    whole of his bhikkhu-life to be compromised -- and that would
    be a far greater problem. Soon after the Final Passing Away
    of the Lord Buddha this sort of question had already become a
    major controversy and it is now even more complex under
    modern conditions. However, modern conditions also have
    brought their own assistance to keeping these rules. For
    instance, a bhikkhu can be given an air ticket and travel
    around the world (if need be) without having any money or
    attendant. He will need to be met at the airport and helped
    in the normal way, but that should be natural if he has been
    invited to come by the lay group. (He should not really be
    travelling otherwise.) And, of course, a monk can use postage
    stamps and 'telephone-cards' that add convenience to
    communicating -- when it is appropriate.</p>
    <p><b><i>FAQ.6: Is there a Vinaya rule that states that once
    a person becomes a monk, he is not allowed to disrobe? If he
    is allowed to disrobe, is there anywhere in the Vinaya that
    sets the maximum number of times he is allowed to do so. If
    so, under what circumstances is he allowed to disrobe?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> I know of no place in the Vinaya that states a
    bhikkhu cannot disrobe. If he no longer has any interest in
    the bhikkhu-life, the tendency will be for him to become lax
    and a bad example for others. His Dhamma friends therefore
    will try to re-fire his enthusiasm. However, if that is not
    possible, becoming a good layman may be better than being a
    bad monk. (Nevertheless, in some countries there is a
    cultural expectation of 'ordaining for life' and a
    corresponding stigma attached to disrobing.) There is a
    tradition (but not a rule) about a bhikkhu not re-ordaining
    more than seven times.</p>
    <p><em><strong>FAQ.7: The Vinaya states that monks are not
    supposed to eat once the sun has passed its zenith. Still,
    what happens if they are in countries such as regions of the
    North or South Poles, e.g. Norway, Alaska, where the sun
    never sets for six months and for the next six months, there
    is no sun.</strong></em></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> I understand that the zenith here means when the
    sun reaches the highest point in its arc across the sky. In
    most habitable areas of the globe this arc may be low to the
    horizon but it should still be possible to follow the rule.
    And if bhikkhus ever reach the polar regions they will have
    the Great Standards to guide them.</p>
    <p><b><i>FAQ.8: It is stated in the Vinaya that when a lay
    person offers fruit to a monk, he has to make a cut on one of
    the fruits to make it permissible for the monk to accept. How
    did this rule originate? Also, lay people, when offering
    fruit juices to monks after midday, are not allowed to offer
    fruit juices from fruits larger than the size of a fist. Is
    this in the Vinaya and why is it so?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> At the time of the Buddha, some lay people
    complained that the monks destroyed the 'life' in seeds.
    Therefore lay people can be asked by the monk if it is
    allowable for him to eat those fruits. In some monasteries
    (not all) this is done by the lay people cutting them. It is
    the Commentary to the Vinaya that mentions about 'great
    fruits'. This practice, however, is not followed in every
    monastery.</p>
    <p><b><i>FAQ.9: In Thailand, it has been observed that Thai
    Buddhist monks are allowed to drink tea, cocoa, coffee (but
    without milk) after midday. But in some other Buddhist
    countries like Burma, monks are not allowed to do this. Is
    this part of the Vinaya rules or is this just tradition,
    custom, or local practice? If it is in the Vinaya, how do you
    explain the differences in interpretation?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> The fourth of the Recollections of the Bhikkhu's
    Requisites is:</p>
    <p>Properly considering medicinal requisites for curing the
    sick, I use them: simply to ward off any pains of illness
    that have arisen, and for the maximum freedom from disease.</p>
    <p>There is an allowance in the Paali texts that
    'medicinal-tonics' can be taken in the afternoon while
    'lifetime-medicines' may be consumed any time they are
    needed.</p>
    <p>There are different interpretations and practices about
    how ill a bhikkhu has to be for it to be allowable to take
    such 'medicines'. Some bhikkhus will not take anything other
    than pure water, while some will over-stretch the Rule to
    even drinking 'medicinal' food-drinks (e.g. Ovaltine) in the
    afternoon. Some bhikkhus will consider tea-leaves allowable
    (as 'herbs') while some will see it as food or as a
    'stimulant' (caffeine) and therefore not appropriate. Also,
    the ordinary rural villagers of South East Asia (until very
    recently) would have had no tea or coffee to drink, so such
    items could be considered quite a luxury. It will depend on
    local conditions and interpretations, which are allowed for
    in the Vinaya through the Great Standards.</p>
    <p><b><i>FAQ.10: Can a monk retain property that he had as a
    lay person? Also, can a monk receive property that has been
    passed to him as inheritance? Is a monk also allowed to
    accept property donated to him by lay devotees and which has
    been transferred to his name? What is the Vinaya's stance on
    this? Does the Vinaya also allow for monks to sell/transact
    property that has been donated to them in order to buy, for
    instance, another piece of land in an area that is more
    suitable for spiritual activities?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> This is a complicated question. If there is a
    steward who does the arranging for the bhikkhu in the proper
    manner then certain things would be allowable. However, there
    are very strict guidelines about this. Practically speaking,
    bhikkhus in Thailand are not ordered to renounce all their
    property, etc., when they receive ordination. (As mentioned
    elsewhere, the majority of bhikkhus in Thailand will return
    to lay life within a certain period.) Bhikkhus who are
    serious about dedicating their life to the Holy Life will
    obviously take the Lord Buddha as their example and like Him
    renounce all that is worldly. There are specific rules, not
    covered in this work, about Community land and property, and
    the different ways they are managed.</p>
    <p><b><i>FAQ.11: Does the Vinaya state that monks cannot take
    nuns and lay people as their teachers? If this is so, what is
    the reason for this?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> The taking of a Teacher (aacariya) by a bhikkhu
    and living in dependence (nissaya) on him can only be between
    bhikkhus. And even according to the bhikkhunii's own Rule, in
    the time of the Lord Buddha, she was not allowed to teach
    bhikkhus. However, this does not mean that a bhikkhu cannot
    learn from others.</p>
    <p><b><i>FAQ.12: Are monks allowed to own and/or drive
    vehicles? Is this allowed by the Vinaya? If it does not go
    against the Vinaya, would it still be socially acceptable,
    given the monk's spiritual status in society?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> There is a specific rule against bhikkhus owning
    vehicles. Obviously, 'motor vehicles' were not available in
    the Buddha's time and most travel would have been on foot.
    However, there was the case:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>...when the group-of-six bhikkhus went in a vehicle
        yoked with cows and bulls, they were criticized by the
        lay people. The Buddha then established a fault of
        Wrong-doing for a bhikkhu to travel in a vehicle; later
        illness was exempted from this guideline... Travelling in
        a vehicle in the Buddha's time was an extravagance. A
        strict application of this training in Thailand is not
        allowing bhikkhus to drive or own vehicles, and
        (officially) not to ride on motorcycles.</p>

    <p>Bhikkhus were allowed to use ferry boats, etc. (In
    Thailand, bhikkhus from riverside monasteries will go on alms
    round by boat.)</p>
    <p><b><i>FAQ.13: Does the Vinaya permit monks to practise
    herbal, traditional or ayurvedic medicine?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> In Thailand, I understand that one cannot be
    officially registered as a herbal doctor while still a
    bhikkhu. While providing medicines for one's fellow monks is
    very much allowable, it is definitely wrong that a monk
    dispenses medicine for reward.</p>
    <p><b><i>FAQ.14: When a monk commits a paaraajika offence, do
    the lay people have the right to ask him to disrobe? What is
    the usual procedure as stated in the Vinaya? What happens
    when a monk has been proven to have committed a paaraajika
    offence, yet refuses to disrobe in spite of demands from lay
    devotees and there is no Sangha Council to enforce the
    demands, as is the case in non-Buddhist countries? Under such
    circumstances, what do the lay people do?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> If a bhikkhu commits a paaraajika offence he is
    'defeated' and no longer a bhikkhu even if he is wearing
    robes. The Community of bhikkhus will have nothing to do with
    him and will expel him. However, if the accused 'bhikkhu'
    does not admit to the offence and it cannot be proved, the
    results of kamma must be allowed to run their own course.
    Buddhism has never engaged in violent witch hunts. And for
    how lay people dealt with stubborn monks in the Buddha's
    time, see Disputes.</p>
    <p><b><i>FAQ.15: What questions should one ask a monk when
    offerings of requisites are made; and to what extent is a
    monk limited (and why) when making his reply; and when is it
    all right to ask details of preferences and specifications;
    and how to find out what is appropriate if the robed person
    finds it difficult or is unable to mention what is required?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>A:</b> Generally, the right-practising bhikkhu will be
    a person of few wants for he is trying to go to the ending of
    all desire. However, there may be certain things he may need
    but may not mention until he is sure that the donors are
    completely sincere in their invitation. If the donor makes
    specific suggestions, the bhikkhu may refuse, he may accept,
    or he may remain silent -- and such silence may very well be
    a positive response (as it was in the Lord Buddha's time).
    Therefore, as the donor gets to know the bhikkhu he or she
    will become more sensitive about what is needed and what is
    appropriate -- and be able to interpret any 'silence' in the
    right way.</p>
