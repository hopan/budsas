        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>n this chapter, I
        want to explore &quot;mindfulness &quot; in greater depth. Mindfulness
        is one of the controlling faculties <i>(indriya)</i> which creates
        success in meditation. If it's not fully understood, and fully
        practised, one can waste a lot of time in one's meditation. I will now
        explain the quality of mindfulness.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Setting Up the &quot;Gatekeeper&quot;
        Inside</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I like to use the simile for mindfulness
        of a person who's guarding a door or guarding a gate. The simile of the
        gatekeeper to describe mindfulness was used by the Buddha (AN VII, 63).
        For mindfulness is not just being aware, being awake, or being fully
        conscious of what's occurring around you. There is also that aspect of
        mindfulness that guides the awareness on to specific areas, remembers
        the instructions and initiates a response. For example, suppose you were
        a wealthy person with a gatekeeper guarding your mansion. One evening,
        before going to the Buddhist Temple to practise meditation, you tell the
        gatekeeper to be mindful of burglars. When you return home, your loving
        kindness suddenly vanishes when you find your house has been burgled.
        &quot;Didn't I tell you to be mindful?&quot;, you scream at the
        gatekeeper. &quot;But I was mindful&quot;, pleads the gatekeeper.
        &quot;I gave attention to the burglars as they broke in, and I was
        clearly attentive as they walked out with your digital T.V. and
        state-of-the-art C.D. system. I mindfully watched them go in several
        times, and my mind did not wander as I observed them going out with all
        your antique furniture and priceless jewellery…&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Would you be happy with such a
        gatekeeper's explanation of mindfulness? A wise gatekeeper knows that
        mindfulness is more than bare attention. A wise gatekeeper has to
        remember the instructions and perform them with diligence. If he sees a
        thief trying to break in then he must stop the burglar, or else call in
        the police.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the same way, a wise meditator must
        do more than just give bare attention to whatever comes in and goes out
        of the mind. The wise meditator must remember the instructions and act
        on them with diligence. For instance, the Buddha gave the instruction of
        the 6th Factor of the Noble Eightfold Path, &quot;Right Effort.&quot;
        When wise meditators practising mindfulness observe an unwholesome state
        trying to &quot;break in&quot;, they try to stop the defilement, and if
        the unwholesome state does slip in, they try to evict it. Unwholesome
        states such as sexual desire or anger are like burglars, sweet-talking
        con artists, who will rob you of your peace, wisdom and happiness. There
        are, then, these two aspects of mindfulness: the aspect of mindfulness
        of awareness and the aspect of mindfulness of remembering the
        instructions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Buddhist <i>Suttas</i>, the same <i>Pali</i>
        word &quot;<i>Sati</i>&quot; is used for both awareness and memory. A
        person who has got good mindfulness is also a person who has got a good
        memory, because these two things go together. If we pay attention to
        what we are doing, if we are fully aware of what we are doing, this
        awareness creates an imprint in our mind. It becomes easy to remember.
        For example suppose you're in danger. Suppose you come very close to
        having a serious car accident. Because of this danger, your mindfulness
        would become extremely strong and sharp. And because of that sharpness
        of mindfulness in a potential accident, you would remember it very
        easily, very clearly. In fact, when you went back home to sleep that
        night you might not be able to forget it. It might keep coming back up
        again and again. This shows the connection between awareness and memory.
        The more you are paying attention to what you're doing, the better you
        remember it. Again, these two things go together: awareness and memory.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we have gatekeepers who have
        developed awareness, they will pay attention to the instructions that
        they are given. If they pay full attention to the instructions that are
        given, they will be able to remember them and act on them diligently.
        This is how we should practice mindfulness. We should always give
        ourselves clear instructions with full attention so that we will
        remember what it is we are supposed to be doing. The teacher's job is
        also to give clear instructions to help us in guiding the mind. That is
        why I teach in very clear stages: stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, etc. When
        we make the training in meditation methodical, when each stage is very
        clear, then it becomes possible to give our &quot;gatekeepers&quot;
        clear instructions.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Instructing the &quot;Gatekeeper&quot;</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the beginning of the meditation when
        you start stage 1, you should remind yourself that there's a gatekeeper
        inside -- that which can be aware of what's happening and can choose
        where to put that awareness. Tell that gatekeeper something like:
        &quot;Now is the time to be aware of the present moment.&quot; &quot;Now
        is the time to be aware of the present moment.&quot; &quot;Now is the
        time to be aware of the present moment.&quot; Tell the gatekeeper three
        times. You know that if you have to repeat something, you're much more<i>
        </i>likely to remember it. Maybe when you were at school, if you
        couldn't spell a word, you'd have to write it out a hundred times. Then
        you'd never forget it after that. This is because when you repeat
        something, it takes more effort. It's harder to do. You have to force
        the mind a little bit more, and mindfulness has to become stronger.
        What's easy to do doesn't take much mindfulness. So make it a little bit
        difficult for yourself by repeating instructions such as: &quot;I will
        be aware of the present moment.&quot; &quot;I will be aware of the
        present moment.&quot; &quot;I will be aware of the present moment&quot;.
        Again, say that to yourself three times.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now with the gatekeeper, like any other
        servant or worker, you don't have to keep giving the same instruction
        every second or two. In this way of developing mindfulness just give
        that instruction to the gatekeeper three times at the beginning, then
        let the gatekeeper get on with the task. Trust the gatekeeper to know
        what it's doing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Instruct your gatekeeper in the same
        manner as you would instruct a taxi driver. You just tell them clearly
        where you want to go, then you sit back, relax and enjoy the journey.
        You trust the driver knows what they are doing. But imagine what would
        happen if you kept telling the driver every few seconds &quot;Go
        slower… Go faster… Turn left here… Now go into third gear…Look
        in your mirror, mate … Keep to the left…&quot; Before you completed
        a few hundred yards of your journey, the taxi driver would rebel, get
        angry and throw you out of the taxi. No wonder then, when meditators
        keep giving instructions to their gatekeeper every few seconds, their
        minds rebel and refuse to co-operate.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So just let the mind get on with the job
        of being in the present moment. Do not keep interfering with it. Give
        the mind clear instructions and then let go and watch. If you establish
        mindfulness in this way, with clear instructions, you will find that
        your mind is like everyone else's mind. That is, once it's given clear
        instructions, it'll tend to do what it's told. It will obviously make
        mistakes now and again. It will sometimes not go straight to the present
        moment immediately. Or sometimes it will go to the present moment and
        then wander off again. However, the instruction which you've given it
        will mean that as soon as it starts to wander off into the past or the
        future there is something which remembers. Mindfulness remembers the
        instructions, and mindfulness puts the attention back into the present
        moment. For you, the onlooker, it's something that is automatic. You
        don't need to choose to do it. It happens automatically, because
        mindfulness has been instructed in the same way that a gatekeeper, once
        instructed, does all the work. You don't have to give any more
        instructions. You can just watch the gatekeeper do the work. This is
        trusting the mind, knowing the mind, knowing its nature and working with
        its nature.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I encourage you to play around with the
        mind and know its capabilities. One of the first things that I was told
        on my first meditation retreat as a student was that there is no need to
        set the alarm for getting up in the morning. (Actually I think we were
        getting up at five o'clock in the morning at that retreat. It was a
        &quot;soft retreat&quot;.) The Teacher said, just to determine the
        waking time, and to tell yourself before going to bed at night,
        &quot;I'm going to get up at five to five.&quot; (That was just five
        minutes before someone was going to ring the bell.) &quot;Don't set your
        alarms.&quot; That was the first time I ever tried that. It worked every
        morning. I told myself very clearly and carefully as I went to sleep,
        &quot;I will get up at five to five.&quot; I didn't need to look at my
        clock or ask, &quot;Is it five to five yet?&quot; I could actually trust
        the mind, and when I woke up and opened my eyes and looked at my clock,
        it was five minutes to five--give or take two minutes. It's incredible
        how the mind works. I don't know how it did it, how it remembered, but
        it did. It works in exactly the same way if you give clear instructions,
        if you program your mind: &quot;Now is the time to watch the present
        moment.&quot; &quot; Be in the present moment.&quot; &quot;Be in the
        present moment.&quot; That's all you need to do. Then you can let the
        mind do the work.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's also important when you're
        instructing the gatekeeper to know not just what you're supposed to be
        doing but also what you're not supposed to be doing<b> -- </b>in other
        words to know the dangers on the path. It's important to know the
        dangers as well as the goal because this enables the gatekeeper to know
        who is allowed in and also who is not allowed in. They need to be very
        clear about both types of &quot;people&quot;. It's not enough to just
        have a list of who's allowed in. If the gatekeeper hasn't got a list of
        who's not allowed in, then they could easily make mistakes.</font></p>
        <b><i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Gatekeeper at Stage One.</font></i></b><font face="Times New Roman">
        Now in the first of these stages of meditation, <i>Present Moment
        Awareness,</i> the goal -- who's allowed in -- is just anything in the
        present moment. It can be the sound of a bird. It can be the sound of a
        truck in the distance. It can be the wind going past. It can be someone
        coughing or banging the door. It doesn't matter. If it is something
        happening now, then it is part of the present moment awareness. It can
        be the breath. It can be a <i>Samadhi</i> <i>Nimitta</i>. It can be a <i>Jhana</i>.
        That's all part of the present moment. So be very clear of what's
        allowed in, and welcome that.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again, one should also be very clear of
        what's not allowed in. What are the dangers to present moment awareness?
        Those dangers are any thought, any perception, any view of the past or
        the future. That is, any looking &quot;back&quot; or any looking
        &quot;forward&quot;. It's important to know those dangers, to articulate
        them very clearly. Sometimes when I make my resolutions I actually
        include the danger in the resolution. &quot;I'll be aware of the present
        moment, but I'll not go off into the past or the future.&quot;
        &quot;I'll be aware of the present moment, but I'll disregard the past
        or the future.&quot; &quot;I'll be aware of the present moment, and I'll
        disregard the past and the future.&quot; Saying that to oneself,
        instructing the gatekeeper about the dangers as well as the goals, helps
        mindfulness do its task. What happens then is that when the dangers to
        that stage arise, mindfulness knows, &quot;This is not what I'm supposed
        to be doing&quot;. Mindfulness discards that past or that future thought
        or perception. This is what happens. As I have been stating, this is the
        nature of the mind if you program it properly.</font></p>
        <b><i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Gatekeeper at Stage Two.</font></i></b><font face="Times New Roman">
        In the second stage of <i>Silent Present Moment Awareness,</i> one has
        the goal of silence in the present,<b> </b>and<b> </b>the danger is
        inner chatter, inner thought. So one should tell the mind that's what
        it's got to avoid; that's the enemy; that's the danger. You tell the
        mind very clearly at the beginning of that stage: &quot;I'll be silently
        aware in the present moment and will discard all inner chatter.&quot;
        &quot;I'll be silently aware in the present moment. I will discard all
        inner chatter.&quot; &quot;I will be silently aware in the present
        moment and will discard all inner chatter.&quot; That way you establish
        mindfulness. You give it a chance to work because you've instructed it
        very clearly.</font></p>
        <b><i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Gatekeeper at Stage Three.</font></i></b><font face="Times New Roman">
        In the third stage, <i>Silent Present Moment Awareness of the Breath,</i>
        one instructs the mind three times to be aware of the breath in the
        present moment. &quot;I'll be aware of the breath in the present moment
        and will discard all other perceptions and thoughts.&quot; What are the
        dangers? It's everything other than the breath, which includes: the
        sounds outside, the feelings in the body, people coughing, thoughts
        about anything else, lunch or dinner, or whatever. Everything else other
        than the breath is a danger. So one should tell oneself: &quot;I will be
        aware of the breath in the present moment and discard all other
        perceptions or thoughts.&quot; &quot;I will be aware of the breath in
        the present moment and discard all other perceptions and thoughts.&quot;
        &quot;I will be aware of the breath in the present moment and discard
        all other perceptions and thoughts.&quot; Again, having told the mind
        very clearly both what it is supposed to be doing and not doing, you
        find you can let the mind do its work. One just looks on. When a thought
        other than the breath comes up, when you're perceiving say the sound of
        a lawnmower outside, straight away the mind knows it's not supposed to
        be doing this and it turns away automatically. One is training the mind
        in mindfulness. It's fascinating to watch the mind when its well
        trained. It does what it has been told without having to tell it again.
        Because it's already been told, it remembers the instructions. It knows
        what it's doing and the meditation becomes smooth and has the appearance
        of effortlessness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The meditation is not effortless though.
        You're putting in the effort but at the right times, at the times when
        it's really going to bear fruit. In just the same way as growing a tree.
        There are times when you put effort in and times when you let things be.
        You plant the seed in the ground. Then you water it and fertilise it.
        But most of the time, when you're growing a tree, your job is just to
        guard it to make sure that nothing interferes with the process. The seed
        has got the instructions; it just needs to be given the chance. In the
        same way don't keep interfering with the mind. Don't keep prodding it
        and pushing it and telling it to do things, because otherwise after a
        while it will just rebel. &quot;Leave me alone. Look, I'm trying to do
        my job. Get out of the way,&quot; says the mind. And if you don't leave
        the mind alone quickly, your meditation's shot!</font></p>
        <b><i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Gatekeeper at Stage Four.</font></i></b><font face="Times New Roman">
        In the fourth stage of the meditation, <i>Full Sustained Attention on
        the Breath,</i> mindfulness is to be told to be aware of the whole
        breath in every moment and<b> </b>not to allow other things to intrude
        on this smooth, continuous<b> </b>awareness<b> </b>of the breath.
        &quot;I shall be aware of the whole breath, continually and just
        disregard anything other than the breath in every moment.&quot; &quot;I
        shall be aware of the whole breath continually and disregard everything
        else.&quot; &quot; I shall be aware of the whole breath continually and
        disregard anything else&quot; If you instruct the mind very carefully
        and clearly, you're giving mindfulness a chance. You only have to tell
        yourself the message three times at the beginning and just see what
        happens.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you've got a very forgetful type of
        mindfulness, in other words if you give yourself these instructions and
        after one or two minutes you find you're just drifting off to
        &quot;Goodness knows where&quot;, there are two possible reasons. One,
        you didn't instruct yourself carefully or clearly enough as to what
        you're supposed to be doing; or two, you really have got very weak
        mindfulness. If you really have weak mindfulness then every three or
        four minutes you should repeat the instructions. There's no need to
        repeat the instructions every ten or fifteen seconds. Repeating of the
        instructions as often as that causes a disturbance in meditation, which
        never gives meditation a chance to work and which<b> </b>eventually just
        gives rise to restlessness and despair.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You should give yourself the
        instructions very carefully, and you'll find you will remember them. So
        little by little you develop mindfulness. You will notice that this
        thing we call mindfulness starts off with a huge territory to be aware
        of: the present moment. There's a huge amount of things you can be
        conscious of in the present moment. Then it's developed and refined down
        bit by bit. Instead of anything in the present moment, it becomes that
        which is silent in the present moment, discarding all that belongs to
        chatter and thought. Then instead of just silence in the present moment,
        everything is discarded other than the silent awareness of the breath in
        the present moment, just awareness of the &quot;in-breath,&quot; and the
        &quot;out-breath&quot;. Then everything is discarded other than the full
        awareness of the breath, from the very beginning of the in-breath to the
        end of the in-breath, from the very beginning of the out-breath to the
        end of the out-breath.</font></p>
        <b><i><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Samadhi</font></font></i><font color="#00007f"><font face="Times New Roman">
        -- Sustained Awareness on Just One Thing</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The difference between Stage Three and
        Stage Four, awareness of the breath and full awareness of the breath, is
        that for awareness of the breath you just have to notice part of each
        in-breath and part of each out-breath . Once you've noticed part of the
        in-breath then the mind can go wandering off somewhere else, but it has
        to be &quot;home&quot; again in time to catch the next out-breath. Once
        it's seen the breath going out, then it can go off again and observe
        other<b> </b>things, until it has to come home again to catch the breath
        going in again. Awareness still has places where it can go. It's still
        got some &quot;width&quot;. It is tied to the breath, but on a long
        leash. You can, at this third stage, be aware of other things as well as
        the breath. But for full awareness of the breath you need to completely
        lock the awareness into the breathing and be aware of nothing else.
        That's why that fourth stage is so important in this meditation. It's
        where you really grab hold of your meditation object. You have
        continuous awareness with it. The awareness here is refined onto one
        small area of existence, just your breath. This is what we're doing with
        awareness. We're restricting it. Instead of allowing it to go all over
        the place, we're focusing it in. And it's with the focusing in of
        awareness, that awareness starts to become strong. It's like using a
        magnifying glass to start a fire. It's concentrating all the energies
        onto one thing. This ability to sustain the mindfulness, to sustain the
        awareness, to sustain the attention, is<b> </b>called<i> Samadhi</i><b>.
        </b>A good definition of <i>Samadhi</i> is: &quot;Sustaining your
        attention on one thing&quot;.<b> </b>No need to call it
        &quot;concentration&quot;, because concentration misses so much of what
        is really important in the meaning of <i>Samadhi</i>.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Samadhi</font></i><font face="Times New Roman">
        is the ability to sustain attention on one thing, and many people can do
        that in their lives. Take for example a surgeon performing an operation.
        I've talked with surgeons, and they tell me that sometimes they spend
        hours just on one operation. They're on their feet all the time, but
        they say they never feel tired because they have to sustain their
        attention on the end of their knife, or scalpel. If they don't, the
        patient might die. Just one little mistake, one lapse of mindfulness,
        and their patient can die. They can get sued or lose their jobs for
        killing their patients. Surgeons performing operations have quite a lot
        of <i>Samadhi</i>. They sustain their attention on what they're doing.
        Standing there they don't feel any pains or aches in their legs because
        all their attention is on the end of their knife. Surgeons can get into
        states of <i>Samadhi</i> because they have to be right there in every
        moment. It's difficult at first, but once they get used to it, it
        actually becomes very pleasant. There's only one thing in the world that
        they're concerned with -- just this part of the operation which is
        happening now. This example tells us an important message about <i>samadhi</i>.
        The message is this: if it's really important, you can do it.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Looking for the Dangers in the
        Meditation Object.</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I like to teach <i>Samadhi</i> by urging
        the student not only to emphasise the importance of the meditation
        object at each stage, but as I've said before to combine this sense of
        importance with a wariness of the dangers to the meditation object as
        well. With each of the stages, always know the danger -- the enemy to
        the goal of that particular stage. Again at Stage One the enemy is the
        past or the future. At Stage Two it's inner chattering. At Stage Three
        observing things other than the breath. Whatever the enemy is, see if
        you can identify that as the danger to that stage of the meditation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, if the enemy is the
        thinking mind, then the danger is insinuating thought which creeps up on
        you and then grabs hold of you like a python. Once the python has its
        coils around you, then you are lost. Remember that simile of the snake
        given in Chapter Five and be alert to the danger. As I also mentioned in
        that chapter, if you've lost quite a few points from your driving
        license in the last few months because of radar traps, you know that
        radar traps are a big danger to you. It means that when driving you
        become very mindful of the speed limits. If something is a danger to
        you, you become very mindful of it. Whatever it is that is taking away
        your success at meditation, identify it. Identify the main danger for
        you in each of these stages.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example suppose you repeat to
        yourself three times, &quot;I'll be silently aware of the present moment
        and not get involved in thinking&quot;. At the end of that you may want
        to become more precise and say to yourself, &quot;The 'snake' I've got
        to be really concerned about is thoughts about food.&quot; Whatever your
        particular &quot;snake&quot; is, keep a lookout for it. Be wary of it.
        If you instruct yourself at the beginning what your particular
        &quot;snake&quot; is and you instruct yourself clearly, intently, then
        you will find that part of your mindfulness throughout your meditation
        will always be on the lookout for that which is a danger to your
        success.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many of the problems in meditation do
        not originate at the beginning of the meditation period. They creep into
        your meditation somewhere in the middle. I like to give the following
        little technique to new meditators. I tell them: &quot;Just breathe in
        and breathe out three times and watch every breath. Just three breaths
        that's all.&quot; Now most new meditators can do that without any
        problems whatsoever. They can watch three breaths -- breathing in,
        breathing out, breathing in, breathing out, breathing in, breathing out
        -- with full awareness. Then I say: &quot;Now just do that for not three
        breaths but three hundred breaths. Do it for a whole hour.&quot; Of
        course they can't do it. Why can we do three breaths but can't do three
        hundred breaths? The reason is we can start out without any problems and
        with full awareness but we cannot sustain that awareness. These
        &quot;snakes&quot;, these problems, they creep in<b> </b>usually<b> </b>after<b>
        </b>we've begun meditation. When you begin meditation it can be very
        clear. Yet when the bell goes you may ask, &quot;Wow, where did that
        hour go?&quot;. You were snoozing, or you were just thinking about so
        many different things. You can start out watching the breath and you can
        finish up thinking about your holidays overseas. Somehow, somewhere the
        &quot;snakes&quot; come in. Or if you'd rather, the &quot;radar
        trap&quot; has got you. So you need to tell yourself what your main
        problem is and to &quot;psyche yourself up&quot; to do something about
        it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you've been meditating long enough,
        you know your problems, the things that you've really got to look out
        for. Psyche yourself up, by saying, &quot;Look out for this one&quot;.
        For example, if giving orders is your big problem, say, &quot;Watch out
        for that one&quot;. Really watch out for it. Then when you're
        meditating, you'll find that when an order is about to be given you will
        spot it coming. You sidestep the &quot;snake&quot; before it gets its
        coils around you. You slam on the brakes before the &quot;speed
        camera&quot; flashes. You've avoided it because you've seen it coming.
        This is where mindfulness starts to really kick in and become very sharp
        and very powerful. One learns to sidestep the dangers. You've given
        clear instructions, sidestepped the dangers, and the meditation really
        starts to become deep. Mindfulness then does become the controlling
        faculty of your meditation. It's one thing to define what mindfulness
        is, but here are clear instructions on how to be mindful, how to set it
        up, how to program yourself so you are fully mindful.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Arousing Energy</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course another factor needed for
        mindfulness is energy. In each of these stages you need energy, and the
        way that energy is aroused is by learning to put everything you have
        into what you're doing now. Don't keep any thing back for the next
        moment. It's one of the mistakes which people make -- especially with
        mental energy. They think, &quot;Well if I really push myself hard now,
        if I put a lot of energy into this moment, I'11 have nothing left for
        the next moment&quot;. It doesn't work that way with the mind. You
        actually arouse energy. You initiate energy. The more energy you put
        into this moment, the more you have for the next moment, and the more
        you've got for the moment afterwards.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">With mental energy you actually build up
        the force. With physical energy it is the opposite. You've only got a
        certain amount, a certain store of physical energy. So if you use some
        up now, you haven't got as much for later on. With mental energy, there
        is a limitless store, and if you put a lot of energy into what you are
        doing right now, you'll find the next moment, the next five minutes, the
        next hour or whatever, you're really awake and very alert. You're sharp
        because you've built up that energy. That's why Ajahn Chah, my Teacher,
        used to say that whatever you're doing put a hundred percent effort into
        it. If it's listening to a talk, put one hundred percent effort into
        listening. If you're sitting meditation, put one hundred percent effort
        into sitting. If you're walking, put one hundred percent effort into
        walking. If you're eating your lunch, put one hundred percent effort
        into eating your lunch. If you're resting, put one hundred percent
        effort into resting. Really sleep as perfectly as you can. Whatever you
        do, put one hundred percent effort into it. Then you find that you build
        up energy. You're awake, you're alive. If, however, you think,&quot; Oh,
        I don't really need to put energy into this sit,&quot; then you get
        dull. You don't enjoy it so much.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even put energy into eating your food
        when eating. See how much you can notice of what you are doing. Then
        you'll enjoy it more! What's the danger to mindfulness when you are
        eating food? Usually it's thinking about something else. Then you don't
        even know what you are putting into your mouth. No wonder so many people
        suffer from indigestion! Whatever it is that you are doing, know what
        you are supposed to be doing. Put full effort into it. Know the dangers
        and avoid those dangers.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Turning Up the Lights</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As one builds up mindfulness and it gets
        very sharp, one realizes that one has been living in a world which has
        been very dim, with not many lights. As one gets more and more mindful,
        it's like someone turns on the lights in the room, like the sun comes
        out and the surroundings become illuminated. That's why being mindful
        becomes a very joyful experience. It's very pleasant to be mindful
        because you see so much more of what's around you. It's like
        &quot;spotlighting&quot; reality. Reality really starts to open out to
        you. You not only see the colours; you see the shapes and the textures.
        You see everything there. It appears very beautiful and wonderful.
        That's why when mindfulness really starts to get strong it generates a
        lot of happiness and bliss.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">People who aren't very mindful, who are
        dull, who cultivate dullness, who sleep a lot, develop depression. They
        live in a grey world. I went to England some years ago. Every time I go
        there, it's in November, December, or January, and it's so miserable
        then because it's just so grey there. The sun is far in the south
        because it is wintertime. Only about nine or ten in the morning does it
        start to get light. By three or four in the afternoon it's dusk again.
        Everything starts to get very dull, and often the clouds are all grey,
        and you're in this drizzle, and all the buildings look grey. The street
        is grey. You look up at the sky, it's grey. It's grey from the top to
        the bottom. You look at the people there. What do they wear? They wear
        grey suits and overcoats. You look at the expressions on their faces,
        they're grey too. You know what tea they drink? Earl Grey! Ha! Ha! It's
        all grey. It's very grey and miserable and depressing. That's what a
        person with very little mindfulness is like. It's like living in a sort
        of London in a perpetual winter. It's just grey and miserable in the
        mind. There's no sort of light. There's no energy there. One doesn't see
        very much.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again when one has a lot of mindfulness
        it's like going out into a garden in the brilliant sunshine. It's
        energising, it's beautiful. There's a lot of energy and happiness there.
        If one can develop that mindfulness, that brightness of the mind, and
        then focus it on a small part of the world, then one sees deeply into
        the nature of that. The experience of bright and focused awareness is
        wonderful and amazing! You see much more beauty than you ever imagined.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So this is a useful simile for
        mindfulness: turning up the lights of the mind. One becomes more deeply
        aware because one actually starts to sustain mindfulness on one thing
        instead of letting mindfulness go all over the place. When that happens,
        mindfulness illuminates that object and builds up its own energy. One
        really starts to &quot;see&quot; into something very deeply and
        wonderfully!</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Building Up the &quot;Muscles of
        Insight&quot;</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This practice builds up the
        &quot;muscles of insight&quot;. Just take any object. It doesn't matter
        if it's a little fly walking on your robe or whether it's a leaf on the
        bushes outside or whatever. Just stand there, or sit there, and watch
        that one leaf. Let mindfulness illuminate it until awareness gets so
        strong on that one little leaf that you see so much of what's going on,
        on that little leaf. It's not just a green leaf, it's a whole world in
        there! Then you'll understand the power of mindfulness. When you can
        sustain mindfulness on one thing, you will know how it illuminates and
        releases a lot of the beauty in that object. It becomes fascinating just
        how much you can see! How much interest, how much wonder, how much awe
        there is in just a tiny leaf! That's where you start to play with
        mindfulness. You start to play with this power of mindfulness that is
        blissful and can see so deeply into things. But when you're looking at a
        leaf, if you start wondering about what you're going to have for dinner;
        then you can't see very clearly into it. Or if you start looking into a
        leaf and you start getting dull, sinking into sloth and torpor, or if
        you're wondering -- &quot;Are people looking at me? Do they think I'm
        somehow strange?&quot; -- then all those distracting thoughts will
        obviously break the spell and break the sustained attention. However, if
        you can sustain your attention on one thing, which is what you're
        learning with this practice of mindfulness and meditation, then it's
        amazing what you will see in the world. The world will start to open up
        and become very beautiful and very fascinating and very wonderful. And
        that's just the world outside!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one develops the ability to sustain
        mindfulness, to sustain attention on one thing for long periods of time,
        then one generates the ability to bore into something with insight and
        to see deeply into its nature. If you're one of those persons who wants
        to discover some of the deep truths of existence, if you don't want to
        just take it on faith from the books or from the teachers, if you want
        to find out for yourself, then this is how you find out. This is how to
        get enlightenment experiences. You develop this powerful mindfulness and
        point it at some interesting and rich sources of wisdom -- especially at
        the mind. If you can sustain attention on your mind, &quot;bore into
        it&quot; as it were, then you will find a whole treasure chest of
        priceless jewels of deep insight.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So to summarise so far, this is the way
        of mindfulness: what it actually is, how to develop it and, in
        particular, how to set up mindfulness at every stage of your meditation.
        Give yourself clear instructions, know what you're supposed to be doing.
        When you give yourself clear instructions and just sit back and watch
        the mind do its job, keeping you at your work, it becomes fascinating.
        That's all you need to do.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Letting Go of the &quot;Doer&quot;</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">At times I've described this type of
        quiet meditation as letting go of the &quot;doer&quot; and sometimes
        that's been quite confusing to some people. What do you mean
        &quot;letting go of the doer&quot;? This is what I mean. We do a little
        bit of doing at the right time, and then we let go and allow the doing
        to happen. Little by little we can let go of the &quot;doer&quot;. We
        can let go of all that chatter, all that ordering (which is ninety
        percent of the thinking mind), of always giving ourselves instructions,
        telling ourselves what to do, getting on our backs when we fail.
        Thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking! That's one of the
        biggest problems for meditators, and this is how to overcome it. There's
        time to think at the very beginning of each stage by giving ourselves
        clear instructions. Then we can let go because we see the mind doing all
        the work. We understand, we realise, we don't need to say anything any
        more. We can be quiet.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Different Levels of Mindfulness
        Revisited</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As our meditation develops not only does
        the area which mindfulness covers get less and less and less, but
        mindfulness increases and gets sharper and sharper. One of the marvelous
        things about meditation is that, as we sharpen the mindfulness we find
        it has different levels. This is the final thing I want to discuss here
        about mindfulness, the different levels of mindfulness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We actually find out that mindfulness of
        daily life is just so dull and useless for wisdom. It has got very
        little sharpness or depth at all. When we start developing meditation,
        we get sharper and more agile. By sharper and agile I mean we can
        sustain attention on very fine areas of existence, and the attention is
        very bright as well. However, as we develop the meditation deeper and
        deeper, we find we have to develop mindfulness to become ever more
        subtle, agile and sharp. As the meditator develops these different
        levels it happens so often that they lose the focus of awareness. For
        example if the breath is one's object, one loses the breath, and often
        people ask why. What has happened here? What has happened is that the
        breath has become soft and subtle, but the mindfulness is still too
        coarse. It hasn't been able to keep up with the development of the
        breath. If that's happened, one should go back to the stage before. This
        can happen at any time, but especially when one has full-sustained
        attention on the breath at stage four.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes the breath disappears and a <i>Nimitta</i>
        can come up, but you can't sustain that <i>Nimitta</i>. This is because
        the quality of mindfulness necessary to sustain a <i>Nimitta</i> has to
        be very refined, and you haven't built up that level of refined
        mindfulness yet. So you have to go back to the stage before the <i>Nimitta</i>
        comes up. Go back to full awareness of the beautiful breath, which is a
        coarser object than the <i>Nimitta</i>, and let the mindfulness develop
        further on that. But if your mindfulness is fully developed at the fifth
        stage, when the <i>Nimitta</i> comes up, mindfulness can handle the more
        refined object. You will find as this mindfulness becomes more and more
        sharp and agile, it can sustain attention even on the most subtle
        objects. But first you have to learn how to sustain attention on the
        coarser objects. At each of these successive stages the mindfulness has
        a higher quality to it, far more agile and sharp than at the previous
        stage. To return to the simile of the mindfulness of the surgeon, the
        mindfulness required to hold a <i>Nimitta</i> is like the skill required
        of a surgeon operating on the brain, while the mindfulness required to
        hold the breath is like the skill required for peeling potatoes. You
        need quite a different refinement at the subtle level. If you move
        straight from peeling potatoes onto being a brain surgeon, you're going
        to make a lot of mess. The same as if you move too quickly from the
        breath onto the <i>Samadhi</i> <i>Nimitta</i>. You're going to lose it.
        You're not going to be able to keep it there.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">With development, you can experience
        immovable mindfulness. The mindfulness that is on one thing entirely --
        very clear, very sharp. It doesn't move at all. The Buddha said this
        reaches its peak in the fourth <i>Jhana</i>. That's the peak of
        mindfulness, where one has complete equanimity. You're just fully aware
        of one thing, fully aware, unmoving. That's as powerful as mindfulness
        can get. Once you know that type of mindfulness, then you know how
        ridiculous it is to think you can become Enlightened without <i>Jhanas</i>.
        Without such powerful mindfulness you can't get the powerful insights.
        So you begin to realise for yourself what mindfulness can be, and the
        sort of mindfulness you need to become Enlightened. The powerful states
        of mindfulness, not the coarse ones, are the ones that will dig deeply
        into the nature of things.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So you can see that there are many
        different levels of mindfulness, and mindfulness isn't just one little
        thing which is there in daily life and which is the same in deep
        meditation. Know that mindfulness has many different degrees of power,
        subtlety and penetration. There are many types of knives -- blunt ones
        and sharp ones, some for peeling potatoes and some for operating on
        brains. That's just like mindfulness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This has been an exposition of what
        mindfulness means in Buddhism, in Buddhist meditation. Know how to
        develop it and how to make it very sharp and very agile and how
        eventually to generate that mindfulness which you can use to dig deep
        into the nature of your mind and uncover the beautiful treasures of
        &quot;impermanence&quot;, &quot;unsatisfactoriness&quot; and
        &quot;non-self&quot; (Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta). It's amazing. You can say
        words like &quot;the great treasures&quot; of Buddhism and people think:
        &quot;They can't be treasures. How can 'suffering' be a treasure? How
        can 'impermanence' be a treasure? How can 'non-self' be a treasure? We
        want something really marvelous and uplifting like 'beauty',
        'transcendence', 'cosmic consciousness', or 'The essence of all
        being'.&quot; This is why people don't find the treasures, they don't
        know what they're looking for./.</font></p>
