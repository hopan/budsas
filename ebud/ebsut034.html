<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">S</font>ince the very beginning of Buddhism
  over 2500 years ago, Buddhist monks and nuns have depended on almsfood. They were, and
  still are, prohibited from growing their own food, storing their own provisions or cooking
  their own meals. Instead, every morning they would make their day's meal out of whatever
  was freely given to them by lay supporters. Whether it was rich food or coarse food,
  delicious or awful tasting it was to be accepted with gratitude and eaten regarding it as
  medicine. The Buddha laid down several rules forbidding monks from asking for the food
  that they liked. As a result, they would receive just the sort of meals that ordinary
  people ate - and that was often meat.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, a rich and influential general by the name of Siha
  (meaning 'Lion') went to visit the Buddha. Siha had been a famous lay supporter of the
  Jain monks but he was so impressed and inspired by the Teachings he heard from the Buddha
  that he took refuge in the Triple Gem (i.e. he became a Buddhist). General Siha then
  invited the Buddha, together with the large number of monks accompanying Him, to a meal at
  his house in the city the following morning. In preparation for the meal, Siha told one of
  his servants to buy some meat from the market for the feast. When the Jain monks heard of
  their erstwhile patron's conversion to Buddhism and the meal that he was preparing for the
  Buddha and the monks, they were somewhat peeved:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;Now at the time many Niganthas (Jain monks),
    waving their arms, were moaning from carriage road to carriage road, from cross road to
    cross road in the city: 'Today a fat beast, killed by Siha the general, is made into a
    meal for the recluse Gotama (the Buddha), the recluse Gotama makes use of this meat
    knowing that it was killed on purpose for him, that the deed was done for his
    sake'...&quot; [1].</em></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Siha was making the ethical distinction between buying
  meat already prepared for sale and ordering a certain animal to be killed, a distinction
  which is not obvious to many westerners but which recurs throughout the Buddha's own
  teachings. Then, to clarify the position on meat eating to the monks, the Buddha said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;Monks, I allow you fish and meat that are quite
    pure in three respects: if they are not seen, heard or suspected to have been killed on
    purpose for a monk. But, you should not knowingly make use of meat killed on purpose for
    you.&quot; [2]</em></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many places in the Buddhist scriptures which
  tell of the Buddha and his monks being offered meat and eating it. One of the most
  interesting of these passages occurs in the introductory story to a totally unrelated rule
  (Nissaggiya Pacittiya 5) and the observation that the meat is purely incidental to the
  main theme of the story emphasizes the authenticity of the passage:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Uppalavanna (meaning 'she of the lotus-like complexion')
  was one of the two chief female disciples of the Buddha. She was ordained as a nun while
  still a young woman and soon became fully enlightened. As well as being an arahant
  (enlightened) she also possessed various psychic powers to the extent that the Buddha
  declared her to be foremost among all the women in this field. Once, while Uppalavanna was
  meditating alone in the afternoon in the 'Blind-Men's Grove', a secluded forest outside of
  the city of Savatthi, some thieves passed by. The thieves had just stolen a cow, butchered
  it and were escaping with the meat. Seeing the composed and serene nun, the chief of the
  thieves quickly put some of the meat in a leaf-bag and left it for her. Uppalavanna picked
  up the meat and resolved to give it to the Buddha. Early next morning, having had the meat
  prepared, she rose into the air and flew to where the Buddha was staying, in the Bamboo
  Grove outside of Rajagaha, over 200 kilometres as the crow (or nun?) flies! Though there
  is no specific mention of the Buddha actually consuming this meat, obviously a nun of such
  high attainments would certainly have known what the Buddha ate. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">However there are some meats which are specifically
  prohibited for monks to eat: human meat, for obvious reasons; meat from elephants and
  horses as these were then considered royal animals; dog meat - as this was considered by
  ordinary people to be disgusting; and meat from snakes, lions, tigers, panthers, bears and
  hyenas - because one who had just eaten the flesh of such dangerous jungle animals was
  thought to give forth such a smell as to draw forth revenge from the same species!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Towards the end of the Buddha's life, his cousin Devadatta
  attempted to usurp the leadership of the Order of monks. In order to win support from
  other monks, Devadatta tried to be more strict than the Buddha and show Him up as
  indulgent. Devadatta proposed to the Buddha that all the monks should henceforth be
  vegetarians. The Buddha refused and repeated once again the regulation that he had
  established years before, that monks and nuns may eat fish or meat as long as it is not
  from an animal whose meat is specifically forbidden, and as long as they had no reason to
  believe that the animal was slaughtered specifically for them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Vinaya, then, is quite clear on this matter. Monks and
  nuns may eat meat. Even the Buddha ate meat. Unfortunately, meat eating is often seen by
  westerners as an indulgence on the part of the monks. Nothing could be further from the
  truth - I was a strict vegetarian for three years before I became a monk. In my first
  years as a monk in North-East Thailand, when I bravely faced many a meal of sticky rice
  and boiled frog (the whole body bones and all), or rubbery snails, red-ant curry or fried
  grasshoppers - I would have given ANYTHING to be a vegetarian again! On my first Christmas
  in N.E. Thailand an American came to visit the monastery a week or so before the 25th. It
  seemed too good to be true, he had a turkey farm and yes, he quickly understood how we
  lived and promised us a turkey for Christmas. He said that he would choose a nice fat one
  especially for us... and my heart sank. We cannot accept meat knowing it was killed
  especially for monks. We refused his offer. So I had to settle for part of the villager's
  meal - frogs again.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Monks may not exercise choice when it comes to food and
  that is much harder than being a vegetarian. Nonetheless, we may <b><i>encourage</i></b>
  vegetarianism and if our lay supporters brought only vegetarian food and no meat, well...
  monks may not complain either! May you take the hint and be kind to animals./.</font></p>
