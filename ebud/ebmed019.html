<BR><P>
<B>S</B>ila, samadhi and panna are the names given to the different aspects of
the practice. When you practise sila, samadhi and panna, it means you
practise with yourselves. Right sila exists here, right samadhi exists
here. Why? Because your body is right here! You have hands, you have
legs right here. This is where you practise sila. 
It's easy to reel off the list of wrong kinds of behaviour as found in
the books, but the important thing to understand is that the potential
for them all lies within us. Your body and speech are with you right
here and now. You practise moral restraint, which means taking care to
avoid the unskilful actions of killing, stealing and sexual misconduct.
For instance, in the past you may have killed animals or insects by
smashing them with an axe or a fist, or perhaps you didn't take much
care with your speech: false speech means lying or exaggerating the
truth; coarse speech means you are constantly being abusive or rude to
others -'you scum,' 'you idiot,' and so on; frivolous speech means
aimless chatter, foolishly rambling on without purpose or substance.
We've indulged in it all. No restraint! In short, keeping sila means
watching over yourself, watching over your actions and speech.

<P>
<B>S</B>o who will do the watching over? Who will take responsibility for your
actions? Who is the one who knows before you lie, swear or say something
frivolous? Contemplate this: whoever it is who knows is the one who has
to take responsibility for your sila. Bring that awareness to watch over
your actions and speech. That knowing, that awareness is what you use to
watch over your practice. To keep sila, you use that part of the mind
which directs your actions and which leads you to do good and bad. You
catch the villain and transform him into a sheriff or a mayor. Take hold
of the wayward mind and bring it to serve and take responsibility for
all your actions and speech. Look at this and contemplate it. The Buddha
taught us to take care with our actions. Who is it who does the taking
care? 
<P>
<B>T</B>he practice involves establishing sati, mindfulness, within this 'one
who knows.' The 'one who knows' is that intention of mind which
previously motivated us to kill living beings, steal other people's
property, indulge in illicit sex, lie, slander, say foolish and
frivolous things and engage in all the kinds of unrestrained behaviour.
The 'one who knows' led us to speak. It exists within the mind. Focus
your mindfulness (sati)
 - that constant recollectedness - on this 'one who knows.' Let the
knowing look after your practice. Use sati or awareness to keep the mind
recollecting in the present moment and maintain mental composure in this
way. Make the mind look after itself. Do it well.
<P>
<B>I</B>f the mind is really able to look after itself, it is not so difficult
to guard speech and actions, since they are all supervised by the mind.
Keeping sila - in other words taking care of your actions and speech -
is not such a difficult thing. You sustain awareness at every moment and
in every posture, whether standing, walking, sitting or lying down.
Before you perform any action, speak or engage in conversation,
establish awareness first. You must have sati, be recollecting, before
you do anything. It doesn't matter what you are going to say, you must
first be recollecting in the mind. Practise like this until you are
fluent. Practise so that you can keep abreast of what's going on in the
mind; to the point where mindfulness becomes effortless and you are
mindful before you act, mindful before you speak. This is the way you
establish mindfulness in the heart. It is with the 'one who knows' that
you look after yourself, because all your actions spring from here.
By guarding your speech and actions they become graceful and pleasing to
the eye and ear, while you yourself remain comfortable and at ease
within the restraint. If you practise mindfulness and restraint until it
becomes comfortable and natural to you, the mind will become firm and
resolute in the practise of sila and restraint. It will be consistently
paying attention to the practice and thus become concentrated. The
characteristic of being unwavering in the practice of mindfulness and
restraint is called 'samadhi.' The mind is firmly concentrated in this
practice of sila and restraint. Being firmly concentrated in the
practice of sila means that there is an evenness and consistency to the
practice of mindfulness and restraint. These are the characteristics of
samadhi as an external factor in the practice. However, it also has an
inner, deeper side to it. 
<P>
<B>O</B>nce the mind has an intentness in the practice and sila and samadhi are
firmly established, you will be able to investigate and reflect on that
which is wholesome and unwholesome - asking yourself "Is this right?..." 
"Is that wrong?" as you experience different mind-objects. When the mind
makes contact with different sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile
sensations or ideas, the 'one who knows' will arise and establish
awareness of liking and disliking, happiness and suffering and the
different kinds of mind-objects that you experience. 
You will come to see clearly, and see many different things.
If you are mindful, you will see the different objects which pass into
the mind and the reaction which takes place upon experiencing them. The
'one who knows' will automatically take them up as objects for
contemplation. Once the mind is vigilant and mindfulness is firmly
established, you will note all the reactions displayed through either
body, speech or mind, as mind-objects are experienced. That aspect of
the mind which identifies and selects the good from the bad, the right
from the wrong, from amongst all the mind-objects within your field of
awareness, is panna. This is panna in its initial stages and it matures
as a result of the practice. All these different aspects of the practice
arise from within the mind. The Buddha referred to these characteristics
as sila, samadhi and panna. 
As you continue the practice, fresh attachments and new kinds of
delusion begin to arise in the mind. 
<P>
<B>T</B>his means you start clinging to that which is good or wholesome. You
become fearful of any blemishes or faults in the mind - anxious that
your samadhi will be harmed by them. At the same time you begin to be
diligent and hard working, and to love and nurture the practice. 
You continue to practise like this as much as possible, until you might
even reach the point where you are constantly judging and picking fault
with everyone you meet, wherever you go. You are constantly reacting
with attraction and aversion to the world around you, becoming full of
all kinds of uncertainty and continually attaching to views of the right
and wrong way to practise. It's as if you have become obsessed with the
practice. But you don't have to worry about this yet - at that point
it's better to practise too much than too little. Practise a lot and
dedicate yourself to looking after body, speech and mind. You can never
really do too much of this. The practice of mindfulness and restraint
with body, speech and mind and the consistent distinguishing between
right and wrong is what you hold as the object of mind. You become
concentrated in this way and by firmly and unshakably attaching to this
way of practice, it means the mind actually becomes sila, samadhi and
panna - the characteristics of the practice as described in the
conventional teachings.
<P>
<B>A</B>s you continue to develop and maintain the practice, these different
characteristics and qualities are perfected together in the mind.
However, practising sila, samadhi and panna at this level is still not
enough to 
produce the factors of jhana (meditative absorption) - the practice is
still too coarse. Still, the mind is already quite refined - on the
refined side of coarse! For an ordinary unenlightened person who has not
been looking after the mind or practised much meditation and
mindfulness, just this much is already something quite refined. At this
level, you can feel a sense of satisfaction with being able to practise
to the full extent of your ability. This is something you will see for
yourself; it's something that has to be experienced within the mind of
the practitioner.
<P>
<B>I</B>f this is so, it means that you are already on the path, i.e.
practising sila, samadhi and panna. These must be practised together,
for if any are lacking, the practice will not develop correctly. The
more your sila improves, the firmer the mind becomes. The firmer the
mind is, the bolder panna becomes and so on ... each part of the
practice supporting and enhancing all the others.
As you deepen and refine the practice, sila, samadhi and panna will
mature together from the same place - they are refined down from the
same raw material. 
In other words the Path has coarse beginnings, but, as a result of
training and refining the mind through meditation and reflection, it
becomes increasingly subtle.
As the mind becomes more refined, the practice of mindfulness becomes
more focussed, being concentrated on a more and more narrow area. The
practice actually becomes easier as the mind turns more and more inwards
to focus on itself. You no longer make big mistakes or go wildly wrong.
Now, whenever the mind is affected by a particular matter, doubts will
arise - such as whether acting or speaking in a certain way is right or
wrong - you simply keep halting the mental proliferation and, through
intensifying effort in the practice, continue turning your attention
deeper and deeper inside. The practice of samadhi will become
progressively firmer and more concentrated. The practice of panna is
enhanced so that you can see things more clearly and with increasing
ease.
<P>
<B>T</B>he end result is that you are clearly able to see the mind and its
objects, without having to make any distinction between the mind, body
or speech. As you continue to turn attention inwards and reflect on the
Dhamma, the wisdom faculty gradually matures, and eventually you are
left contemplating the mind and mind-objects - which means that you
start to experience the body as immaterial. Through your insight, you
are no longer groping at or uncertain in your understanding of the body
and the way it is. The mind experiences the body's physical
characteristics as formless objects which come into contact with the
mind. Ultimately, you are contemplating just the mind and mind-objects -
those objects which come into your consciousness.
Now, examining the true nature of the mind, you can observe that in its
natural state, it has no preoccupations or issues prevailing upon it.
It's like a piece of cloth or a flag that has been tied to the end of a
pole. As long as it's on its own and undisturbed, nothing will happen to
it. 
<P>
<B>I</B>n its natural state, the mind is the same - in it, there exists no
loving or hating, nor does it seek to blame other people. It is
independent, existing in a state of purity that is truly clear, radiant
and untarnished. In its pure state, the mind is peaceful, without
happiness or suffering - indeed, not experiencing any vedanå (feeling)
at all. This is the true state of the mind.
The purpose of the practice, then, is to seek inwardly, searching and
investigating until you reach the original mind. The original mind is
also known as the pure mind. The pure mind is the mind without
attachment. It doesn't get affected by 
mind-objects. In other words, it doesn't chase after the different kinds
of pleasant and unpleasant mind-objects. Rather, the mind is in a state
of continuous knowing and wakefulness - thoroughly mindful of all it is
experiencing. When the mind is like this, no pleasant or unpleasant
mind-objects it experiences will be able to disturb it. The mind doesn't
'become' anything. In other words, nothing can shake it. The mind knows
itself as pure. It has evolved its own, true independence; it has
reached its original state. How is it able to bring this original state
into existence? Through the faculty of mindfulness wisely reflecting and
seeing that all things are merely conditions arising out of the
influence of elements, without any individual being controlling them.
This is how it is with the happiness and suffering we experience. When
these mental states arise, they are just 'happiness' and 'suffering'.
There is no owner of the happiness. The mind is not the owner of the
suffering - mental states do not belong to the mind. Look at it for
yourself. In reality these are not affairs of the mind, they are
separate and distinct. Happiness is just the state of happiness;
suffering is just the state of suffering. You are merely the knower of
these. In the past, because the roots of greed, hatred and delusion
already existed in the mind, whenever you caught sight of the slightest
pleasant or unpleasant mind-object, the mind would react immediately -
you would take hold of it and have to experience either happiness or
suffering. You would be continuously indulging in states of happiness
and suffering. That's the way it is as long as the mind doesn't know
itself - as long as it's not bright and illuminated  The mind is not
free. It is influenced by whatever mind-objects it experiences. In other
words, it is without a refuge, unable to truly depend on itself. You
receive a pleasant mental impression and get into a good mood. The mind
forgets itself.
<P>
<B>I</B>n contrast, the original mind is beyond good and bad. This is the
original nature of the mind. If you feel happy over experiencing a
pleasant mind-object, that is delusion. If you feel unhappy over
experiencing an unpleasant mind-object, that is delusion. Unpleasant
mind objects make you suffer and pleasant ones make you happy - this is
the world. Mind-objects come with the world. They are the world. They
give rise to happiness and suffering, good and evil, and everything that
is subject to impermanence and uncertainty. When you separate from the
original mind, everything becomes uncertain - there is just unending
birth and death, uncertainty and apprehensiveness, suffering and
hardship, without any way of halting it or bringing it to cessation.
This is the endless round of rebirth.
<P>
<B>S</B>amadhi means the mind that is firmly concentrated, and the more you
practise the firmer the mind becomes. The more firmly the mind is
concentrated, the more resolute in the practice it becomes. The more you
contemplate, the more confident you become. The mind becomes truly
stable - to the point where it can't be swayed by anything at all. You
are absolutely confident that no single mind-object has the power to
shake it. Mind-objects are mind-objects; the mind is the mind. The mind
experiences good and bad mental states, happiness and suffering, because
it is deluded by mind-objects. If it isn't deluded by mind-objects,
there's no suffering. The undeluded mind can't be shaken. 
Simply speaking, this state that has arisen is the mind itself. If you
contemplate according to the truth of the way things are, you can see
that there exists just one path and it is your duty to follow it. If you
attach to happiness, you are off the path - because attaching to
happiness will cause suffering to arise. If you attach to sadness, it
can be a cause for suffering to arise. You understand this - you are
already mindful with right view - but at the same time, are not yet able
to fully let go of your attachments.
<P>
<B>S</B>o what is the correct way to practice? You must walk the middle path,
which means keeping track of the various mental states of happiness and
suffering, while at the same time keeping them at a distance, off to
either side of you. 
<P>
<B>T</B>his is the correct way to practise - you maintain mindfulness and
awareness even though you are still unable to let go. It's the correct
way, because whenever the mind attaches to states of happiness and
suffering, awareness of the attachment is always there. This means that
whenever the mind attaches to states of happiness, you don't praise it
or give value to it, and whenever it attaches to states of suffering,
you don't criticise it. This way you can actually observe the mind as it
is. Happiness is not right, suffering is not right. There is the
understanding that neither of these is the right path. You are unable to
drop them, but you can be mindful of them. With mindfulness established,
you don't give undue value to happiness or suffering. You don't give
importance to either of those two directions which the mind can take,
and you hold no doubts about this; you know that following either of
those ways is not the right path of practice, so at all times you take
this middle way of equanimity as the object of mind. When you practise
to the point where the mind goes beyond happiness and suffering,
equanimity will necessarily arise as the path to follow, and you have to
gradually move down it, little by little - the heart knowing the way to
go to be beyond defilements, but, not yet being ready to finally
transcend them, it withdraws and continues practising.
<P>
<B>W</B>henever happiness arises and the mind attaches, you have to take that
happiness up for contemplation, and whenever it attaches to suffering,
you have to take that up for contemplation. Eventually, the mind reaches
a stage when it is fully mindful of both happiness and suffering. That's
when it will be able to lay aside the happiness and the suffering, the
pleasure and the sadness, and lay aside all that is the world and so
become the 'knower of the worlds.' Once the mind - 'the one who knows' -
can let go, it will settle down at that point. 
<P>
<B>I</B>t is here that the practice becomes really interesting. Wherever there
is attachment in the mind, you keep hitting at that point, without
letting up. If there is attachment to happiness, you keep pounding at
it, not letting the mind get carried away with the mood. If the mind
attaches to suffering, you grab hold of that, really getting to grips
with it and contemplating it straight away. Even if the mind is caught
in an unwholesome mental state, you know it as unwholesome and the mind
is not heedless. It's like stepping on thorns: of course, you don't seek
to step on thorns, you try to avoid them, but nevertheless sometimes you
step on one. Even though you know this, you are unable to stop stepping
on those 'thorns.' The mind still follows various states of happiness
and sadness, but doesn't completely indulge in them. You sustain a
continuous effort to destroy any attachment in the mind - to destroy and
clear all that which is the world from the mind.
<P>
<B>S</B>ome people want to make the mind peaceful, but don't know what true
peace really is. They don't know the peaceful mind! There are two kinds
of peacefulness - one is the peace that comes through samadhi, the other
is the peace that comes through panna. The mind that is peaceful through
samadhi is still deluded. The peace that comes through the practice of
samadhi alone is dependent on the mind being separated from
mind-objects. When it's not experiencing any mind-objects, then there is
calm, and consequently one attaches to the happiness that comes with
that calm. However, whenever there is impingement through the senses,
the mind gives in straight away. It's afraid of mind-objects. It's
afraid of happiness and suffering; afraid of praise and criticism;
afraid of forms, sounds, smells and tastes. 
<P>
<B>O</B>ne who is peaceful through samadhi alone is afraid of everything and
doesn't want to get involved with anybody or anything on the outside.
People practising samadhi in this way just want to stay isolated in a
cave somewhere, where they can experience the bliss of samadhi without
having to come out. Wherever there is a peaceful place, they sneak off
and hide themselves away. This kind of samadhi involves a lot of
suffering - they find it difficult to come out of it and be with other
people. They don't want to see forms or hear sounds. They don't want to
experience anything at all! They have to live in some specially
preserved quiet place, where 
no-one will come and disturb them with conversation. They have to have
really peaceful surroundings.
<P>
<B>T</B>his kind of peacefulness can't do the job. If you have reached the
necessary level of calm, then withdraw. The Buddha didn't teach to
practise samadhi with delusion. If you are practising like that, then
stop. If the mind has achieved calm, then use it as a basis for
contemplation. Contemplate the peace of concentration itself and use it
to connect the mind with and reflect upon the different mind-objects
which it experiences. Contemplate the three characteristics of aniccam
(impermanence), dukkham (suffering) and anatta 
(not-self). Reflect upon this entire world. When you have contemplated
sufficiently, it is all right to re-establish the calm of samadhi. You
can re-enter it through sitting meditation and afterwards, with calm
re-established, continue with the contemplation. As you gain knowledge,
use it to fight the defilements, to train the mind.
<P>
<B>T</B>he peace which arises through panna is distinctive, because when the
mind withdraws from the state of calm, the presence of panna makes it
unafraid of forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations and ideas.
It means that as soon as there is sense contact the mind is immediately
aware of the mind-object. As soon as there is sense contact you lay it
aside - mindfulness is sharp enough to let go right away. This is the
peace that comes through panna.
<P>
<B>W</B>hen you are practising with the mind in this way, the mind becomes
considerably more refined than when you are developing samadhi alone.
The mind becomes very powerful, and no longer tries to run away. With
such energy you become fearless. In the past you were scared to
experience anything, but now you know 
mind-objects as they are and are no longer afraid. You know your own
strength of mind and are unafraid. When you see a form, you contemplate
it. When you hear a sound, you contemplate it. You become proficient in
the contemplation of mind-objects. Whatever it is, you can let go of it
all. You clearly see happiness and let it go. You clearly see suffering
and let it go. Wherever you see them, you let them go right there. All
mind-objects lose their value and are no longer able to sway you. When
these characteristics arise within the mind of the practitioner, it is
appropriate to change the name of the practice to vipassanå: clear
knowing in accordance with the truth. That's what it's all about -
knowledge in accordance with the truth of the way things are. This is
peace at the highest level, the peace of vipassana.
<P>
<B>D</B>eveloping samadhi so that you can just sit there and attach to blissful
mental states isn't the true purpose of the practice. You must withdraw
from it. The Buddha said that you must fight this war, not just hide out
in a trench trying to avoid the enemy's bullets. When it's time to
fight, you really have to come out with guns blazing. Eventually you
have to come out of that trench. You can't stay sleeping there when it's
time to fight. 
This is the way the practice is. You can't allow your mind to just hide,
cringing in the shadows.
<P>
<B>I</B> have described a rough outline of the practice. You as the
practitioners must avoid getting caught in doubts. Don't doubt about the
way of practice. When there is happiness, watch the happiness. When
there is suffering, watch the suffering. Having established awareness,
make the effort to destroy both of them. Let them go. Cast them aside.
Know the object of mind and keep letting it go. Whether you want to do
sitting or walking meditation it doesn't matter. If you keep thinking,
never mind. The important thing is to sustain moment to moment awareness
of the mind. If you are really caught in mental proliferation, then
gather it all together, and contemplate it in terms of being one whole,
cutting it off right from the start, saying, "All these thoughts, ideas
and imaginings of mine are simply thought proliferation and nothing
more. It's all aniccam, dukkham and anatta. None of it is certain at
all." Discard it right there.
