    . This is Dhamma, this is Vinaya, this is the Master's teaching.&#148;</i> Now, monks, the
    words of that monk are neither to be welcomed nor scorned, but without welcoming, without
    scorning, the words and syllables thereof are to be closely scrutinized, laid beside Sutta
    and compared with Vinaya. If when thus laid beside Sutta and compared with Vinaya, they
    lie not along with Sutta and agree not with Vinaya, to this conclusion must ye come:
    Surely this is not the word of that Exalted One, Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One, and
    it was wrongly taken by that monk. So reject it, monks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Monks, those monks who point out what is not Dhamma as
    Dhamma, what is Dhamma as not Dhamma, what is not the Discipline as the Discipline, what
    is the Discipline as not the Discipline, -- such conduct of theirs is to the loss of many
    folk, to the misery of many folk, to the loss, the injury, the misery of devas and

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<a name="0-3"></a><font size="6">S</font>ince many
    centuries ago, Vegetarianism has become a topic of debate in various walks of life,
    especially within the circle of religious life. There is no denying the fact that
    Vegetarianism is one of the aspects which aggravate the difference between Theravada and
    Mahayana --sects in Buddhism. Both sects stick to their respective view and
    interpretation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This writing was carried on for analyzing and studying
    straight-forwardly some issues of Vegetarianism, and also proving to what extent the view
    and the interpretation of Theravada and Mahayana are in line with the pure teaching of the
    Lord Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After observing the background, basis, function,
    objective, practice, effectiveness, and validity of Vegetarianism discussed in this
    writing, the Buddhists should be able to find a method of settlement which is wise and
    based on the Dhamma for the issues of Vegetarianism. At least, it is expected that this
    writing will broaden their horizon of knowledge --so that narrow-minded and unilateral
    view will not arise.&nbsp;</font></p>

    <h3><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<a name="0-4"></a>Prologue</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&#147;If you belong to Herbivore group, who eat
    vegetables and other agricultural produces, you may accompany Prince Charles and Princes
    Diana or both to dine together in the palace or to eat in the restaurant on the side of
    the road...&#148; </i><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> That is the quotation of one of a
    series of promotions and campaigns expressed by a member of the Vegetarian Society in
    England within the effort to introduce their way of living to the community, namely
    abstaining from eating any food made of animal meat --in the sense to limit themselves to
    eating plants, vegetables, fruits and other agricultural produces. It was said that this
    natural way of living can make a person healthier and stronger. Those who are very
    fanatical in Vegetarianism spread out an issue that animal-meat eating causes negative
    psychological effects. Scream of suffering and gripping fright of the animal being killed
    contain certain vibrations which are able to enter the meat. Such a meat causes
    nervousness, stress and worry to the eating persons.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Promotion, propaganda, and some predictions assuming that
    the Vegetarianism movement almost reaches the success, seemed to scare and to annoy some
    of the people belonging to <i>Carnivore</i> (meat eater), especially the producers of the
    food made of meat. They did not hesitate to spend millions of pound-sterling to campaign
    against the way of the vegetarian group belonging to <i>Herbivore</i>. Those belonging to
    Carnivore also incessantly defend their way of living. By exposing various results of
    research and study, they stated that the advanced and developing countries with clever and
    intelligent people were established by the high consumption of animal protein, whereas the
    people of under developed countries are the negative effect of unbalanced use of vegetable
    protein. Various ways, including to ridicule, were used by them to oppose the Vegetarians.
    This way is not used for the first time, but it has been applied for a very long time. On
    the arrival and presence of <i>Mahatma Gandhi</i> in England in 1988, <i>The New
    Encyclopedia Britannica</i> writes: <i>&quot;As he struggled painfully to adapt himself to
    Western food..., he felt awkward. His Vegetarianism became a continual source of
    embarrassment to him; his friends warned him that it would wreck his studies as well as
    his health.&quot;</i> Some scientists put forward that based on the form and composition
    of their teeth, and their digestive system, all the persons were actually destined to be
    Herbivore as well as Carnivore.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Persisting in avoiding any
    food made of meat means to conflict with the natural law.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The arena of promotion and propaganda resulted in much
    restlessness to many persons who are short of knowledge in the matter, especially in the
    details of the two ways of living. They are very confused in choosing the way of living
    which is most appropriate and suitable to them. What about the Buddhists? What is the
    appropriate answer to the title of this writing: <i>&quot;Are You Herbivore or
    Carnivore?&quot;</i> The following subject matters of discussion may be sufficiently
    useful in assisting in finding the right answer, in line with the Dhamma, to the above
    question.</font></p>

    <b><p ALIGN="center"><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">Background of
    Vegetarianism, and View as well as Attitude of the Buddha</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font face="Times New Roman">he
    English term <i>'Vegetarianism'</i> just appeared and was known in about 1847.<a href="#3"
    target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a> However, the idea on Vegetarianism has actually been push
    aside since a very long time ago, on an indefinite point of time. Abstinence from any food
    made of meat was noted as one of the teachings of Pythagoras, thereafter followed and
    secured by Plato, Epicurus, Plutarch, and other pagan philosophers. In Jambudvipa (India
    during the era of the Gotama Buddha), the adherents of Jainism --with Mahavira as the
    leader-- were known as the hermits very strictly practising the way of abstinence.<a
    href="#4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a> Within the circle of the Buddhists, <i>Devadatta</i>
    was the main pioneer for practice of Vegetarianism. Accompanied by his four conspiring
    monks, he strived for imposition of five extreme rules to the whole members of the Sangha,
    one of which was the rule to abstain absolutely from any food made of fish or meat. In
    response to this demand, the Gotama Buddha stated that the monks who felt comfortable,
    agreeable, and suitable to the rule may practice it. However, He rejected to validate and
    to apply the rule to <i>all</i> the monks compulsorily.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">From the discretion provided by the Gotama
    Buddha, it is very clear that Vegetarianism is actually not an official part of the Dhamma
    Vinaya. Vegetarianism is an unrequired and unimportant practice. The practice of
    Vegetarianism is not a <i>'passport'</i> for achievement of the purity and the Real
    Freedom <i>(Nibbana)</i>. In other words, whether Vegetarianism is practised or not, a
    person still has an opportunity and capacity to achieve the purity and the Real Freedom.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Gotama Buddha was repeatedly confronted
    with the problems of Vegetarianism. <i>Nigantha Nathaputta</i> -- also known as Mahavira
    -- was the leader of Jainism frequently ridiculing Him. The Brethren discussed this matter
    in their Hall of Truth: <i>&quot;Friend, Nathaputta the ascetic goes about sneering,
    because, he says, 'Priest Gotama eats meat prepared on purpose for him, with his eyes
    open'.&quot;</i> Hearing this, the Master rejoined: --<i>&quot;This is not the first time,
    Brethren, that Nathaputta has been sneering at me for eating meat which was got ready for
    me on purpose; he did just so in former times.&quot;</i> Then He told them an old-world
    tale. Once on a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as a
    brahmin. When he came of age he embraced the religious life. He came down from Himalaya to
    get salt and seasoning, and next day walked the city, begging alms. A certain wealthy man
    designed to annoy the ascetic. So he brought him to his dwelling, and pointed out a seat,
    and then served him with fish. After the meal, the man sat on one side, and said: <i>&quot;This
    food was prepared on purpose for you, by killing the living creatures. Not upon my head is
    this wrong, but upon yours!&quot;</i> And he repeated the first stanza:--<i>&quot;The
    wicked kills, and cooks, and gives to eat: He is defiled with sin that takes such
    meat.&quot;</i> On hearing this, the Bodhisatta recited the second stanza: <i>&quot;The
    wicked may for gift slay wife or son; Yet, if the holy eat, no sin is done.&quot;</i> <a
    href="#5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a> So, it can be stated that those who take life
    are in fault, but not the persons who eat the flesh. The monks have permission to eat
    whatever food it is customary to eat in any place or country, so that it be done without
    the indulgence of the appetite, or evil desire.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">A Buddha does not have the authority to
    prevent any other person from killing a living creature. Any person is entitled to do
    anything as he wants, and he will be responsible for and receive by himself the result as
    well. On many occasions, the Gotama Buddha confirmed that any murder is bad action <i>(akusala-kamma)</i>
    which will cause suffering, and animal meat trading <a href="#6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>
    <i>(mamsa-vanijja)</i> is one of the five kinds of trading which ought not be done by the
    Buddhists. Therefore, in this the Buddhists showed their equanimity <i>(upekkha)</i>. All
    creatures own their respective action. Whatever action done by them --good or bad--, of
    that they will be the heir.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">The view and attitude shown by the Gotama
    Buddha in facing the problems of Vegetarianism is the most prudent wisdom produced by a
    great man in this world. After judging for himself the objective --not unilateral-- view
    and attitude which really conform to the real essence, <i>Jivaka Komarabhacca</i>, a
    well-known physician, declared himself as follower of the Gotama Buddha. At one time, he
    paid a visit to the Master. After paying homage and taking a proper seat, he said: <i>&quot;This
    is what I have heard, revered sir: that they kill living creatures on purpose for the
    recluse Gotama, and that the recluse Gotama knowingly makes use of the meat killed on
    purpose and specially provided for him. Those who speak thus, revered sir: 'They
    kill...'-- now, are these quoting the Lord's own words, revered sir, not misrepresenting
    the Lord with what is not fact, are they explaining in conformity with Dhamma, and does no
    reasoned thesis give occasion for contempt?&quot;</i> In response to this question, the
    Buddha spoke: <i>&quot;Jivaka, those who speak thus: 'They kill...'-- these are not
    quoting my own words, but are misrepresenting me with what is not true, with what is not
    fact. I, Jivaka, say that in three cases meat may not be used: if it is seen, heard,
    suspected (to have been killed on purpose for a monk). In these three cases, I, Jivaka,
    say that meat may not be used. But I, Jivaka, say that in three cases meat may be used: if
    it is not seen, heard, suspected. In these three cases I, Jivaka, say that meat may be
    used.&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, the Buddha explained that
    wherever they are, the monks in the Dhamma Vinaya always develop loving-kindness <i>(metta)</i>,
    compassion <i>(karuna)</i>, sympathetic joy <i>(mudita)</i>, and equanimity <i>(upekkha)</i>
    to all creatures, far-reaching, wide-spread, immeasurable, without enmity, without
    malevolence. If a householder invites them to partake of food, they will accept it
    consciously, anything dedicated to them. They have never thought: <i>&quot;Indeed it is
    good that a householder wait on us with sumptuous almsfood.&quot;</i> They have never
    expected as well: &quot;<i>O may a householder also wait on us in the future with similar
    sumptuous almsfood.&quot;</i> They make use of that almsfood without being ensnared,
    entranced or enthralled by it, but seeing the peril in it, wise as to the escape. <i>&quot;What
    do you think about this, Jivaka? Are those monks at that time striving for the hurt of
    themselves or are they striving for the hurt of others or are they striving for the hurt
    of both?,&quot;</i> asked the Buddha. <i>&quot;Not this, revered sir,&quot;</i> replied
    the Jivaka Komarabhacca. Then the Master asked again, <i>&quot;Are not those monks at that
    time, Jivaka, eating food that is blameless?&quot;</i> He replied: <i>&quot;Yes, revered
    sir. I had heard this, revered sir: Sublime is abiding in friendliness. The Lord is seen
    as my witness for this, revered sir, for the Lord is abiding in friendliness.&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the meantime, the Buddha also explained
    that anyone who kills a living creature on purpose for a Tathagata or His disciples stores
    up much demerit in five ways: In that, when he speaks thus: 'Go and fetch such and such a
    living creature'; In that, while this living creature is being fetched it experiences pain
    and distress because of the affliction to its throat; In that, when he speaks thus: 'Go
    and kill that living creature'; In that, while this living creature is being killed it
    experiences pain and distress; and in that, if he proffers to a Tathagata or His disciples
    what is not allowable.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">Based on the conception in the above sutta,
    it may be concluded that the fish or animal killed (by one's self or through another
    person) intentionally offered to a monk as dedication <i>(udissa-mamsa)</i> is the food
    inappropriate to a monk, whereas the fish or/and meat (in dead condition) purchased by a
    devout follower from a market -- sold for public consumption <i>(pavatta-mamsa)</i> -- is
    the food permitted by the Buddha to be accepted and to be eaten by the monks, His
    disciples.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="4"><sup>4</sup></a> John Blofeld, a well-known
    Mahayana writer, seemed to disregard this historical fact when he made a wrongful
    statement: &quot;Ancient books show that Vegetarianism was unknown to India until the
    period when Buddhism swept over the country. Hindu scholars themselves admit that the
    practice was received from Buddhism...&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="5"><sup>5</sup></a> Please compare it to the
    saying of Jesus in Matthew XV, 10-19 which reads: &quot;Not what goes into the mouth
    defile a man,... But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles
    a man. For out of the heart, come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft,
    false witness, slander.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="6"><sup>6</sup></a> It is important to be

    and Vegetarianism in the Opinion of Theravada</strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font face="Times New Roman">heravada
    recognizes animal as an intact manifestation of life. Animal does not only have a shape of
    body <i>(rupa)</i> and instinct, but also has comprehensive mental elements --feeling <i>(vedana)</i>,
    perception <i>(sanna)</i>, mental states <i>(sankhara)</i>, and consciousness <i>(vinnana)</i>.<a
    href="#7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp; It is very precarious to prove
    scientifically that the capability of animal in identifying its species, caring and loving
    its offspring, selecting a suitable shelter for it, rightly remembering to return, being
    afraid of threat to life, and feeling happy when it is loved, being loyal and willing to
    make sacrifice for the protection of its caretaker whenever he is facing any danger, and
    the like are only motivated by instinct. Actually, it will be more accurate when it is
    said: the person who adheres to misleading dogma that animal has only instinct is the
    person who uses his instinct rather than his common sense as a man. Also, animal does not
    live only once, namely in this present life, but came from its past lives, and the life
    will continue from time to time in the future. Death in the present life for it is not the
    end of everything.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">Animal is not a humble creature nor accursed
    creature which may be treated arbitrarily. The animal slaughter as offering, as practised
    by primitive religion to bribe, to worship or to satisfy the low-desire of blood thirsty
    imaginative gods is a culpable action which could not be justified at all by Theravada. It
    is an official rule for any Theravadin to abstain from any form of animal killing. In
    addition, Theravada has never allowed animal butchery for food consumption.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">It is also necessary to understand that
    animal is not intentionally created for men. <i>Dr. K. Sri Dhammananda</i>, a Theravada
    leader from Ceylon who became a Dhammaduta in Malaysia for many years commented: <i>&quot;If
    we believe that animals were created by someone for man, there are reasons to say that men
    are also created for animals since there are some animals who eat human flesh.&quot;<a
    href="#8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a></i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, Theravada does not agree with the opinion that
    killing of animal can be prevented by launching <i>a protest or action of strike</i> in
    the form of abstaining from food made of meat (in the sense that it is required to
    practise Vegetarianism). The effective way to reduce the killing of a number of animals is
    to provide intensively the people with information about the Dhamma. It is only in this
    way that they can really bear in mind that the value of life is so important for any
    creature, including animal. This means that any creature is entitled to its life. As other
    living creatures, animal also covets happiness and does not want any form of suffering at
    all. The life loved very much by it should not be disturbed or even destroyed for any
    reason --which include satisfying human appetite. By means of such a right view, the
    people will not kill or slaughter any animal for personal consumption or for sale on the
    market. Thus, the life of animal can be saved not by <i>forbidding the eating of its meat
    or considering its meat as dirty</i>, but by <i>referring to the value of life, and
    fighting for basic rights of the animal.</i> There is no doubt that the way taken by
    Theravada to overcome the problem of slaughter may be stated as a method of solution <i>straight
    to the point</i>. This is absolutely different from the method proposed and adopted by the
    vegetarians, which may be considered as <i>an endless method, a seeming salvation</i>.</font></p>

    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">M</font><font face="Times New Roman">any
    people have known that Vegetarianism is closely related to Mahayana concept. A rule for
    practice of Vegetarianism was expressly outlined in <i>Bodhisattva Sila</i> in article
    three of Lahukapatti section, which reads: <i>&quot;A monk who eats flesh that comes from
    animal life, commits a Lahukapatti sin.&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">A sufficiently strong statement was inserted
    in <i>Nirvana Sutra</i>, <i>&quot;Meat eating smashes the seed of great compassion.&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">A statement of similar spirit was also
    appended in <i>Brahmajala Sutra</i> of Sanskrit text, <i>&quot;A disciple of the Buddha
    should not intentionally eat meat of any living creature because if he does so, he smashes
    great compassion, virtue, and seed of the Buddhahood. This also causes all the creatures
    meeting him to evade him. Therefore, all the Bodhisattva have to avoid the eating of meat
    of any living creature. Meat eating is the source of unlimited sin.&quot; <a href="#9"
    target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a></i></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Surangama Sutra</i> contains a refusal and
    sharp criticism against the practice of meat eating: <i>&quot;After my Nirvana, in the
    Dharma ending age, these ghosts will be found throughout in the world, and will boast of
    how they feed on flesh which leads them to realize Bodhi (Enlightenment). Ananda, I permit
    the bhiksu to eat only the five kinds of pure flesh which are the product of my
    transcendental power of transformation and not of animal slaughter. You, Brahman, live in
    a country where vegetables do not grow because it is too damp and hot and because of all
    the gravel and rock, I will use my spiritual power of compassion to provide you with
    illusory meat to satisfy your appetite. How then, after my Nirvana, can you eat the flesh
    of living beings and so pretend to be my disciple? You should know that those who eat
    meat, though their minds may open and realize a semblance of Samadhi (Concentration), are
    but great raksasa (demon) who, after this life, will sink back into the bitter ocean of
    Samsara (circle of continued life) and cannot be my disciples. They will kill and devour
    one another ceaselessly; how then can they escape from the three worlds of
    existence?&quot; <a href="#10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a></i></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the meantime, in <i>Lankavatara Sutra</i>
    there is a special chapter discussing the matter on meat eating. This is a dialogue with a
    bodhisattva-mahasattva named <i>Mahamati</i>. A part of the content can be quoted as
    follows: <i>&quot;It is not true, Mahamati, that meat is proper food and permissible for
    the Sravaka when (the victim) was not killed by himself, when he did not order others to
    kill it, when it was not specially meant for him. Again, Mahamati, there may be some
    unwitted people in the future time, who, beginning to lead the homeless life according to
    my teaching, are acknowledged as sons of the Sakya, and carry the Kashaya robe about them
    as a badge, but who are in thought evilly affected by erroneous reasonings. They may talk
    about various discriminations which they make in their moral discipline, being addicted to
    the view of a personal soul. Being under the influence of the thirst for [meat-] taste,
    they will string together in various ways some sophistic arguments to defend
    meat-eating.... Further, a tenfold prohibition is given as regards the flesh of animals
    found dead by themselves. But in the present sutra all [meat-eating] in any form, in any
    manner, and in any place, is unconditionally and once for all, prohibited for all....
    There is no meat to be regarded as pure in three ways; not premeditated, not asked for,
    and not impelled; therefore, refrain from eating meat.... Let one avoid all meat-eating
    [whatever they may say about] witnessing, hearing, and suspecting; these theorizers born
    in a carnivorous family understand this not.&quot; <a href="#11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a></i></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">Opposition against meat eating and suggestion
    to practise Vegetarianism are found in may other Sanskrit texts, that is: <i>Hastikakshya,
    Mahamegha, Nirvana, and Anglimalika</i>. However, all those sources have no equivalent
    comparison in any section of the Tipitaka (Pali) adopted by Theravadins.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">The thing to be investigated now is: What
    source is reliable? Can it be accounted for in terms of originality in this case? Did the
    Theravadins eliminate it? Or, did the Mahayanists interpolate it? In other question, were
    the rules and doctrine really stated and established by the Gotama Buddha himself or not?
    Both the Mahayanists and Theravadins stick to their respective opinion that it is their
    own scripture which is pure and original.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">It is considered necessary to study this case
    more profoundly. The study mentioned herein does not mean to analyze the rules and
    doctrine in terms of Mahayana as well as Theravada, because such an effort will cause a
    subjective and unilateral impression. The most accurate study to be conducted is to verify
    the validity of the rules and doctrine by virtue of historical evidences.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the <i>Bodhisattva Sila</i> translated by
    Kumarajiva, there are 58 articles divided into two classifications. Ten articles are
    classified into heavy offence <i>(garukapatti)</i>, the first four articles of which are
    the basic rules precisely similar to four articles of <i>Parajika</i> in the text of
    Patimokkha, Vinaya Pitaka (Pali). The rule for practice of Vegetarianism is set forth as
    the third article of the 48 articles on light offence <i>(lahukapatti)</i>. What should be
    analyzed further is the eighth article on Lahukapatti, which reads: <i>&quot;A monk who
    speak ill of or is opposed to the Buddhist Dharma in the Mahayana Doctrine, commits a
    Lahukapatti sin.&quot;</i> <a href="#12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a> The emergence of
    the term <i>'Mahayana'</i> in the rule is a very outstanding <i>peculiarity</i>. In <i>&quot;A
    Historical Study of the Terms Hinayana and Mahayana, and the Origin of Mahayana
    Buddhism&quot;</i>, a lecturer at Calcutta University, Department of Ancient Indian
    History and Culture, <i>Ryukan Kimura</i>, concluded --based on historical data-- that the
    term <i>Mahayana</i> was not known to the Buddhist community in the early period when the
    Gotama Buddha had not attained the Final Release. In the Pali <i>Nikayas</i> <a href="#13"
    target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a> as well as in the Chinese <i>Agamas</i> <a href="#14"
    target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>, which are the most reliable texts as the original
    manifestation in the early Buddhism, such a term could not be found at all. The term, at
    least, was just revealed after the Second Council <i>(Sangayana)</i> had been held, about
    one hundred years after the Mahaparinibbana, which resulted in the separation within the
    Sangha. Mahasanghika followers felt annoyed and embittered by the label given by those who
    were conservative and loyal to the pure doctrine of the Gotama Buddha as is [Theravada] as
    <i>'papa bhikkhu'</i> (evil monks) and <i>'adhammavadi'</i> (adherents of false doctrine).
    They tried to find a new term which could strengthen and take into superiority the
    opinion, concept, and doctrine followed by their own group, and on the contrary to oppose
    as well as to look down on the opinion, concept, and doctrine adopted by other groups.
    Some term such as <i>'Bodhisattvayana'</i>, <i>'Buddhayana'</i>, <i>'Arhatyana'</i>, <i>'Sravakayana'</i>,
    <i>'Dviyana'</i>, and the like could be composed successfully by them in a relatively
    short period of time. However, they seemed to be not so satisfied with the terms because
    all these were specific, only able to show differences in certain aspects. They required a
    term which could really accommodate, represent and cover differences of opinion, concept,
    and doctrine as a whole. At last, they created a term felt to be more agreeable, namely: <i>'Mahayana'</i>
    for their own party and <i>'Hinayana'</i> for other parties, literary meaning &quot;Great
    Vehicle&quot; and &quot;Lesser Vehicle&quot;. During the period from the time of the
    separation up to the time of <i>Nagarjuna</i> (the second century A.D.), the term Mahayana
    and Hinayana were only used to indicate differences of the basic doctrine --as contained
    in <i>Saddharmapundarika Sutra</i>. Just in the time of Nagarjuna and thereafter, the term
    was subjected to change of connotation, not only referring to the differences of the basic
    doctrine, but also referring to the difference of school/sect --as written in <i>Prajnaparamita
    Sastra</i>. Those who were classified into Hinayana were not only the group of Theravada,
    Sarvastivada, but also the group of Mahasanghika which was its founder. From the above
    analyses, it is clearly proved that the term Mahayana was actually just known to the
    Buddhist community later. Coming back to the context of this writing, it is necessary to
    ask a question: How was it possible that the term Mahayana which was never stated by the
    Buddha may appear in one of the articles of Bodhisattva Sila? Certainly, none can help but
    say that the term is a new insertion. The next point of contemplation is: When they did
    not feel <i>'sinful'</i> at all to insert the term Mahayana and to threaten the persons
    who humiliated and opposed their doctrine, would they feel <i>'guilty'</i> of making the
    idea of Vegetarianism penetrate the Bodhisattva Sila and of swindling the name of the
    Buddha as the person who made the rule effective? In terms of its title, the validity of
    the Bodhisattva Sila itself is actually still very obscure. All the articles set forth
    therein are the rules especially directed to the monks. In this case, the <i>composer</i>
    of the Bodhisattva Sila presumably laid the fact aside that the bodhisattvas were not
    absolutely born to be monks or laity, but they might be born to be other living creatures
    such as animals. If the Bodhisattva Sila is applied to any of the bodhisattva born in any
    world, the practice will be peculiar and funny. Conversely, if the Bodhisattva Sila is
    declared as a rule especially applied to a bodhisattva being born as a monk, the use of <i>'Bodhisattva'</i>
    Sila can certainly be considered inaccurate.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">In reality, it is not too difficult to prove
    on the basis of historical data, evidences and facts, whether the monks in the early
    period, and even the Gotama Buddha himself ate animal flesh or not. In <i>Pratimoksa Sutra</i>
    (Sanskrit) of the <i>Mahasanghika</i> group, the origin of Mahayana sect, in the 39<sup>th</sup>
    article of Pacattika<sup> <a href="#15" target="_self">15</a></sup>, there is a rule which
    reads: <i>&quot;Whatever monk who is not ill, asking or having families asked for such
    foods which are regarded as excellent, for himself, should chew or consume them, that is a
    Pacattika. These are foods which are regarded as excellent (pranitasammatani bhojanani),
    namely: clarified butter, oil, honey, molasses, milk, curds, fish, and meat.&quot;</i> <a
    href="#16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a> Indirectly, this rule implies that a monk who
    is ill may ask for and eat fish and meat, whereas a monk who is not ill may also eat it
    provided that he does not request it from a householder who is not his relative. Thus,
    there is no doubt that fish and meat are the food appropriate and common to the monks from
    the early period in the time of the Gotama Buddha.<a href="#17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">Relating to <i>Lankavatara Sutra</i>, a
    Sanskrit expert and well-known Buddhist intellectual, <i>Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki</i>,
    commented on the introduction to the translation of the Lankavatara Sutra and also in his
    commentary book, <i>&quot;Studies in the Lankavatara Sutra&quot;</i> that the eighth
    chapter of this sutra, namely <i>&quot;on Meat Eating&quot;</i> is a later addition, like
    the introductory chapter, which relates the dialogue with <i>Ravana</i> --a legendary
    giant king also known in the Hinduism myth. It is clearly visible that there was an effort
    to append this chapter into the main part of the sutra. The chapter which has no organic
    connection with the text proper, suffered certain modifications, especially on the
    translation worked by <i>Bodhiruci (Wei)</i> in 513 A.D.. There must have been the
    accepting of meat-food among the followers of Buddhism in the time when the Lankavatara
    Sutra was compiled. Evidently, the Buddha did not object to their eating it if the animal
    was not especially killed for them. This caused unfavourable comments among the other
    religions, for instance, the <i>Lokayatas</i>, and the Buddhists naturally did not like
    them, and this must have started the new effort to prohibit meat-eating altogether among
    the Mahayana advocates. In any way, Lankavatara Sutra which just a collection of notes
    unsystematically strung together, is not a discourse directly preached by the founder of
    Buddhism, that it is a later composition which developed some time after the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Based on the result of the critical analysis conducted by
    D.T. Suzuki for seven years, as summarized above, the statement of <i>Maitridevi</i> in <i>Pancaran
    Dharma</i> magazine, issue number 149, that <i>&quot;. . . If a sutta or sutra is
    contained in the Holy Book of Tipitaka or Tripitaka, the sutta or sutra was certainly
    preached by the Gotama Buddha or Sakyamuni Buddha, such as Lankavatara Sutra contained in
    the Tripitaka.&quot;</i>, may be considered as a very rash statement expressed with the
    blind dedication and emotion --beyond historical data, evidences, facts--; a very
    primitive attitude in believing something, if it is not a hypocrite effort in reuniting
    sects in Buddhism. In the <i>Dipavamsa</i>, it is straight-forwardly narrated that the
    deviating monks of <i>Vajjiputtaka</i> group, founders of Mahayana sect, who did not
    understand the real meaning of the pure doctrine of the Buddha, put aside at their will
    some parts of the profound sutta and vinaya, and composed false new sutra and vinaya. It
    seems many Buddhists in Indonesia at present have not realized so much the advice of <i>Bhikkhu
    Narada</i> that: <i>&quot;Don't believe rashly that a sutra beginning with the concocted
    phrase 'Thus I have heard, once upon a time the Buddha lived at Sravasti...' is definitely
    a sermon really preached by Him. For certain groups, to write such a phrase is as easy as
    to write a novel, and to insert new sutras into the Tripitaka is as easy as to put new
    books in a row at a library!&quot;</i></font></p>

    Vegetarianism is frequently associated with the attainment of purity. A person abstaining
    from any food made of fish and meat is considered as a holy person. Can purity be attained
    in such an easy way? Certainly not! The purity depends on the condition of a person's
    mind, not on something beyond. A person's purity can be appreciated from <i>&quot;what
    extent he can restrain, and leave out his desire for food&quot;</i>, and not viewed from <i>&quot;what
    he eats&quot;</i>. In <i>Amagandha Sutta</i>, Sutta-nipata, Khuddaka Nikaya, it was
    written: <i>&quot;Neither the flesh of fish, nor fasting, nor nakedness, nor tonsure, nor
    matted hair, nor dirt, nor rough skins, nor the worshipping of the fire, nor the many
    immortal penances in the world, nor hymns, nor oblations, nor sacrifice, nor observance of
    the season, purify a mortal who has not conquered his doubt.&quot;</i> Based on the saying
    expounded by Kassapa Buddha to the ascetic Tissa as mentioned above, it can be declared
    that abstinence from any food made of fish or meat is not criteria for a person's purity.
    If only because of eating plants, vegetables, and fruits a person is considered pure;
    goat, horse, cow and the like are certainly pure from their time of birth! The statement
    of similar notion was also expressed by the Gotama Buddha against the people in Jambudvipa
    who believed that taking a bath in certain rivers [Gangga for example] a person can wash
    out all his desire, sin, and suffering. His saying is as follows: <i>&quot;Supposing water
    of the river can be used for washing out all the desire, sin, and suffering, it is sure
    that all turtles, crabs, fish, and shrimps living in the river considering as holy have
    been for a long time exempted from their desire, sin, and suffering.&quot;</i></font></p>

    present, when someone questions what is the basic difference between Theravadin monks and
    Mahayanist monks, people will promptly answer that the Mahayanist monks abstain from the
    food which is a living product, whereas the Theravadin monks may be free to eat anything
    as they like. This answer is indeed extremely mistaken and unreasonable. To declare that
    the Theravadin monks do not abstain from the food which is a living product, is as evil as
    to slander the Theravadin monks as 'killer'.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">In <i>Catuppaccaya Paccavekkhana Patha</i> ,
    it was specified how a Theravadin monk should have a certain attitude in accordance with
    the Dhamma to the food offering served by householders. Before receiving it, a monk should
    know and realize the food offering is only an element <i>(dhatuso)</i>, loathsome <i>(patikkulato)</i>,
    non-being <i>(nissato)</i>, lifeless <i>(nijjivo)</i>, and empty in the real sense <i>(sunno)</i>.<a
    href="#18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup></a> Likewise, when and after eating it, a monk
    should understand and realize it as the five things are.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">For the Theravadin monks, there is no
    difference between fish-dish/meat and plants/vegetables. The two kinds of food have the
    same function, namely to support survival, to contribute to pure life, to maintain
    physical health, to remove hunger, to sustain pain, to release physical disturbance, and
    to make the life easy. Any food should be eaten not for enjoyment, addiction, fattening or
    body embellishment.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">Fish-dish or meat (cooked) is a kind of food
    permitted by the Gotama Buddha to be accepted and to be eaten by the monks. The reason is
    that the fish-dish and meat are no longer living creatures or living products. As soon as
    an animal is dead, no consciousness <i>(vinnana)</i> or psychic life <i>(nama-jivitindrya)</i>
    will arise and exist within itself. Only the persons who stick to misconception on <i>Atta</i>
    will not be able to distinguish the cooked fish-dish/meat from the living creature. The
    concept of mind and body <i>(Nama-rupa)</i> for such persons is certainly blurred. If so,
    how is possible for them to covet the attainment of purity?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition, it should be explained herein that in
    Buddhism there is no belief that the meat of the slaughtered animal contains fury or
    mystical vibrations which will cause the eater to sustain nervousness, stress, worry, and
    the like. This is a misleading belief adopted by some ancient religions in India.<a

    of Vegetarian Buddhists stated that they abstain from any food made of meat for
    cultivation of compassion <i>(karuna)</i>. This statement should be studied further based
    on the pure doctrine of the Buddha. Several books on Abhidhamma <a href="#20"
    target="_self"><sup>20</sup></a> define compassion as: something having compassion to <i>dukkhita-satta</i>,
    namely unhappy living creatures or/and those who will afflicted with sufferings in the
    future. As meat (in the form of cooked food) is no longer considered as a living creature,
    as described before, it is impossible for anyone to develop compassion for it. This
    practice is as impossible as the development of compassion to vegetables, plants, table,
    chair, and other unliving items. It should be mentioned further that the compassion may
    not be developed in the formless worlds <i>(arupa-bhumi)</i> because in those worlds there
    is no object in the form of living creature or person. Seeing <i>'living creature'</i> who
    is suffering or/and will suffer is an immediate cause of compassion <i>(dukkhabhibhutanam
    anathabhavadassana padatthana)</i>. Thus, the presence of 'living creature' as object for
    practice of compassion is the main condition. It must also be understood that a
    manifestation of compassion is usually accompanied with intention, expectation and effort
    to help a living creature escape from suffering <i>(dukkhapanayanakarapavattilakkhana)</i>.
    In this case, no one may release an animal from the suffering which already afflicted it,
    with eating no meat. Whether its meat is eaten or not, the animal had already died, and
    might not come to life with its dead body. The underlying objective of all the teachings
    of the Buddha is to relieve one's self or/and other creatures from the suffering which is
    being or/and will be possibly experienced; not 'the suffering which has been passed'. A
    past suffering may not be changed anymore.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was said that when he was still a bodhisatta, the
    Gotama Buddha had lived in the past life as a heron. One day, he saw a fish floating in
    the river. As he thought that the fish was dead, he pecked the fish. When the fish was
    squeezed, it floundered. The bodhisatta living as heron released the fish immediately.
    However, the other fishes known to be dead <i>certainly</i> became his daily meal. Since
    the bodhisatta was born as heron, tiger, and other carnivorous animals, could he sustained
    himself with vegetables, spinach and the like? Eating the dead body of the fish did not
    mean that the bodhisatta had no compassion. It can be judged that he develop no compassion
    if he killed his prey by himself, as a custom for animals which were born not as
    bodhisatta. In <i>&quot;Dictionary of Comparative Religion&quot;</i>, <i>Trevor O. Ling,
    M.A., Ph.D.</i> simplifies in the entry &quot;Food&quot;: <i>&quot;. . . Among Buddhists,
    emphasis is laid on wrongfulness of killing animal (since it is a sentient being), rather
    than on eating its flesh when dead. The onus of bad kamma comes upon the slayer rather
    than the eater --a somewhat different attitude from that found among Hindus, who regard
    eating of meat as equally fraught with bad karma consequences.&quot;</i> There is evidence
    of difference between killing a living creature and eating meat. Thus, compassion --in the
    above context-- actually has no relation in any way to eating or not eating meat,
    Vegetarianism.</font></p>

    advocating the Vegetarianism, the 14<sup>th</sup> issue, <i>Sagaramati</i> wrote in his
    article entitled <i>&quot;Do Buddhists Eat Meat&quot;: &quot;To say that eating an
    animal's flesh has no ethical connection with the brutal act of killing it and the fear
    and terror experienced by it shows a thoroughgoing insensitivity to life, a poverty of
    imagination, and an incapacity to reason. Although one may not have killed the animal
    oneself or had someone else kill it for one, one is not freed from responsibility for the
    killing. A butcher or slaughterman kills an animal not for himself but for a market of
    consumers. If there were no of meat-eaters, there would be no point in butchering animals
    except for one's own consumption. Therefore, if one decides to eat meat one has also
    decided to become part of the market of meat consumers. And if one has become part of this
    market one is connected with the demand to which the butcher or slaughterman responds.
    There is a very definite relationship between the meat-eater and the brutal act of
    killing, between one's desire to taste flesh and the actual pain and suffering undergone
    by the animals.&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the tone of similar lyric, <i>John Blofeld</i> --a
    well-known author of some books of Mahayana-- also wrote in the Foreword of the book <i>&quot;Mahayana
    Vinaya&quot;</i> composed by <i>Bhiksu Yen Kiat</i>: <i>&quot;In modern times, animals are
    seldom specially killed for individuals; yet it is clear that all of us are indeed
    responsible for their death, as the butchers supply meat according to our demand for it.
    Thus, it does not seem at all logical under the present-day conditions for monks to claim
    that they can eat meat as they are unaware that the slaughtering takes place for
    them.&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At a glance, the writings seem to be logical and
    reasonable. However, if such a pattern of reasoning is applied consistently, the
    Vegetarians will not escape from the liability and the effect of the killing committed by
    another person. For the moment, they can crow over the developed loving-kindness and
    compassion since they have never looked at with their own eyes the process of planting,
    plowing, and harvesting of crops, vegetables, fruits and other agricultural products.
    Supposing the crops and other agricultural products are able to speak, they will perhaps
    tell about the groans of earth-worms, and other crawling creatures whose bodies are torn
    up by eyeless hoes; about screams of mice whose heads are crushed by unfeeling sticks;
    about murmur of insects whose breathing cavity has burned down by spraying D.D.T.; and
    about many other touching and heart breaking stories! Apparently, nature has not been
    prepared to make the crops and other agricultural products as the living witnesses who can
    speak and seek for justice before the herbivorous people. The screams, groans, and murmur
    are still considered as meaningless cry in the wilderness. It should be questioned whether
    indeed only cattle and fowl are appropriate for and entitled to loving-kindness and
    compassion, whereas the life of earth-worms, and other soil-animals, mice, and insects may
    be neglected in such a simple way? If the herbivores imagine how happy the cattle and fowl
    would be if in the world there are no carnivorous persons, it will be also fair enough if
    the carnivores imagine how glad the earth-worms, mice, and insects would be if in the
    world there are no herbivorous persons --in which it is possible for them to have a party
    safely on any wet and dry rice fields!</font></p>

    people said that practice of Vegetarianism can change human character. This was said by
    means of a comparison that the animals belonging to carnivorous are much more cruel,
    vicious, and wild than herbivorous animals. The thing to be observed further is: Can the
    life of animal be compared absolutely to the life of human being whose civilization is
    quite different? That is actually not the case. Many meat-eating persons are proved to be
    good-natured, modest, polite, devoted and religious.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">The above fact appears to have been realized
    by a graduate of Cambridge University who is assigned at the World Health Organization and
    the Food and Agriculture Organization, <i>Geoffrey Bell</i>. He acknowledged honestly: <i>&quot;An
    Eskimo, who is perhaps a Carnivore forever and ever, may be a Buddhist better than me, who
    usually abstains from the food made of meat!&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">If everybody has such a wide-viewpoint, the
    life story of the founder of German National Socialist Party (NAZI), <i>Adolph Hitler</i>,
    would certainly not make such a stir in the world. To the allies as well as his enemy in
    the battle, Adolph Hitler was known as a strict Herbivore --if he might not be called a
    Vegetarian.<a href="#21" target="_self"><sup>21</sup></a> Such a way of life represents
    the attitude of Adolph Hitler who more appreciate an animal than hundreds or even
    thousands of man slaughtered by him. A question should be put forward: Does animal need
    more loving-kindness and compassion than man?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the above real example, it can be concluded that it
    is very imprudent to evaluate a person's loving-kindness/compassion or harshness/cruelty
    only based on something usually eaten by him. In connection therewith, <i>J.M. Brower</i>
    commented: <i>&quot;If the statement that meat-eating will bring a person to the social
    harshness is true, the Eskimos will certainly be noted for their harshness, and India (in
    which the Vegetarianism develops rapidly) will certainly become the most peaceful country
    in the world!&quot;</i> That is not the fact. Thus, the statement that Vegetarianism can
    influence a person's characteristic is a superficial assumption which is groundless and
    unproved in a real way.</font></p>

    people said that the practice of Vegetarianism can make a person <i>feel sad</i> to see,
    to hear, or to imagine the event of killing committed by any other person (not to mention
    by himself) against animals as foodstuff to meet the need of life. This sad feeling then
    became a stimulus of spirit and support of determination for them in continuous practice
    of Vegetarianism. Is the statement in conformity with the reality? It is still up in the
    air! If it really makes a person feel sad..., the practice of Vegetarianism should also
    make a person at least <i>feel shy</i> to use parts of animals body [which have been
    processed in such a way] in fulfillment of their needs of life. In other words, when a
    person is determined to avoid any food made of meat or fish, in the logical consequence,
    he should also be determined to avoid any necessities of life made of animals! However, it
    seems that the fact is not as expected. It is not too difficult to find a drum [made of
    animal leather], candles [one of basic materials of which is derived from animal fat
    (tallow)] <a href="#22" target="_self"><sup>22</sup></a> at the Mahayana temples, and it
    is quite easy to find the Vegetarian monks who take honey [pressed from honeycombs in
    which its eggs or offspring must die] <a href="#23" target="_self"><sup>23</sup></a> and
    wear silk robes [the fibre of which might only be taken first by killing --by means of
    heating or steaming-- the larvae when they are still in their cocoon before dipping into
    the cocoon in the process of metamorphosis], and it is very easy to find Vegetarian layman
    who wears elegantly leather belt, leather sandals, leather shoes <a href="#24"
    target="_self"><sup>24</sup></a>, and other articles clearly made of parts of animal
    bodies. The consistent Vegetarian should also not take any medicines in view of the fact
    that any findings by medical experts demand the life of experimental animals.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">If an accusation is made that consumption of
    meat or fish as foodstuff can multiply the rate of slaughters, it is necessary to ask in
    turn whether the use of the above goods does not give the same opportunity? Presumably,
    the moment has come for the Vegetarian Buddhists to give the H.H. Dalai Lama XIV <i>(Tendzin
    Gyatso)</i> a special authority, namely <i>'infallibility'</i> in making any statement
    about moral, doctrine, concept, and anything relating to the teaching [as that owned by a
    Pope in the Catholic] that in a free and safe way he can immediately pontificate that:
    &quot;For certain reasons, which should not be put forward herein, I declare that only
    consumption of meat as foodstuff will increase the rate of slaughter, whereas any other
    use will not increase it at all, and even it is totally allowed!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nevertheless, supposing he has such a special authority,
    the H.H. Dalai Lama XIV should think thousands of times in order to issue such a
    statement. The reason is simple: he is not a Vegetarian forever! He strives to abstain
    from any shrimp-containing foods only due to the fact that he is bogged down with health
    problem, allergy.<a href="#25" target="_self"><sup>25</sup></a> Presumably, the suggestion
    to practice Vegetarianism integratedly and comprehensively in order to decrease the rate
    of slaughters since many centuries ago up to now is only <i>&quot;an unfinished plan&quot;</i>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">A</font><font face="Times New Roman">mong their
    active efforts in practising and publicizing their way of living, uncounted vegetarians
    buried themselves in creating a new kind of food which has never occurred to any of very
    creative professional cooks before, namely: <i>&quot;artificial meat&quot;</i>. This
    artificial meat is made of wheat flour kneaded with other ingredients in such a way that
    its taste, aroma and even form are exactly like original meat sliced and cooked from an
    animal --even, a cook will feel difficult to differentiate the artificial one from the
    original one. Although the method of preparation is very sophisticated and the expenses to
    be incurred are much more expensive than those of the original one, the idea to produce
    the artificial meat is quite exciting and attracting the people of various walks of life,
    adhering to the Vegetarianism or not. The restaurants serving such a kind of food appear
    suddenly in large numbers in some big cities in the world. Even, some Buddhist magazines
    [not cook books] in Indonesia do not fall behind in inserting various recipes of such a
    vegetarian food, from artificial roast chicken up to artificial pork roasted on skewers.
    Many questions should be put forward to the vegetarians who are interested in and have an
    appetite for such an artificial meat. How are the idea and practice of artificial food
    production in terms of religion? If the eaten food is artificial meat, is the attained
    purity also not an <i>'artificial purity'</i>? Is such a practice just the same as an
    effort to press a mental stain by raising another mental stain, which is more loathsome?
    Furthermore, may it not be considered as a great hypocrisy in this religious world?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Based on the fact which can be monitored, the 'appetite'
    of the person who practice Vegetarianism is surely no less than that of carnivores. Desire
    or mental defilement is never indiscriminate. It is indeed possible that a person who has
    been practising the Vegetarianism for a long period of time can press or forget his desire
    for food made of meat. However, this is not a guarantee at all that the desire will not
    change its object to another kind of food, vegetarian food --in the sense that he longs
    for and attaches to plants, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural produces which are
    of good quality and selected, and which are delicious and tasty, pleasing, and have an
    enchanting form. Thus, the desire actually cannot be eliminated only by replacing,
    changing, or shifting its object. The desire can only be eradicated from its own source.</font></p>

    in the form of <i>sukara-maddava</i> to the Gotama Buddha. This dish of food became the
    last meal of the Gotama Buddha before His Absolute Release (Mahaparinibbana).</font></p>

    who made this translation appear for the first time, but it is clear that this translation
    is fully supported by the vegetarian Buddhists. From the former times, they have really
    done their utmost in various ways to prove that the Gotama Buddha was a vegetarian
    abstaining from any food made of meat. The translation should be examined more profoundly.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">In <i>Sumangalavilasini</i> --the book of
    commentary on Mahavagga, Digha Nikaya--, <i>Buddhaghosa Thera </i><a href="#28"

    of pig of prime species, which is in moderate age --not too young but not too old--, which
    is tender, which is available in the market for public consumption (pavatta-mamsa).&quot;</i>
    This opinion is strongly supported by <i>Dhammapala Thera</i>, writer of <i>Paramatthadipani</i>
    --the commentary book of Udana, Khuddaka Nikaya-- saying that in <i>Maha-atthakatha</i> <a
    href="#29" target="_self"><sup>29</sup></a> there is also such a statement. In addition, <i>Buddhadatta
    Thera</i> who wrote <i>Mathuratthavilasini</i> --a book of commentary on Buddhavamsa,
    Khuddaka Nikaya-- also stated that one of the thirty natural points for each
    Sammasambuddha is: His last meal before Final Release is <i>'animal meat'</i>
    (parinibbanadivase mamsarasabhojanam). In the Tipitaka Scripture in Thai language
    --published by <i>Mahamakut-rajavidyalay</i>--, and in Burmese language (and its
    translation in English) --published by <i>Burma Pitaka Association</i>--, the term <i>sukara-maddava</i>
    is translated into <i>&quot;tender pork&quot;</i>.<a href="#30" target="_self"><sup>30</sup></a></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">If it is examined according to its derivation
    of word, the validity of the translation should not be doubted anymore. The term <i>sukara-maddava</i>
    is derived from two words, namely: <i>'sukara'</i> and <i>'maddava'</i>. In <i>&quot;A
    Dictionary of the Pali Language&quot;</i> compiled by <i>Robert Caesar Childers</i>, and
    in <i>&quot;Pali Glossary&quot;</i> compiled by <i>Dines Anderson</i>, as well as in <i>&quot;Concise
    Pali-English Dictionary&quot;</i> compiled by <i>Ven. A.P. Buddhadatta</i>, the noun <i>sukara</i>
    is translated into &quot;a pig, a hog, a boar&quot;, whereas the adjective <i>maddava</i>
    is translated into <i>&quot;flaccid, mildness, softness&quot;</i>. Thus, based on the
    derivation of word, the term <i>sukara-maddava</i> actually bears no relation to <i>&quot;mushroom&quot;</i>
    or any kind of fungus.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the meantime, it should be understood that
    householder Cunda was a devote <a href="#31" target="_self"><sup>31</sup></a> who knew
    that the Gotama Buddha was in poor health condition. He cooked intentionally a special
    food, <i>sukara-maddava</i>, with the expectation that His health would be improved. It
    would be very risky if the served food was a kind of food mixed with <i>'mushroom'</i>
    --since a very long time ago known by the people as a kind of plant which <i>'may be'</i>
    poisonous <a href="#32" target="_self"><sup>32</sup></a> --at least, according to the
    nutritionists, which may cause <i>weakness</i> and <i>intoxication</i>. Moreover, mushroom
    is a food of a very low nutrient content and even it may be said to have insignificant
    nutritive value.<a href="#33" target="_self"><sup>33</sup></a> In other words, mushroom
    are not any more nourishing than juicy cabbage leaves. Therefore, it is very improper to
    expect that such a food will support the health. It should also be known that the Absolute
    Extinction of the Gotama Buddha was actually not caused by <i>sukara-maddava</i> served by
    the householder Cunda --as misconstrued by many persons--; but it was because of the
    extreme weakness of His body, and because of the period of life he had to live having been
    exhausted. Three months before, He determined to terminate His life when it was full moon
    in the month of Vesakha. In the event presently recorded in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta and
    the Cunda Sutta, the Gotama Buddha had never said that <i>sukara-maddava</i> served by the
    householder Cunda contained killing poison.<a href="#34" target="_self"><sup>34</sup></a>
    He only said that in this world, no one, man, brahmin, ascetic, god, mara or brahma would
    be able to <i>'digest'</i> <i>(jirapeti)</i> the dish of food, except himself. <i>Nagasena
    Thera</i> and <i>Buddhaghosa Thera</i> commented that when the <i>sukara-maddava</i> was
    being cooked, many gods put heavenly <i>'oja'</i> (nutriments) in a large quantity into
    it, thinking that it was the last meal of the Gotama Buddha. Seeing the event, the Gotama
    Buddha told the householder Cunda not to offer the <i>sukara-maddava</i> containing the
    heavenly 'oja' to the monks who accompanied Him, which might cause <i>'overdose'</i>. The
    gods put the heavenly 'oja' in the dose especially allocated to the Gotama Buddha. Thus,
    the translation of the term <i>sukara-maddava</i> into <i>'mushroom'</i> with the
    presumption that the Absolute Extinction of the Gotama Buddha was caused by the <i>'poison'</i>
    contained in the food, is really not in conformity with the fact.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In any way, it is actually not so important and should not
    be used as material of debate by the Buddhists. Whether <i>sukara-maddava</i> is really
    mushroom or not, it cannot be used as the ground or reason to support the Vegetarianism.
    The kind of food ever eaten by the Gotama Buddha certainly cannot be concluded only by
    seeing His <i>'last meal'</i>. Several sources in the Tipitaka Scripture clearly indicate
    how the Gotama Buddha had His own attitude towards the Vegetarianism, and applicable to
    His disciples.</font></p>

    interpret that the idea to formulate the Vegetarianism was inspired by the misery
    sustained by the Bodhisatta Siddhattha for six years in the Uruvela forest, namely that he
    only ate leaves and fruits --did not eat fish or meat. This is actually a
    misinterpretation -- if it may not be said to be an invented story. He sustained the
    misery only due to his evil action in the pas life, namely that he insulted Kassapa
    Buddha. Thus, the misery was truly not within the framework of practising and cultivating
    the loving-kindness. Vegetarianism bears no relation to Perfection <i>(Paramita)</i> which
    should be developed by Bodhisattas. Moreover, his Paramita were actually completed
    unimpairedly before his rebirth in Tusita Heaven waiting for the right moment for
    emergence of a Sammasambuddha in the world.</font></p>

    Vegetarianism for Monks</strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font face="Times New Roman">he
    Gotama Buddha never forbade nor suggested to the monks to practise Vegetarianism. If a
    monk feels pleasant, agreeable, and comfortable to the Vegetarianism, he may practice it
    freely. However, the Vegetarianism should not be practised at the expenses of other rules
    stipulated formally by the Buddha and also should not be practised blindly with total
    fanaticism -- since the Vegetarianism has no established standing foundation in terms of
    doctrine.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">As it is forbidden to ask for any food from
    householders -- unless he is ill --, a monk who practises the Vegetarianism should not
    order the householders to prepare special food which is not made of fish or meat. He
    should be satisfied with anything offered sincerely and faithfully by the householders. If
    not, he is certainly not an easily supportable monk <i>(subharo)</i>. The difficulty in
    choosing food is not a reason for breaching of any other formal rule. He should know and
    realize which one is a primary rule, and which one is a secondary rule; which should be
    given priority and which should be subordinated.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">In addition, he should not boast by telling
    another person and even the public that he abstains from any food made of fish or meat. It
    is enough for him if he contended within himself. In any way, the main objective of all
    the rules is to train and to control oneself, not to enhance himself by an air of
    arrogance, boasting, or/and egoism. In other words, Vegetarianism should be practised not
    for humiliating, blaming or ridiculing the other monks who do not practise it <a
    href="#35" target="_self"><sup>35</sup></a>, or for other purpose which are not in line
    with the Dhamma Vinaya -- as what was done by Devadatta, one of the pioneers of
    Vegetarianism. If not, a monk who practises the Vegetarianism will not diminish, but on
    the contrary multiply his mental defilement.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the meantime, a monk who practises the
    Vegetarianism should realize that the Vegetarianism is only a rule which should not be
    obeyed blindly. By disregarding this view, he will not be able to attain the purity or the
    Real Emancipation. Even, the lowest stage of purity (Sotapanna) will never furnish any
    place for a person who is still put himself in the chains of attachment to the rules and
    rituals <i>(silabbataparamasa)</i>.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">For the monks, the practice of Vegetarianism
    sometimes gives an attractive experience. There was a monk who told some of his followers
    that he would practise the Vegetarianism for several months. As it is a custom of the
    monks not to refuse any food served to him --unless it is in contravention of the Dhamma
    Vinaya-- the monk received, but did not eat the food made of fish and meat. One day, which
    might be an unlucky day for the monk, one of his followers addressed him: <i>&quot;Venerable
    Sir, didn't you know that the dish of food, served by the other person, which you have
    just eaten actually contained meat?&quot;</i> Cornered by this very simple question, in a
    few moments the monk was conspicuously silent. However, as he was indeed good at speaking
    glibly, a few moments later the monk could control the situation. Apparently, the monk
    found an answer which could really protect himself from the question, namely by making use
    of the three conditions for purity of meat as provided by the Buddha. In sinless face and
    in calm voice, the monk said spuriously, <i>&quot;Heck,... I didn't see, hear, and assume
    the dish of food contained meat. If I knew before, of course I would avoid and not eat
    it.&quot;</i> This answer was certainly accepted with a weak smile and a light nod as if a
    very young boy has been just advised by his father. However, it was not impossible that
    behind the smile and nod there was an unimaginable valuation. There is an analogy which
    can clarify the difference between the Vegetarianism and the three conditions for purity
    of meat provided by the Buddha, namely a blade of sword and its scabbard. The three
    conditions for purity play a role as blade of sword, whereas the Vegetarianism is a
    scabbard. In a safe condition, a person usually appreciates, admires, and boasts only the
    beauty of the scabbard adorned with jewelry and carving. The existence of the blade of
    sword is neglected and forgotten. However, in a critical condition, the presence of the
    blade of sword which can slash anything, is more required and expected than the scabbard.
    In the safe condition, the scabbard can show its superiority, but in the critical
    condition, the scabbard can only entrust its safety behind the sharp blade of sword.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the above example, it is clear that it is actually
    difficult for a monk to practise Vegetarianism, especially those who are non-expert in
    cooking. The use of foodstuffs for cooking sometimes deviates from the assumption. For an
    example, a monk certainly feels difficult to differentiate between the soya bean cake
    fried by using <i>coconut oil</i> and the soya bean cake fried by using <i>lard</i> [the
    white rendered fat of a hog]. The nature does not favour men with a sharp sense of smell
    like that given to certain animals. However, supposing he has such a special sensitivity,
    a monk will face some difficulties, especially in terms of ethics. Presumably, it is not
    decent when a monk should first <i>sniff</i> repeatedly the food to be eaten by him.</font></p>

    different from the monks, laity will not face so many difficulties in the practice of
    Vegetarianism because they may examine carefully, look into, choose, and cook by
    themselves with the basic materials and ingredients to be used. One difficulty which will
    perhaps be faced is to prevent that no fly attacks it indiscriminately or no ant slips on
    the food pan. If this happens, they will be cornered in hesitation and skepticism because
    no holy book can prove scientifically: Whether the food in the pan is still pure as
    vegetarian food or not. Based on logic, the food cannot be considered as pure vegetarian
    food. However, if the food is declared in terms of religion as the food which is no longer
    vegetarian food, in this world actually none succeeds or will succeed in practising the
    Vegetarianism! Which food has never been touched or dirtied by animal carcass? Such
    question should be answered by the vegetarian laity: Are the rice; flour; and the like,
    mixed with louse carcass and other things in the bags, vegetarian foods? Are the plants;
    vegetables; fruits and other agricultural produces, containing worms; insects; and eggs,
    vegetarian foods? Are the cakes of soya bean and soya flour grasped or touched by the
    other buyers who have just chosen and sliced the meat in the market, vegetarian foods?
    Presumably, up to now there is no valid criteria to resolve this matter. Therefore, the
    success in practising the Vegetarianism is still an unresolved puzzle.<a href="#36"

    denying the fact that in this modern age, human beings are necessary required and even
    compelled to get the basic needs of their life, such as clothing, food, shelter, or
    medicines, which are processed and produced in the factories. Among the products available
    in the market at present are such as goods made of parts of animal body which are
    obtainable without any difficulty. Even, the daily necessities are not free from them. One
    of the examples is that some observers said that Colgate toothpaste, Camay and Palmolive

    back to the <i>primitive way of life</i>. However, before resolving this matter, someone

    both are related to the matter of eating, Vegetarianism is frequently connected with <i>Atthasila</i>
    (Eight Precepts), one point of which is the practice to abstain from eating food after the
    midday. Almost all the Mahayana monks who practise the Vegetarianism do dot observe the
    rule in the Patimokkha (Pali) set forth in the part of Pacittiya.<a href="#38"
    target="_self"><sup>38</sup></a> It seems that the two rules are considered as an optional
    alternative, either of which may be chosen as one wishes. The pretext is: &quot;Let those
    who feel agreeable to Vegetarianism practise the Vegetarianism, and those who are
    agreeable to the sixth precept of the Atthasila practise this precept. In any way, both
    are all the same for moral development, typical of the Buddhist Dharma.&quot; <a
    href="#39" target="_self"><sup>39</sup></a> Actually, such a pretext is really not in
    conformity with the pure teaching of the Gotama Buddha. At least, this pretext reflects a
    generalization between the teaching of the Gotama Buddha and the wrong proposal of the
    insurgent, Devadatta!</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="Left"><font face="Times New Roman">It is irrelevant if the practice of
    Vegetarianism is connected with the practice of the sixth precept of the Atthasila. Being
    different from the doubtful position of Vegetarianism, Atthasila was formally declared by
    the Gotama Buddha as a means which could lead one to the Heaven, even to the gate of
    purity. Therefore, it seems to be imprudent if someone jacks up and then replaces one of
    the precepts in the Atthasila with the Vegetarianism. Presumably, many persons still
    misunderstand the sixth precept. The precept is actually not only a rule of discipline,
    but also a tradition practised by the Buddhas, monks, and laity from the past ages. At
    present, the precept was formerly enforced by the Gotama Buddha just following an event.
    However, it does not mean that the rule did not exist before. The occurrence of an event
    was only a strong reason for a Buddha to start a formal enforcement of a rule. For that
    reason, it is quite wrongful to interpret that the rules of discipline are only the order
    outlined by the Gotama Buddha in His personal opinion and judgement. Thus, the <i>corruption</i>
    of the sixth precept of the Atthasila by the Mahayanists, does not only mean a failure in
    practising the precept, but also means to tear the tradition spread out perfectly by the
    Buddhas!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Certain people are of the view that the benefit of the
    sixth precept of Atthasila is only to practise moderate way in manner of eating, and apart
    from this, there is no other benefits. However, this is not the case. Besides giving many
    benefits to religious observance, the practice of the precept also maintains good physical
    health. The practice of the precept, known as <i>&quot;Juice Fasting&quot;</i> <a
    href="#40" target="_self"><sup>40</sup></a> in the modern medical term, has been proved
    valid in may developed countries: America, Germany, Sweden, Russia, and the like. A
    medical research institute, which is very famous in the world, <i>Karolinska</i>
    (Stockholm), recommends it as an effective method of treatment. In the absence of intake
    of protein and fat during fasting, body burns up and digest, in the nature course, its own
    muscles in the process called <i>'autolysis'</i> or <i>'self-digestion'</i>. This is
    carried out very brilliantly, namely by picking out unhealthy, old and dead parts of
    cells. In that way, the body will be clear of wastes piled up for a few moments. <i>Dr.
    Otto Buchinger, M.D.</i> called this method of fasting as <i>a refuse disposal, a burning
    of rubbish</i>. During the period of fasting, alimentary canal, liver and kidney can
    function more effectively because they are exempted from the duties to digest new food,
    and can specialize in cleaning out the heap of combustion refuse and eradicating as well
    as discharging any poison (uric acid, purine, etc.) out of the body. At the same time,
    process of formation of new sound and powerful cells will be accelerated. Someone should
    not fear for lack of protein content during the fasting period. It is because that the
    protein saved in the body is in a dynamic state, which can be continuously re-synthesized,
    re-utilized for various needs in the body.<a href="#41" target="_self"><sup>41</sup></a>
    Some scientist have now been able to prove that naturally, body can digest, process and
    absorb nutriments much better in the morning than during the night. Therefore, morning is
    the best time for all creatures --except flying bat and other night animals-- to fill
    their belly, whereas night is the time to take a rest. Presumably it is less human if
    someone puts his stomach, intestines, and other digestive organs to work by force during
    day and night!</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">I</font><font face="Times New Roman">n the
    preceding part, it is discussed in details whether the practice of Vegetarianism can
    really give benefits in terms of religion or not. Now, as the last topic of discussion, it
    is considered necessary to present a discussion in terms of physical health. There is an
    opinion that by abstaining from any food made of fish or meat, some persons will be
    healthier and stronger. However, there is other opinion that it is due to eating fish and
    meat that persons will be healthier and stronger. Which is the right one between the two
    opinions? There is no absolute truth in this matter. In other words, whether the practice
    of Vegetarianism is beneficial to physical health or the other way around, it will depend
    on each individual. For the persons who suffer from certain diseases: allergy,
    hypertension, heart attack, and the like, or the persons whose bodies have high content of
    cholesterol, the practice of Vegetarianism [More accurately, it may be called as <i>'diet'</i>]
    can indeed support their health. However, for babies and children, the practice of
    Vegetarianism will certainly hamper their growth, especially the development of their
    brains. Consumption of vegetables protein contained in the agricultural products cannot
    substitute the demand for animal protein as a whole. It should also be realized that fish
    and meat contain certain elements which are less or even cannot be found in the plants,
    vegetables or fruits, for instance vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> which
    cannot be produced artificially is very beneficial to formation and renewal of blood
    cells. Besides anemia, lack of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> may result in damage to brain,
    indolence and mental defect. The symptoms are formication up to nervous disorder or
    paranoia. If the condition is not overcome early, this will result in permanent mental
    deterioration paralysis.<a href="#42" target="_self"><sup>42</sup></a> It is clear that
    absolute abstinence from fish and meat leads to negative effects on one's health. If not,
    why do the health organizations stick to the motto: <i>&quot;Four for Health, Five for
    Perfection&quot;</i>, and it is not replaced with &quot;Three Enough for Health&quot; --in
    the sense that fish/meat and milk are excluded from the basic menu. Several <i>alleviations</i>
    applied by a certain vegetarian group in the West by legally allowing <i>milk, egg</i> and
    even <i>fresh-water fish</i>, indirectly expose their disguised fear that the rigid
    practice of Vegetarianism may threaten and endanger physical health. Thus, it would be
    concluded herein that actually, Vegetarianism is only appropriate for the persons who
    suffer from (certain) diseases, the persons who bear excessive nutriments or the person
    who do light labour [for instance, only sitting with legs dangling while instructing their
    subordinates]-- because they do not need a high consumption of animal protein or other
    elements contained in fish and meat. On the contrary, children, persons with malnutrition,
    or persons who work very hard --in which the consumption of animal protein and other
    elements contained in fish/meat and milk are required in a large quantity--, the practice
    of Vegetarianism should be taken into serious consideration.</font></p>

    attentively the discussions cited above, now the readers can certainly give the correct
    answer to the question: <i>&quot;Are You Herbivore or Carnivore?&quot;</i> The answer
    which is in line with the Dhamma, pure teaching of the Buddha, should not be either of the
    two alternatives. A real Buddhist would not be trapped in the dilemma of Vegetarianism.
    The Gotama Buddha set a prudent example and an excellent guide to face as well as to
    overcome the problems of Vegetarianism. No Buddhist should consider or classify himself
    into Carnivore [only eating fish and meat], especially shows an attitude as if he is a <i>salesman</i>
    of producers of the food made of fish or meat; who very ambitiously offers his commodities
    in pursuit of a high amount of incomes and in various ways does his utmost to legally
    allow animal killing. However, no Buddhist should consider or classify himself into
    Herbivore [only eating plants, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural products],
    especially shows an attitude as if he is <i>henchman</i> of the Vegetarians, who very
    fanatically spreads the way of living as Herbivore. Buddhists are the persons who have a <i>&quot;typical
    way of living&quot;</i> in fulfilling their demand for food, which cannot be classified
    into the way of living of Vegetarianism or <b>non</b>-Vegetarianism. Thus, in response to
    the question which becomes the title of this book, a Buddhist may state expressly and
    firmly: <i>&quot;I am neither a Herbivore nor a Carnivore! I am an eater of any food which
    conform to the Dhamma, pure teaching of the Buddha...&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A fool likes to raise frivolous questions and choosy on <i>&quot;what&quot;</i>
    kind of food to be eaten, while a wise is more attentive and more considerate <i>&quot;how&quot;</i>
    the food should be partaken mindfully; without arousing mental defilement.</font></b></p>
