        of the Buddha's teachings consist of four components: monks, nuns,
        laymen, and laywomen. Of the two major Buddhist traditions, <em>Mahaayaana</em>
        and <em>Theravaada</em>, <em>Mahaayaana</em> alone has all four of these
        components extant. For a number of reasons, including a series of
        invasions in Sri Lanka, the <em>Theravaadin</em> tradition lost its
        Order of nuns sometime after the 10th century. This puts women in <em>Theravaadin
        </em>societies at a spiritual disadvantage through no fault of their
        own. One may legitimately question why steps have not been taken over
        the last nine hundred years to restore the Order to its rightful place.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The origin of the <em>Bhikkhunii
        Sa&quot;ngha</em> is documented in the <em>Paali</em> canon [1].
        Permission to enter the Order for nuns was won with much difficulty
        thanks to the skilful diplomacy of the monk <em>Aananda</em> who
        appealed to the Buddha on behalf of <em>Mahaapajaapatii</em> [2] and her
        companions. The position of the Buddha in this matter requires
        investigation. In her book, Women under Primitive Buddhism, I. B. Homer
        states, <em>&quot;I hope to show that [the Buddha] did not, as is
        usually said of him, grudge women entry into the Order, but his
        compassion for the many folk included, from the beginning, women as well
        as men and animals. He saw the potentially good, the potentially
        spiritual in them as clearly as he saw it in man. Hence, were their life
        spent in the world or in the religious community, he spared himself no
        trouble to show them the way to happiness, to salvation a way which they
        might train themselves to follow by self-mastery.&quot;</em> [3]</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Aananda</em> was later criticized
        for having prevailed upon the Buddha for the establishment of the <em>Bhikkhunii
        Sa&quot;ngha</em>, [4] although the Order appears to have functioned
        successfully. At the Third Buddhist Council held in India in the third
        century B.C.E., it was decided to dispatch nine missions abroad to
        spread Buddhism.[5] One mission, headed by <em>Mahinda</em>, son of
        Emperor <em>Asoka</em> of India, reached Sri Lanka. The tremendous
        success it achieved was such that within a short time there was a
        request from a group of five hundred women, led by <em>Anula</em>, to
        join the order. Mahinda's sister <em>Sa&quot;nghamittaa</em> was invited
        to Sri Lanka to initiate the <em>Bhikkhunii Sa&quot;ngha</em>. Both <em>Bhikkhu</em>
        and <em>Bhikkhunii Sa&quot;nghas</em> grew quickly in strength and
        popularity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">By the turn of the tenth century,
        however, Buddhism in Sri Lanka was being seriously affected by internal
        political conflicts and foreign invasions, during which the monastic
        orders disappeared. Eventually a king named <em>Vijayabahu</em> was able
        to establish law and order in the country and became keen to revive
        Buddhism from the pathetic state to which it had fallen. Realizing that
        no members of the <em>Bhikkhu Sa&quot;ngha</em> remained, he sought
        assistance from Burma to restore the order of monks, [6] but there is no
        mention of reviving the order of nuns.[7] If monks suffered so
        extensively that their order became extinct, there can be little doubt
        about the plight of the order of nuns. There is no record that the king
        tried to revive it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even though the <em>Bhikkhunii
        Sa&quot;ngha</em> disappeared in Sri Lanka, Buddhist women remained
        earnest in their quest for spiritual awakening. Rather unusual steps
        have been taken by women in Thailand [8] and Sri Lanka.[9] In Thailand
        several groups of women have come forward who wish to practice religion
        with an earnestness beyond that common among laywomen. The status of one
        group, the <em>maejis</em>, is far from satisfactory. Another group of
        women, known as <em>silacarinis</em>, began in 1957 with the ordination
        of five women who observe ten precepts. They have a nunnery centered in
        Bangkok and wear brown robes. Another group wearing dark brown robes
        live under the guidance of a self-ordained monk, <em>Bodhiraksa</em>,
        who initiated the ordination lineage himself. Yet another group is
        headed by <em>Bhikkhunii Voramai Kabilsingh</em> who began as a <em>maeji</em>,
        but later received full ordination in Taiwan. Members of this group wear
        light yellow robes. I believe that this group will have the best
        opportunity of meeting the needs of Buddhist women who choose to lead a
        life of renunciation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Sri Lanka a movement known as <em>Dasasilmaataa</em>
        can be traced to the pioneering efforts of <em>Sudhammacari</em>
        (1885-1937). Born into a Christian family in Bentota, Catherine de Alwis
        Gunatilaka became interested in Buddhism and wished to become a nun. As
        there were no nuns in Sri Lanka and no monk would administer the ten
        precepts, she went to Burma (Myanmar) where she underwent training and
        was given ordination by Daw Ni Chari. She received the name Sudhammacari
        at ordination and founded the Lady Blake Nunnery at Katukele (Kandy)
        when she returned to Sri Lanka in 1903. Many women from various parts of
        the country came to her to receive the precepts</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">From there the number of <em>Dasasilmaataa</em>
        grew. These women now command respect from the lay community and receive
        assistance from the Buddha Sangha Ministry of the Government of Sri
        Lanka for their educational and material needs. Some of them are
        satisfied with the traditional ten precepts, but many are hopeful of
        becoming fully ordained nuns, either within or outside of the Theravadin
        tradition.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many heads of the <em>nikaayas</em>
        (monastic orders) in Sri Lanka oppose ordination for nuns and maintain
        that it cannot be granted within the Theravadin tradition of Vinaya.
        Moreover, they oppose nuns receiving ordination from any other Buddhist
        tradition. Fortunately some other leading members of the <em>Sa&quot;ngha</em>
        are of the opinion that Sri Lankan women may legitimately receive
        ordination from countries like China, Korea, or Taiwan where the lineage
        has been maintained without a break.[10] Considerable numbers of laymen
        and laywomen also favor such a step and support this cause.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Opposition to the revival of an order of
        Buddhist nuns seems to run counter the spirit as well as the religious
        aims of Buddhism. Two significant statements found in two authoritative
        suttas indicate how important the presence of nuns is in Buddhism and
        how much is lost in their absence. The first statement occurs in a
        relevant discussion between the Buddha and a wanderer, <em>Vacchagotta</em>.[11]
        In this discussion the Buddha affirms that all six components of
        Buddhist society named by <em>Vacchagotta</em> are expected to realize
        their ideals. These six components are: monks, nuns, celibate laymen,
        celibate laywomen, ordinary laymen, and ordinary laywomen. In another
        text, in a discussion with Mara, the Buddha is reminded of his
        commitment not to pass away until the four components of a Buddhist
        society, namely monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen, became eligible for <em>nibbaana</em>
        by cultivating the necessary qualities.[12]</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although in the <em>Theravaada</em>
        tradition women who aspire to be nuns are prevented by historical
        circumstances from receiving ordination, their counterparts in the <em>Mahaayaana</em>
        tradition fortunately are not. Therefore it is possible to overcome
        these obstacles by turning to the nuns of the <em>Mahaayaana</em>
        countries.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Historians believe that Buddhism reached
        China around the first century C.E. [13], Pao-Chang gives an account of
        the early beginnings of the order of nuns in China.[14] Given the
        extreme hardships of travel either over the Himalayas or through the
        deserts Central Asia, it was difficult for an order of monks to become
        established in China; how much more difficult it would have been for
        nuns to survive the journey and establish an order there. Eventually, it
        was by the sea route from Sri Lanka that the <em>Bhikkhunii Sa&quot;ngha</em>
        reached China in the fifth century.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Soon after Buddhism arrival in China, a
        number of Chinese women became interested in becoming nuns. There appear
        to have been many discussions on the ordination of women among the
        Buddhists in China prior to the establishment of a <em>bhikkhuni</em>i
        order. Some maintained that the establishment of an order was not
        possible without the participation of nuns in the ordination ceremony.
        Others were of the opinion that it was possible for Chinese women to
        receive only the initial, novice (<em>saamanerii)</em> ordination.
        Others believed that the Vinaya rules for full ordination could be
        interpreted to permit monks to grant ordination to women in spite of the
        absence of ordained nuns.[15] This seemingly unresolvable problem was
        vexing to unimaginative minds. Finally, the problem of full ordination
        for women was referred to <em>Gunavannan</em> of Kashmir by Hui Kuo, the
        woman who was to become the first Chinese <em>bhikkhunii</em>, herself
        an expert in Vinaya.[16] When she asked him whether it was legitimate
        for women to receive full ordination without the participation of nuns, <em>Gunavarman</em>
        responded by saying that there would be nothing wrong with such an
        ordination. When she asked whether it would be wrong for monks to grant <em>bhikkhunii</em>
        ordination to women without the participation of nuns, he replied that
        there would be no fault on the part of the monks if they did so. He
        explained that monks would be deemed at fault only if they gave <em>bhikkhunii</em>
        ordination without nuns when nuns were available to participate. Since
        there were no nuns in China at the time, there would be nothing wrong
        with such an ordination. This was a wise solution that was within the
        limits of Vinaya.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But <em>Gunavarman</em>, an intelligent
        and ardent propagator of Buddhism, did not stop there. He worked to get
        a sufficient number of nuns to perform the full ordination. In 429 C.E.,
        eight nuns from Sri Lanka arrived in China, but were deemed insufficient
        in number to perform an ideal dual ordination.[17] Therefore another
        group of nuns, eleven in number and headed by <em>Devasara</em>, was
        brought from Sri Lanka and reached China in 432 C.E.[18] Prior to his
        death, <em>Gunavarman</em> thoughtfully left instructions for performing
        the dual ordination with a Sinhala monk, <em>Sa&quot;nghavarman</em>,
        who completely fulfilled the instructions.[19] The two groups of nuns
        who had arrived in China from Sri Lanka conferred the dual ordination of
        nuns for the first time in China. It is said that at that time, <em>&quot;more
        than 300 Chinese nuns received full ordination from Sinhala
        Bhikkhuniis&quot;</em> [20]. Strangely enough, no Sri Lankan chronicle
        mentions this important event. It comes to us only from Chinese sources.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <em>Bhikkhunii Sa&quot;ngha </em>became
        firmly rooted in China and gradually spread through neighboring
        countries, such as Korea and Vietnam. In 1992, at a well-attended
        ceremony held to bid farewell to a group of five Chinese monks who had
        completed their education in Sri Lanka, Prof. W. Rahula referred to the
        regrettable lack of fully ordained Theravaadin nuns. He suggested that
        Sri Lankan <em>dasasilmaataas</em> could receive their full ordination
        from one of these countries.[21]</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The two suttas discussed earlier show
        that the disappearance of the nuns' component disable the <em>Theravaadin</em>
        tradition. Dr. Senarat Paranavitana has asserted that without the <em>Bhikkhunii
        Sa&quot;ngha</em>, the present-day <em>Bhikkhu Sa&quot;ngha</em> in Sri
        Lanka, cannot be called a <em>Mahaasa&quot;ngha</em> (great order). In
        addition, the inability of the <em>Theravaadin</em> tradition to meet
        the legitimate demands of women to practice Buddhism equally makes it
        vulnerable to criticism. Therefore, it is imperative for the <em>Theravaadin</em>
        tradition to meet this serious challenge and open its doors to nuns.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The following are possible ways to
        achieve this aim. The first three possibilities were presented by Prof.
        G. P. M. Malalasekara, founder of the World Fellowship of Buddhists
        (WFB), when he called or the restoration of the order of Buddhist nuns.
        His contributions to this effort, have appeared as far back as 1934 in
        the Ceylon Daily News.[22] He puts forth six recommendations.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>First</strong>, according to the
        <em>Mahaaparinibbaana Sutta</em>, the Buddha, when lying on his death
        bed, is said to have told his attendant <em>Aananda</em> that the <em>Sa&quot;ngha</em>
        was permitted to abolish lesser and minor rules.[23] Malalasekara says
        &quot;That, then, is the first possibility - a decision by a
        representative assembly of the <em>Sa&quot;ngha</em> to dispense with
        the traditional ceremonial in the ordination of nuns.&quot;[24] Making
        use of the Buddha's final concession, it is within the power of the <em>Bhikkhu
        Sa&quot;ngha</em> to make the necessary amendments to restore the <em>Bhikkhunii
        Sa&quot;ngha</em> by performing an ordination without, the participation
        of nuns. If any monk believes that the rules pertaining to the
        ordination of nuns are of major concern and do not fall within the
        category of &quot;lesser and minor rules,&quot; he would be invited to
        come forth and justify his position.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Second</strong>, it. is possible
        to make use of an injunction issued by the Buddha that stipulates, <em>&quot;I
        permit you monks, to confer full ordination on nuns.&quot;</em>[25]
        There are references in the texts that show that some regulations were
        amended, altered, or abrogated by the Buddha himself on various
        occasions under special circumstances. The absence of <em>Bhikkhuniis</em>
        in <em>Theravaada</em> clearly being a special circumstance, these
        textual references should be sufficient cause for granting monks the
        authority to ordain nuns with a clear conscience that no transgression
        of the Vinaya rules has been committed. Those who oppose the restoration
        of the <em>Bhikkhunii Sa&quot;ngha</em> on the grounds of Vinaya
        technicalities seem to ignore this relevant injunction.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Third</strong>, certain special
        procedures have been performed in Buddhist history, such as when <em>Mahaapajaapatii
        Gotam</em>i and her companions took the precepts before the <em>Bhikkhunii
        Sa&quot;ngha</em> had been instituted. The ordination of Buddhist monks
        nuns essentially consists of followers taking upon themselves
        voluntarily the observance of certain precepts. Ordination is not
        something that is transmitted from one person to another; rather, it is
        certain precepts that one undertakes to keep and observe in accordance
        with one's own motivation. Buddhist ordination is essentially different
        from the ordination of priests found in other religions, where priests
        are regarded as intercessors between human beings and a divine power. In
        the Buddhist context, there is not relegation of authority, no question
        of acting earth as a divine ministrant. Just as Buddhist lay-people in
        Sri Lanka undertake to observe the eight or ten precepts on poya days by
        reciting the precepts at a shrine, there is nothing to prevent women
        from observing the precepts of novice or full ordination. There cannot
        be any serious objection to this type of self-ordination.[26]</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If any one of the above suggestions by
        Prof. Malalasekera is accepted, it would be possible to restore the <em>Bhikkhunii
        Sa&quot;ngha</em> within the <em>Theravaadin</em> tradition. What is
        required is an understanding of the spirit, rather than the letter, of
        the Vinaya regulations. There are three further options available for
        the restoration the <em>Bhikkhunii Sa&quot;ngha</em> which have come to
        light because of the public discussions and debates that have taken
        place on this issue in Sri Lanka, particularly in the past ten
        years.[27]</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Fourth</strong>, due to improved
        relations and closer contact with China, Korea, and Taiwan, in recent
        years, it became known that the <em>Bhikkhunii Sa&quot;ngha</em>
        transmitted to China by Sinhalese nuns continues in these countries in
        an unbroken succession. Therefore it is possible to reintroduce the <em>Bhikkhunii
        Sa&quot;ngha</em> to Sri Lanka from one of these three countries (or
        Vietnam), either by bringing chapter of nuns to Sri Lanka or by sending
        a group of applicants to those countries to be ordained. Sending
        applicants to one of these countries is a better approach, since they
        would have the opportunity to undergo training there. This proposed step
        is not as drastic as some would make it out to be. It is merely the
        receiving back of the <em>Bhikkhunii Sa&quot;ngha</em> that was earlier
        sent from Sri Lanka to China. It would be like accepting back the great
        gift that was given in earlier times.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are precedents for this proposed
        reintroduction. In the latter part of the eighteenth century, a
        delegation from Thailand was invited to Sri Lanka to reestablish the <em>Bhikkhu
        Sa&quot;ngha</em> and began the <em>Siam Nikaaya</em>.[28] In the
        nineteenth century, two separate groups of monks went to monasteries in
        Amarapura and Ramanna in Burma and received full ordination there. On
        their return, they founded the Amarapura sect in 1803[29] and the
        Ramanna sect in 1864.[30] It is also well known that Sri Lanka has been
        instrumental at times in reviving and reorganizing Buddhism in Thailand
        and Burma. Therefore, there can be no legitimate objection to seeking
        the assistance of Chinese or Korean nuns in restoring the <em>Bhikkhunii
        Sa&quot;ngha</em> to Sri Lanka.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Fifth</strong>, if the venerable
        <em>Mahaanayakas</em>, the leading bhikkhus of the <em>Theravaadin</em>
        tradition in Sri Lanka, are not prepared to accept the authenticity of
        the <em>Bhikkhunii Sa&quot;nghas</em> in China and other <em>Mahaayaana</em>
        countries, Sri Lankan Buddhist women are still free to seek ordination
        in any Buddhist tradition they like.[31] Nuns fully ordained in other
        traditions should be recognized as <em>bhikkhunii</em> without any
        discrimination. <em>Theravaadin</em> leaders in Sri Lanka should not be
        hasty to oppose such a move. The choice to renounce worldly life and
        practice &quot;the holy life&quot; is the inalienable right of all
        Buddhist women. No Buddhist can legitimately deny women this right.
        Those who oppose women's right to obtain ordination within the <em>Theravaadin</em>
        tradition cannot oppose their right to become <em>bhikkhuniis</em> in
        another tradition. Gunapala Dharmasiri has stated that, since the
        tradition of Vinaya ordination is fundamentally the same in <em>Mahaayaana</em>
        and <em>Theravaada</em>, if an ordination lineage has been lost in one
        tradition, it can be reinstated by borrowing from those countries where
        it has been preserved.[32] The respected scholar <em>Aananda Wellawatte
        Thera</em> holds a similar view.[33] For tradition to question the
        validity of an ordination given by another established Buddhist
        tradition is not reasonable or justified.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sixth</strong>, a meeting may be
        convened of a special body comprised of leading members of the
        international <em>Sa&quot;ngha</em> community, representing several
        Buddhist traditions from all over the world. Sri Lankan candidates can
        be given <em>saamanarii</em> and full <em>bhikkhunii</em> ordination by
        this representative body. At present there are several international
        Buddhist organizations of this type, including one recently established
        in Colombo. Therefore, the convening of an international body of monks
        and nuns would not be a difficult task.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <em>dasasilmaataas</em> of Sri Lanka
        have dedicated their lives to the Buddhist path as nuns in an age when
        few are committed to spiritual values. Helping to promote their
        aspirations would encourage them and would promote the welfare of
        Buddhism as a whole. As Prof. Jotiya Dhirasekera has stated, Buddhism
        has contributed much to the emancipation of women.[34] This contribution
        has been impaired by the opposition of <em>Theravaadin</em> leaders in
        Sri Lanka to the revival of the <em>Bhikkhunii Sa&quot;ngha</em>. Some
        Buddhist leaders proudly assert that from its inception Buddhism has
        stood for the liberty of womankind. Their words are rendered idle coasts
        in the face of their opposition to the revival of the <em>Bhikkhunii
        Sa&quot;ngha</em>. Revival of the traditional order of nuns can no
