    <hr width="25%">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This short essay is intended to
    give a brief introduction to Buddhism. It will discuss the
    way Buddhists perceive the world, the four main teachings of
    the Buddha, the Buddhist view of the self, the relationship
    between this self and the various ways in which it responds
    to the world, the Buddhist path and the final goal. </font></p>
    <h4><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Three Marks of
    Existence</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism has been described as a
    very pragmatic religion. It does not indulge in metaphysical
    speculation about first causes; there is no theology, no
    worship of a diety or deification of the Buddha. Buddhism
    takes a very straightforward look at our human condition;
    nothing is based on wishful thinking, at all. Everything that
    the Buddha taught was based on his own observation of the way
    things are. Everything that he taught can be verified by our
    own observation of the way things are. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we look at our life, very
    simply, in a straightforward way, we see that it is marked
    with frustration and pain. This is because we attempt to
    secure our relationship with the &quot;world out there&quot;,
    by solidifying our experiences in some concrete way. For
    example, we might have dinner with someone we admire very
    much, everything goes just right, and when we get home later
    we begin to fantasize about all the things we can do with our
    new-found friend, places we can go etc. We are going through
    the process of trying to cement our relationship. Perhaps,
    the next time we see our friend, she/he has a headache and is
    curt with us; we feel snubbed, hurt, all our plans go out the
    window. The problem is that the &quot;world out there&quot;
    is constantly changing, everything is impermanent and it is
    impossible to make a permanent relationship with anything, at
    all. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we examine the notion of
    impermanence closely and honestly, we see that it is
    all-pervading, everything is marked by impermanence. We might
    posit an eternal consciousness principle, or higher self, but
    if we examine our consciousness closely we see that it is
    made up of temporary mental processes and events. We see that
    our &quot;higher self&quot; is speculative at best and
    imaginary to begin with. We have invented the idea to secure
    ourselves, to cement our relationship, once again. Because of
    this we feel uneasy and anxious, even at the best of times.
    It is only when we completely abandon clinging that we feel
    any relief from our queasyness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These three things: pain,
    impermanence and egolessness are known as the three marks of
    existence. </font></p>
    <h4><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Four Noble
    Truths</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first sermon that the Buddha
    preached after his enlightenment was about the four noble
    truths. The first noble truth is that life is frustrating and
    painful. In fact, if we are honest with ourselves, there are
    times when it is downright miserable. Things may be fine with
    us, at the moment, but, if we look around, we see other
    people in the most appalling condition, children starving,
    terrorism, hatred, wars, intolerance, people being tortured
    and we get a sort of queasy feeling whenever we think about
    the world situation in even the most casual way. We,
    ourselves, will someday grow old, get sick and eventually
    die. No matter how we try to avoid it, someday we are going
    to die. Even though we try to avoid thinking about it, there
    are constant reminders that it is true. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second noble truth is that
    suffering has a cause. We suffer because we are constantly
    struggling to survive. We are constantly trying to prove our
    existence. We may be extremely humble and self-deprecating,
    but even that is an attempt to define ourselves. We are
    defined by our humility. The harder we struggle to establish
    ourselves and our relationships, the more painful our
    experience becomes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third noble truth is that the
    cause of suffering can be ended. Our struggle to survive, our
    effort to prove ourselves and solidify our relationships is
    unnecessary. We, and the world, can get along quite
    comfortably without all our unnecessary posturing. We could
    just be a simple, direct and straight-forward person. We
    could form a simple relationship with our world, our coffee,
    spouse and friend. We do this by abandoning our expectations
    about how we think things should be. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the fourth noble truth: the
    way, or path to end the cause of suffering. The central theme
    of this way is meditation. Meditation, here, means the
    practice of mindfulness/awareness, shamata/vipashyana in
    scanscrit. We practice being mindful of all the things that
    we use to torture ourselves with. We become mindful by
    abandoning our expectations about the way we think things
    should be and, out of our mindfulness, we begin to develop
    awareness about the way things really are. We begin to
    develop the insight that things are really quite simple, that
    we can handle ourselves, and our relationships, very well as
    soon as we stop being so manipulative and complex. </font></p>
    <h4><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Five Skandhas</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist doctrine of
    egolessness seems to be a bit confusing to westerners. I
    think this is because there is some confusion as to what is
    meant by ego. Ego, in the Buddhist sense, is quite different
    from the Freudian ego. The Buddhist ego is a collection of
    mental events classified into five categories, called
    skandhas, loosely translated as bundles, or heaps. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we were to borrow a western
    expression, we could say that &quot;in the beginning&quot;
    things were going along quite well. At some point, however,
    there was a loss of confidence in the way things were going.
    There was a kind of primordial panic which produced confusion
    about what was happening. Rather than acknowledging this loss
    of confidence, there was an identification with the panic and
    confusion. Ego began to form. This is known as the first
    skandha, the skandha of form. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the identification with
    confusion, ego begins to explore how it feels about the
    formation of this experience. If we like the experience, we
    try to draw it in. If we dislike it, we try to push it away,
    or destroy it. If we feel neutral about it, we just ignore
    it. The way we feel about the experience is called the
    skandha of form; what we try to do about it is known as the
    skandha of impulse/perception. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next stage is to try to
    identify, or label the experience. If we can put it into a
    category, we can manipulate it better. Then we would have a
    whole bag of tricks to use on it. This is the skandha of
    concept. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The final step in the birth of ego,
    is called the skandha of consciousness. Ego begins to churn
    thoughts and emotions around and around. This makes ego feel
    solid and real. The churning around and around is called
    samsara -- literally, to whirl about. The way ego feels about
    its situatuation (skandha of feeling) determines which of the
    six realms of existence it creates for itself. </font></p>
    <h4><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Six Realms</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If ego decides it likes the
    situation, it begins to churn up all sorts of ways to possess
    it. A craving to consume the situation arises and we long to
    satisfy that craving. Once we do, a ghost of that craving
    carries over and we look around for something else to
    consume. We get into the habitual pattern of becoming
    consumer oriented. Perhaps we order a piece of software for
    our computer. We play with it for awhile, until the novelty
    wears out, and then we look around for the next piece of
    software that has the magic glow of not being possessed yet.
    Soon we haven't even got the shrink wrap off the current
    package when we start looking for the next one. Owning the
    software and using it doesn't seem to be as important as
    wanting it, looking forward to its arrival. This is known as
    the hungry ghost realm where we have made an occupation out
    of craving. We can never find satisfaction, it is like
    drinking salt water to quench our thirst. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another realm is the animal realm,
    or having the mind like that of an animal. Here we find
    security by making certain that everything is totally
    predictable. We only buy blue chip stock, never take a chance
    and never look at new possibilities. The thought of new
    possibilities frightens us and we look with scorn at anyone
    who suggests anything innovative. This realm is characterized
    by ignorance. We put on blinders and only look straight
    ahead, never to the right or left. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The hell realm is characterized by
    acute aggression. We build a wall of anger between ourselves
    and our experience. Everything irritates us, even the most
    innocuous, and innocent statement drives us mad with anger.
    The heat of our anger is reflected back on us and sends us
    into a frenzy to escape from our torture, which in turn
    causes us to fight even harder and get even angrier. The
    whole thing builds on itself until we don't even know if
    we're fighting with someone else or ourselves. We are so busy
    fighting that we can't find an alternative to fighting; the
    possibility of alternative never even occurs to us. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are the three lower realms.
    One of the three higher realms is called the jealous god
    realm. This pattern of existence is characterized by acute
    paranoia. We are always concerned with &quot;making it&quot;.
    Everything is seen from a competetive point of view. We are
    always trying to score points, and trying to prevent others
    from scoring on us. If someone achieves something special we
    become determined to out do them. We never trust anyone; we
    &quot;know&quot; they're trying to slip one past us. If
    someone tries to help us, we try to figure out their angle.
    If someone doesn't try to help us, they are being
    uncooperative, and we make a note to ourselves that we will
    get even later. &quot;Don't get mad, get even,&quot; that's
    our motto. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At some point we might hear about
    spirituality. We might hear about the possibility of
    meditation techniques, imported from some eastern religion,
    or mystical western one, that will make our minds peaceful
    and absorb us into a universal harmony. We begin to meditate
    and perform certain rituals and we find ourselves absorbed
    into infinite space and blissful states of existence.
    Everything sparkles with love and light; we become godlike
    beings. We become proud of our godlike powers of meditative
    absorption. We might even dwell in the realm of infinite
    space where thoughts seldom arise to bother us. We ignore
    everything that doesn't confirm our godhood. We have
    manufactured the god realm, the highest of the six realms of
    existence. The problem is, that we have manufactured it. We
    begin to relax and no longer feel the need to maintain our
    exalted state. Eventualy a small sliver of doubt occurs. Have
    we really made it? At first we are able to smooth over the
    question, but eventually the doubt begins to occur more and
    more frequently and soon we begin to struggle to regain our
    supreme confidence. As soon as we begin to struggle, we fall
    back into the lower realms and begin the whole process over
    and over; from god realm to jealous god realm to animal realm
    to hungry ghost realm to hell realm. At some point we begin
    to wonder if there isn't some sort of alternative to our
    habitual way of dealing with the world. This is the human
    realm. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The human realm is the only one in
    which liberation from the six states of existence is
    possible. The human realm is characterized by doubt and
    inquistiveness and the longing for something better. We are
    not as absorbed by the all consuming preoccupations of the
    other states of being. We begin to wonder whether it is
    possible to relate to the world as simple, dignified human
    beings. </font></p>
    <h4><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Eightfold Path</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The path to liberation from these
    miserable states of being, as taught by the Buddha, has eight
    points and is known as the eightfold path. The first point is
    called right view -- the right way to view the world. Wrong
    view occurs when we impose our expectations onto things;
    expectations about how we hope things will be, or about how
    we are afraid things might be. Right view occurs when we see
    things simply, as they are. It is an open and accomodating
    attitude. We abandon hope and fear and take joy in a simple
    straight-forward approach to life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second point of the path is
    called right intention. It proceeds from right view. If we
    are able to abandon our expectations, our hopes and fears, we
    no longer need to be manipulative. We don't have to try to
    con situations into our preconceived notions of how they
    should be. We work with what is. Our intentions are pure. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third aspect of the path is
    right speech. Once our intentions are pure, we no longer have
    to be embarresed about our speech. Since we aren't trying to
    manipulate people, we don't have to be hesitant about what we
    say, nor do we need to try bluff our way through a
    conversation with any sort of phony confidence. We say what
    needs to be said, very simply in a genuine way. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth point on the path, right
    discipline, involves a kind of renunciation. We need to give
    up our tendency to complicate issues. We practice simplicity.
    We have a simple straight-forward relationship with our
    dinner, our job, our house and our family. We give up all the
    unnecessary and frivolous complications that we usually try
    to cloud our relationships with. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right livelihood is the fifth step
    on the path. It is only natural and right that we should earn
    our living. Often, many of us don't particularly enjoy our
    jobs. We can't wait to get home from work and begrudge the
    amount of time that our job takes away from our enjoyment of
    the good life. Perhaps, we might wish we had a more glamorous
    job. We don't feel that our job in a factory or office is in
    keeping with the image we want to project. The truth is, that
    we should be glad of our job, whatever it is. We should form
    a simple relationship with it. We need to perform it
    properly, with attention to detail. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sixth aspect of the path is
    right effort. Wrong effort is struggle. We often approach a
    spiritual discipline as though we need to conquer our evil
    side and promote our good side. We are locked in combat with
    ourselves and try to obliterate the tiniest negative
    tendency. Right effort doesn't involve struggle at all. When
    we see things as they are, we can work with them, gently and
    without any kind of aggression whatsoever. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right mindfulness, the seventh
    step, involves precision and clarity. We are mindful of the
    tiniest details of our experience. We are mindful of the way
    we talk, the way we perform our jobs, our posture, our
    attitude toward our friends and family, every detail. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right concentration, or absorption
    is the eighth point of the path. Usually we are absorbed in
    absentmindedness. Our minds are comletely captivated by all
    sorts of entertainment and speculations. Right absorption
    means that we are completely absorbed in nowness, in things
    as they are. This can only happen if we have some sort of
    discipline, such as sitting meditation. We might even say
    that without the discipline of sitting meditation, we can't
    walk the eightfold path at all. Sitting meditation cuts
    through our absentmindedness. It provides a space or gap in
    our preocuppation with ourselves. </font></p>
    <h4><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Goal</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most people have heard of nirvana.
    It has become equated with a sort of eastern version of
    heaven. Actually, nirvana simply means cessation. It is the
    cessation of passion, aggression and ignorance; the cessation
    of the struggle to prove our existence to the world, to
    survive. We don't have to struggle to survive after all. We
    have already survived. We survive now; the struggle was just
    an extra complication that we added to our lives because we
    had lost our confidence in the way things are. We no longer
    need to manipulate things as they are into things as we would
    like them to be. </font></p>
