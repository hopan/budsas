<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Let us discuss a question often asked by many people: What
    is the difference between Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism? To
    see things in their proper perspective, let us turn to the
    history of Buddhism and trace the emergence and development
    of Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism.</p>
    <p>The Buddha was born in the 6th Century B.C. After
    attaining Enlightenment at the age of 35 until his
    Mahaparinibbana at the age of 80, he spent his life preaching
    and teaching. He was certainly one of the most energetic man
    who ever lived: for forty-five years he taught and preached
    day and night, sleeping for only about 2 hours a day.</p>
    <p>The Buddha spoke to all kinds of people: kings and
    princes, Brahmins, farmers, beggars, learned men and ordinary
    people. His teachings were tailored to the experiences,
    levels of understanding and mental capacity of his audience.
    What he taught was called <i>Buddha</i> <i>Vacana, </i>i.e.
    word of the Buddha. There was nothing called Theravada or
    Mahayana at that time.</p>
    <p>After establishing the Order of monks and nuns, the Buddha
    laid down certain disciplinary rules called the <i>Vinaya </i>for
    the guidance of the Order. The rest of his teachings were
    called the <i>Dhamma </i>which included his discourses,
    sermons to monks, nuns and lay people.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>The First Council</b></font></p>
    <p>Three months after the Buddha's <i>Mahaparinibbana, </i>his
    immediate disciples convened a council at Rajagaha. Maha
    Kassapa, the most respected and elderly monk, presided at the
    Council. Two very important personalities who specialised in
    the two different areas - the <i>Dhamma </i>and the <i>Vinaya
    - </i>were present. One was Ananda, the closest constant
    companion and disciple of the Buddha for 25 years. Endowed
    with a remarkable memory, Ananda was able to recite what was
    spoken by the Buddha. The other personality was Upali who
    remembered all the <i>Vinaya</i> rules.</p>
    <p>Only these two sections - the <i>Dhamma </i>and the <i>Vinaya
    - </i>were recited at the First Council. Though there were no
    differences of opinion on the <i>Dhamma </i>(no mention of
    the <i>Abhidhamma) </i>there was some discussion about the <i>Vinaya
    </i>rules. Before the Buddha's <i>Parinibbana,</i> he had
    told Ananda that if the <i>Sangha </i>wished to amend or
    modify some minor rules, they could do so. But on that
    occasion Ananda was so overpowered with grief because the
    Buddha was about to die that it did not occur to him to ask
    the Master what the minor rules were. As the members of the
    Council were unable to agree as to what constituted the minor
    rules, Maha Kassapa finally ruled that no disciplinary rule
    laid down by the Buddha should be changed, and no new ones
    should be introduced. No intrinsic reason was given. Maha
    Kassapa did say one thing, however: &quot;If we changed the
    rules, people will say that Ven. Gotama's disciples changed
    the rules even before his funeral fire has ceased
    burning.&quot;</p>
    <p>At the Council, the <i>Dhamma </i>was divided into various
    parts and each part was assigned to an Elder and his pupils
    to commit to memory. The <i>Dhamma </i>was then passed on
    from teacher to pupil orally. The <i>Dhamma </i>was recited
    daily by groups of people who often cross check with each
    other to ensure that no omissions or additions were made.
    Historians agree that the oral tradition is more reliable
    than a report written by one person from his memory several
    years after the event.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>The Second Council</b></font></p>
    <p>One hundred years later, the Second Council was held to
    discuss some <i>Vinaya </i>rules. There was no need to change
    the rules three months after the <i>Parinibbana of</i> the
    Buddha because little or no political, economic or social
    changes took place during that short interval. But 100 years
    later, some monks saw the need to change certain minor rules.
    The orthodox monks said that nothing should be changed while
    the others insisted on modifying some rules, Finally, a group
    of monks left the Council and formed the <i>Mahasanghika - </i>the
    Great Community. Even though it was called the <i>Mahasanghika,</i>
    it was not known as Mahayana, And in the Second Council, only
    matters pertaining to the <i>Vinaya </i>were discussed and no
    controversy about the <i>Dhamma </i>is reported,</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>The Third Council</b></font></p>
    <p>In the 3rd Century B.C. during the time of Emperor Asoka,
    the Third Council was held to discuss the differences of
    opinion among the bhikkhus of different sects. At this
    Council the differences were not confined to the <i>Vinaya </i>but
    were also connected with the <i>Dhamma. </i>At the end of
    this Council, the President of the Council, Moggaliputta
    Tissa, compiled a book called the <i>Kathavatthu </i>refuting
    the heretical, false views and theories held by some sects.
    The teaching approved and accepted by this Council was known
    as <i>Theravada. The</i> <i>Abhidhamma Pitaka </i>was
    included at this Council.</p>
    <p>After the Third Council, Asoka's son, Ven. Mahinda,
    brought the <i>Tripitaka </i>to Sri Lanka, along with the
    commentaries that were recited at the Third Council. The
    texts brought to Sri Lanka were preserved until today without
    losing a page. The texts were written in Pali which was based
    on the Magadhi language spoken by the Buddha. There was
    nothing known as <i>Mahayana</i> at that time.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Coming of Mahayana</b></font></p>
    <p>Between the 1st Century B.C. to the 1st Century A.D., the
    two terms Mahayana and Hinayana appeared in the <i>Saddharma
    Pundarika Sutra </i>or the Sutra of the Lotus of the Good
    Law.</p>
    <p>About the 2nd Century A.D. <i>Mahayana </i>became clearly
    defined. Nagarjuna developed the <i>Mahayana</i> philosophy
    of Sunyata and proved that everything is Void in a small text
    called <i>Madhyamika-karika.</i> About the 4th Century, there
    were Asanga and Vasubandhu who wrote enormous amount of works
    on <i>Mahayana. </i>After the 1st Century AD., the
    Mahayanists took a definite stand and only then the terms of <i>Mahayana</i>
    and <i>Hinayana </i>were introduced.</p>
    <p>We must not confuse <i>Hinayana</i> with <i>Theravada</i>
    because the terms are not synonymous. <i>Theravada</i>
    Buddhism went to Sri Lanka during the 3rd Century B.C. when
    there was no <i>Mahayana </i>at all. <i>Hinayana </i>sects
    developed in India and had an existence independent from the
    form of Buddhism existing in Sri Lanka. Today there is no <i>Hinayana
    </i>sect in existence anywhere in the world. Therefore, in
    1950 the World Fellowship of Buddhists inaugurated in Colombo
    unanimously decided that the term <i>Hinayana </i>should be
    dropped when referring to Buddhism existing today in Sri
    Lanka, Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, etc. This is the
    brief history of <i>Theravada, Mahayana</i> and <i>Hinayana.</i></p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Mahayana and Theravada</b></font></p>
    <p>Now, what is the difference between <i>Mahayana and
    Theravada?</i></p>
    <p>I have studied Mahayana for many years and the more I
    study it, the more I find there is hardly any difference
    between <i>Theravada and Mahayana with</i> regard to the
    fundamental teachings.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left">- Both accept Sakyamuni Buddha as the
        Teacher.<br>
        - The Four Noble Truths are exactly the same in both
        schools.<br>
        - The Eightfold Path is exactly the same in both schools.<br>
        <i>-</i> The <i>Paticca-samuppada </i>or the Dependent
        Origination is the same in both schools.<br>
        - Both rejected the idea of a supreme being who created
        and governed this world.<br>
        - Both accept <i>Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta</i> and <i>Sila,</i>
        <i>Samadhi, Panna </i>without any difference.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These are the most important teachings of the Buddha and
    they are all accepted by both schools without question.</p>
    <p>There are also some points where they differ. An obvious
    one is the <i>Bodhisattva </i>ideal. Many people say that <i>Mahayana
    </i>is for the <i>Bodhisattvahood </i>which leads to
    Buddhahood while <i>Theravada </i>is for Arahantship. I must
    point out that the Buddha was also an Arahant. Pacceka Buddha
    is also an Arahant. A disciple can also be an Arahant. The
    Mahayana texts never use the term Arahant-yana, Arahant
    Vehicle. They used three terms: <i>Bodhisattvayana,
    Prateka-Buddhayana, and Sravakayana. </i>In the Theravada
    tradition these three are called <i>Bodhis.</i></p>
    <p>Some people imagine that Theravada is selfish because it
    teaches that people should seek their own salvation. But how
    can a selfish person gain Enlightenment? Both schools accept
    the three Yanas or <i>Bodhis</i> but consider the <i>Bodhisattva
    </i>ideal as the highest. The <i>Mahayana </i>has created
    many mystical <i>Bodhisattvas</i> while the <i>Theravada </i>considers
    a <i>Bodhisattva </i>as a man amongst us who devotes his
    entire life for the attainment of perfection, ultimately
    becoming a fully Enlightened Buddha for the welfare of the
    world, for the happiness of the world.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Three Types of Buddhahood</b></font></p>
    <p>There are three types of Buddhahood: the Samma Sambuddha
    who gains full Enlightenment by his own effort, the Pacceka
    Buddha who has lesser qualities than the Samma Sambuddha, and
    the Savaka Buddha who is an Arahant disciple. The attainment
    of Nibbana between the three types of Buddhahood is exactly
    the same. The only difference is that the Samma Sambuddha has
    many more qualities and capacities than the other two.</p>
    <p>Some people think that Voidness or <i>Sunyata</i>
    discussed by Nagarjuna is purely a <i>Mahayana </i>teaching.
    It is based on the idea of <i>Anatta </i>or non-self, on the <i>Paticcasamuppada
    </i>or the Dependent Origination, found in the original
    Theravada Pali texts. Once Ananda asked the Buddha,
    &quot;People say the word <i>Sunya. </i>What is <i>Sunya?&quot;</i>
    The Buddha replied, &quot;Ananda, there is no self, nor
    anything pertaining to self in this world. Therefore, the
    world is empty.&quot; This idea was taken by Nagarjuna when
    he wrote his remarkable book, <i>&quot;Madhyamika
    Karika&quot;. </i>Besides the idea of Sunyata is the concept
    of the store-consciousness in Mahayana Buddhism which has its
    seed in the Theravada texts. The Mahayanists have developed
    it into a deep psychology and philosophy. </p>
