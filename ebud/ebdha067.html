    <blockquote>
        <p><i>For over two decades, Australian John Cianciosi
        (known in Thailand as Venerable Ajahn Jagaro) had been a
        fully ordained Buddhist monk in the Thai Theravada
        tradition, and abbot of the International Forest
        Monastery in northeast Thailand. Then he accepted an
        invitation from the Buddhist Society of Western Australia
        to establish a Forest Monastery to the south of Perth. He
        worked there tirelessly as abbot, meditation teacher,
        counselor and manager for the growing Buddhist community,
        and as with the monastery in Thailand, it flourished
        mightily under his direction. During his time there, he
        gained a national reputation for his oratory; until he
        left the monkhood in 1995, he appeared frequently on
        national television. His ability to express the Buddhist
        teachings in a clear and direct modern idiom are
        universally praised.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>The Monthly Aspectarian:</b> John, it's very
    interesting what you're doing, bringing the teachings of an
    ascetic forest Buddhism to a modern, urban Western setting
    and teaching it. How do you think it will translate into this
    setting? </p>
    <p><b>John Cianciosi:</b> The aspects that I'm taking, which
    predominantly have to do with meditation and skillful living,
    will translate very well, I think, because it has already
    translated into Western culture. From my own experience,
    meditation is very popular in both Australia and America;
    there's a lot of interest in it. </p>
    <p>As far as the forest ascetic tradition, the monastic
    aspects are not really relevant or applicable to lay life . .
    . and certainly not to a modern culture such as what we have
    here in the West. But the principles of exploring and
    training the mind in order to develop a greater sense of
    well-being, serenity, understanding and better means for
    living a healthy life, I think, is very relevant, applicable
    and, one could say, even more necessary in this time when
    life is so stressful and hectic. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> I couldn't agree more. I've always said that
    you don't have to go live in a cave to meditate. In fact,
    especially in the West, with the way the world is going, it's
    essential that we begin to learn these things and use them in
    our lives. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> Yes; one could look at it in terms of mental
    health in comparison to physical health. We all need physical
    health; we all need to be fit to a degree; very few of us
    will want to take it to the extent of going into training to
    become a professional runner or professional gymnast at the
    level of Olympic standards, but all of us want good health
    and appreciate the need to do some sort of exercise -- be it
    in a health club or even just going for walks for the sake of
    physical well-being. One could compare that to mental
    well-being by not all of us wanting to take on full time,
    intensive retreats in a monastery -- but maybe all of us can
    benefit from the degree of well-being that can be acquired
    from a very simple mental training on a daily basis . . . or
    just even applying the principles of that training in our
    daily lives. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> It seems to me that especially here in the
    West, if we're going to keep up with what's going on in the
    world, we're forced to process so much more information than
    in the past. I mean exponentially more amounts of
    information. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> Well yes, there is this sense of overload and
    people are suffering a lot of stress. As a result of that
    stress, there's a lot of social problems and family problems
    . . . because when we're under stress and don't have the
    coping mechanism to react, the way we relate to our partners
    and our children and society and work environment is from the
    position of a stressed state. That makes us very irritable,
    very aggressive, very impatient, very confused; we make bad
    decisions, we do things and say things that we regret, and we
    get burned out. And so because life is so much more
    demanding, I think there is a greater need for having a
    center of stillness -- or a degree of that, anyway -- which
    can help us process and respond to the amount of input
    without losing it. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> Many more people are being drawn to various
    types of meditative and esoteric practices, but I think most
    people come into it without ever having thought about the
    process of thinking. I mean, contemplating what occurs when
    one thinks, what is going on, who is the thinker, what is the
    thought. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> For most people, that's a little way down the
    road. You see, in order to explore the mind in that way, you
    need to have a basis of introspection. In other words, you've
    got to be able to pay attention to the inner workings and the
    inner process of the mind. Most people are not at all able to
    do that because our education and the conditioning we receive
    throughout life is to pay attention to external things, as if
    the world and everything is out there. We don't really notice
    the inner world, that which is the real world, because
    everything we experience is an internal experience through
    our senses. It registers in the mind as a mental experience
    and perception. </p>
    <p>Thought is that which shapes what we are and how we live
    and what we do, yet we're conditioned to pay attention to the
    outer world. If you say to somebody, &quot;Be aware&quot; or
    &quot;Notice what you're thinking,&quot; &quot;Listen to your
    thinking,&quot; &quot;What are you feeling right now?&quot;
    it's very difficult for people to be aware of that. That's
    why one could say that as a preliminary, people need to have
    some means of training, some technique for beginning this
    inner journey to introspection. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> Would you say that one of the first great
    accomplishments is to understand the difference between self
    and thought? </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> Yes, that would be an appreciation which will
    grow on you as you begin to objectify thought. In other
    words, you can be aware of thinking as a process that's
    taking place in consciousness. Once you can appreciate that,
    once you have this objectification of sorts and know that
    what you can see coming and going can't be you, then you can
    appreciate, maybe, &quot;Thinking is an activity of
    mine&quot; . . . but in the final sense, it's not necessarily
    <strong><i>what you</i></strong><strong> </strong><strong><i>are</i></strong>.
    </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> How do you proceed with a -- for lack of a
    better word -- neophyte? A new seeker on the path? </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> This is what I'm exploring now with a series of
    meditation workshops: to introduce people to this process.
    First off, I don't like people to begin a training without
    understanding the context, so I present an overview of what
    we are endeavoring to do . . . so that a person sees that in
    context and understands the theory. </p>
    <p>Given that, then, one would be taught very basic, simple,
    natural techniques for, say, calming the mind, centering the
    mind, techniques of relaxation and concentration. When you
    try to do that, you begin to become aware of what the mind is
    doing -- that it is not peaceful, that it is not
    concentrated, that there is a lot of noise, that the mind is
    thinking about the past and the present and the future.
    Because of this technique of trying to concentrate, you
    become aware of mental activity. In that process, you begin
    to train the mind and understand its workings. It's
    continuous, very systematic; it's very gradual, it's very
    natural, there's nothing forced. But the person becomes,
    let's say, hopefully, as a result of that understanding, more
    skilled in training the mind towards serenity and awareness. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> Could you give a brief version of the overview
    that you mentioned? </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> First of all you must dispel a lot of the
    peripheral notions about meditation that are not necessarily
    inaccurate, but aren't really important -- all the
    superstition, all the magical aspects of it, the supernatural
    aspects of it. As far as I'm concerned, they are peripheral
    and non-essential, and I don't put any emphasis on that. I
    see this as a very simple -- scientific, one could almost
    say, or a natural process of enhancing things that we already
    have. We all have the ability to be aware. We all have the
    ability to focus our attention. We all have the ability to
    concentrate. But they are not highly developed abilities, so
    through a systematic technique, just like mental
    calisthenics, we can strengthen these certain qualities such
    as awareness, self awareness, concentration -- the ability to
    focus your mind, hold your attention on one thing so that you
    can channel your mental energy fully. Through this process
    you experience the benefits, and one benefit is a sense of
    inner clarity, a sense of stillness and silence, a sense of
    serenity. </p>
    <p>As a result of that, you have this -- one could say,
    power. The power is nothing unnatural; it's just the power to
    channel your mental energy, put it where you want to put it,
    what you want to concentrate on. You concentrate on that . .
    . thereby, whatever you do will be done more fully. You are
    fully present. You are fully listening. You are fully
    speaking. You are fully reading. You are fully involved. You
    are fully seeing and hearing and tasting, and therefore you
    are fully living. And when you are fully present, you can be
    in charge. You can make the choice that you want to make,
    rather than acting out of habit, acting mechanically,
    reacting out of just the sense of compulsion and obsession
    whereby we lose choice in life. This is the context that I
    want the meditation to be in. </p>
    <p>Once we've developed this foundation through having
    trained the mind, of having some choice and some control,
    then we can cultivate certain aspects like loving-kindness
    and compassion. We can work through the unresolved emotional
    conflicts, unresolved grief and unresolved resentment that
    have accumulated because they just have never been fully
    conscious and not addressed. Then we can clear our mind of a
    lot of accumulated negativity. That frees us from so much. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> When one can stop the mind and have silence,
    one breaks the hold that the illusory world has --
    momentarily, at least. But then how does one maintain that on
    an ongoing basis? I find I can do it when I need to but then
    the rest of the time, I'm pretty much on automatic, like most
    people. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> Well, you have to apply the principles of that
    brief experience in a more general sense. That is, what you
    can take with you is not the silence of those thoughts,
    no-thought, or the silence of full concentration on one thing
    or object . . . but just the awareness that can flow with
    what you're doing, with what you're experiencing. You can
    have silence amid activity <i>or </i>amid noise. In other
    words, you can have the skill of meditation in daily life,
    meditation in action. The only way we achieve that is not by
    every few minutes sort of closing our eyes and going into a
    trance, but remaining centered and remaining fully, as much
    as possible, aware, and, one can say, in charge. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> While washing dishes, driving a car, whatever.
    </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> Yes, but to develop that, you see, requires
    some training. That is why we begin by the training of formal
    meditation -- to get a feel, an appreciation for what it is
    that the mind is doing, what it is to be aware, what it is to
    direct attention. We gradually expand that to meditation in
    action by taking specific daily activities, such as washing
    the dishes and learning to relax, by being aware. That
    doesn't mean not thinking. That doesn't mean not doing
    anything; it means just being present in what you are doing .
    . . and being aware of what you're thinking. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> When one stops thought, one is confronted with
    the real self, yes? </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> When one's thoughts stop, one is confronted
    with the silence of the mind, but -- </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> And that's who you are, yes? </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> Let's say that you are getting a little closer
    to the center, but I would not jump to the conclusion of
    saying that that is what you are -- because you have to look
    even more deeply. You have to go that center. In actual fact,
    as long as there is an object and a subject, then it is a
    duality; you are not there. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> Ah. You take it that far. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> For that sort of exploration, you do need quite
    a deep meditation, and you need to train the mind quite
    fully. Now for most people, it's very difficult to come to
    that sort of depth of meditation -- especially, as we were
    just saying, in our busy lives when meditation forms only one
    portion of life rather than a predominant portion. To really
    explore that in depth -- the question of self and the
    breaking through the delusions about what we are and what, in
    reality, we are not -- is getting into some pretty . . . one
    could say, an Olympic standard of meditation. [laughter] I
    think for many people, it takes a lot of time. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> Let's come back to that, perhaps near the end.
    Now I was taught to meditate by Huey, Dewey, and Louie -- do
    you know who I mean? Donald Duck's nephews. You grew up in
    Australia; Disney is there too, right? </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> Yes. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> When I was about ten years old, I bought a
    Donald Duck comic book . . . and in this comic book, Huey,
    Dewey, and Louie go out to play and they come upon a flying
    saucer. And in this flying saucer is an alien that they make
    friends with. They discover that this alien can control their
    actions by getting inside their minds, and that the only way
    they can stop the alien from doing that is to think no
    thoughts. So they're walking around with empty bubbles over
    their heads in this comic book, thinking no thoughts to avoid
    this alien controlling them. Remember, I'm ten years old. And
    I'm thinking, Hey, cool. I wonder if I can do that? So I
    practiced it and practiced it and got pretty good at it. I
    forgot all about it of course -- and then a few years later I
    started getting interested in metaphysics and meditation, and
    I was like, Hey, I know how to do that! </p>
    <p>I found that in fact that one incident is part of my
    inspiration for being in publishing and in communications --
    because I see from that experience how mass media can be used
    to help people come to understand themselves better, to teach
    meditation and such. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> Some of the comic books, like <i>Calvin and
    Hobbes</i>, have some very good insights. I read those and am
    quite a fan . . . and there's this one book, <i>The Tao of
    Pooh</i>. It gives a description of Taoism through the story
    of Winnie-the-Pooh. In <i>Calvin &amp; Hobbes</i>, there are
    a lot of quite intuitive insights into the nature of life,
    into the nature of relationships and into the nature of the
    mind. Obviously, somebody has observed themselves, observed
    the mind, observed how they work, and then can illustrate it
    through these comics, which are very readable, very
    enjoyable. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> Well, somebody at Disney knew what they were
    doing. Somebody there put that comic out there for me and
    whoever else could read it and make use of it. I still
    haven't tracked down who the artist and writer were, but I'm
    very curious to know. As a result of that, I have found in my
    life and in my practice that it's easy to stop the mind and
    break the hold. When I come right back into regular life, I
    come back refreshed. I come back knowing that it's not as
    real as it seemed before I took my break. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> This is what we were saying previously. People
    who have never been trained or who've never had that
    experience, can't appreciate the noise of the mind because
    they've never heard the silence. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> They don't know that it's noise. </p>
    <p><b>JC: </b>But once you hear the silence, you can
    appreciate the noise; and so the experience gives you a new
    perspective on life and a new perspective on your mind. But
    even in that silence there has to arise not just a new
    perspective but a deeper understanding of the nature of
    thinking and the nature of that silence. This requires, one
    could say, a deepening of understanding as well. So we have
    concentration or serenity, and then we have wisdom, the
    wisdom that comes from the understanding of the experience. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> Well, there's also the level of emotion. Now
    in the Eastern systems -- correct me if I'm wrong -- there's
    a tendency to lump the emotions and the mind together as one
    thing. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> We think of emotions as a composite of various
    aspects of mind including feelings, perception -- and
    thinking, in particular. So you have basic feelings which are
    then thought on or embellished by thinking, based on certain
    perceptions bringing you to the experience of a certain
    emotion. So emotions are not completely separate from thought
    but a composite like a cake or something that's made up or a
    dish that's made up of a combination of things . . . and the
    end product is a particular real experience. An emotion of,
    say, love, is a real experience. But it is a composite of
    many things. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> So it's not so much to discount the emotions
    as to see them as an aspect of mind? </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> An aspect of mind that needs to be understood
    and needs to be worked with to the extent that they are not
    all-powerful in your mind . . . because emotions have their
    role. But emotions also have to be seen in perspective,
    because not all emotions are good. When I say
    &quot;good,&quot; I mean healthy, good for you, good for
    others. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't have them -- but
    if you've got them, it's what you do with them. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> Uncontrolled emotions would be just as good or
    bad as uncontrolled thought. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> Exactly. It's just another aspect of mind. The
    mind is the most extraordinary thing. It's like an empty sky
    in which any sort of cloud formation can appear. Sometimes
    it's clear, sometimes there are white clouds just floating
    by, sometimes there are very dark and heavy clouds, sometimes
    there's a raging storm up there with lightning and thunder.
    The mind can facilitate all of those various experiences, and
    they need to be understood and dealt with. The understanding
    of it comes from introspection, dealing with it. Having the
    ability to choose and direct comes from mindful awareness,
    concentration, clear intention. It's like getting to know the
    mind, training the mind, and then directing it, liberating it
    so that it becomes a very wonderful garden rather than just a
    jungle. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> I see the mind of most people, and myself, all
    too often, as having almost a life of its own. That's
    probably giving it too much power, but my point is that it
    likes to do what it likes to do. And it's not the least bit
    interested in being trained by us and, in fact, it will
    resist. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> Certainly. And it's the most difficult thing to
    train. It's a lot easier to train an animal! It's a lot
    easier for us to achieve external things, to be successful in
    external activity. That's why most of us prefer to do that
    than to try to train the mind. We want to change the external
    rather than change the internal. The mind is the most
    difficult thing to train. One, it is abstract; it is so fast,
    it changes so quickly. It requires a tremendous amount of
    patience. And the development is slow. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> It's downright resistant. You try to gain
    control of it and it will offer up anything: your greatest
    fantasy, your greatest fear. It'll tell you any lie. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> Yes, exactly. On the other hand, it has the
    greatest rewards as well. Any achievement or any success that
    we have in understanding and training the mind brings the
    greatest rewards, because it is the center of our existence.
    A well-trained mind is the greatest gift one can have. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> We know that there are a million ways to
    meditate. But most people, when they think of meditation,
    think of little more than just trying to have silence in
    their mind. They will say, I've tried it, I can't do it. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> There are a million ways to meditate, but the
    basic principles, especially the fundamental aspects of
    meditation, are very simple and you'll find them in every
    method or in every tradition. The first thing is to get hold
    of the mind. In other words, what is the attention on, where
    is the attention. And the second thing is to simplify or
    learn to calm and concentrate. </p>
    <p>One is to get to know where the attention is . . . in
    other words, this sense of introspection, being aware of what
    you're paying attention to <strong><i>now</i></strong>, what
    the mind is doing <strong><i>now</i></strong> as much as
    possible, but then to train it to simplify, to focus on one
    thing. Gentle effort, repetitive effort of training the mind
    to pay more attention to one object. Every time the mind goes
    to something else you know it, you bring it back to that
    object. Different techniques teach you to pay attention to
    different things, but the principle is almost always the
    same. You can make it as complicated as you want; that
    principle will hold true. </p>
    <p>It's getting to be aware of where the attention is and
    then making gentle effort and continuous, sustained effort to
    train the mind to pay attention to one thing. It's through
    this training that you experience calmness and concentration,
    which are the basic tools for every other form of meditation.
    </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> When one seeks to attain silence in the mind,
    especially in the beginning stages, you discover it's almost
    like peeling an onion, layer after layer. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> Exactly. The more sensitive you become -- in
    other words, the more aware you become, the more you notice
    the subtle movements, the subtle activities of the mind. At
    first, most people only become aware of their mind when
    they're experiencing some intense anger, and then, you know,
    Oh, I'm angry. Or tremendous restlessness, that we notice:
    Oh, I'm restless. But as you develop meditation, you become
    more sensitive and eventually you begin to notice the little
    ripples and gentle breezes of the mind's activities. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> We are going to have to wrap it up. Are there
    points you would like to make before we finish? </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> Well, yes. Basically, to restate that we should
    not isolate meditation. To remember that it's very, very
    important to expand the practice of meditation to incorporate
    as much as possible of life by learning to live in a
    meditative or wakeful state where we are more self aware of
    what we're doing and how we're relating -- and can then
    direct our lives so that we live them more peacefully, with
    more serenity . . . and experience silence in the midst of
    noise . . . and experience the stillness in the midst of
    activity. I feel this is probably the greatest benefit that
    meditation can give to people of this time and in this
    environment, when life demands us to be active. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> That's an excellent and very important point.
    So many people think they can't do meditation because they
    can't afford to sit for an hour in the morning and an hour in
    the evening; that they just don't have the time to do it --
    when almost all time is open to it. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> When people make that excuse, my teacher used
    to always ask, &quot;Well, do you have enough time to
    breathe?&quot; Meditation can become a very natural process
    that flows with life. We have to develop that skill. </p>

    <h3><font color="#000080">Addendum:</font></h3>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> There's one thing I want to ask you because I
    haven't had the chance to ask somebody who represents the
    tradition at the level that you do. My understanding, and
    correct me if I'm wrong, is that the goal of the Buddhist
    practice, which I understand really is not a religion but
    appears to be a religion, is merging into the One and a
    complete losing of the self. Is that a true statement? </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> There is truth in it, but it's not completely
    correct because it almost lends itself to a misunderstanding.
    One would say that the Buddhists' goal is to &quot;peel that
    onion&quot; to the very end. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> Right, but to what end? </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> Exactly. To the end which is free of all
    delusion. Of course we would like to know, Well, what is it?
    Let's say that . . . the Buddhist teaching is that there is <em><strong>no
    self</strong></em>. In other words, this is <em><strong>beyond
    duality and beyond concept</strong></em>. As long as you can
    name it and think it, it is a created object; it is something
    created. And what is created is in duality. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> Right. But if the goal is to transcend
    duality, then what you're left with is a complete loss of
    self, and is this not kind of a spiritual death wish? </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> It's the death of mortality or the death of
    that which is mortal, a death of all that is conditioned and
    limited and in duality, which always dies anyway. What is
    born dies. So anything that is born, any concept, any notion
    of self, any notion of an entity that is standing apart from
    something else (which means it's in duality) will die. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> But if you were to merge back into the One,
    the ride would be over. Do you know what I mean? </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> Mortality would be over, yes. Birth and death
    would be over. Duality would be over. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> I guess I personally don't know if I really
    want that. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> It's because it's so hard to appreciate that
    maybe non-duality and this non-standing apart could be
    something desirable or could be something better. But let's
    say that one will only come to that when one has seen fully
    and completely that duality is not satisfactory, that being a
    separate entity and existing in the mortal realm where there
    is birth and death is not really satisfactory. In other
    words, we're talking about appreciating something that is
    very different from all of our experience, and the only time
    we're going to turn to that is when we're fed up with the
    realm of birth and death. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> It's said that all life is suffering, and yet
    it really isn't. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> That quote and others like it are correct, but
    they lead to kind of a basic misunderstanding. All life is
    suffering -- not in the sense that there is no happiness or
    there is no pleasure or there is no good experience, but only
    in the sense that all conditions or all mortality are states
    which come and go and thus are basically unsatisfactory. They
    can never really satisfy us and give us security. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> But if we accept impermanence, then it's okay.
    </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> But we don't, you see. None of us really likes
    the thought of losing that which is nice and pleasant and
    dear to us. And it does bring us grief. We accept that to the
    extent that we're willing to live with it. </p>
    <p><b>TMA:</b> But if we can truly accept impermanence, then
    we can enjoy our duality. </p>
    <p><b>JC:</b> The more we can accept the nature of life as it
    is, the reality of life, make your contribution in order to
    make it as best as possible but willing to tolerate
    &quot;What if the unsavory side of it turns up?&quot; -- of
    course the more at peace we will be with it, and the more we
    will be able to enjoy the good side of it. </p>
    <p>In other words, we have a good, healthy attitude. And
    that's wonderful. This is why I think that for most people,
    we want to emphasize that aspect rather than to go into the
    idea of transcending duality and getting beyond them because
    you have to come to that, and it has to be a natural
    progression where you've made life as best as possible; but
    there is just so much and it's still not really satisfying.
    You're not really fulfilled. You're not really completely at
    ease. So there is a highest, but most of us just aim at
    making life better.</p>
