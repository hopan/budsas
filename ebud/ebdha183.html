    <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he robe of a monk is
    a sign, not just for the person who's going forth, but a strong sign for society as well.
    It is a sign that there is spiritual aspiration and that there are beings who are very
    serious about this; there is truth and people are seeking the truth. This is a very
    healthy thing for society to see: a robe. Sometimes we mix up other religious perceptions
    with what Buddhism is. A monk isn't a priest. It's not like a monk is some kind of
    intermediary with truth. Each one of us has to discover truth for ourselves. So a monk or
    a nun practices in this particular way with the intention to realise truth. In the same
    way, lay people are practising in their environments with their conditions. A monk doesn't
    ordain to become a teacher or a counsellor or a lecturer. The primary intention is the
    realisation of nibbana. From that, teaching or counselling in a community can take place
    but that's secondary. If there isn't that primary intention of realising nibbana then it
    becomes corrupted and the monk is just speaking from books rather than from wisdom and
    insight. The realisation of nibbana isn't selfish. It's kind of like the selfishness that
    puts an end to selfishness. Then from that you get monastic beings trying to share their
    insights with the lay community. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Not everyone has
    the vocation of being a monk or a nun but everyone has a bit of the monk or nun in them.
    So we can look at the monk or the nun as a kind of archetype, an image of someone who is
    seeking truth. Each one of us has different ways of trying to realise truth. A society
    which supports a situation where men and women who really want to do that are given the
    opportunity is enriched. And a society which does not have that and where those energies
    are not allowed to flower or are thwarted suffers a great loss. Just like a society which
    allows great artists to flower or good plumbers or good ecologists or whatever it might
    be. These are all important parts of a healthy society. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes people ask, 'what if everyone wanted to become a
    monk or a nun?' And my joke is, 'what if everyone wanted to become a hairdresser?' I don't
    think it's ever going to be a problem. What we're trying to do here is to develop a
    community where the community includes the monastics and the lay people. Where spiritual
    aspiration, the love of truth and goodness is encouraged, honoured and brought strongly
    into consciousness. This is that kind of sanctuary and the kind of ceremony which reminds
    us of that possibility./. </font></p>
