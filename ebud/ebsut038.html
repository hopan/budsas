    <p>Dear friends,</p>
    <p>&quot;Knowing how to live alone&quot; here does not mean
    to live in solitude, separated from other people, on a
    mountain in a cave. &quot;Living alone&quot; here means
    living to have sovereignty of yourself, to have freedom, not
    to be dragged away by the past, not to be in fear of the
    future, not being pulled around by the circumstances of the
    present. We are always master of ourselves, we can grasp the
    situation as it is, and we are sovereign of the situation and
    of ourselves. There are many places in the sutras where the
    Buddha says that &quot;being alone&quot; does not mean to be
    separated from other people. We can be sitting in a cave, but
    we are not necessarily alone, because we have lost ourselves
    in our thinking, so we are not alone. In the Majjhima Nikaya
    there are at least four sutras that talk about the subject of
    knowing how to live alone, and in the Madhyama Agama there
    are also sutras that talk about the subject of living alone.
    Therefore, we know that the subject of living alone is a very
    important subject in the teachings of the Buddha. We have to
    know how to do this, how to live in freedom, not being
    imprisoned by the future and not being carried away by things
    in the present.</p>
    <p>The Sutra on Knowing the Better Way to Live Alone teaches
    us how to live each moment of our daily life very deeply.
    When we can live our daily life deeply, we begin to have
    concentration and wisdom; we can see the true nature of life,
    and we arrive at a great freedom, and freedom is the essence
    of happiness. If we are suffering, it is because we are not
    free, and therefore to practice is to recover our freedom.
    When we have freedom, we will become solid. Freedom and
    solidity are the two characteristics of nirvana, so we need a
    program of freedom and solidity. If somebody is suffering, we
    know that person is not free; because they are not free, they
    are suffering, they are being imprisoned by the past, or they
    are being oppressed by the present, or they are being carried
    away by the future, and that is why they are suffering. The
    practice is to re-establish our freedom, and then we will no
    longer suffer, and our happiness will increase. The oldest
    writings on the better way to live alone, on how to live
    deeply in the present moment, are found in this sutra.</p>
    <p>For example, someone hears the doctor say, &quot;You have
    cancer, you may live for six months more.&quot; That person
    feels completely overwhelmed. The fear, the idea that
    I&#146;m going to die in six months takes away all our peace
    and joy. Before the doctor told us that we had cancer, we had
    the capacity to enjoy ourselves with our friends. However,
    once the doctor told us that, we lose all our capacity to sit
    and enjoy our tea, or enjoy our meal, or watch the moon,
    because we are so afraid of the moment when we will die. It
    takes away all our freedom. If you know that death is
    something that comes to everybody, you will not suffer so
    much. The doctor says we have six months left to live, but
    the doctor also will die. Maybe the doctor knows we have six
    months, but the doctor does not know how many months he
    himself has left to live. Maybe the doctor will die before
    us. Maybe driving home after the examination he will have an
    accident, and therefore the knowledge of the doctor
    isn&#146;t so great. He tells us we only have six months
    left. We may be lucky to live six months, because the doctor
    may die before us. So if we look deeply we see things, which
    if we don&#146;t look deeply we wouldn&#146;t see. Looking
    deeply we can get back our freedom from fear, and with that
    freedom, with our non-fear, we may live happily those six
    months.</p>
    <p>All of us are equal as far as life and death are
    concerned: we are all going to die. So it is very equal, it
    will happen to everybody. Everyone has to die, but before we
    die, can we live properly? I am determined to live properly
    until I die. That is a very awakened thing to say. If we are
    going to die, then we have to live the best we can, and if we
    can live six months in the best way we can then the quality
    of that six months will be as if we were living for six
    years, or sixty years. If our life is filled with being
    caught in the fetters of suffering, then our life
    doesn&#146;t have the same kind of meaning as if we live in
    freedom. So knowing that we have to die, I am determined to
    live my life properly, deeply. All of us have to die, but if
    we are able to live with peace, joy, and freedom before we
    die, then we live as if we are dead already, even before we
    die.</p>
    <p>First of all, the Buddha teaches us that we must struggle
    to get back our freedom, to be able to live the moments of
    our daily life deeply. In these moments of our daily life we
    can have peace, we can have joy, and we can heal the
    suffering we have in our bodies and in our minds. Living
    deeply at each moment of our life helps us to be in touch
    with the wonderful things of life, helps us to nourish our
    body and our mind with these wonderful elements, and at the
    same time helps us to embrace and transform the suffering
    that we have. So to live deeply in the present moment of
    every day of our life is to live a life of wonder,
    nourishment, and healing. Living like that we can revive our
    freedom, and live deeply: we give rise to the truth, we have
    awakened understanding, and our fears, our anxieties, our
    sufferings, and our sadness, will evaporate, and we will
    become a source of joy and life to ourselves and to those
    around us. According to Buddhism, that is the method of
    dwelling happily in the present moment. Looking carefully, we
    will see that this writing on knowing the better way to live
    alone is the oldest human writing about how to live the
    present moment, so it is a very important sutra. We should
    study it carefully, and then apply it in our lives and in the
    practice. We know that all the teachings related to the
    teachings on living in the present moment should be studied
    in the same way.</p>
    <p>There was a monk whose name was Thera. His friends
    probably gave him the name Thera, which means &quot;the
    elder.&quot; That monk liked to live on his own. He always
    went off on the alms round on his own. He liked to do walking
    meditation on his own. He like to eat on his own, he liked to
    wash his clothes on his own. He really liked to do everything
    on his own. He seemed to like to avoid his friends in the
    practice as much as possible. All the monks had heard the
    Buddha praising the better way to live alone, but the way the
    Buddha used the meaning of &quot;living alone,&quot; he meant
    not to be imprisoned by the past, not to be pulled away by
    the future, and not to be carried away by what was happening
    in the present. The Buddha did not mean that living alone
    means to distance yourself and separate yourself from your
    friends in the practice. Nevertheless, this monk liked to do
    things on his own, eating on his own, going to the town on
    his own, and avoiding other people. The other monks knew that
    he liked to do things alone, but they felt that there was
    something not quite right about this way of life. They felt
    that he wasn&#146;t really practicing according to the spirit
    of the Buddha&#146;s teachings. So the other monks went to
    the Buddha and they said, &quot;Lord Buddha, one of our
    fellow practitioners called Thera, the elder, likes to do
    everything on his own: walking meditation, eating meditation,
    working on his own, and we don&#146;t know if living like
    that that is really truly living alone.&quot; And Buddha
    said, &quot;Where is that monk? Ask him to come here and have
    a cup of tea with us.&quot; So the monks went and invited
    Thera to join them, and the Buddha said, &quot;I hear you
    like to live alone. How do you live on your own? Please tell
    me.&quot; And Thera said, &quot;Lord Buddha, I sit in
    meditation alone, I eat on my own, I wash my clothes on my
    own, I go into the village for alms on my own.&quot; And the
    Buddha said, &quot;Oh, that is true, then you really do live
    alone. But maybe the way you live alone is not the best way
    to live alone, there is a better way to live alone.&quot; And
    then the Buddha recited a gatha: &quot;If you live without
    being imprisoned by the past, not being pulled away by the
    future, not being carried away by the forms and images of the
    present moment, living each moment of your life deeply, that
    is the true way of living alone.&quot; When Thera heard this
    he knew that he had been living alone just as an outer form,
    and there was a deeper way to live alone.</p>
    <p>The sutra where this story is told is called the Theranama
    Sutra, it is in the Samyutta Nikaya, and there is also an
    equivalent sutra in the Samyukta Agama, it is Number 71 in
    the Samyukta Agama. The essence of the sutra is a poem. The
    Buddha wrote poems, but the poems of the Buddha were more
    designed to show us how to practice. The gatha which talks
    about the art of living alone is called the
    Bhaddekaratta-gatha, Bhaddekaratta means &quot;the best way
    to live alone.&quot; Many people have mistranslated this
    title: One master translated it as &quot;practicing for one
    night.&quot; There&#146;s also another master who translated
    this title as &quot;being present.&quot; The correct
    translation is to say &quot;The better way to practice living
    alone.&quot; This poem says:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p><i>Do not pursue the past.<br>
            Do not lose yourself in the future.<br>
            The past no longer is.<br>
            The future has not yet come.<br>
            Looking deeply at life as it is<br>
            in the very here and now,<br>
            the practitioner dwells<br>
            in stability and freedom.</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>All of the essence of the Buddha&#146;s teachings lies in
    these words. We know that stability and freedom are the two
    characteristics of nirvana, and that is the aim of our
    practice. The aim of our practice is that every moment of our
    daily life we can produce stability and freedom: walking,
    lying down, sitting, standing, we produce freedom and
    stability. Nirvana is something we can touch right in the
    present moment, not only with our mind, but also with our
    body. When our feet are walking in a leisurely way, solid and
    free, then our feet are touching nirvana. As soon as we have
    stability and freedom, nirvana is there. The level of freedom
    and stability tells us whether we have been able to touch
    nirvana deeply. Do not pursue the past. There are people who
    are tired of the present and think that the past was more
    beautiful, and that life was more beautiful before. They
    always think the past was more beautiful. Therefore, they
    cannot see the happiness of the present.</p>
    <p>Many of us are caught in this way of thinking. The past is
    no longer there, and we compare it with the present, and we
    say that the past was more beautiful than the present; but
    even when we had those moments in the past we didn&#146;t
    really value them at the time, because in the past we were
    not able to live in the present moment. We were always
    running after the future, and now if we were taken back to
    the past, we would do the same. At that time life was more
    beautiful, the sun was brighter, the moon was brighter--those
    are words from a French song. There are people who pursue the
    past, not because they think the past was beautiful, but
    because the past has made them suffer, the past was a trauma,
    a heavy wound for them. We have suffered, we have been
    wounded, we have died in the past, and those heavy wounds are
    calling us back to the past, crying, &quot;Come back here,
    come back to the past. I am the subject, you cannot escape
    me.&quot; That is what the past says to us. We are like sheep
    running back to the past, to enclose us, to imprison us, to
    make us suffer. The past is also a very great prison. We hear
    the words of the past, and we run back to the past, we refuse
    to live our life in the present moment, we are always going
    back to the past. So the Buddha says, &quot;Don&#146;t pursue
    the past.&quot;</p>
    <p>These are the words of our teacher: &quot;Don&#146;t
    pursue the past.&quot; We should write a poem, how can we
    write a poem so we are able to do this? Sometimes we are
    sitting with our friend. Our friend is sitting there, but we
    feel abandoned by our friend, because our friend is drowning
    in the past. Our friend is sitting next to us, but our friend
    is not with us, our friend is imprisoned by the past. Our
    friend is there, but our friend is not really there. We know
    that we are sitting there, and we feel that our friend is not
    sitting there with us. So we find a way to free our friend
    from the past, and we say to our friend: &quot;A penny for
    your thoughts. What are you thinking about? Tell me.
    I&#146;ll give you ten centimes if you tell me.&quot; That
    person may wake up, jump up and smile and be free from the
    prison of the past.</p>
    <p>If we are a monk or a nun, we should know how to do this.
    We should know the method of being able to release our friend
    in the practice who is imprisoned and drowning in the past.
    We have to use our love, our mindfulness, and our friendship,
    to help that person out of the prison of the past. If we are
    a monk or a nun, we should know how to use our brothers and
    sisters in the practice to help us get out of our prison of
    the past. Therefore, living in a Sangha has these kinds of
    benefits.</p>
