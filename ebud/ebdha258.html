      last public talk I gave was in a very hot hall. But even in a cool, 
      air-conditioned hall such as this, people can get rather heated, because 
      the external coolness sometimes doesn't reach the heart. The heart can be 
      on fire with all the emotions that overwhelm it. This is of great interest 
      in Buddhism, because Buddhism is primarily concerned with the heart, or 
      the mind. </FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In Buddhism we don't make a distinction 
      between the <B><I>heart</I></B> and the <I><B>mind</B></I>, they are one 
      and the same. In English we do make a distinction. We use the word 'heart' 
      not only to refer to the physical organ in the chest, but to the aspect of 
      feelings and emotions. We use the word 'mind' for the more analytical 
      processes associated with the brain: thinking, remembering, planning and 
      so on. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Many people feel that Buddhism is a very 
      intellectual religion, if it can be regarded as a religion at all. They 
      see it as something to do with the intellect, about thinking, philosophy, 
      about training the mind in some technical meditative procedure. For most 
      Western people Buddhism seems cold, lacking in emotions, lacking in warmth 
      of heart. This is not true to the real nature of Buddhism, but it is the 
      way many people from Western countries perceive and encounter it. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Because most Western people who come to 
      Buddhism do so through an intellectual approach, through the study of 
      books or listening to public lectures, they approach it from a more 
      intellectual angle. When they listen to talks about Buddhism they hear 
      teachings which seem to satisfy the intellect, because in Buddhism we do 
      place a lot of emphasis on logic and reason. An intellectual understanding 
      is very important for one who wants to follow any path, be it religious or 
      otherwise. So most of the people who teach Buddhism in the West, and most 
      of the Buddhist books that become popular, will tend to approach it from 
      this very analytical point of view, stressing its logical nature. They 
      emphasise teachings like the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, 
      Dependent Origination and numerous other analytical expositions which are 
      very logical. These teachings are important and true, but it all seems to 
      be up in the head. It all seems to be a matter of cold-blooded logic and 
      intellect. Quite often people say Buddhism seems to be too intellectual.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However, this perspective is not a true 
      representation of Buddhism. Many members of this evening's audience are 
      Asian people, who were born into Buddhist cultures. Others amongst us have 
      had the opportunity to travel and live in the traditional Buddhist 
      cultures of Asia, and have seen how people in these societies relate to 
      Buddhism and live this teaching. Rather than being cold, it is a very warm 
      religion. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The heart is very much a part of the 
      religious path. This is something that needs to be pointed out and 
      explained, and I hope to do so this evening. The topic of tonight's talk 
      is compassion. Compassion is obviously something to do with feeling. It is 
      a quality of the heart, not an intellectual experience. It isn't just a 
      philosophical thought or idea: compassion is a feeling that we all can and 
      do feel. Compassion is one of the essential qualities of Buddhism, and in 
      Buddhist practice this quality will be present. As the title to this talk 
      suggests, it is a natural expression of awakening. The path of Buddhism is 
      the path of awakening. </FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Recognizing suffering </FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Those talks that you have heard and those 
      books that you have read all emphasise the Four Noble Truths, which are 
      the heart of the Buddha's teaching. If one had to summarise what the 
      Buddha taught, every sect of Buddhism would have to agree that the essence 
      or heart of the Buddha's teaching is the Four Noble Truths. These, stated 
      briefly, are: </FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">* that there is suffering in life <BR>
        * that there is a cause of this suffering <BR>
        * that there is a cessation of suffering <BR>
        * that there is a way leading to the cessation of suffering </FONT></I>
        </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha said that these Four Noble 
      Truths could be discovered and verified within each person. The rest of 
      his teaching is an explanation, a very comprehensive one, of these truths. 
      Put more briefly, the Buddha once said, 'I teach only this: suffering and 
      the end of suffering' - very brief and very simple. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When we hear talks about the Four Noble 
      Truths, they seem to dwell quite a lot on this Pali word 'dukkha', which 
      is usually rendered as 'suffering' or less emotionally charged, 
      'unsatisfactoriness'. But 'suffering' is a good enough word, because it 
      //is// suffering: unpleasant, difficult to bear, a state of dis-ease, a 
      state of discomfort, both physical and mental, the presence of a problem - 
      that quality is called //dukkha//, suffering. It is an existential fact of 
      existence. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Hearing this, some may think: &quot;Gosh, this 
      Buddhism - not only is it intellectual, it's also very depressing. 
      Suffering... another talk on suffering!&quot; People tend not to notice that 
      the Buddha said: &quot;I teach suffering //and the end// of suffering.&quot; It's 
      very inspiring to know that there really is such a thing as an end to 
      suffering. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But before you can treat the problem you 
      have to recognise that there is one, otherwise you won't do anything about 
      it. The Buddha said suffering was a truth to be known - suffering must be 
      seen. It must be known before it can be dealt with. People seem to think 
      that by noticing suffering, by fully and consciously acknowledging 
      suffering, it will be depressing and will somehow have a detrimental 
      effect. In fact it has the most wonderful effect on the human being, as we 
      awaken to the nature of life, as we awaken to the predicament of mortal 
      existence. And as we awaken to the nature of suffering, the natural 
      consequence is the opening of the heart into compassion and love. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What is compassion? Compassion literally 
      means 'to feel with', 'to feel for'. It is quite different from passion. 
      Passion is not the natural expression of awakening. It is the natural 
      expression of delusion. Passion is always associated with very strong 
      emotions, and these emotions always come from the ego. 'Me' is always at 
      the centre of passion, regardless of whether that passion is in a positive 
      form, such as desiring, or in the negative form, such as hating. Hatred is 
      a very strong passion - you can passionately hate someone. In this world 
      there are many strongly felt passions of hatred between human beings. 
      Quite often passionate love can turn into passionate hatred. This is 
      because they come from the same centre, from the idea of a separate self 
      which must be gratified and protected. There are barriers between 'me' and 
      others, there is no bond. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So passion is not a synonym for 
      compassion. Compassion is to feel with, to feel for. It is not like 
      passion. Passion is always hot, obsessive, and blinding. It weakens the 
      faculties. Compassion is always cool and associated with awakening. It is 
      a natural pair with wisdom. Compassion arises naturally from awakening, 
      because awakening means that we are beginning to clearly see how things 
      are. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And how things are is suffering. How 
      things are is that we're all in a common predicament - not only us, not 
      only human beings, but all living creatures. All living beings are in 
      exactly the same boat, the 'boat' of birth, old age, sickness and death, 
      the vulnerability of mortal existence. To be born means to be mortal. When 
      we are mortal we are vulnerable. We have these bodies, we feel pain, we 
      get old, we experience sickness. Emotionally and mentally we are very 
      vulnerable. We all fear rejection, we all fear failure, we all fear pain 
      and mental anguish. We fear loss of all kinds and we fear the unknown.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These are common experiences. To all human 
      beings, all living creatures, regardless of sex, race, or age, regardless 
      of being human or animal, these are very common experiences. To be human, 
      to be mortal, to be born into this experience, means to be vulnerable.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Compassion is already there </FONT></B>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To become awakened, to be more awakened, 
      means that we are beginning to appreciate this. We are beginning to look 
      closely at this experience called 'life'; what it feels like to be a human 
      being, and what it is to feel the experiences of pain, fear, sadness, 
      wanting and all that we can feel during one lifetime. We begin to notice 
      what the Buddha pointed out - //dukkha//, suffering, dis-ease. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As we notice this in ourselves we can 
      recognize it in others, we can recognise it in every living being. That is 
      how we can feel compassion in the heart. Quite often we think that we have 
      to develop compassion. &quot;I just don't have enough compassion, I have to 
      develop more compassion.&quot; You don't have to develop compassion, you have 
      all the compassion you need in your heart. Compassion is naturally in the 
      heart, but something is blocking it. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Compassion is there, it comes out on 
      occasions. Have you noticed it? It comes out when certain barriers are 
      down. What are those barriers? What are the obstacles? It is when the mind 
      is caught in darkness, when the mind is so preoccupied with 'me' and 
      'mine', with protecting the self and with getting, that the mind can no 
      longer see suffering. And that is a very common experience. We don't see 
      others because we do not feel with them, compassion doesn't manifest. It's 
      not that it's not there, but it doesn't come through. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Just contemplate your experiences in your 
      own daily life, as you get up in the morning and go about your business at 
      home. Notice your brothers, sisters, father, mother, friends, husband, 
      wife... obviously there is love there, but notice how rarely it is 
      expressed. Notice how rarely it manifests. What is blocking it? All the 
      activity based on //me// and //mine//, what //I// want, what //I// have to 
      get, what //I// have to prove. The tensions and conflict of competition 
      blocks love from manifesting. It's there, it's just that it doesn't 
      manifest. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When we leave home and go to work on the 
      bus, or on the road as we drive our cars, we don't feel much compassion. 
      Why not? Because at that moment there is competition. You want to get in 
      front, you want to get to that seat before the other guy gets it. At that 
      time you can't see others, you can't feel for them. At that moment, other 
      people are competitors, adversaries. At that moment it's //me// against 
      //them//: 'I have to get what //I// want, what //I// need - //I// have to 
      protect.' There's the possibility that other people will get it, resulting 
      in contention, fear and everything but compassion. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the workplace, it's much the same. Even 
      just sitting here, I could feel rather intimidated... you're all looking 
      at me. &quot;What are they thinking?&quot; And you may be sitting there thinking in 
      much the same way, it does happen. People erect barriers so that they 
      forget to see others. They fail to see others in themselves or see 
      themselves in others. That is what is blocking the natural expression of 
      compassion from arising: competition. With this way of relating, with 
      these barriers, with this investment and contention, very little 
      compassion can operate. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But then if you saw a little kitten walk 
      in here, with its big eyes, what would you feel? I imagine every one of 
      you, even if you don't like cats, would think, &quot;What a cute little kitten, 
      it must be hungry.&quot; That's compassion! Why, in that moment, is there 
      compassion in your heart? Where did it come from? What meditation did you 
      do to develop that compassion? Was it some secret technique that you 
      learnt from some yogi or guru who somehow zapped you into feeling 
      compassion? No, compassion is a natural expression, you experience a 
      natural response when the barriers are down, when the fear is down, when 
      the craving is down, when there is no competition. What do you see there? 
      A tiny little being, so helpless, so vulnerable. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Compassion flows because it is natural, 
      because you know what it is to suffer, you know what it is to feel pain, 
      you know what it is to be hungry, you know what it is to be alone. You 
      know this because you can feel for another being, one that is obviously 
      vulnerable to suffering. It is spontaneous, natural. It happens all the 
      time. We all feel it on occasion, but we don't usually notice it. We 
      haven't consciously, clearly noticed it or fully observed what is going 
      on. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We might even feel that it's a bit of a 
      weakness. We see the little kitten - poor little kitten - we might go and 
      stroke it. Then somebody walks by and we mustn't let them see our mushy 
      feelings. We're supposed to be strong and independent, so we don't want to 
      acknowledge this natural state. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So I'd like to emphasise that compassion 
      is not something you have to develop: you have compassion, your heart is 
      full of it. Every one of us has plenty of compassion, but it needs the 
      opportunity to flow out. We need to drop the barriers, we need to break 
      down the barriers that prevent the expression of compassion. We don't have 
      to do any meditation to develop compassion. That may sound somewhat 
      contrary to some of the Buddha's teaching, but it isn't really. You can 
      call it cultivating compassion. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I found it very useful to appreciate and 
      understand that compassion is natural. I had an interesting experience in 
      the monastery in Perth where I live. As I am the senior monk, the abbot, I 
      am supposed to run things. A very difficult monk came to stay with me for 
      one year. He suffered from a sense of paranoia, which made him stubborn 
      and difficult to have around. There was a lot of conflict because he would 
      try to manipulate things and was always scheming. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">By nature I'm a fairly authoritarian sort 
      of person. I like to have things run smoothly. I don't believe I'm too 
      extreme, but being in such a position, one knows what should be done and 
      how things should run. So there was some conflict. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One day it came to a head. I felt that it 
      just couldn't be resolved. It had become too much of a personality clash. 
      So he said, &quot;I want the whole community of monks (there were only six of 
      us) to resolve it.&quot; It seemed like a good idea, so we all met together, 
      bringing up the conflict in the midst of the community, in the midst of 
      the Order of monks: &quot;This is the problem. This is the way I see it, this 
      is the way he sees it, so who's right? How are we to deal with this?&quot;
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I had quite a lot of aversion and 
      resentment towards this monk, and in fact I wanted to get rid of him. I 
      just saw him as a troublemaker, somebody who had to be put down by winning 
      the argument. After the initial preamble, the first monk to speak said, 
      &quot;Well, Ajahn Jagaro is the abbot and I think he has the perfect right to 
      make the decisions about what should be done. If this monk was a good monk 
      he would just do what he was told. I'm quite willing to do what I'm told 
      about anything like this.&quot; </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As soon as he said that, I was very 
      surprised by my reaction. I looked immediately at the troublesome monk, 
      but I didn't see a troublesome monk. All I saw was a human being, and the 
      thought that came into my mind was, &quot;Oh no, what if they all say that - it 
      will crush him.&quot; I felt immediate compassion for this monk, who just a 
      minute ago I was very averse to. I sensed that he was a vulnerable human 
      being, that he would be humiliated. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But of course, life has many teachings for 
      us, and in a few minutes my mind changed again, because all the other 
      monks took his side! But I do have tremendous gratitude for that 
      experience, because it was from that point on that I realised that 
      compassion is a very spontaneous, natural feeling; we all have it. It's 
      not something that you have to cultivate. What you have to do is to remove 
      the barriers that stop the flow of compassion. You don't need to build 
      compassion, it is there. When we see others in ourselves and ourselves in 
      others, when we see the vulnerability of others and recognise the 
      suffering that is common to us all, compassion will flow. It will come 
      spontaneously, and you can see it over and over again if you are watchful.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Once you recognise this fact, once you 
      know this is the potential of the heart, then it is easy to be 
      compassionate. It simply means opening the eyes, seeing others, seeing the 
      vulnerable living being rather than seeing the enemy, the rival, the ugly 
      man, the desirable woman. These perceptions create barriers to seeing the 
      common existential experience of vulnerability. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now that is not too difficult to do, but 
      it does mean an awakening of the mind. It means waking up and actually 
      noticing, recollecting, seeing in this way. So that if I, sitting here, 
      see you as them, out there, either favourably or not, then of course I 
      don't feel very much compassion. I can feel threatened or I can feel 
      attracted, one or the other. But if I see each and every one of you as a 
      human being, then I see myself in you and I know you all feel very much 
      like I do. I don't feel competitiveness, nor do I feel that sense of fear, 
      but quite naturally, I feel //with// you. You can call it compassion, or a 
      sense of communion. We can experience this with anyone. It simply means 
      seeing oneself in others and seeing others in oneself. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A quite touching story was related to me 
      by another monk. Our monastery in Perth is situated about ten kilometres 
      from a low-security prison farm. The prisoners there are given a lot more 
      freedom and opportunity to work than in ordinary prisons. On the farm, 
      there's work to do and they get paid for it. Some time previously the 
      education officer at this prison farm had invited one of our monks to 
      teach meditation to a group of prisoners. The monk who went most often 
      told me this story, which was related to him by one of the prisoners who 
      attended his meditation class. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In that prison they had a slaughterhouse, 
      and one of the jobs in the prison was working in the slaughterhouse. This 
      prisoner was a slaughterer. He was killing the cattle without thinking 
      much about it; usually the cattle just came in and he knocked them off. 
      One day a cow came in very passively. It wasn't fighting at all, but 
      standing very passively. He looked its way and just happened to catch its 
      eyes, a thing which he'd never done before. Usually he just thought, &quot;It's 
      only an animal - knock it out.&quot; But this time, because the cow was quiet, 
      he looked at it, straight into the cows eyes - and cows have such big 
      eyes. He noticed that the cow was crying, he actually saw tears in its 
      eyes. The cow was crying and at that moment he saw another living being. 
      He felt with this living being, he saw himself in this living being, he 
      saw that this living being felt just like him. I wanted to live, the cow 
      was afraid. He couldn't do it; he put down his tools and walked away - 
      never again! </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">How many times has that kind of thing 
      happened to you without you really noticing it? When we feel with another, 
      when we look at another and see ourselves in that person, there is a 
      natural communion, there is compassion and empathy. When that happens you 
      can't exploit, you can't hurt. This feeling for others, compassion, is 
      quite a natural experience as we open up to the true nature of life, as we 
      open up to the universal truth of suffering in all its forms, to which we 
      are all subject. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you saw yourself in others and others 
      in yourself, you couldn't go out and kill, rape, hurt, or exploit them. 
      Those things can only be done when we forget, when we drown real knowledge 
      and superimpose it with falseness and ideological lies, created by desire 
      and aversion. They are not the natural expression of the heart, they are 
      defilements of the mind, conditioned into the mind, from where they 
      overwhelm and block this natural space of the heart. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you want somebody to go and do terrible 
      things to others, don't tell them that those people have wives and 
      husbands and children, or that they are afraid and feel pain. You can't 
      tell them that. When you want your soldiers to go to war, to fight and 
      kill, you can't tell them that the enemy are human beings, that they feel 
      pain, that they feel just like you do. They have to become monsters, they 
      have to become cold, unfeeling aliens. &quot;Go out there and get rid of those 
      aliens!&quot; When you want people to work in a slaughterhouse, when you want 
      people to go shooting, hunting and fishing, don't tell them that the 
      animals feel and they're afraid and sensitive: &quot;Animals, they're just dumb 
      animals. They were put on earth for us to make use of.&quot; As soon as you 
      awaken to the fact that this creature experiences pain, that this creature 
      is afraid, that this creature is mortal and therefore much the same as 
      you, you can't harm it. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So I do not think that compassion needs 
      much development. Compassion is already there in everyone. It is there in 
      the heart. It's just that sometimes, most times, it is blocked by our 
      selfishness and delusion. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I would like to emphasise this in 
      education. You know there is great emphasis on trying to keep law and 
      order, trying to stop many of the terrible things happening in society 
      today. I think if we could make more people more sensitive, in the sense 
      of being aware of this existential truth of suffering, that all living 
      creatures feel, that all living creatures suffer and are vulnerable, then 
      the world would be a much better place. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We can bring this awareness into our minds 
      by awakening to this truth, by noticing this over and over again, 
      consciously bringing it into our minds. Use it as a meditation. Try to see 
      yourself in others and see others in yourself. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">People will ask, &quot;Can you really feel 
      compassion for some of the monsters that are around in the world?&quot; Well, 
      even monsters suffer. But you don't have to put yourself to such an 
      extreme test straight away. What about your neighbour, people on the 
      train, people sitting here now? We can bring up this awareness with 
      ordinary people. When we bring this awareness into the mind, compassion 
      will arise naturally. Compassion transcends all differences because we are 
      all in the same boat. Whether it's a little kitten, whether it's a bird, a 
      snake, a frog, a man, woman, father, son - we're all vulnerable, we are 
      all subject to //dukkha// and we can all feel for each other. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Don't wait for others to set the ball in 
      motion. Just by awakening to this truth, compassion will flow. It happens 
      to every mother: how can she be so patient? How can she be so 
      compassionate? Because she sees the vulnerability of her child. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I've noticed that this happens with people 
      when relating to monks, because monks are like helpless babies. We need to 
      be fed just as a little baby has to be fed. I have to wait for someone to 
      bring me my food everyday. People provide us with the things we need - if 
      ever we need shoes or clothes, people provide them for us. So we're very 
      vulnerable. If no one brings food for us, we don't eat. I've noticed that 
      the result of this is that somehow it does bring a lot of compassion out 
      of people. People generally feel a lot of compassion towards monks. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I noticed one particular case of this when 
      I was in Thailand. One year I spent a Rains Retreat in the north, my first 
      experience of living in northern Thailand. There was one particular lady, 
      an elderly woman who used to come to the monastery occasionally. We used 
      to go on alms-round every morning. Monks would go out with their bowls and 
      walk through the town, but because in that province of Northern Thailand 
      they weren't accustomed to forest monks, we used to get very little food 
      on these alms-rounds. It was a large village of around five hundred 
      houses, but only some ten or twelve people would put food in our bowls.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One household that we went past was a very 
      poor house where this particular woman lived. Either she or her grandson, 
      who was only a small boy, offered the food. She had a husband - poor man. 
      She was a really ferocious woman; she used to shout at the top of her 
      voice and she had a very aggressive way of shouting at her husband. She 
      looked very hard. The way she would shout and scowl was quite frightening 
      - obviously she was quite a tough woman. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But a magical transformation would take 
      place every morning when the monks came by. As soon as she saw the monks 
      she'd immediately get the pot of rice and come and kneel down on the road. 
      She would get right down on her knees, a lovely smile would appear on her 
      face and her features would soften so much. When she said something she 
      spoke so gently, it was like a magical transformation - this compassion 
      for these helpless little monks! Obviously it was always there, it was 
      just that at that moment it would come out because of the way she saw the 
      monks. It was different from the way she saw her husband, who was a bit of 
      a nuisance. The barriers went down and the compassion flowed. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is something that we call all 
      contemplate. When we contemplate and understand this, we will know how to 
      allow this natural potential to express itself, to manifest. This is the 
      path of Buddhism. Compassion is the natural result of following the path, 
      the natural result of awakening to the truth of suffering. Such an 
      awakening is not depressing, not cold or indifferent, but leads to true 
      love and compassion. </FONT></P>
