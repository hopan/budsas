      honour for me to be here with you all and join you on this momentous 
      occasion of Second World Buddhist Summit 2004. We have assembled here at 
      the Sacred Lumbini Garden to discuss and understand the role of <I>
      Lumbini: &#39;A Symbol of Unity in Diversity – the Fountain of World Peace&#39;</I>. 
      The Summit surely will prove to be an effective platform to promote 
      Lumbini as a symbol of international brotherhood, peace and prosperity. I 
      do hope that at the end of three days of Summit the indispensability of 
      peace in the prevailing international situation will emerge as the major 
      agenda of deliberations. Friends in the Dhamma! We are here to pay our 
      respects to the Buddha who has shown to us all the possible ways and means 
      to establish a peaceful society and make our human life comfortable, happy 
      and contented.</P>

      <P>Introduction</B> </FONT>[2]</P>
      <P>Before we can speak about &#39;The Indispensability of Peace in the Present 
      World Context&#39;, we have to first explain what is meant by the term 
      &#39;peace&#39;. Peace is one of those things everyone says they want, but can&#39;t 
      seem to find. So if everyone really wants it, then what is the problem?
      </P>
      <P>What do we mean when we talk of peace? Is peace really achievable in 
      the present world context? Is peace just a utopian concept or can it exist 
      in our daily lives? How can one achieve peace in a war zone? Is peace 
      achievable through religious practice or political dialogue? </P>
      <P>The present world we live in is witnessing violence at an unprecedented 
      level. Although the Cold War has ended, there are new conflicts that 
      develop everyday, while old ones deepen and escalate. As citizens of this 
      world, we seem unable to stem the violence, and our representative, the 
      United Nations is struggling to keep afloat of the tide of unrest. 
      Therefore, how can we create sustainable World Peace in the present world 
      context? </P>
      <P>As we converge here in Lumbini, having walked our different paths in 
      life, philosophy and religion, we all carry in our hearts a desire for 
      peace. Both the Nepalese government and the Maoists are struggling for the 
      betterment of society, but this cannot be achieved without first 
      establishing peace in the country. In this climate of conflict here in 
      Nepal today, we forget that this is where the Buddha, the Emissary of 
      World Peace was born. How did we let the message of peace be shrouded by 
      the violence of war? We have seen the capacity of war to destroy men and 
      human resources, to cripple entire generations, to crush human rights 
      underfoot, to disrupt the values upon which living together is based and 
      to make every aspect of our lives less human. Although we may be weary and 
      wary about the concept of conflict, it is the prospect of peace that 
      brings us here today, and it is in this spirit that we should move forward 
      for the future of our nation and our world.</P>
      <P>Indeed, how can we realize the indispensability of peace in Nepal? In 
      order for peace to be indispensable, are we willing to dispense with our 
      own personal goals? What are we willing to sacrifice for the cause of 
      peace? How can peace feature as an objective for constitutional 
      politicians? What is the monarchy willing to give up in the name of peace? 
      And what is the place of peace in the Maoists ideologies? Democracy has 
      been embraced by Nepal since 1990 but it is obvious that peace has not 
      been one of its products. </P>
      <P>The subject of the indispensability of peace in the present world 
      context is a very big one, but the organizers of this World Buddhist 
      Summit, besides asking me to speak on it, have allotted me some thirty 
      minutes in which to do so. Either they underestimated the dimensions of 
      the subject or overestimated my ability to deal with it in the time 
      allotted. It would be pleasant to think that the latter alternative was 
      the case, but if this is so then I am going to have to disappoint our good 
      organizers, and must ask them and you to forgive me. I am quite unable to 
      deal with the subject of the &#39;Indispensability of Peace in the Present 
      World Context&#39; systematically in the space of some thirty minutes. Being a 
      son of the Buddha myself, I shall deal with it from a Buddhist perspective 
      and its application to present world context and particularly to 
      present-day Nepal, the birth land of the Buddha. </P>
      <P>If there are those amongst you who are cynical of peace, I do not blame 
      you for having that sentiment. Talking about peace is an activity that is 
      totally disconnected from the real world. While we are talking about peace 
      here in the peaceful sacred garden in a very amicable environment there is 
      violence not far away from here and other places in the world this very 
      minute. There are so many religious, political, inter-religious and peace 
      conferences like this which are discussing the issue of peace but at the 
      end of the day, all it is paying lip-service to the issue. People who are 
      involved and engaged in the violence hardly attend those conferences and 
      are not involved in shaping the content of those conferences. </P>
      <P>If politicians and decision makers of this country and Maoists leaders 
      were to participate in conferences for peace such as this, then there is a 
      chance that they might reflect upon their policies and actions that 
      directly or indirectly caused the death of many innocent lives. They will 
      at least have a chance to learn about the great message of peace echoed 
      worldwide for over 2,500 years through the mouth of the Buddha, a Nepalese 
      hero who lighted a powerful torch of peace to the world. </P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>Peace: What it really means to us</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>Our popular concept of peace has failed. It is concepts of peace such 
      as &quot;peace is not war&quot; or &quot;not conflict&quot; that I accuse of failure. Many [3] 
      suggest a relationship between peace definitions and peace action. Peace 
      definitions or concepts are the basis on which we decide how to make 
      peace. For example, if I define peace as not war, then I would attempt to 
      make peace by attempting to eliminate war or at least mitigate its 
      severity. On the other hand, if I define peace as inner harmony, I would 
      attempt to develop &#39;inner me&#39; and meditate as much as possible in order to 
      make peace with myself and surroundings. The point is that concepts or 
      definitions of peace are the basis for peacemaking. What one does to 
      achieve peace depends on how one imagines, defines, or conceptualizes 
      peace. If our present peace efforts are in danger of catastrophic failure 
      then our concepts may need revision. Perhaps it is also our inability to 
      make those concepts clear that has led to their failure. Indeed &quot;peace&quot; 
      has proven difficult to define. Perhaps it has rhetorical uses for 
      political leaders who benefit from the ambiguity of the term. Also there 
      are socially constructed cultural differences in peace concepts. </P>
      <P>&quot;Peace&quot; is a word that is uttered almost as frequently as &quot;truth,&quot; 
      &quot;beauty,&quot; and &quot;love.&quot; It may be just as elusive to define as these other 
      virtues. Common synonyms for peace include &quot;amity,&quot; &quot;friendship,&quot; 
      &quot;harmony,&quot; &quot;concord,&quot; &quot;tranquility,&quot; &quot;repose,&quot; &quot;quiescence,&quot; &quot;truce,&quot; 
      &quot;pacification,&quot; and &quot;neutrality.&quot; While some of these descriptions are 
      appropriate, they are still quite limited in describing both the nature of 
      peace and the role of the peacemaker. Any attempt to articulate the nature 
      of peace and peacemaking, therefore, must address those conditions that 
      are favorable to their emergence. Freedom, human rights, and justice are 
      among such prerequisites. Also included are proactive strategies such as 
      conflict resolution, nonviolent action, community building, and 
      democratization of authority.</P>
      <P>Although &#39;peace&#39; is a common word we use globally, the understanding of 
      it varies from culture to culture. For example, we find that there is an 
      East-West dichotomy of peace concepts in the present world context. In the 
      Western concept the most common elements of peace are prosperity and order 
      where order refers to rule of law. Therefore, the Western concepts see 
      peace more as a property of social systems functioning to assure 
      prosperity. On the contrary, the Eastern concepts of peace emphasize order 
      and tranquility of mind. Here order refers both to the political and 
      cosmic order achieved through individual conformity to custom, norms, etc. 
      as an outcome of individual internal harmony. [4]</P>
      <P>Additionally, some categorize peace as </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>1) a world without war, <BR>
        2) world justice, and <BR>
        3) world order. [5] </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>1) The peace is not a war category [6] that is concerned with 
      disarmament, control of or elimination of war, understanding the root 
      causes of war, and the control of or elimination of war-like violence 
      (oppressive, bloody regimes like Idi Amin in Uganda or the Khemer Rouge of 
      Cambodia). To these ends most of peace research has been dedicated to 
      three conceptual groups: 1.1) peace through no violence, 1.2) peace 
      through conflict resolution, and 1.3) peace through disarmament. [7]</P>
      <P>2) The peace as world/social justice category [8] has shifted focus 
      from the causes of war to the conditions of violence and peace. In doing 
      so it has continued to define peace in terms of violence and has added 
      conflict theory to peace theory (e.g. &quot;War to end all wars&quot;). </P>
      <P>3) The peace as world order category [9] attempts to address the 
      problem of human survival in the face of increasingly complex world 
      problems such as nuclear war, and ecological disaster. The primary problem 
      under this category is the existence of autonomous, independent 
      nation-states which, except for the influence of an emerging world 
      economy, function largely in response to their own internal needs. </P>
      <P>All of the above conceptual schemes imply two basic ways of 
      conceptualizing peace: </P>
      <P>1) Concepts of peace that are largely materialistic, international, and 
      external. Materialistic in the sense that peace is associated with 
      prosperity; war and violence reduce prosperity. International in that the 
      appropriate starting point for peace is at the level of relations between 
      nations. External in the sense that peace, if it is possible, must exist 
      outside the individual or the relationship (individual to others/society); 
      peace is more the product of social structures than of interactional 
      patterns or subjective states. The problem of obtaining peace is seen as 
      war or violence (physical and structural). </P>
      <P>2) Concepts of peace that are more idealistic, inter- and 
      intra-personal, and both internal and external. Idealistic in that 
      non-material goals and processes are valued in the achievement of peace; 
      peace is not necessarily related to prosperity. Additionally, peace is 
      idealistic in that like other aspects of social reality, it is constructed 
      and maintained through social processes and can be revised through those 
      same processes. Inter- and intra-personal in that the best level at which 
      to begin peacemaking is seen as developing internal peace with which one 
      then interacts more peacefully with others. Internal in the sense that 
      peace must first exist within the individual in relationship to others; 
      peace is more the product of interactional patterns or subjective states 
      than of social structures. Yet external concepts of peace are not 
      excluded. Social structures must also be changed to institutionalize 
      changes in interactional patterns or subjective states.</P>
      <P>In other words, the concepts of peace can be divided into two aspects: 
      1) Negative peace and Positive peace. Negative peace means the absence of 
      war, violence both personal and social, terrorist activities and 
      hostilities in general. Therefore, &quot;peace is the absence of violence in 
      all its forms - physical, social, psychological, and structural&quot; [10]. The 
      term positive peace, on the other hand, connotes not only the absence of 
      war, but also more significantly, the promotion of a harmonious 
      functionally cooperative and well integrated society. [11] </P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>Buddhist &#39;Peace&#39;</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>Having discussed on the popular concepts of peace let me look back to 
      our Buddha, the Emissary of World Peace. Let us see what Buddha would say 
      about peace in the present world context. In short, Santi or peace in 
      Buddha&#39;s term is a synonym of the Buddhist ultimate goal i.e. Nibbana 
      and/or happiness. Nibbana literally means extinguish. Extinguish from all 
      defilements namely desire, hatred and delusion. In other words, when we 
      can extinguish the fire of desire, hatred and delusion we are in peace. 
      Those defilements are the major roots of physical, social and mental 
      conflicts that we encounter in our day to day lives. Therefore, attaining 
      Nibbana means not to be in physical, social and mental conflicts but to be 
      in physical, social and mental peace. Therefore, &#39;peace is not just 
      absence of war. Peace is a state of consciousness dynamically maintained 
      by the people in a society where the evils of greed, hatred, and ignorance 
      are reduced to minimum and non-greed and non-hatred are increased to the 
      maximum.&#39; [12]</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, peace is the characteristic of Nibbana. The Buddha 
      extends the concept of peace to include both inner peace (<I>ajjhattta-santi</I>) 
      and outer peace (<I>bahiddha-santi</I>). Inner peace which is generally 
      known as &#39;peace of mind&#39; is a mental state free from &#39;disquieting or 
      oppressive thoughts or emotions.&#39; Inner peace is a prerequisite for outer 
      peace which involves interpersonal relations. We can feel outer peace when 
      we live harmoniously with our fellow beings. Parallel to mental peace, 
      outer peace includes communal, national and global peace. [13]</P>
      <P>From the Buddha&#39;s perspective, the meaning of peace, in terms of our 
      living experiences combines four primary issues: happiness, peace, freedom 
      and security. According to the Buddha, Nibbana is called <I>parama sukha</I>, 
      the highest happiness; <I>anuttara santivarapada</I>, the supreme state of 
      sublime peace; <I>vimutti</I>, liberation or deliverance; and <I>anuttara 
      yogakhema</I>, the supreme security from bondage. [14] While these aspects 
      of Nibbana may seem far removed from our present world context, a little 
      reflection will show that they link up with our most basic aspirations, 
      indeed with the most basic desires of all human beings. When we consider 
      the true motivation behind all our actions, it should be immediately clear 
      that what we really desire most is a state that combines these four 
      qualities: happiness, peace, freedom, and security. The reason we fail to 
      attain them is not that we desire their opposites – for no one 
      deliberately seeks to be miserable, distressed, enslaved, and imperiled – 
      but because we misconceive them and thus do not know how to attain them.
      </P>
      <P>Not understanding the truth we seek our basic aspirations in the wrong 
      direction, like a man who wants to go from Lumbini to Kapilavastu by 
      heading north-east to Kathmandu. </P>
      <P>(1) We cannot distinguish <I>true happiness</I> from sensual 
      gratification, thus we seek happiness by frantically pursuing sensual 
      pleasures. This is like trying to satisfy one&#39;s thirst by drinking sea 
      water: the more one drinks, the more thirsty one becomes.</P>
      <P>(2) Again, we think that <I>peace</I> means the absence of conflict; 
      thus we try to gain by subduing our opponents and by bullying our 
      environment to serve our desires, unaware that this process is ultimately 
      self-destructive.</P>
      <P>(3) We identify <I>freedom</I> with license, the freedom to act on 
      impulse, to do whatever we wish; thus we demand the right to act 
      impetuously, without having to pay the price, without having to bear 
      responsibility for our irresponsible actions.</P>
      <P>(4) We think of <I>security</I> as protection from external harm; thus 
      we shield ourselves in high-walled homes equipped with high-alert security 
      systems, yet we never feel completely safe but live in the shadow of fear, 
      of an anxiety that swells up from within. </P>
      <P>It is said that there are 84,000 teachings taught by the Buddha which 
      we call Buddhism nowadays. When we investigate those entire teachings one 
      easily finds that the ultimate teaching of all those teachings is peace 
      and how to achieve that physical, mental and social peace within this 
      life. Buddhism, therefore, is <I>the religion of peace and happiness</I><B>.
      </B>For nearly 2,600 years ago the Buddha was already talking about the 
      peace and the way to achieve that peace. Nibbana is not a Buddhist heaven 
      or certain place for Buddhists to aspire after death but it is the human 
      peace everyone yearns for. Consequently, a scholar boldly state <I>
      Buddhism has taught peace more strongly among its followers, more 
      effectively, during all its history, than has any other great religious 
      faith to the world</I>. [15]</P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>Will peace be achievable in the present world context?</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>As to where or not peace would be achievable in the present world 
      context is a topic for a good debate. Based on a recorded history of 
      civilization of already 6,000 years, it seems that our earthly society is 
      destined to undergo periods of wars from time to time. However, if the 
      UNESCO preamble is to be taken seriously, then we may have some hope of a 
      lasting peace. UNESCO&#39;s preamble starts with the words: Since war begin in 
      the minds of men it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must 
      be constructed. This would mean that we should develop a kind of 
      educational program that would make it possible for a new generation to 
      wage peace among themselves instead of war. Although this is theoretically 
      sound, in practice we need to do a lot of groundwork if we were to 
      visualize a 21st century for our children and grandchildren which is 
      characterized by peace.</P>
      <P>To this end we need to find out, in the first place, what has caused so 
      much violence and wars over the centuries up to the present time. Among 
      several possible reasons we find the following:</P>
      <B>
      <P>1. Politics</B>: The formation of various political parties led to a 
      number of wars unnecessarily because each of such parties tried to impose 
      its political philosophy over the rest of the population.</P>
      <B>
      <P>2. Religion</B>: In spite of the fact that religion in itself is a very 
      peaceful institution, yet various religions found it appropriate to wage 
      wars against their neighbor in the name of God.</P>
      <B>
      <P>3. Communism</B>: This type of ideology visualized people living 
      together as members of the same family where everything is shared with 
      each other. In practice, communism has deprived people of their basic 
      human rights.</P>
      <B>
      <P>4. Capitalism</B>: This system advocates the never-ending building of a 
      capital in a way that people never feel satisfied because they always 
      yearn for more and more. This often leads to greed which tends to 
      disregard other&#39;s people need.</P>
      <B>
      <P>5. Exploitation</B>: One of the evils of colonialism has been the 
      exploitation of people&#39;s resources. This element nowadays is still among 
      us under various guises. It explains why it is said that the rich get 
      richer and the poor get poorer.</P>
      <B>
      <P>6. Power-Abuse</B>: The concept of power is frequently rendered as an 
      opportunity to provide excellent services to people everywhere. However, 
      when power is abused, people are forced to rebel and a war generally takes 
      place.</P>
      <B>
      <P>7. Jealousy</B>: When people see other in a more privileged position, 
      instead of thanking his karma for being so kind to them, they get annoyed 
      instead and in a number of instances figure out a way to destroy people&#39;s 
      goods.</P>
      <B>
      <P>8. Ethnicity</B>: People tend to make such a big dean to one&#39;s ethnic 
      background that they find themselves often divided and all of a sudden 
      involved unnecessarily in tribal conflicts. This type of conflict is also 
      known as racism.</P>
      <B>
      <P>9. Organized Crime</B>: Many refer to this type of crime simply by the 
      word &quot;mafia.&quot; Here people are blackmailed and threatened so as to comply 
      to anything the mafia gang proposes. As a result, conflicts are bound to 
      follow.</P>
      <B>
      <P>10. Terrorism</B>: In the wake of the September 11, 2001 incident, the 
      term &#39;terrorism&#39; becomes part of our daily conversation. It has more 
      frequently been associated with violence committed by disenfranchised 
      groups desperately attempting to gain a shred of power and influence. 
      Although these groups cannot kill on the scale that governments with all 
      their military power can, their sheer numbers, their intense dedication, 
      and their dangerous unpredictability have given them influence vastly out 
      of proportion with their meager military resources. Some of these groups 
      have been inspired by purely secular causes and they have been motivated 
      by leftist ideologies. [16] Current development of terrorism and the 
      &#39;state anti-terror terrorism&#39; present a complex and new situation for the 
      question of peace and war. This surpasses all the past understanding of 
      war and peace. This confrontation has no national boundaries. It has no 
      definite military targets. It defies all rules that regulate wars. There 
      is neither the beginning nor the end of the war.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above source, there are many numerous others which 
      instigate tension among human beings to the point of war. Of course, 
      agencies such as the weapons industrial complex, will not hesitate to take 
      the advantage of every situation conceivable to provide weapons of 
      destruction to everyone who is willing to pay the right price. In fact, 
      this agency has become one of the most lucrative businesses in the world.</P>
      <P>With regards to various sources of conflict the Buddha often referred 
      to the negative effect of attachment to speculative or fixed views, 
      dogmatic opinions, and even correct views if not personally know to be 
      true [17]. Grasping at views can be seen to have led to religious and 
      ideological wars (offensive or defensive), crusades, bloody revolutions, 
      and gas chambers. Indeed, millions of deaths were caused, in the 20th 
      century, by those attached to particular ideologies which &#39;justified&#39; 
      their actions: Hitler, Stalin, the Khmer Rouge, and terrorists of various 
      kinds.</P>
      <P>The bad influence of other members of one&#39;s community is seen as 
      another factor which may lead to conflict. It is said that when a king 
      acts in an not virtuous <I>(adhammika) </I>way, this influences his 
      ministers to do likewise, and this influence then spreads to Brahmins and 
      householders, and on to townsfolk and villagers. That is, rot at the top 
      can easily spread downwards through the whole of society [18].</P>
      <P>Once Sakka the ruler of the gods came to the Buddha and asked: &#39;By what 
      bonds are people bound whereby, though they wish to live in peace, without 
      hate and hostility, they yet live in conflict, with hate and hostility.&#39; 
      The Buddha replied: &#39;It is the bonds of envy and avarice that so bind 
      people that, though they wish to live in peace, they live in conflict, 
      with hate and hostility.&#39; If we trace external conflicts back to their 
      source, we will find that they originate not in wealth, position or 
      possessions, but in the mind itself. They spring up because we envy others 
      for the qualities they possess which we desire for ourselves.</P>
      <P>World peace in the present world context is feasible and attainable. 
      However, we have to work at it by taking several steps simultaneously, the 
      sooner the better. Needless to say, everyone must try to make contribution 
      to this end. As we have already seen negative effect of attachment to 
      speculative or fixed views and dogmatic has become our greatest enemy to 
      world peace. It needs to be thoroughly understood and put totally out of 
      views and opinion in the line of &#39;right view&#39;, even it were to take us 
      longer than expected. </P>

      <P>How to stop an insurgency? Personal Experiences</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>Since the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) launched its People&#39;s War 
      in February 1996, their insurgency kept continuing to the present day. 
      With eight years of time span many hundreds of lives were killed in Nepal. 
      Several attempts were tried and keep trying to stop this killing field of 
      Nepal but it is progressing no where and degree of insurgency getting 
      wider and wider. What happened in Nepal? Why? </P>
      <P>This is because when we realize that there is nowhere else to go, we 
      face the problem rather than running away. I believe that most problems 
      have solutions that we can&#39;t see when we&#39;re running in the other 
      direction. As the people of our world come to live ever closer to each 
      other, we have to find solutions to our problems. There is no place to run 
      away to. We simply cannot afford major conflicts any more. </P>
      <P>I had personal experiences of how a national government found such a 
      solution to a major crisis, one that threatened the very existence of 
      their democracy. I left Nepal to study Buddhism in Thailand as a 15 years 
      novice-monk in 1975. At that time Thailand was a very similar to present 
      Nepal. South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia fell to the Communists within a 
      few days of each other in 1975. The &#39;Domino Theory&#39; current at that time 
      among the Western powers, predicted that Thailand would soon fall next but 
      most Western governments were to be surprised that Thailand didn&#39;t fall. 
      All that time, I was a young novice-monk in Bangkok residing in a royal 
      monastery under the patronage of the present Supreme Patriarch of 
      Thailand.</P>
      <P>His Holiness the Supreme Patriarch or Deputy-Supreme Patriarch of the 
      time was quite influential in Thailand. Their Majesties King and Queen, 
      many top Thai generals and senior members of the national government would 
      visit him for advice and inspiration. I had become fluent in Thai, and so 
      gained an insider&#39;s understanding of the seriousness of the situation. The 
      military and the government were not as concerned with the Red armies 
      outside their borders as they were with the Communist activists and 
      sympathisers within their own nation.</P>
      <P>Many brilliant Thai university students had fled to the jungles in 
      northeast Thailand to support an internal, Thai, Communist guerrilla 
      force. Their weaponry was supplied from beyond Thailand&#39;s borders as was 
      their training. But the villages in the &#39;pink&#39; parts of the region gladly 
      supplied their food and other requirements. They had local support. They 
      were an ominous threat. They were able to announce many region of Thailand 
      as &#39;Red&#39; region where it would be very dangerous for civil servants or 
      governmental staffs to step in. Often bombs were exploded in different 
      places and Thai militaries always encounter those Communist guerrilla 
      forces in bloody fight.</P>
      <P>I remembered following my teacher who was Deputy Supreme Patriarch to 
      Communist captured regions trying to help villagers who are the invisible 
      supporters of Communist guerrilla force. Many times we were threatened 
      that they might attack us any time. On one occasion, a bomb was detonated 
      on the route where my teacher passed after visiting a monastery and 
      villagers. </P>
      <P>Many occasions I witnessed Their Majesties King and Queen of Thailand 
      personally visit my teacher at the monastery in Bangkok and consult about 
      the crisis after Their Majesties visited those dangerous regions 
      personally. Out of great compassion to his troubling subjects Their 
      Majesties dare enough to visit those regions where it is dangerous for 
      outsiders to visit. Their Majesties visited in those areas personally to 
      understand the grass root problem of those people and extend his hands to 
      help them in all possible ways. </P>
      <P>One of the ways out of crisis applied by Their Majesties to stop the 
      insurgency was to heal physical, mental and social scars from those people 
      in jungle and remote places by reducing the gap between urban and rural 
      and rich and poor. With introduction of many royal projects development 
      was decentralised and poverty was slowly alleviated. In terms of social 
      and mental development, with the full support of Deputy Supreme Patriarch 
      and the monastic Order, Their Majesties would help villagers to set up a 
      simple religious community where they could learn and share their 
      spiritual experiences and practice the teachings of the Buddha in their 
      own way. This slowly developed to be well informed and educated religious 
      based community where they can achieve peace, harmony and happiness within 
      their own means. Those religious communities led by Buddhist monks in 
      those &#39;Red&#39; regions began to transform to &#39;pink&#39; and later cleaned 
      completely with their own understanding and achievement. Of course, to 
      achieve those goals Thai government played equally very wise role and 
      closely followed many virtues of Buddhist teachings in handling the 
      crisis. </P>
      <P>In regards to the solution of this crisis, my senior colleague a 
      British Buddhist monk, Ajarn Brahm, who was in Thailand during 1970s too 
      wrote beautifully about how Thai government handled the crisis in his 
      recently published book as follows [19]:</P>
      <P>&quot;The Thai military and government found the solution in a three part 
      strategy. </P>
      <B>
      <P>1. Restraint:</B> The military did not attack the Communist bases, 
      though every soldier knew where they were. When I was living the life of a 
      wandering monk in 1979 80, seeking out the mountains and jungles to 
      meditate in solitude, I would run into the army patrols and they would 
      give me advice. They would point to one moun<FONT FACE="Palatino Linotype">ญ</FONT>tain 
      and tell me not to go there – that was where the Communists were. Then 
      they would point to another mountain and tell me that was a good place to 
      medi<FONT FACE="Palatino Linotype">ญ</FONT>tate, there were no Communists 
      there. I had to heed their advice. That year the Communists had caught 
      some wandering monks meditating in the jungle and killed them – after 
      torturing them, I was told. </P>
      <B>
      <P>2. Forgiveness:</B> Throughout this dangerous period, there was an 
      unconditional amnesty in place. Whenever one of the Communist insurgents 
      wanted to abandon his cause, he could simply give up his weapon and return 
      to his village or university. He would probably experience surveillance, 
      but no punishments were imposed. I reached one village in Kow Wong 
      district a few months after the Communists had ambushed and killed a large 
      jeep full of Thai soldiers outside their village. The young men of the 
      village were mostly sympathetic to the Communist soldiers, but not 
      actively fighting. They told me they were threatened and harassed, but 
      allowed to go free.</P>
      <B>
      <P>3. Solving the root problem:</B> During these years, I saw new roads 
      being built and old roads being paved in the region. Villagers could now 
      take their produce to town to sell. The King of Thailand personally 
      supervised, and paid for, the construction of many hundreds of small 
      reservoirs with connected irrigation schemes, allowing the poor farmers of 
      the northeast to grow a second crop of rice each year. Electricity reached 
      the remotest of hamlets and with it came a school and a clinic. The 
      poorest region in Thailand was being cared for by the government in 
      Bangkok, and the villagers were becoming relatively prosperous.</P>
      <P>A Thai government soldier on patrol in the jungle told me once:</P>
      <I>
      <P>- We don&#39;t need to shoot the Communists. They are fellow Thais. When I 
      meet them coming down from the mountains or going to the village for 
      supplies, and we all know who they are, I just show them my new 
      wristwatch, or let them listen to a Thai song on my new radio then they 
      give up being a Communist</I>.</P>
      <P>That was his experience, and that of his fellow soldiers.</P>
      <P>The Thai Communists began their insurgency so angry with their 
      government that they were ready to give their young lives. But restraint 
      on the part of the government helped to prevent their anger being made 
      worse. Forgiveness, through an amnesty, gave them a sate and honourable 
      way out. Solving the problem, through development, made the poor villagers 
      prosperous. The villagers saw no need to support the Communists anymore: 
      they were content with the government they already had. And the Communists<B>
      </B>themselves began to doubt what they were doing, living with such 
      hardships in the jungle covered mountains.</P>
      <P>One by one they gave up their guns and returned to their family, their 
      village or their university. By the early 1980s, there were hardly any 
      insurgents left, so then the generals of the jungle army, the leaders of 
      the Communists, also gave themselves up. I remember seeing a feature 
      article in the <I>Bangkok Post </I>of a sharp entrepreneur who was taking 
      Thai tourists into the jungle to visit the now abandoned caves from where 
      the Communists once threatened their nation.</P>
      <P>What happened to those leaders of the insurgency? Could the same 
      unconditional offer of amnesty be applied to them? Not quite. They were 
      not punished, nor exiled. Instead, they were offered important positions 
      of responsibility in the Thai government service, in recognition of their 
      leadership qualities, capacity for hard work and concern for their people! 
      What a brilliant gesture. Why waste the resource of such courageous and 
      committed young men?</P>
      <P>This is a true story as I heard if from the soldiers and villagers of 
      northeast Thailand at the time. It is what I saw with my own eyes. Sadly, 
      it has hardly been reported elsewhere.</P>
      <P>At the time of writing this book (2004), two of those former Communist 
      leaders were serving their country as ministers in the Thai National 
      Government.&quot;</P>
      <P>In regards to Communist (Maoist) insurgency, Nepal is 25 years behind 
      Thailand. Therefore, I believe that there is a lesson which Nepal could 
      learn from Thailand to stop the insurgency and bring old Nepal back to 
      &#39;peaceful Nepal&#39;.</P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>Buddha&#39;s solution of present crisis of peace</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>In essence, the whole teaching of the Buddha is a solution to all 
      conflicts because his teachings are aiming to cease conflicts and to 
      achieve peace. However, following are few solutions I would like to bring 
      out here as examples.</P>
      <B>
      <P>1. Economic means: </B>Based on many discourses, it is said that 
      poverty is a root cause of crime. The Buddha points out that <I>if a ruler 
      allows poverty to develop; this will lead to social strife, so that it is 
      his responsibility to avoid this by looking after the poor, and 
      investigating in various sectors of economy.</I> [20] To the extent that 
      economic grievances are factors in a conflict, then, this implies that 
      addressing them can help resolve it.</P>
      <B>
      <P>2. Negotiation and emphasizing the mutual harm of war: </B>The Buddhist 
      way of solving conflict by peaceful means is well indicated in the life 
      story of the Buddha who actually intervened on one occasion to solve a 
      conflict in a peaceful manner. He gave a practical lesson in tolerance in 
      the field of politics. A conflict had arisen between the Sakyas – members 
      of the republic from which he himself came – and the Koliyas over the 
      water of the river Rohini which flowed between their territories. Soldiers 
      from both sides had assembled and a battle was about to begin. The Buddha 
      personally intervened and stopped them by pointing out how foolish it was 
      for them to destroy invaluable lives for a matter so trivial. Then he 
      asked: <I>Why on account of some water of little worth would you destroy 
      the invaluable lives of kings?</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>3. A non violent moral stance: </B>The Buddha always instructs his 
      followers to be true pacifists who live a non violent life. Any monk who 
      uses violent means to solve conflicts is not a true follower of the 
      Buddha. The Buddha says, <I>though thieves and bandits were to cut limb by 
      limb with a double edged saw, even then one who defiles his mind (feels 
      angry about it) is not a follower of my instructions </I>[21]. The Buddha 
      teaches his followers to meet anger with love and not with anger, and to 
      conquer evil with good and not with evil. The Buddha says:</P>
      <I>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Conquer anger with love, conquer evil with good, conquer the stingy 
        by giving, and conquer the liar with truth </I>[22]<I>.</P>
        <P>Though he should conquer a thousand men in the battlefield, yet he, 
        indeed, is the nobler victor who should conquer himself</I> [23].</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Of course, such an approach does not always save lives, and indeed it 
      is said that the Sakya people came to be annihilated when they did not 
      defend themselves against aggressors.</P>
      <B>
      <P>4. Reflections to undermine hatred and develop patience: </B>In other 
      to promote peace in society the Buddha instructs his followers to advance 
      themselves from human to godly behaviour by practicing four &#39;Divine 
      Abidings&#39;: loving kindness, compassion, appreciative gladness and 
      equanimity [24]. These virtues are naturally own by a mother when she 
      deals with her children. Accordingly, the Buddha suggests all of us to 
      develop mother minded mind when it comes to human relationship. Allied to 
      these is the virtue of patience or forbearance. All such values are 
      directly relevant to defusing conflicts, and their practice will make 
      these less likely to occur in the first place.</P>
      <B>
      <P>5. Forbearance and forgiveness: </B>In accordance with the spirit of 
      the above, certain scriptural passages recommend the strength and 
      transformative potency of forbearance and forgiveness. One passage 
      concerns a conflict between the gods <I>(devas) </I>and the power hungry 
      titans <I>(asuras). </I>The story [25] goes: the leader of the gods is 
      cursed by titan leader. When the god leader is not angry, his charioteer 
      asks whether he forbear from fear or weakness? The god leader replies: <I>
      neither, I simply do not wish to bandy words with a fool. </I>Further, he 
      explains that the words of a fool are best stopped by responding to his 
      anger and verbal onslaught by oneself remaining calm, not by harsh 
      measurers. This will not lead to one&#39;s opponent thinking he can take 
      advantage of one&#39;s &#39;weakness&#39;, for forbearing patience <I>(khanti) </I>is 
      a sign of real strength, unlike the deceptive &#39;strength&#39; of a fool:</P>
      <I>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Worse of the two is he who, when reviled, reviles again. He, who does 
        not, when reviled, revile again, wins a twofold victory. He seeks the 
        welfare of both himself and the other, who, having known the anger of 
        another, mindfully maintains his peace</I> [26]<I>.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      </I><B>
      <P>6. Developing amicable view towards others: </B>The Buddha teaches his 
      followers to have religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence with 
      followers of other religions. The story in Sihasutta is a good case in 
      point. When Siha, a chief follower of another faith taught by the 
      Niganthas, declares himself a Buddhist, the Buddha accepts his adherence 
      and allows him to continue giving alms to the Niganthas who come to his 
      house. These are the Buddha&#39;s word: <I>Your family, Siha, has been as a 
      well spring to the Niganthas for a long time. Therefore, you might 
      consider giving alms to the Niganthas who approach you </I>[27]. Based on 
      this teaching it is not difficult for us to understand that why Buddhists 
      can live peacefully with the followers of other religions.</P>
      <P>If one truly follows those teachings he would not only live in harmony, 
      prosperity and happiness but lead a peaceful life. However, out of 
      numerous ancient wisdom of the Buddha if we to solve present crisis I can 
      site few teachings if political leaders either governmental or Maoists 
      could practice it sincerely guarantee peace in Nepal. </P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>Buddha&#39;s Teachings to a Ruler to Achieve Peaceful Society</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>Buddhism and Kingship has a very close connection. Buddha always 
      emphasized monarchies and put in a high esteem. Kingship at the time of 
      the Buddha perhaps had a different nature from the present kingship. King 
      at the time of the Buddha can also simply mean a ruler or leader. A leader 
      of any kind be it a king or a Prime Minister or a Maoist leader who 
      control the lives of people in a country or an organization. Therefore, 
      there are so many teachings which Buddha addressed directly to monarchies 
      and the rulers of the country. Buddha pointed out that one of the causes 
      of lacking peace in the society depends on the ruler of the country. 
      According to the Buddha, the ruler of the country should abide by moral 
      principles and rules which means to cherish the happiness and well-being 
      of the country and its people. The king is specially admonished to observe 
      the Ten Royal Virtues (<I>dasarajadhamma</I>), upon which his kingship is 
      founded. The traditional explanation of these ten virtues is as follows:</P>
      <B>
      <P>1. Dana</B>: He should practise the virtue of charity, generosity and 
      reward. He should not be enslaved by the craving for the attachment to 
      material gains, nor seek them merely for his own pleasure and 
      satisfaction; he should rather seek material gains to help others and to 
      contribute to their welfare.</P>
      <B>
      <P>2. Sila</B>: He should observe the Five Basic Principles of moral 
      conduct (pancasila) to refrain from all physical, verbal and mental 
      impurities.</P>
      <B>
      <P>3. Paricaga</B>: He should practise the virtue of self-sacrifice in 
      order to devote himself for the good of the people, and be willing to 
      sacrifice his personal comforts in the interests of the people, holding 
      that the happiness and welfare of a king lies in those of his subjects and 
      that what is in the interest of the subjects should be also in the 
      interest of a king himself.</P>
      <B>
      <P>4. Ajjava</B>: He should practise the virtue of honesty and integrity, 
      should be free from fear in discharge of his office, should be sincere and 
      faithful in his intentions and should not deceive the public.</P>
      <B>
      <P>5. Maddava</B>: He should practise the virtue of gentleness, politeness 
      and friendliness and be possessed of a genial temperament.</P>
      <B>
      <P>6. Tapa</B>: He should practise the virtue of austerity in habits and 
      lead a simple life, he should not indulge in a life of material luxury, 
      but should be self-controlled and self-disciplined.</P>
      <B>
      <P>7. Akkodha</B>: He should practise the virtue of freedom from hatred, 
      ill-will, enmity, and should bear no grudge against anybody.</P>
      <B>
      <P>8. Ahimsa</B>: He should practise the virtue of non-violence, which 
      means not only that he should harm nobody, but also that he should try to 
      promote peace by avoiding and preventing war or any other undertaking that 
      involves violence.</P>
      <B>
      <P>9. Khanti</B>: He should practise the virtue of patience, forbearance 
      and tolerance, being able to bear hardships, difficulties and insults; and</P>
      <B>
      <P>10. Avirodha</B>: He should practise the virtue of non-opposition; he 
      should not oppose the will and demand of the people, nor should he 
      obstruct any measures that are conducive to the interests and welfare of 
      his people, but he should rule the country in conformity with the will of 
      the people and the principle of righteousness. </P>
      <P>The ruler&#39;s actions are of far-reaching consequence since they affect 
      his own kingship as well as the fortune, fate and destiny of his subjects 
      who are almost entirely dependent upon him; that is, whatever may be his 
      action it affects the whole sphere and environment of the national life, 
      physical as well as mental. Thus, by his exemplary action the king , the 
      leader, influences, for good or bad, for weal or woe, the material as well 
      as the spiritual condition of those who live under his rule, and he thus 
      influences and determines their happiness or misery. </P>
      <P>Buddha states that as the leader, ruler and protector of the people, 
      the king or ruler is entrusted with great responsibilities, the whole 
      kingdom and maintain the righteous order this world; [28] he is deemed 
      responsible, directly or indirectly, for all the bad or good things of his 
      subjects. Everything in his country is right if the ruler is righteous: 
      the shortage of rainfall and crops, dangers from famine, pestilence, 
      disease, war, and even from evil spirit that overcome the people – all 
      these are thought to be caused by the king&#39;s fault, and the people would 
      complain and suspect that he does not longer practise his royal virtues 
      and is not righteous in ruling the kingdom. [29]</P>
      <P>In addition to above principles, there are other moral principles 
      pertaining to governmental affairs. To restore the peace it is necessary 
      for the governmental leaders to study and practice these principle taught 
      by the Buddha himself. Perhaps the ancient wisdom of the Buddha who was 
      nurtured through Nepalese soil can solve the current Nepalese problems.

      like without this bloody fights, terrorism or civil war, we need only to 
      study the nations which have abolished their military or reduced this 
      element to merely a token. Among such countries we have Costa Rica, Malta, 
      Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, 
      Iceland, Liechtenstein, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Germany 
      among the few others. When such nations relied on the military for their 
      national safety and security, their people were very miserable. Poverty 
      was rampant. Many suffered from hunger while many others slept in the 
      streets like strayed animals.</P>
      <P>Throughout the history the military industrial complex has proved 
      itself to be more of a curse than a blessing. Due to this reality, in 
      quite a few countries like the United States, the weapons industrial 
      complex owns the major new media – radio, press, and television – as to 
      indoctrinate people with &quot;good&quot; news about the military industrial 
      complex. In brief, the weapons industry is depicted as angel sent from 
      heaven to keep the nation safe and secure! </P>
      <P>Professor Charles Mercieca, President of International Association of 
      Educators for World Peace interestingly states some of the advantages of a 
      world without the military industrial complex, of a world without weapons 
      or where the existence of such elements become noticeably insignificant. 
      We need to keep in mind that billions of dollars which are being wasted on 
      such elements of destruction will be then spent for merely positive and 
      constructive purposes, such as the following:</P>
      <I>
      <P>1. Adequate houses for all people</I>: In United States alone there are 
      some 23,000,000 people who are classified as homeless. Such people 
      everywhere are living like strayed animals, totally abandoned by a 
      civilized society, because their government chooses to spend money on 
      weapons for its own people instead of good housing facilities.</P>
      <I>
      <P>2. Complete elimination of hunger</I>: Countless millions of people are 
      starving to death especially in the underdeveloped countries. The 
      developed nations, headed by the United States, takes all the little money 
      these poor nations may have to furnish them with weapons instead of food 
      and adequate nourishment. This reveals human cruelty at its worse.</P>
      <I>
      <P>3. Free education for all children</I>: If we were to reduce military 
      spending in the world by just 50%, every nation will have enough money to 
      provide free education for their children at all levels: elementary, 
      secondary, college and university. Education inspires wisdom to choose 
      properly between alternatives in the best interest of the entire human 
      species without exception.</P>
      <I>
      <P>4. Proper health care for everyone</I>: The weapons industry has 
      polluted our air and water with so much toxic wastes that countless 
      millions are now dying of cancer of some kind. How do government officials 
      dare to tell their people that their nation needs more weapons for 
      national defense and security, when such weapons have become the number 
      one deadly enemy of their own people?</P>
      <I>
      <P>5. Elimination of organized crime</I>: There is hardly one case of an 
      organized crime where money has not been the motive. The weapons industry, 
      as the Center for Defense Information in Washington, DC underlined exist 
      not for the defense of the nation but profit. The manufacture and sales of 
      weapons has now become a part of an international network of organized 
      crime.</P>
      <I>
      <P>6. Respect for every form of life</I>: Since the beginning of times, 
      every religion has advocated respect for every form of life. The weapons 
      industry has constantly demonstrated it has no regard for any kind of life 
      whatsoever. With its lethal toxic wastes it has destroyed countless 
      thousands of species, thus seriously upsetting the balance of our 
      ecological system.</P>
      <I>
      <P>7. More beautification of our cities</I>: Planet earth is our home... 
      the only home we have! It is our sacrosanct duty to keep it healthy and 
      beautiful through the preservation of the rain forests. We also need to 
      get rid of our air and water pollution, grow more trees, and create a 
      spiritual atmosphere in our communities characterized by mutual love and 
      respect.</P>
      <I>
      <P>8. Immediate repair of our streets</I>: If you were to be traveling in 
      Russia, India, and numerous other countries, you may likely find numerous 
      roads that need repair very badly. They have become a hazard to travelers. 
      The government of such nations says there is no money available. However, 
      they do find unlimited money to purchase a never-ending amount of weapons!</P>
      <I>
      <P>9. Preservation of our culture heritage</I>: From the biblical days of 
      Hammurabi to the Persian, Roman, and Ottoman Empires, up to the present 
      day, wars have constantly destroyed our rich cultural heritage. Weapons 
      and wars could be eliminated through the development of mutual love and 
      respect in an ever increasing interdependent world.</P>
      <I>
      <P>10. Creation of global family spirit</I>: Modern technology has brought 
      the world very close together. Hence, we cannot afford tolerating the 
      suffering of even one human being as this would affect the entire human 
      race eventually. Our greatest challenge at this stage of history is to 
      turn enemies into friends. To this end we need patience, determination, 
      firmness, love and perseverance.</P>
      <P>The Buddha says,<I> &#39;Hatred never ceases through hatred. Only through 
      love does it cease. </I>[30]&#39; Similarly, he also says, <I>&#39;Though one many 
      conquer a thousand times a thousand men in battle, yet he indeed is the 
      noblest victor who conquers himself.</I> [31]&#39; In view of this, it is 
      somewhat incomprehensible for our government officials to search for our 
      nation&#39;s enemies outside of themselves. They tell us that we need to 
      increase still the budget for defense because our prospective enemies have 
      the weapons we have and we must make sure ours will be superior. Here we 
      need to raise some legitimate questions: Why do we allow our weapons 
      industry to sell weapons of destruction to every single country on earth, 
      friend and enemy alike? Why does the President of the United States 
      insists with the U.S. ambassadors in every single nation on earth to 
      advertise American merchandise including the various kinds of weapons of 
      destruction?</P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>Instrument Used for Peace</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>When it comes to a collective effort, the solution becomes 
      psychologically different because of the strength which will find when we 
      are united together for a common cause. Here are some organizations which 
      need to feel responsible for the eventual achievement of a permanent peace 
      in the present world context.</P>
      <B>
      <P>1. Religious-Related Organizations</B>: Such organizations need to 
      condemn in the open the violence for the harm it inflicts on our 
      environment, cultural heritage and life of people on the whole. They need 
      to encourage their members not to associate with any kinds of anti-peace 
      activities.</P>
      <B>
      <P>2. Academic Institutions</B>: Our schools, colleges, and universities 
      have the sacrosanct duty to educate for peace. It would not serve any 
      purpose at all to provide our children with knowledge but, at the same 
      time, without the ability to use such knowledge constructively to promote 
      a permanent world peace. </P>
      <B>
      <P>3. Community Groups</B>: It is nice for community groups to discuss the 
      needs of their community relative to the beautification of their town, 
      needed recreational facilities and the educational opportunities for every 
      citizen. But they need to realize that wars never end the war only peace 
      can end war. </P>
      <B>
      <P>4. Students&#39; Confraternities</B>: Unless students become involved right 
      away in dealing with the enemy of their future life, destructive wars, it 
      may be too late afterwards to do anything constructive about it. They 
      should make a resolution not to engage for such a destructive activity and 
      to urge their friends everywhere to do likewise.</P>
      <B>
      <P>5. Prospective Politicians</B>: The politicians of the future are 
      composed of today&#39;s young generation. This generation, composed of boys 
      and girls, of young men and women, should restructure the priorities of 
      the nation relative to the vital needs of the population. They should 
      start planning the to achieve peace of their own nation and of the nations 
      of the whole world.</P>
      <B>
      <P>6. News Media Reporters</B>: Although the news media reporters 
      theoretically exist to be informative and to educate the people, in 
      practice they view their job as position to make a lot of money through 
      the exploitation of people&#39;s emotions. They need to become more 
      conscientious and to realize the great responsibility they have to unmask 
      the dangers of the war, violence and terrorism.</P>
      <B>
      <P>7. Human Rights Advocates</B>: Although all the nations of the world 
      signed the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights, yet there 
      are very few countries which seem to observe all the norms laid down to 
      bring to the attention of the world that the self-benefited destructive 
      activity has become the greatest and most atrocious violator of human 
      rights. Human Rights activists should know that they are not in a position 
      be biased. </P>
      <P>In addition to those activities which promote peace in the present 
      world context it is equally important to reflect upon some of the other 
      facades of peace which are sacrosanct in peacemaking process. They are:</P>
      <B>
      <P>1. Accountability for Peace</B>: The lack of peace is evident in Nepal, 
      and the wounds are fresh and deep in the hearts of those who have lost 
      their loved ones in the war. What would the Maoist say to the mother who 
      has lost her son? What would the government say to the orphan who has lost 
      her whole family? How would the king address his subjects who are 
      suffering? Let us not talk about who is to blame, or who to take revenge 
      on. All sides should take responsibility for the atrocities that have 
      happened and work towards ensuring that they do not happen again. Also, 
      various programs should be introduced to heal the victims of war and 
      violence. </P>
      <B>
      <P>2. Self interest and peace:</B> It is no point to talk about peace if 
      personal interests are sacrosanct. The only thing that should be 
      sacrificed in the name of peace is self-interest, not lives. As long as 
      people are working for their own self-interest, then peace will NOT be 
      achieved. </P>
      <B>
      <P>3. Relationship between Peace and Power</B>: In most cases peace and 
      power are two things closely linked like two facades of a coin. Let us ask 
      who design peace in our societies? Is that man in power or man who is 
      oppressed? Isn&#39;t it that man with a power always exercises his power to 
      defend his own peace without regarding others&#39; means of peace? If it is so 
      when peace can be achievable? What is power hierarchies for, isn&#39;t it to 
      achieve peaceful society? But do power hierarchies gearing up to its 
      objective of peace? Similarly, Why two parties do not come to talk on the 
      same table? It is because they are afraid of losing their grip of power. 
      Dispensability of power is a key element to bring two parties to the same 
      table. This relationship between peace and power can easily be seen 
      amongst any marriage couple. A working marriage means the couple has 
      agreed upon the equal share of power and respects each others&#39; rights by 
      dispensing some of self-interests for the bigger benefits of a union.</P>
      <B>
      <P>4. Peace promoting activities:</B> As peace is only achievable through 
      determination of all members of the society there should be different 
      kinds of peace promoting activities in societies aiming for world peace. 
      For example, in connection to Lumbini we could think of founding a <B>
      &#39;Buddhist Peace Institute&#39;</B> to work towards peace promoting activities 
      which could easily developed into a national institute. In the academic 
      fields, running courses on peace would greatly benefit future generations. 
      In a similar vain, several peace building activities can be introduced to 
      different sectors of the society. </P>
      <B>
      <P>5. Promoting of peace through international initiatives</B>: No one can 
      escape from the effect of globalization these days. Similarly, various 
      projects and programs on developing culture of peace are exercised in many 
      parts of the world perhaps with the help of international organizations. 
      These could be lessons of co-operation to achieve peace in different 
      places. </P>
      <P>In view of what has been stated, will world peace be achievable in the 
      present world context? The answer is in the affirmative only if what has 
      been stated above is properly understood and taken seriously. Peace should 
      be the main aim of all organizations, and it should be achieved through 
      planning and negotiation, not by accident. We need to keep in mind that 
      world peace is not imposed from the outside. Indispensability of peace 
      evolves and develops from the inside of every individual. The root of the 
      seed of peace is found in the human heart which is made possible to 
      develop through a program of peace education, a good health care system, 
      and an adequate education for every human being without exception. For 
      peace to be enduring, it must not be based on any one person&#39;s view of 
      their ideal world. Rather, solutions must be based on facts, not fantasy - 
      history, not propaganda.</P>
      <P>As I observed at the beginning of this paper, &#39;Indispensability of 
      Peace in the Present World Context&#39; is a very big subject, and I hope that 
      by telling you the story of my own and my perceptions about peace have 
      been able to shed at least some light on it. This Buddhist Summit is being 
      held in Lumbini Sacred Garden, and I am addressing you not far from the 
      area where the Buddha was born and gave us unparallel solution to peace to 
      the world. Having said that we should remind of the Buddha&#39;s wisdom how 
      Buddha himself intervened between two neighbouring states – the Koliyas 
      and the Sakyas – who had reached the brink of war over a question of the 
      distribution of water from the Rohini River, not so far away from this 
      very spot. &#39;Blood is thicker and much precious than water,&#39; a simple 
      wisdom of Buddha can stop bloody violence if we truly understand the value 
      of human life. As a result, both states became integrated into peace. 
      Politically, in Nepal at present, we are concerned with a different kind 
      of integration the integration of Democratic government and Maoists. Let 
      us therefore do away with our divisions. Let us do away with the divisions 
      between democrats and Maoists, between oppressor and oppressed, and 
      between the followers of different political ideologies. Let us have an 
      integrated Nepal and an integrated peaceful Nepalese community. Let us 
      base ourselves firmly and unmistakably upon our common aspiration of true 
      happiness, peace, freedom and security among all walks of life. </P>
      <P>One last word. I have spoken on the indispensability of peace in the 
      present world context because that is what I was asked to speak on. But as 
      my paper proceeded it will have become obvious to you that what we really 
      have to do is understand and follow some of the message given by our 
      national hero, the Buddha, to achieve undeniable peace in our lives and 
      how can we develop culture of peace in our present world context. I do 
      hope that the Summit will not only work to find resolutions but it works 
      as reflections of the present world context.</P>
      <P>May this Buddhist Summit be a step in the righteous peaceful direction 
      and may Nepal resume peace as soon as possible.</P>
