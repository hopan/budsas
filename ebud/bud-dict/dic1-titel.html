  <b><u><hr>
  <p ALIGN="left"></u><font face="VU Times" color="#000080">From The Preface To The First Edition</font></p>
  </b>
<p><font face="VU Times">As a first attempt of an authentic dictionary of Buddhist
doctrinal terms, used in the <b>P&#257;&#7735;i</b> Canon and its Commentaries, this present
manual will fill a real gap felt by many students of Buddhism. It provides the
reader not with a mere superficial enumeration of important <b>P&#257;&#7735;i</b> terms and
their English equivalents, but offers him precise and authentic definitions and
explanations of canonical and post-canonical terms and doctrines, based on Sutta,
Abhidhamma and Commentaries, and illustrated by numerous quotations taken from
these sources, so that, if anyone wishes, he could, by intelligently joining
together the different articles, produce without difficulty a complete
exposition of the entire teachings of Buddhism.</font></p>
<p><font face="VU Times">As already pointed out by the author in the preface to his
Guide through the <b>Abhidhamma-pi&#7789;aka</b> (Colombo 1938), there are found in the
Abhidhamma Canon numerous technical terms not met with in the Sutta Canon; and
again other terms are found only in the Commentaries and not in Sutta and
Abhidhamma. The author therefore has made a first attempt - without, however,
laying any claim to absolute reliability or completeness in this by no means
easy undertaking - to indicate in the Appendix all the terms that in the oldest
Sutta texts are either not found at all, or at least not in the same form or
meaning, and to set forth how far these are deviations from the older texts, or
further developments.</font></p>
<p><font face="VU Times">In this connection, the author wishes to state that the often
quoted Pa&#7789;isambhid&#257;-magga, as well as Niddesa, Buddhava&#7747;sa and Cariyapi&#7789;aka,
though included in the Khuddaka Nik&#257;ya of the Sutta Pi&#7789;aka, nevertheless bear
throughout the character of Commentaries, and though apparently older than the
Sutta Commentaries handed down to us in <b>Buddhaghosa</b>'s version, must doubtless
belong to a later period of origin than the Abhidhamma Canon.</font></p>
<p><font face="VU Times">In rendering the terms into English, I often had to differ
considerably from the interpretation of Western scholars, and to introduce quite
new words. A great number of such earlier translations must be considered partly
as totally incorrect, partly as misleading, or at the very least ambiguous.
Incorrect are, for instance, the English renderings of <b> <i>n&#257;ma-r&#363;pa</i></b> by
'name and form'; <b> <i>javana</i></b> (impulsion, i.e. the karmic impulsive moments) by
'apperception', etc.</font></p>
<p><font face="VU Times">The expositions concerning the true nature of the 8-fold
Path, the 4 Noble Truths, the <b> <i>pa&#7789;icca-samupp&#257;da</i></b> and the 5 groups of
existence - doctrines which, with regard to their true nature, have been often
misunderstood by Western authors - are sure to come to many as a revelation.</font></p>
<p><font face="VU Times">On the doctrine of <b> <i>anatt&#257;</i></b>, or 'egolessness', i.e. the
impersonality and emptiness of all phenomena of existence, the author repeatedly
felt the necessity of throwing light from every possible point of view, for it
is exactly this doctrine which, together with the doctrine of the conditionality
of all phenomena of existence, constitutes the very essence of the whole
Teaching of the <b>Buddha</b> without which it will be by no means possible to
understand it in its true light. Thus the doctrine of impersonality runs like a
red thread right through the whole book.</font></p>
<p><font face="VU Times">May this little manual provide an ever-helpful companion and
<b> <i>vade mecu&#7747;</i></b> to all earnest students in their study of the original Buddhist
scriptures, and also give to Buddhist authors and lecturers the opportunity of
supplementing and deepening their knowledge of the profound teachings of the
<b>Buddha</b>!</font></p>
<p><font face="VU Times">Should it, for a better understanding, prove necessary to
give to certain subjects a more detailed treatment, the carrying out of this
task may be reserved for a later edition of this work.</font></p>

  <b><u><hr>
  <p ALIGN="left"></u><font face="VU Times" color="#000080">Editor's Preface To The Third Edition</font></b></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="VU Times">The present revised and enlarged Third Edition was intended
to be issued in commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the venerable author's
passing away on 28th May 1957. But due to unavoidable circumstances the
publication had to be delayed.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="VU Times">It was the venerable author's wish to enlarge the first
edition of this work, but when a second edition became necessary, he was
prevented from expanding it by the illness to which he later succumbed. It
rested, therefore, with his pupil, the present editor, to make, within the
original scope and character of the work, such additions and revisions as seemed
useful.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="VU Times">Over seventy articles have been expanded and partly
rewritten; others were slightly revised; more source references were included,
and information on literature for further study of the respective subjects was
added to some of the articles. But only very few new words have been added (e.g.
<b>
<i>anupassan&#257;, &#257;nupubbi-kath&#257;</i></b>, etc.). This restriction was observed
because the venerable author himself thought only of 'a more detailed treatment'
of existing articles (see Preface to the 1st ed.) as he obviously wished to
preserve the original form and character of the book. It was also considered
that the adding of more words such as those coined in later commentarial and
Abhidhammic literature, would be superfluous as in the English language such
terms will generally be found only in a few scholarly books and translations
which themselves give the explanations needed.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="VU Times">This book is chiefly intended for those who study the
Buddhist teachings through the medium of the English language, but wish to
familiarize themselves with some of the original <b>P&#257;&#7735;i</b> terms of doctrinal
import. They are in the same position as a student of philosophy or science who
has to know the terminology of his field, which for common parlance is mostly
not less 'unfamiliar' than are the words of the <b>P&#257;&#7735;i</b> language found in the
Dictionary.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="VU Times">Such acquaintance with the <b>P&#257;&#7735;i</b> terms of the original texts
will also be useful to the student for the purpose of identifying the various
renderings of them favored by different translators. It is deplorable that there
is a considerable multiplication of new English coining for the same doctrinal
term. This great variety of renderings has proved to be confusing to those
students of Buddhism who are not familiar with the <b>P&#257;&#7735;i</b> language. Even at this
late stage when many translations of <b>P&#257;&#7735;i</b> texts are in print, it will be
desirable if, for the sake of uniformity, translators forgo their preference for
their own coining, even if they think them better than others. In any case,
doctrinal terms have to be known by definition, just as in the case of
philosophical and technical terms in a Western language.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="VU Times">As a small help in the situation described, a number of
alternative renderings used by other translators have been included in some
articles of this edition. In a very few cases, unacceptable though familiar
renderings have been bracketed. The Venerable Nyanatiloka's own preferences have
been placed in inverted commas. Generally it may be said that his renderings,
based on his comprehensive knowledge of texts and doctrine, are very sound and
adequate. Only in a very few cases has the editor changed the author's preferred
rendering e.g. 'canker' for <b> <i>&#257;sava</i></b> (instead of 'bias'), 'right view' for
<b> <i>samm&#257;-di&#7789;&#7789;hi</i></b>
(instead of 'right understanding'). The latter change was made for the sake of
economizing with the few English equivalents for the numerous <b>P&#257;&#7735;i</b> synonyms for
'knowing', etc.; and also to avoid having to render the opposite term, <b> <i>micch&#257;-di&#7789;&#7789;hi</i></b>,
by 'wrong understanding'.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="VU Times">This Dictionary appeared also in the author's own German
version (published by Verlag Christiani, Konstanz, Germany) and in a French
translation made by the late Mme Suzanne Karpeles (published by 'Adyar', Paris,
1961).</font></p>
