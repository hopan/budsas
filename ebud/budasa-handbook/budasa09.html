    meditation is mental training aimed at raising the mind to such a level that it is no
    longer subject to suffering. The mind breaks free from suffering by virtue of the clear
    knowledge that nothing is worth grasping at or clinging to. This knowledge deprives
    worldly things of their ability to lead the mind into further thoughtless liking or
    disliking. Having this knowledge, the mind transcends the worldly condition and attains
    the level known as the Supramundane Plane (Lokuttara-bhumi).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to comprehend clearly the supramundane plane, we
    have to know first about its opposite, the mundane plane (Lokiyabhumi). The mundane plane
    comprises those levels at which the things of the world have control over the mind. Very
    briefly, three levels are recognized in the mundane plane, namely: the sensual level
    (Kamavacara-bhumi), or the level of a mind still content with pleasures of every kind; the
    level of forms (Rupavacara-bhumi), the condition of a mind uninterested in sensual
    objects, but finding satisfaction in the various stages of concentration on forms as
    objects; and lastly the formless level (Arupavacara-bhumi), the yet higher level of a mind
    finding satisfaction in the bliss and peace of concentration on objects other than forms.
    These three levels in the worldly plane are the mental levels of beings in general.
    Regardless of whether we presume to call them human beings, celestial beings, gods,
    beasts, or denizens of hell, they are all included within the three worldly levels. The
    mind of a worldling can at any particular time exist in any one of these three. It is not
    impossible. It is quite normal. As a rule, though, it will tend to fall back naturally to
    the unconcentrated sensual level; the human mind normally falls under the influence of the
    delightful in colors and shapes, sounds, odors, tastes and tactile objects. Only on
    certain occasions is it able to escape from the influence of these seductive things and
    experience the tranquillity and bliss which comes from practicing concentration on forms
    or other objects. It all depends on concentration. At certain times, then, a person's mind
    may be located in any of these levels of concentration. In India at the time of the Buddha
    this must have been fairly common, because people who had gone in search of the
    tranquillity and bliss associated with the various levels of concentration were to be
    found living in forests all over the country. At the present time such people are few, but
    it is nevertheless possible for the ordinary man to attain these levels. If someone in
    this world is in the process of experiencing the bliss of full concentration on a form,
    then for him &quot;the world&quot; consists of just that form, because he is aware of
    nothing else. At that time and for that person, &quot;the world&quot; is equivalent to
    just that one form, and it remains so until such time as his mental condition changes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even though a person dwelling in any of these three levels
    may have gained such bliss and calm tranquillity that he has come to resemble a rock, a
    lump of earth, or a log of wood, yet grasping and clinging to selfhood are still present.
    Also present are various kinds of desire, albeit of the finest and most tenuous sort, such
    as dissatisfaction with the state in which he finds himself, which prompts him to go in
    search of a new state. That desire for change constitutes karma, so such a person has not
    yet transcended the worldly state. He is not yet in the supramundane plane. A mind
    dwelling in the supramundane plane has transcended the world. It views the worldly state
    as devoid of essence, self, or substance, and will have nothing of it. Dwellers in this
    supramundane plane can be further classified into grades. There are four levels of Path
    and Fruit, namely the levels of the Stream - enterer (Sotapanna), the Once -
    returner(Skidagami), the Never - returner (Anagami), and the completely Perfected
    individual or Arahant. The condition of these four kinds of noble individuals or Aryians
    is the supramundane condition. &quot;Supramundane&quot; means &quot;above the world,&quot;
    and refers to the mind, not the body. The body can be anywhere at all as long as living
    conditions are adequate. &quot;Supramundane&quot; simply describes a mind dwelling above
    the world. As for the nether worlds such as hell, purgatory, or the places of suffering,
    torment and bondage, these are out of the question for the Aryians.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The criteria for recognizing these four levels in the
    supramundane plane are the various mental impurities which are in the course of being
    eliminated. The Buddha divided the impurities in this group into ten kinds. He called them
    the Fetters (Samyojana). These ten fetters bind man and all beings to the world, keeping
    people in the mundane plane. If a person starts to cut through these fetters and break
    loose, his mind gradually and progressively becomes freed from the worldly condition; and
    when he manages to cut through them completely, his mind becomes completely free,
    transcends the world for good and comes to dwell permanently in the supramundane plane.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of these ten kinds of subtle mental impurities that bind
    us, the first is the Self belief (Sakkaya-ditthi), the view that the body and mind is
    &quot;my self.&quot; It is a misunderstanding or misconception based on clinging to the
    idea &quot;I am.&quot; Because the average person is not aware of the true nature of the
    body and the mind, he unthinkingly regards these two as his &quot;self.&quot; He assumes
    that body and mind is his &quot;self,&quot; his &quot;I.&quot; This instinctive idea that
    there is an &quot;I&quot; and a &quot;mine&quot; is so firmly ingrained that normally
    nobody ever doubts their existence. True, the self instinct is what makes life possible,
    being the basis of self preservation, the search for food and propagation of the species,
    but in this case, what we are calling the self belief is to be taken only in its most
    basic sense as the root cause of selfishness. This is considered to be the first of the
    fetters, to be done away with before anything else.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second fetter is Doubt (Vicikiccha), the cause of
    wavering and uncertainty. Most importantly it is doubt concerning the practice leading to
    liberation from suffering-doubt due to inadequate knowledge, doubt as to what this subject
    is really all about, doubt as to whether this practice for breaking free from suffering is
    really the right thing for one, whether one is really capable of carrying it through,
    whether it is really better than other things, whether or not it really does any good,
    whether the Buddha really did attain enlightenment, whether he really did achieve
    liberation from suffering, whether the Buddha's teaching and the practical method based on
    his teaching really do lead to liberation from suffering, whether it is really possible
    for a bhikkhu in the Sangha to attain liberation from suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The root cause of hesitancy is ignorance. A fish that has
    always lived in the water, if told about life on dry land, would be sure to believe none
    of it, or at most only half of it. We, immersed as we are in sensuality, are as habituated
    to sensuality as is the fish to water, so that when someone speaks of transcending
    sensuality, transcending the world, we can't under stand. And that which we can understand
    to some extent we are hesitant about. It is natural for us to think on this lower level;
    to think on the high level produces a new picture. The conflict between the high level
    thinking and the low level thinking is what constitutes wavering. If mental energy is
    insufficient, the low level thinking will triumph. Doubt and wavering with regard to
    goodness is something chronically present in everyone right from birth. In a person who
    has been brought up wrongly, it may be a very common complaint. We have to introspect and
    note the bad consequences of this wavering, which is present to such an extent in our work
    and our everyday living that we become skeptical about goodness, truth and liberation from
    suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third fetter is Superstition (<i>Silabbatapraramasa</i>)
    or attachment to rules and rituals based on a misunderstanding</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">of their real purpose. Essentially it is a misguided
    attachment to certain things one does. Usually it has to do with doctrines and ceremonies.
    An example of this is belief in magic and magical practices, which is blatantly just
    superstition and occurs even among Buddhists. Practice based on the belief that it will
    produce magical abilities, psychic powers and protective forces is founded on false hopes
    and is irrational. Another example is the undertaking of moral precepts (Five Precepts,
    etc.) or virtuous conduct. The real purpose of this is to eliminate mental defilements;
    but if we believe that it will give rise to miraculous powers which we shall then be able
    to use to eradicate the defilements, we are in fact grasping and clinging, and so
    defeating our original purpose. The practice is quite correct in itself, but if we
    misunderstand it and cling to it irrationally, regarding it as something magical or
    sacred, then it becomes pure superstition. Even taking upon oneself the moral precepts, if
    done in the belief that it will lead to rebirth as a celestial being, is without a doubt
    an example of attachment to rules and rituals and goes contrary to Buddhist aims. Such
    beliefs contaminate otherwise virtuous conduct. The objective of the Buddhist discipline
    is the elimination of the cruder defilements of body and speech as a foundation for the
    progressive development of concentration and insight. The objective is not rebirth in
    heaven. To have such false motives is to soil and contaminate one's own morals with
    grasping and clinging, with false ideas. Charity, or adherence to moral precepts, or
    meditation practice, if carried out with a mistaken idea of their true objective.
    inevitably will stray from the Buddhist path. Do understand that even Buddhist practice
    associated with misunderstanding because craving has come in and taken over, bringing the
    expectation of mystical powers, becomes superstition instead. This applies to even the
    very small and trivial things that most of us like to indulge in, such as ritual chanting,
    merit making and the like. The ceremony of placing rice and trays of sweets before the
    Buddha's image, if performed in the belief that it is an offering to the Buddha's
    &quot;spirit&quot; and that he will be able to partake of it, is 100 percent certain to
    produce effects precisely the opposite of what the devotee is hoping for. Behavior that
    defeats its own true purpose is generally quite common in Buddhist circles. It is foolish
    and irrational and results in practices originally worthwhile and attractive becoming
    contaminated with the stupidity and ignorance of the people performing them. This is what
    is meant by superstition. As we can see, this defilement has its origins in delusion and
    misunderstanding. Most of us have our own ingrown beliefs in mystical powers as a result
    of having been misinformed and led astray by others. We need not go into any more detail
    here; but though it may be rather disturbing, everyone ought to do some critical
    self-examination along these lines.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When these first three defilements, namely self belief,
    doubt and superstition, have been completely given up, one is said to have attained the
    lowest level in the supramundane plane, that is, to have become a Stream enterer. To give
    up completely these three defilements is not difficult at all, because they are just
    primitive qualities possessed by primitive, under-developed people. In anyone who has
    studied well and made progress, these three elements should not be present; and if they
    are, then that person's mind should be considered still primitive. Anyone ought to be able
    to give up these three defilements and become an Aryian. If he can't he is still a foolish
    and deluded person, or, to use the best term, a worldling (Puthujjana), someone with a
    thick blindfold covering the eye of insight . When any individual has managed to give up
    these defilements, his mind is freed from bondage to the world. These three are ignorance
    and delusion obscuring the truth and are fetters binding the mind to the world. Giving
    them up is like rendering ineffective three kinds of bondage or three blind folds, then
    slipping free and rising above and beyond the world, into the first supramundane level.
    This is what it is to become an Aryian of the first degree, to attain the first level in
    the supramundane plane. Such an individual is called a &quot;Stream - enterer,&quot; one
    who has attained for the first time the Stream that flows on to Nirvana. In other words an
    individual at this stage is certain to attain Nirvana at some time in the future. What he
    has attained is only the Stream of Nirvana, not Nirvana itself. This Stream is a course
    that flows right on to Nirvana, inclining towards Nirvana just as the water-course of a
    river slopes down towards the sea. Though it may still take some time, a mind which has
    once entered the Stream is certain to achieve Nirvana eventually. Attaining the second
    level in the supramundane plane implies giving up the three fetters just mentioned, and
    further, being able to attenuate certain types of craving, aversion and delusion to such a
    degree that the mind becomes elevated and only very feebly attached to sensuality. It is
    traditionally held that an individual who achieves this level will return to this world at
    most only once more, hence he is known as a &quot;Once - returner.&quot; A Once - returner
    is closer to Nirvana than a Stream - enterer, there remaining in him no more than a trace
    of worldliness. Should he return to the sensual human world, he will do so not more than
    once, because craving, aversion and delusion, though not completely eliminated, have
    become exceedingly attenuated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third stage is that of the Never - returner. This
    grade of Aryian, besides having succeeded in giving up the defilements to the extent
    necessary for becoming a Once - returner, has also managed to give up the fourth and fifth
    fetters. The Fourth fetter is sensual desire and the fifth is ill will. Neither the Stream
    - enterer nor the Once - returner has completely given up sensual desire. In both of them
    there is still a remnant of satisfaction in alluring and desirable objects. Even though
    they have managed to give up self belief, doubt and superstition, they are still unable to
    relinquish completely their attachment to sensuality of which some traces remain. But an
    Aryian at the third stage, a Never - returner, has succeeded in giving it up completely,
    so that not a trace remains. The defilement called ill will, which includes all feelings
    of anger or resentment, has been washed out to a large extent by the Once - returner so
    that there remains only a trace of ill humor to obstruct his mind; but the Never -
    returner has got rid of it altogether. Thus the Never - returner has thrown off both
    sensual desire and ill will.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This sensual desire or attachment to and satisfaction in
    sensuality was explained adequately in the section on sensual attachment. It is a chronic
    defilement, firmly fixed in the mind as if it were a very part of it, of the same
    substance. For the ordinary man, it is hard to understand and hard to eradicate. Anything
    at all can serve as an object for desire: colors and shapes, sounds, odors, tastes and
    tactile objects of any sort, kind and description. These are sensual objects (Kama), and
    the state of mental attachment which takes the form of satisfaction in these desirable
    objects is sensual desire (Kama - raga). What we call ill will is the reaction of a mind
    that feels dissatisfaction. If there is satisfaction, there is sensual desire; if
    dissatisfaction, ill will. Most people's minds are subject to these two states. There may
    arise ill will towards even inanimate objects, and what is more, one can even be
    dissatisfied with the things one has produced oneself, the things that arise in one's own
    mind. Where there is actual hatred and anger towards an object, ill will has become too
    fierce. An Aryian at a stage below the Non - returnee has given it up to a degree
    appropriate to his station. The ill will that remains for the third grade of Aryian to
    relinquish is just a mental reaction so subtle that possibly no outward evidence of it
    appears. It is an inner perturbation not revealed by any facial expression, yet present
    inwardly as dissatisfaction, as irritation or annoyance at some person or thing that does
    not conform to expectation. Imagine a person completely devoid of every form of ill will:
    consider what a very exceptional individual he would be, and how worthy of respect. The
    five defilements we have just been discussing were grouped together by the Buddha as the
    first to be given up. Self belief, doubt, superstition, sensual desire and ill will have
    all been given up by an Aryian at the third level. Because there remains no sensual
    desire, this grade of Aryian never again returns to the sensual state of existence. This
    is why he gets the name &quot;Never - returner,&quot; one who will never come back. For
    him there is only movement forward and upward to Arahantship and Nirvana, in a state
    having nothing to do with sensuality, a supreme, divine condition. As for the five
    remaining defilements, these only the Arahant, the fourth grade of Aryian, succeeds in
    relinquishing completely.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next defilement, the sixth of the fetters, is desire
    for the bliss associated with the various stages of concentration on forms (rupa - raga).
    The first three grades of Aryian are still not capable of giving up attachment to the
    bliss and tranquillity obtainable by concentrating deeply on forms, but they will succeed
    in doing so when they move up to the last stage, that of the Arahant. The fully
    concentrated state has a captivating flavor, which can be described as a foretaste of
    Nirvana. Though it differs from real Nirvana, it has more or less the same flavor. While
    one is fully concentrated, the defilements are dormant; but they have not evaporated away
    entirely, and will reappear as soon as concentration is lost. As long as they are dormant,
    however, the mind is empty, clear, free, and knows the flavor of real Nirvana.
    Consequently this state can also become a cause of attachment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The seventh subtle defilement is desire for the bliss
    associated with full concentration on objects other than forms (arupa - raga). It
    resembles the sixth fetter, but is one degree more subtle and attenuated. Concentration on
    an object such as space or emptiness yields a tranquillity and quiescence more profound
    than concentration on a form, with the result that one becomes attached to that state. No
    Arahant could ever become fascinated by any state of pleasant feeling whatsoever,
    regardless of where it originated, because an Arahant is automatically aware of the
    impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and nonselfhood of every state of feeling. Other hermits
    and mystics practicing concentration in the forest do not perceive the hidden danger in
    these blissful states and so become fascinated by and attached to the flavor of them just
    as immature people become attached to the flavor of sensual objects. For this reason the
    Buddha used the same word &quot;desire&quot; for both cases. If you think this subject
    over and really come to understand it, you will be full of admiration and respect for
    these individuals called Aryians. The eighth fetter binding a man to the world is
    awareness of superiority or inferiority (mana). It is the delusion of having this or that
    status relative to another. It consists in the thought: &quot;I am not as good as he is. I
    am just as good as he is. I am better or higher than he is.&quot; Thinking &quot;I am not
    as good as...,&quot; one feels inferior; thinking &quot;I am better than...,&quot; one
    feels puffed up; and thinking &quot;I am just as good as...,&quot; one thinks along
    competitive lines or in terms of getting ahead of the other fellow. It is not pride or
    conceit. Not to think automatically of oneself as better or worse than the other fellow in
    this fashion is bound to be very difficult. The placing of this defilement as number eight
    is probably meant to indicate that it is hard to give up and so belongs near the end of
    the list. Only the highest grade of Aryian can relinquish it. The likes of us naturally
    can't give it up. This idea that one is better than, or on a par with, or not as good as
    the other fellow, comes from a certain kind of attachment. As long as the mind is still
    involved in good and bad, the awareness of inferiority, superiority, or equality with
    respect to others remains to disturb it; but when it has completely transcended good and
    bad, such ideas cannot exist. As long as such ideas do remain, real bliss and tranquillity
    are lacking.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ninth fetter is Agitation (Uddhacca), that is, mental
    unrest, distraction, lack of peace and quiet. This is the feeling of agitation that arises
    when something interesting comes by. We all have certain chronic wishes, particularly a
    desire to get, to be, not to get, or not to be, one thing or another. When something comes
    by, via the eye, ear, nose, tongue, or body, which fits in with one of our tendencies,
    there is likely to come about the mental reaction, pro or con, which we call interest. If
    we see something new and strange, wavering and curiosity are bound to arise, because there
    are still things that we want and things that we fear and mistrust. So the mind cannot
    resist, it has to be interested in the various things that come by- at least that is how
    it is with an ordinary person. If the object in question happens to coincide with a desire
    of his, he finds it hard to resist. He is likely to become interested to the point of
    becoming involved, pleased to the point of forgetting himself. If it is an undesirable
    object, the mind becomes depressed so that his gratification comes to an end. This is the
    nature of Agitation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first three grades of Aryian still have curiosity and
    inquisitiveness about things, but the Arahant has none at all. His mind has abolished all
    desire for anything whatsoever: it has abolished fear and hatred, worry and anxiety,
    mistrust and doubt, and all desire to know about and see things. His mind is free. Nothing
    can provoke or lure him, and arouse inquisitiveness or curiosity, simply because he has
    abolished partiality. It should be realized that the existence or arising of agitation in
    any situation is a consequence of some form of desire, even including the desire for
    knowledge. When desire has been done away with through realizing the impermanence,
    worthlessness and nonselfhood of all things, nothing is any longer seen as worth getting
    or being, and so there is no curiosity about anything. If a bolt of lightning were to
    strike right beside an Arahant, he would not be interested, because he has no fear of
    death, or craving for continued existence, or anything of that sort. Even if something
    dangerous came along, or if something brand new were discovered in the world, he would
    know no inquisitiveness or curiosity, because such things have no significance for him. He
    has no wish to know about anything from the point of view of what it may have to offer
    him. Because there is nothing that he longs for, he has no curiosity of any kind, and his
    mind has a purity, a tranquillity such as we ordinary folk have never attained.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The tenth and last defilement is Ignorance. This covers
    every kind of defilement not yet mentioned. The word &quot;ignorance&quot; refers to a
    condition of lack of knowledge, and in this case &quot;knowledge&quot; means real
    knowledge, correct knowledge. Naturally no creature can exist without having some
    knowledge, but if that knowledge is false, it has the same value as no knowledge. Most
    people suffer from chronic ignorance or false knowledge; most of us are benighted. The
    most important questions for human beings are those that ask: &quot;What is suffering,
    really?,&quot; &quot;What is the real cause of the arising of suffering?,&quot; &quot;What
    is real freedom from suffering?&quot; and &quot;What is the real way to attain freedom
    from suffering?&quot; If some individual has real knowledge, if he is free of ignorance,
    he is reckoned as enlightened. The totality of human knowledge is of untold extent, but
    the Buddha classed most of it as not essential. The Buddha's enlightenment encompassed
    only what need be known. The Buddha knew all that need be known. The word
    &quot;omniscient&quot; or &quot;all - knowing&quot; means knowing just as much as need be
    known: it does not include anything non-essential.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ignorance causes people to misidentify suffering as
    pleasure, to such an extent that they just swim around in circles in a sea of suffering.
    It also causes them to misidentify the cause of suffering, so that they go blaming the
    wrong things, spirits, celestial beings, or anything at all as the cause of their pain and
    misfortune, instead of rectifying the situation by the right means. The making of vows to
    these spirits and celestial beings is a manifestation of the lowest level of ignorance
    regarding the complete elimination of suffering by means of eliminating the craving which
    is its direct cause. The mistaken assumption that the bliss and tranquillity or
    unawareness brought about by deep concentration is the complete extinction of suffering
    was common in the Buddha's time, and is still promoted in the present day. Certain schools
    of thought have even come to regard sensuality as an instrument for extinguishing
    suffering, so that sects with shameful, obscene practices have arisen right in the
    temples. They firmly believe that sensuality is something quite essential, a kind of vital
    nourishment. Not content with just the four necessities of life, namely food, clothing,
    shelter and medicine, they add an extra one, sensuality, making five necessities. A person
    ignorant about the Path that leads to the extinction of suffering is liable to act
    foolishly and be motivated by his own desires, for instance naively relying on physical
    things, or on spirits and celestial beings, just as if he had no religion at all. Such a
    person, though he may be a Buddhist by birth, is able to go to such foolish lengths simply
    because the power of ignorance prevents his being content with extinguishing suffering by
    way of the Noble Eightfold Path. Instead he goes about extinguishing suffering by lighting
    incense and candles, and making pledges to supposedly supernatural things.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every normal person wishes to gain knowledge; but if the
    &quot;knowledge&quot; he gains is false, then the more he &quot;knows,&quot;' the more
    deluded he becomes. Thus more kinds of knowledge can blind the eyes. We have to be careful
    with this word &quot;enlightenment.&quot; The &quot;Light&quot; may be the glare of
    ignorance, which blinds and deludes the eye and gives rise to overconfidence. Blinded by
    the glare of ignorance, we are unable to think straight and so are in no position to
    defeat suffering. We waste our time with trivialities, nonessential things unworthy of our
    respect. We become infatuated with sensuality, taking it to be something excellent and
    essential for human beings, something which every man ought to get his share of before he
    dies, and making the excuse that we are doing it for the sake of some quite different
    ideal. The hope for rebirth in heaven is founded on sensuality. Attachment to anything
    whatsoever, particularly sensuality comes about because ignorance has enveloped the mind
    cutting off all means of escape. At several places in the Texts, ignorance is compared to
    a thick shell covering the whole world and preventing people from seeing the real light.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha placed ignorance last in the list of the ten
    fetters. When a person becomes an Arahant, the highest grade of Aryian, he completely
    eliminates the five remaining fetters or defilements. He eliminates desire for forms,
    desire for objects other than forms, status consciousness, agitation and ignorance. The
    four kinds of Aryian, Stream - enterer, Once - returner, Never - returner and Arahant,
    dwell in the Supra mundane plane. The Supramundane can be recognized as having nine
    aspects. The condition of the Stream - enterer while he is in the process of cutting out
    the defilements is called the Path of Stream entry, and that when he has succeeded in
    cutting them out is called the Fruit of Stream entry. Likewise there are the following
    pairs: Path and Fruit of Once returning, Path and Fruit of Never returning and Path and
    Fruit of Arahantship, in all four pairs. These together with Nirvana make up the nine
    aspects of the Supramundane. For an individual in the supramundane plane, suffering is
    diminished in accordance with his status until ultimately he is completely free of it.
    When a person once succeeds in attaining unobscured and perfect insight into the true
    nature of things so that he is able to stop desiring anything whatsoever, he has attained
    the supramundane plane, his mind has transcended the worldly condition. And when he has
    completely and utterly relinquished all the mental defilements, his mind is rendered
    permanently free of all those worldly things which formerly it liked and disliked.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nirvana is a condition not in any way comparable to any
    other. It is unlike any worldly condition. In fact, it is the very negation of the worldly
    condition. Given all the characteristics of the worldly condition, of phenomenal
    existence, the result of completely canceling out all those characteristics is Nirvana.
    That is to say, Nirvana is that which is in every respect precisely the opposite of the
    worldly condition. Nirvana neither creates nor is created, being the cessation of all
    creating. Speaking in terms of benefits, Nirvana is complete freedom from hellfire,
    scourging, torture, bondage, subjection and thralldom, because the attainment of Nirvana
    presupposes the complete elimination of the defilements, which are the cause of all
    unsatisfactory mental states. Nirvana lies beyond the limitations of space and time. It is
    unique, unlike anything in the world. Rather it is the extinction of the worldly
    condition. Speaking metaphorically, the Buddha called it the realm where all conditional
    things cease to be (Sankhara - samatho). Hence it is the condition of freedom, of freedom
    from fetters. It is the end of torment and buffeting, stabbing and chafing, from any
    source whatsoever. This is the nature of the Supramundane, the ultimate. It is the
    Buddhist goal and destination. It is the final fruit of Buddhist practice. In the
    foregoing pages we have explained systematically the principles of Buddhism. We have
    presented it as an organized practical system designed to bring knowledge of the true
    nature of things. In reality things are impermanent, unsatisfactory and not selves; but
    all creatures are attracted by things and become attached to them simply through
    misunderstanding. The Buddhist practice, based on Morality (Sila), Concentration
    (Samadhi), and Insight (Panna), is a tool to be used for completely cutting out grasping
    and clinging. The objects of our clinging are the five aggregates: body, feeling,
    perception, active thinking and consciousness. When we have come to know the true nature
    of the five aggregates, we understand all things so well that desire gives way to
    disenchantment, and we no longer cling to any of them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What we have to do is lead the kind of life described as
    Right Living (Samma Vihareyyum), and be full day and night with the joy that arises out of
    conduct that is consistently good, beautiful and right. This limits aimless wandering of
    the thoughts and makes it possible to concentrate and to have clear insight at all times.
    Then if conditions are right, the result is disenchantment, struggle to break loose,
    slipping free, or even complete Nirvana. If we wish to hurry and gain quick results, then
    there is the line of practice called Vipassana, which begins with moral purity and mental
    purity and carries right through to perfect and unobscured intuitive insight. By this
    means we can completely cut through the fetters that bind us fast to this world, and
    attain the final Fruit of the Path. This is a brief account of the whole of Buddha-Dhamma
    from beginning to end, including both theoretical and practical principles, and covering
    the entire subject right from the first steps to the final Fruit. The whole story ends
    with Nirvana. As the Buddha said: &quot;All Buddhas recognize Nirvana as the highest
    good.&quot; So it behooves us to practice in order to realize and attain that which should
    be realized and attained. Doing this, we shall deserve to be called Buddhists; we shall
    gain insight and penetrate to the real essence of BuddhaDhamma. If we don't practice
    Buddha-Dhamma, we shall only know about it and shall lack any true insight. It rests with
    each of us to practice introspection, observe and understand his own imperfections, and
    then try to root them out completely. Even if one is only half successful, some clear
    understanding will result. As the defilements are progressively eliminated, their place is
    taken by purity, insight and peace. So I advise and beseech you to approach the subject in
    this fashion. You may then succeed in penetrating to the real Buddha- Dhamma. Don't waste
    the advantages of having been born a human being and having encountered the Buddha's
    teaching. Don't miss this chance to be a perfect human being. </font></p>
