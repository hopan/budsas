    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1956, the Venerable Buddhadasa Bhikkhu gave a series of
    lectures to a group of prospective judges, which were subsequently edited and arranged
    into what became The Handbook for Mankind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since then, the success of this small book has been
    astounding. Well over 100,000 copies have been printed in Thai, and the book still enjoys
    widespread popularity, more than three decades after the original talks. The reason for
    the &quot;Handbook's&quot; duration is clear: that the Venerable Buddhadasa offers fresh
    insights into a timeless Truth (Dhamma), in the direct and simple manner that
    characterizes all his teaching. The clarity of his insight brings the Dhamma to life, so
    that today, a new generation of readers, not yet born at the time of these talks, can find
    meaning in his words.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a guide for newcomers to the Buddha-Dhamma (the Truth
    which the Buddha awakened to and subsequently taught), this book is an invaluable guide.
    In it are contained the essential teachings of Buddhism. The &quot;Handbook&quot; is
    especially useful for those who approach the Buddha's teaching, not as a subject for
    scholarly study, buy as a means to understand and ennoble their lives.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Handbook for Mankind was originally published in
    English by the Sublime Life Mission, buy has long been out of print. With their
    permission, we have reprinted this book, making some corrections where necessary, buy
    leaving the text otherwise intact. Our thanks are due to Mr. Pun Chongprasoed, who first
    put this book together in Thai, and to all the people whose effort has made possible the
    reprinting of this book.</font></p>
    <p><a name="author"></a><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000"><strong>BIOGRAPHY</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhadasa Bhikkhu (Servant of the Buddha) went forth as a
    bhikkhu (Buddhist monk) in 1926, at the age of twenty. After a few years of study in
    Bangkok, which convinced him &quot;purity is not to be found in the big city,&quot; he was
    inspired to live close with nature in order to investigate the Buddha-Dhamma. Thus, he
    established Suan Mokkhabalarama (The Grove of the Power of Liberation) in 1932, near his
    hometown of Pum Riang (now in Chaiya District). At that time, it was the only forest
    Dhamma Center and one of the few places dedicated to vipassana meditation in Southern
    Thailand. Word of Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, his work, and Suan Mokkh spread over the years so
    that they are easily described as &quot;one of the most influential events of Buddhist
    history in Siam.&quot; Here, we can only mention some of the most interesting services he
    has rendered Buddhism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ajahn Buddhadasa worked painstakingly to establish and
    explain the correct and essential principles of what he called &quot;pristine
    Buddhism,&quot; that is, the original realization of the Lord Buddha before it was buried
    under commentaries, ritualism, clerical politics, and the like. His work was based in
    extensive research of the Pali texts (Canon and commentary), especially of the Buddha's
    Discourses (Sutta Pitaka), followed by personal experiment and practice with these
    teachings. Then he taught whatever he could say truly quenches dukkha (dissatisfaction,
    suffering). His goal was to produce a complete set of references for present and future
    research and practice. His approach was always scientific, straight-forward, and
    practical.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although his formal education only went as far as ninth
    grade and beginning Pali studies, he was given five Honorary Doctorates by Thai
    universities. His books, both written and transcribed from talks, fill a room at the
    National Library and influence all serious Thai Buddhists in Siam. Doctoral dissertations
    are still being written about him and his legacy. His books can be found in bookstores
    around the country and are favorites as gifts at cremations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Progressive elements in Thai society, especially the
    young, were inspired by his teaching and selfless example. Since the 1960's, activists and
    thinkers in areas such as education, ecology, social welfare, and rural development have
    drawn upon his teaching and advice. Most of the monks involved in nature conservation and
    community development were inspired by him. He provided the link between the scriptural
    tradition and engaged buddhist practice today.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the founding of Suan Mokkh, he studied all schools
    of Buddhism, as well as the other major religious traditions. This interest was practical
    rather than scholarly. He sought to unite all genuinely religious people in order to work
    together to help, as he put it, &quot;drag humanity out from under the power of
    materialism.&quot; This broadmindedness won him friends and students from around the
    world, including Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His last project was to establish an International Dhamma
    Hermitage. This addition to Suan Mokkh is intended to provide facilities for:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Courses which introduce foreigners to the correct
    understanding of Buddhist principles and practice; <br>
    Meetings among Buddhists from around the world to establish and agree upon the &quot;heart
    of Buddhism&quot;; <br>
    Meetings of leaders from all religions for the sake of making mutual good understanding
    and cooperating to drag the world out from under the tyranny of materialism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He also left instructions for a small monastery in which
    foreign monks may train as Dhamma-duta (Dhamma missionaries). It now functions under the
    name &quot;Daun Kiam&quot; or Suan Atammayatarama. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A similar facility for nuns, Thai and foreign, awaits the
    women who will make it happen. He called it Dhamma-Mata (Dhamma Mothers, those who give
    birth to others through Dhamma). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ajarn Buddhadasa died in 1993 after a series of heart
    attacks and strokes that he kept bouncing back from in order to teach.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The final stroke occured as he was preparing notes for a
    talk to be given on his birthday in two days (27 May). Suan Mokkh carries on in the hearts
    and actions of all those who have been inspired and guided by his example and words. Suan
    Mokkh is not so much a physical place as it is the space of liberation that we all must
    discover in this very life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000"><b>ABOUT THE TRANSLATOR</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rod Bucknell first became seriously interested in Buddhism
    in the mid -1960's, when, during a visit to Thailand, he was introduced to the techniques
    of insight meditation. After spending a year in various Thai meditation centers and
    monasteries, he took ordination as a bhikkhu (monk) under the guidance of Ajahn Pannananda
    of Wat Cholapratan Rangsarit. He soon became interested also in the teachings of Ajahn
    Buddhadasa, and, recognizing their potential value to westerners, began translating some
    of the Ajahn's more important works into English. During the four years he spent in the
    Sangha, he translated altogether six works of varying length, usually in close
    consultation with the Ajahn in order to ensure accuracy in the rendering of key concepts.
    Despite his return to lay life, he maintains a close interest - both scholarly and
    practical - in Ajahn Buddhadasa's teachings, and has published several related articles in
    religious studies journals. He is currently a lecturer in the Department of Studies in
    Religion at the University of Queensland, Australia.</font></p>
