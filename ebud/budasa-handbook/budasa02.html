    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font face="Times New Roman">he word
    &quot;religion&quot; has a broader meaning than the word &quot;morality.&quot; Morality
    has to do with behavior and happiness, and is basically the same the world over. A
    religion is a system of practice of a high order. The ways of practice advocated by the
    various religions differ greatly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Morality made us good people, behaving in accordance with
    the general principles of community life and in such a way as to cause no distress to
    ourselves or others. But though a person may be thoroughly moral, he may still be far from
    free of the suffering attendant on birth, ageing, pain and death, still not free from
    oppression by the mental defilements. Morality stops well short of the elimination of
    craving, aversion and delusion, so cannot do away with suffering. Religion, particularly
    Buddhism, goes much further than this. It aims directly at the complete elimination of the
    defilements, that is, it aims at extinguishing the various kinds of suffering attendant on
    birth, ageing, pain and death. This indicates how religion differs from mere morality, and
    how much further Buddhism goes than the moral systems of the world in general. Having
    understood this, we can now turn our attention to Buddhism itself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is a system designed to bring a technical
    knowledge inseparable from its technique of practice, an organized practical understanding
    of the true nature of things or what is what. If you keep this definition in mind, you
    should have no difficulty understanding Buddhism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Examine yourself and see whether or not you know what is
    what. Even if you know what you are yourself, what life is, what work, duty, livelihood,
    money, possessions, honour and fame are, would you dare to claim that you know everything?
    If we really knew what is what, we would never act inappropriately; and if we always acted
    appropriately, it is a certainty that we would never be subject to suffering. As it is, we
    are ignorant of the true nature of things, so we behave more or less inappropriately, and
    suffering results accordingly. Buddhist practice is designed to teach us how things really
    are. To know this in all clarity is to attain the Fruit of the Path, perhaps even the
    final Fruit, Nirvana, because this very knowledge is what destroys the defilements. When
    we come to know what is what, or the true nature of things, disenchantment with things
    takes the place of fascination, and deliverance from suffering comes about automatically.
    At the moment, we are practising at a stage where we still do not know what things are
    really like, in particular, at the stage of not yet realizing that all things are
    impermanent and not selves. We don't as yet realize that life, all the things that we
    become infatuated with, like, desire and rejoice over, is impermanent, unsatisfactory and
    not self. It is for this reason that we become infatuated with those things, liking them,
    desiring them, rejoicing over them, grasping at them and clinging to them. When, by
    following the Buddhist method, we come to know things aright, to see clearly that they are
    all impermanent, unsatisfactory and not selves, that there is really nothing about things
    that might make it worth attaching our selves to them, then there will immediately come
    about a slipping free from the controlling power of those things.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Essentially the Buddha's teaching as we have it in the
    Tipitaka is nothing but the knowledge of what is what or the true nature of things--just
    that. Do keep to this definition. It is an adequate one and it is well to bear it in mind
    while one is in the course of practising We shall now demonstrate the validity of this
    definition by considering as an example the Four Noble Truths. The First Noble Truth,
    which points out that all things are suffering, tells us precisely what things are like.
    But we fail to realize that all things are a source of suffering and so we desire those
    things. If we recognized them as a source of suffering, not worth desiring, not worth
    grasping at and clinging to, not worth attaching ourselves to, we would be sure not to
    desire them. The Second Noble Truth points out that desire is the cause of suffering.
    People still don't know, don't see, don't understand, that desires are the cause of
    suffering. They all desire this, that and the other, simply because they don't understand
    the nature of desire. The Third Noble Truth points out that deliverance, freedom from
    suffering, Nirvana, consists in the complete extinguishing of desire. People don't realize
    at all that nirvana is something that may be attained at any time or place, that it can be
    arrived at just as soon as desire has been completely extinguished. So, not knowing the
    facts of life, people are not interested in extinguishing desire. They are not interested
    in nirvana because they don't know what it is.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Fourth Noble Truth is called the Path and constitutes
    the method for extinguishing desire. No one understands it as a method for extinguishing
    desire. No one is interested in the desire extinguishing Noble Eightfold Path. People
    don't recognize it as their very point of support, their foothold, something which they
    ought to be most actively reinforcing. They are not interested in the Buddha's Noble Path,
    which happens to be the most excellent and precious things in the entire mass of human
    knowledge, in this world or any other. This is a most horrifying piece of ignorance. We
    can see, then, that the Four Noble Truths are information telling us clearly just what is
    what. We are told that if we play with desire, it will give rise to suffering, and yet we
    insist on playing with it until we are brim full of suffering. This is foolishness. Not
    really knowing what is what or the true nature of things, we act in every way
    inappropriately. Our actions are appropriate all too rarely. They are usually
    &quot;appropriate&quot; only in terms of the values of people subject to craving, who
    would say that if one gets what one wants, the action must have been justified. But
    spiritually speaking, that action is unjustifiable. Now we shall have a look at a stanza
    from the texts which sums up the essence of Buddhism, namely the words spoken by the
    bhikkhu Assaji when he met Sariputta before the latter's ordination. Sariputta asked to be
    told the essence of Buddhism in as few words as possible. Assaji answered: &quot;All
    phenomena that arise do so as a result of causes. The Perfected One has shown what the
    causes are, and also how all phenomena may be brought to an end by eliminating those
    causes. This is what the Great Master teaches.&quot; He said in effect: Every thing has
    causes that combine to produce it. It cannot be eliminated unless those causes have been
    eliminated first. This is a word of guidance warning us not to regard anything as a
    permanent self. There is nothing permanent. There are only effects arising out of causes,
    developing by virtue of causes, and due to cease with the cessation of those causes. All
    phenomena are merely products of causes. The world is just a perpetual flux of natural
    forces incessantly interacting and changing. Buddhism points out to us that all things are
    devoid of any self entity. They are just a perpetual flux of change, which is inherently
    unsatisfactory because of the lack of freedom, the subjection to causality. This
    unsatisfactoriness will be brought to an end as soon as the process stops; and the process
    will stop as soon as the causes are eliminated so that there is no more interacting. This
    is a most profound account of &quot;what is what&quot; or the nature of things, such as
    only an enlightened individual could give. It is the heart of Buddhism. It tells us that
    all things are just appearances and that we should not be fooled into liking or disliking
    them. Rendering the mind truly free involves escaping completely from the causal chain by
    utterly eliminating the causes. In this way, the unsatisfactory condition which results
    from liking and disliking will be brought to an end. Let us now examine the Buddha's
    intention in becoming an ascetic. What motivated him to become a bhikkhu? This is clearly
    indicated in one of his discourses, in which he says that he left home and became a
    bhikkhu in order to answer the question: &quot;What is the Good?&quot; The word
    &quot;good&quot;(Kusala), as used here by the Buddha, refers to skilfulness, to absolutely
    right knowledge. He wanted to know in particular what is suffering, what is the cause of
    suffering, what is freedom from suffering, and what is the method that will lead to
    freedom from suffering. To attain perfect and right knowledge is the ultimate in skill.
    The aim of Buddhism is nothing other this perfection of knowledge of what is what or the
    true nature of things. Another important Buddhist teaching is that of the Three
    Characteristics, namely impermanence (anicca), unsatisfactoriness or suffering (dukkha)
    and non - selfhood (anatta). Not to know this teaching is not to know Buddhism. It points
    out to us that all things are impermanent (anicca), all things are unsatisfactory(dukkha),
    and all things are not selves (anatta). In saying that all things are impermanent we mean
    that things change perpetually, there being no entity or self remains unchanged for even
    an instant. That all things are unsatisfactory means that all things have inherent in them
    the property of conducing to suffering and torment. They are inherently unlikable and
    disenchanting. That they are not selves is to say that in no thing whatsoever is there any
    entity which we might have a right to regard as its &quot;self&quot; or to call
    &quot;mine.&quot; If we grasp at things and cling to things, the result is bound to be
    suffering. Things are more dangerous than fire because we can at least see a fire blazing
    away and so don't go too close to it, whereas all things are a fire we can't see.
    Consequently we go about voluntarily picking up handfuls of fire which is invariably
    painful. This teaching tells us what things are like in terms of the Three
    Characteristics. Clearly Buddhism is simply an organized practical system designed to show
    what is what.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have seen that we have to know the nature of things. We
    also have to know how to practice in order to fit in with the nature of things. There is
    another teaching in the texts, known as the Chief of all Teachings. It consists of three
    brief points: &quot;Avoid evil, do good, purify the mind!&quot; This is the principle of
    the practice. Knowing all things as impermanent, worthless and not our property, and so
    not worth clinging to, not worth becoming infatuated with, we have to act appropriately
    and cautiously with respect to them, and that is to avoid evil. It implies not to break
    with accepted moral standards and to give up excessive craving and attachment. On the
    other hand, one is to do good, good as has come to be understood by wise people. These two
    are simply stages in morality. The third, which tells us to make the mind completely pure
    of every kind of contaminating element, is straight Buddhism. It tells us to make the mind
    free. As long as the mind is not yet free from domination by things, it cannot be a clean,
    pure mind. Mental freedom must come from the most profound knowledge of the what is what.
    As long as one lacks this knowledge, one is bound to go on mindlessly liking or disliking
    things in one way or another. As long as one cannot remain unmoved by things, one can
    hardly be called free. Basically we human beings are subject to just two kinds of
    emotional states: liking and disliking (which correspond to pleasant and unpleasant mental
    feeling). We fall slaves to our moods and have no real freedom simply because we don't
    know the true nature of moods or what is what. Liking has the characteristic of seizing on
    things and taking them over; disliking has the characteristic of pushing things away and
    getting rid of them. As long as these two kinds of emotional states exist, the mind is not
    yet free. As long as it is still carelessly liking and disliking this, that the other,
    there is no way it can be purified and freed from the tyranny of things. For this very
    reason, this highest teaching of Buddhism condemns grasping and clinging to things
    attractive and repulsive, ultimately condemning even attachment good and evil. When the
    mind has been purified of these two emotional reactions, it will become independent of
    things.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Other religions would have us simply avoid evil and grasp
    at goodness. They have us grasp at and become attached to goodness, even including the
    epitome of goodness, namely God. Buddhism goes much further, condemning attachment to
    anything at all. This attachment to goodness is right practice at the intermediate level,
    but it just can't take us to the high level no matter what we do. At the lowest level we
    avoid evil, at the intermediate level we do our utmost to do good, while at the highest
    level we make the mind float high above the domination of both good and evil. The
    condition of attachment to the fruits of goodness is not yet complete liberation from
    suffering, because, while an evil person suffers in a way befitting evil persons, a good
    person suffers also, in a way befitting good persons. Being good, one experiences the kind
    of suffering appropriate to good human beings. A good celestial being experiences the
    suffering appropriate to celestial beings, and even a god or Brahma experiences the
    suffering appropriate to gods. But complete freedom from all suffering will come only when
    one has broken free and transcended even that which we call goodness to become an Aryian,
    one who has transcended the worldly condition, and ultimately to become a fully perfected
    individual, an Arahant.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now as we have seen, Buddhism is the teaching of the
    Buddha, the Enlightened One, and a Buddhist is one who practices according to the teaching
    of the Enlightened One. With regard to what was he enlightened? He simply knew the nature
    of all things. Buddhism, then, is the teaching that tells us the truth about what things
    are really like or what is what. It is up to us to practice until we have come to know
    that truth for ourselves. We may be sure that once that perfect knowledge has been
    attained, craving will be completely destroyed by it, because ignorance will cease to be
    in the very same moment that knowledge arises. Every aspect of Buddhist practice is
    designed to bring knowledge. Your whole purpose in setting your mind on the way of
    practice that will penetrate to Buddha-Dhamma is simply to gain knowledge. Only, do let it
    be right knowledge, knowledge attained through clear insight, not worldly knowledge,
    partial knowledge, halfway knowledge, which for example clumsily mistakes bad for good,
    and a source of suffering for a source of happiness. Do try your utmost to look at things
    in terms of suffering, and so come to know, gradually, step by step. Knowledge so gained
    will be Buddhist knowledge based on sound Buddhist principles. Studying by this method,
    even a woodcutter without book learning will be able to penetrate to the essence of
    Buddhism, while a religious scholar with several degrees, who is completely absorbed in
    studying the Tipitaka but doesn't look at things from this point of view, may not
    penetrate the teaching at all. Those of us who have some intelligence should be capable of
    investigating and examining things and coming to know their true nature. Each thing we
    come across we must study, in order to understand clearly its true nature. And we must
    understand the nature and the source of the suffering which produces, and which sets us
    alight and scorches us. To establish mindfulness, to watch and wait, to examine in the
    manner described the suffering that comes to one-- this is very best way to penetrate to
    Buddha-Dhamma. It is infinitely better than learning it from the Tipitaka. Busily studying
    Dhamma in the Tipitaka from the linguistic or literary viewpoint is no way to come to know
    the true nature of things. Of course the Tipitaka is full of explanations as to the nature
    of things; but the trouble is that people listen to it in the manner of parrots or talking
    myna birds, repeating later what they have been able to memorize. They themselves are
    incapable of penetrating to the true nature of things. If instead they would do some
    introspection and discover for themselves the facts of mental life, find out firsthand the
    properties of the mental defilements, of suffering, of nature, in other words of all the
    things in which they are involved, they would then be able to penetrate to the real
    Buddha- Dhamma. Though a person may never have seen or even heard of the Tipitaka, if he
    carries out detailed investigation every time suffering arises and scorches his mind he
    can be said to be studying the Tipitaka directly, and far more correctly than people
    actually in the process of reading it. These may be just caressing the books of the
    Tipitaka everyday without having any knowledge of the immortal Dhamma, the teaching
    contained within them. Likewise, we have ourselves, we make use of ourselves, we train
    ourselves, and we do things connected with ourselves every day, without knowing anything
    about ourselves, without being able to handle adequately problems concerning ourselves. We
    are still very definitely subject to suffering, and craving is still present to produce
    more and more suffering every day as we grow older, all simply because we don't know
    ourselves. We still don't know the mental life we live. To get to know the Tipitaka and
    the profound things hidden within it is most difficult. Let us rather set about studying
    Buddha-Dhamma by getting to know our own true nature. Let us get to know all the things
    which make up this very body and mind. Let us learn from this life: life which is spinning
    on in the cycle of desiring, acting on the desires, and reaping the results of the action,
    which then nourish the will to desire again, and so on, over and over incessantly; life
    which is obliged to go spinning on in the circle of samsara, that sea of suffering, purely
    and simply because of ignorance as to the true nature of things or what is what.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Summing up, Buddhism is an organized practical system
    designed to reveal to us the &quot;what is what.&quot; Once we have seen things as they
    really are, we no longer need anyone to teach or guide us. We can carry on practising by
    ourselves. One progresses along the Aryian Path just as rapidly as one eliminates the
    defilements and gives up inappropriate action. Ultimately one will attain to the best
    thing possible for a human being, what we call the Fruit of the Path, Nirvana. This one
    can do by oneself simply by means of coming to know the ultimate sense of the &quot;what
    is what.&quot; </font></p>
