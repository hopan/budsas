    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">I</font><font face="Times New Roman">n this
    chapter we shall examine the method to be used for eliminating clinging. The method is
    based on three practical steps, namely Morality, Concentration, and Insight, known
    collectively as the Threefold Training.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first step is morality (Sila). Morality is simply
    suitable behavior, behavior that conforms with the generally accepted standards and causes
    no distress to other people or to oneself. It is coded in the form of five moral precepts,
    or eight, or ten, or 227, or in other ways. It is conducted by way of body and speech
    aimed at peace, convenience and freedom from undesirable effects at the most basic level.
    It has to do with the members of a social group and the various pieces of property
    essential to living.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second aspect of the threefold training is
    concentration (Samadhi). This consists in constraining the mind to remain in the condition
    most conducive to success in whatever he wishes to achieve. Just what is concentration? No
    doubt most of you have always understood concentration as implying a completely tranquil
    mind, as steady and unmoving as a log of wood. But merely these two characteristics of
    being tranquil and steady are not the real meaning of Concentration. The basis for this
    statement is an utterance of the Buddha. He described the concentrated mind as fit for
    work (kammaniya), in a suitable condition for doing its job. Fit for work is the very best
    way to describe the properly concentrated mind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third aspect is the training in insight (Panna), the
    practice and drill that gives rise to the full measure of right knowledge and
    understanding of the true nature of all things. Normally we are incapable of knowing
    anything at all in its true nature. Mostly we either stick to our own ideas or go along
    with popular opinion, so that what we see is not the truth at all. It is for this reason
    that Buddhist practice includes this training in insight, the last aspect of the threefold
    training, designed to give rise to full understanding of and insight into the true nature
    of things.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the religious context, understanding and insight are
    not by any means the same. Understanding depends to some extent on the use of reasoning,
    on rational intellection. Insight goes further than that. An object known by insight has
    been absorbed; it has been penetrated to and confronted face to face; the mind has become
    thoroughly absorbed in it through examination and investigation so sustained that there
    has arisen a non-rational but genuine and heartfelt disenchantment with that thing and a
    complete lack of emotional involvement in it. Consequently the Buddhist training in
    insight does not refer to intellectual understanding of the kind used in present day
    academic and scholarly circles, where each individual can have his own particular kind of
    truth. Buddhist insight must be intuitive insight clear and immediate, the result of
    having penetrated to the object by one means or another, until it has made a definite and
    indelible impression on the mind. For this reason the objects of scrutiny in insight
    training must be things that one comes into contact with in the course of everyday living;
    or at least they must be things of sufficient importance to render the mind genuinely fed
    up and disenchanted with them as transient, unsatisfactory and not selves. However much we
    think rationally, evaluating the characteristics of transience, unsatisfactoriness and
    non-selfhood, nothing results but intellectual understanding. There is no way it can give
    rise to disillusionment and disenchantment with worldly things. It must be understood that
    the condition of disenchantment replaces that of desiring the formerly infatuatingly
    attractive object, and that this in itself constitutes the insight. It is a fact of nature
    that the presence of genuine, clear insight implies the presence of genuine
    disenchantment. It is impossible that the process should stop short at the point of clear
    insight. Disenchantment displaces desire for the object, and is bound to arise
    immediately.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Training in morality is simply elementary preparatory
    practice, which enables us to live happily and helps stabilize the mind. Morality yields
    various benefits, the most important being the preparing of the way for concentration.
    Other advantages, such as conducing to happiness or to rebirth as a celestial being, were
    not considered by the Buddha to be the direct aims of morality. He regarded morality as
    primarily a means of inducing and developing concentration. As long as things continue to
    disturb the mind, it can never become concentrated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Training in concentration consists in developing the
    ability to control this mind of ours, to make use of it, to make it do its job to the best
    advantage. Morality is good behavior in respect of body and speech; concentration amounts
    to good behavior in respect of the mind, and is the fruit of thorough mental training and
    discipline. The concentrated mind is devoid of all bad, defiling thoughts and does not
    wander off the object. It is in a fit condition to do its job. Even in ordinary worldly
    situations, concentration is always a necessity. No matter what we are engaged in, we can
    hardly do it successfully unless the mind is concentrated. For this reason the Buddha
    counted concentration as one of the marks of a great man. Regardless of whether a man is
    to be successful in worldly or in spiritual things, the faculty of concentration is
    absolutely indispensable. Take even a schoolboy. If he lacks concentration, how can he do
    arithmetic? The sort of concentration involved in doing arithmetic is natural
    concentration and is only poorly developed. Concentration as a basic element in Buddhist
    practice, which is what we are discussing here, is concentration that has been trained and
    raised to a higher pitch than can develop naturally. Consequently, when the mind has been
    trained successfully, it comes to have a great many very special abilities, powers and
    attributes. A person who has managed to derive these benefits from concentration can be
    said to have moved up a step towards knowing the secrets of nature. He knows how to
    control the mind, and thus has abilities not possessed by the average person. The
    perfection of morality is an ordinary human ability. Even if someone makes a display of
    morality, it is never a superhuman display. On the other hand the attainment of deep
    concentration was classed by the Buddha as a superhuman ability, which the bhikkhus were
    never to make a display of. Anyone who did show off this ability was considered no longer
    a good bhikkhu, or even no longer a bhikkhu at all.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To attain concentration necessitates making sacrifices. We
    have to put up with varying degrees of hardship, to train and practice, until we have the
    degree of concentration appropriate to our abilities. Ultimately we shall gain much better
    results in our work than can the average man, simply because we have better tools at our
    disposal. So do take an interest in this matter of concentration and don't go regarding it
    as something foolish and old-fashioned. It is definitely something of the greatest
    importance, something worth making use of at all times, especially nowadays when the world
    seems to be spinning too fast and on the point of going up in flames. There is far more
    need for concentration now than there was in the time of the Buddha. Don't get the idea
    that it is just something for the people in temples, or for cranks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now we come to the connection between the training in
    concentration and the training in insight. The Buddha once said that when the mind is
    concentrated, it is in a position to see all things as they really are. When the mind is
    concentrated and fit for work, it will know all things in their true nature. lt. is a
    strange thing that the answer to any problem a person is trying to solve is usually
    already present, though concealed, in his very own mind. He is not aware of it, because it
    is still only subconscious; and as long as he is set on solving the problem, the solution
    will not come, simply because his mind at that time is not in a fit condition for solving
    problems. If, when setting about any mental work, a person develops right concentration,
    that is, if he renders his mind fit for work, the solution to his problem will come to
    light of its own accord. The moment the mind has become concentrated, the answer will just
    fall into place. But should the solution still fail to come, there exists another method
    for directing the mind to the examination of the problem, namely the practice of
    concentrated introspection referred to as the training in insight. On the day of his
    enlightenment the Buddha attained insight into the Law of Conditioned Origination, that
    is, he came to perceive the true nature of things or the &quot;what is what&quot; and the
    sequence in which they arise, as a result of being concentrated in the way we have just
    described. The Buddha has related the story in detail, but essentially it amounts to this:
    as soon as his mind was well concentrated, it was in a position to examine the problem.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is just when the mind is quiet and cool, in a state of
    well- being, undisturbed, well concentrated and fresh, that some solution to a persistent
    problem is arrived at. Insight is always dependent on concentration though we may perhaps
    never have noticed the fact. Actually the Buddha demonstrated an association even more
    intimate than this between concentration and insight. He pointed out that concentration is
    indispensable for insight, and insight, indispensable for concentration at a higher
    intensity than occurs naturally, requires the presence of understanding of certain
    characteristics of the mind. 0ne must know in just which way the mind has to be controlled
    in order that concentration may be induced. So the more insight a person has, the higher
    degree of concentration he will capable of. Likewise an increase in concentration results
    in a corresponding increase in insight. Either one of the two factors promotes the other.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Insight implies unobscured vision and consequently
    disenchantment and boredom. It results in a backing away from all the things one has
    formerly been madly infatuated with. If one has insight, yet still goes rushing after
    things, madly craving for them, grasping at and clinging on to them, being infatuated with
    them., then it cannot be insight in the Buddhist sense. This stopping short and backing
    away is, of course, not a physical action. One doesn't actually pick things up and hurl
    them away or smash them to pieces, nor does one go running off to live in the forest. This
    is not what is meant. Here we are referring specifically to a mental stopping short and
    backing away, as a result of which the mind ceases to be a slave to things and becomes a
    free mind instead. This is what it is like when desire for things has given way to
    disenchantment. It isn't a matter of going and committing suicide, or going off to live as
    a hermit in the forest, or setting fire to everything. Outwardly one is as usual, behaving
    quite normally with respect to things. Inwardly, however, there is a difference. The mind
    is independent, free, no longer a slave to things. This is the virtue of insight. The
    Buddha called this effect Deliverance, escape from slavery to things, in particular the
    things we like. Actually we are enslaved by the things we dislike too. We are enslaved
    insofar as we cannot help disliking them and are unable to remain unmoved by them. In
    disliking things, we are being active, we are becoming emotional about them. They manage
    to control us just as do the things we like, affecting each of us in a different way. So
    the expression &quot;slavery to things&quot; refers to the reactions of liking and
    disliking. All this shows that we can escape from slavery to things and become free by
    means of insight. The Buddha summed up this principle very briefly by saying:
    &quot;Insight is the means by which we can purify ourselves.&quot; He did not specify
    morality or concentration as the means by which we could purify ourselves, but insight,
    which enables us to escape, which liberates us from things. Not freed from things, one is
    impure, tainted, infatuated, passionate. Once free, one is pure, spotless, enlightened,
    tranquil. This is the fruit of insight, the condition that results when insight has done
    its job completely.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Have a good look at this factor, insight, the third aspect
    of the threefold training. Get to know it, and you will come to regard it as the highest
    virtue. Buddhist insight is insight that results in backing away from things by completely
    destroying the four kinds of attachment. Those four attachments are ropes holding us fast;
    insight is the knife that can cut those bonds and set us free. With the four attachments
    gone, there is nothing left to bind us fast to things. Will these three modes of practice
    stand the test? Are they soundly based and suitable for all in practice? Do examine them.
    When you have another look at them you will see that these three factors do not conflict
    with any religious doctrine at all, assuming that the religion in question really aims at
    remedying the problem of human suffering. The Buddhist teaching does not conflict with any
    other religion, yet it has some things that no other religion has. In particular it has
    the practice of insight, which is the superlative technique for eliminating the four
    attachments. It liberates the mind, rendering it independent and incapable of becoming
    bound, enslaved, overpowered by anything whatsoever, including God in heaven, spirits, or
    celestial beings. No other religion is prepared to let the individual free himself
    completely, or be entirely self reliant We must be fully aware of this principle of
    self-reliance, which is a key feature of Buddhism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As soon as we see that Buddhism has everything that any
    other religion has and also several things that none of them have, we realize that
    Buddhism is for everyone. Buddhism is the universal religion. It can be put into practice
    by everyone, in every age and era. People everywhere have the same problem: to free
    themselves from suffering-suffering which is inherent in birth, aging, pain and death,
    suffering which stems from desire, from grasping. Everyone without exception, celestial
    being, human being, or beast, has this same problem, and everyone has the same job to do,
    namely to eliminate completely the desire, the unskillful grasping which is the root cause
    of that suffering. Thus Buddhism is the universal religion. </font></p>
