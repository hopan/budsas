    any recent book on the origins of religion, we find that there is one point on which all
    authors are in agreement. They all agree in saying that religion arose in the world out of
    fear. Primitive forest-dwelling man feared thunder and lightning, darkness and storms, and
    various things about him that he was unable to understand or control. His method of
    avoiding the danger he saw in these phenomena was to demonstrate either humility and
    submission or homage and reverence, depending on which he felt was most appropriate.
    Later, as man's knowledge and understanding developed, this fear of the forces of nature
    changed into a fear of phenomena more difficult to apprehend. Religions based on deference
    to objects of fear such as natural phenomena, spirits and celestial beings, came to be
    looked down upon as unreasonable and ridiculous. And then man's fear became still more
    refined into a fear of suffering, suffering of the sort that cannot be alleviated by any
    material means. He came to fear the suffering inherent in birth, ageing, pain and death,
    the disappointment and hopelessness which arise out of desire, anger and stupidity, which
    no amount of power or wealth can relieve. Long ago in India, a country well provided with
    thinkers and investigators, intelligent people dispensed with all paying of homage to
    supernatural beings and started seeking instead the means of conquering birth, ageing,
    pain and death, the means of eliminating greed, hatred and delusion. Out of this search
    arose Buddhism, a higher religion based on insight, a means of conquering birth, ageing,
    pain and death, a method for destroying the mental defilements. Buddhism has its origins
    in fear of this last kind, just as do all religions based on intelligence The Buddha
    discovered how to conquer absolutely what man fears: he discovered a practical method, now
    called Buddhism for eliminating suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Buddhism&quot; means &quot;the Teaching of the
    Enlightened One.&quot; A Buddha is an enlightened individual, one who knows the truth
    about all things, one who knows just what is what, and so is capable of behaving
    appropriately with respect to all things. Buddhism is a religion based on intelligence,
    science and knowledge, whose purpose is the destruction of suffering and the source of
    suffering. All paying of homage to sacred objects by means of performing rites and
    rituals, making offerings or praying is not Buddhism. The Buddha rejected all this as
    foolish, ridiculous and unsound. He also rejected the celestial beings, then considered by
    certain groups to be the creator of things, and the deities supposed to dwell, one in each
    star in the sky. Thus we find that the Buddha made such statements as these:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Knowledge, skill and ability are conducive to
    success and benefit and are auspicious omens, good in their own right regardless of the
    movements of the heavenly bodies. With the benefits gained from these qualities, one will
    completely outstrip those foolish people who just sit making their astrological
    calculations.&quot; And: &quot;If the water in rivers (such as the Ganges) could really
    wash away sins and suffering, then the turtles, crabs, fish and shellfish living in those
    sacred rivers ought by now to be freed of their sins and sufferings too.&quot; And:
    &quot;If a man could eliminate suffering by making offerings, paying homage and praying,
    there would be no one subject to suffering left in the world, because anyone at all can
    pay homage and pray. But since people are still subject to suffering while in the very act
    of making obeisances, paying homage and performing rites, this is clearly not the way to
    gain liberation.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To attain liberation, we first have to examine things
    closely in order to come to know and understand their true nature. Then we have to behave
    in a way appropriate to that true nature. This is the Buddhist teaching; this we must know
    and bear in mind. Buddhism has nothing to do with prostrating oneself and deferring to
    awesome things. It sets no store by rites and ceremonies such as making libations of holy
    water, or any externals whatsoever, spirits and celestial being included. On the contrary,
    it depends on reason and insight. Buddhism does not demand conjecture or supposition; it
    demands that we act in accordance with what our own insight reveals and not take anyone
    else's word for anything. If someone comes and tells us something, we must not believe him
    without question. We must listen to his statement and examine it. Then if we find it
    reasonable, we may accept it provisionally and set about trying to verify it for
    ourselves. This is a key feature of Buddhism, which distinguishes it sharply from other
    world religions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now a religion is a many-sided thing. Seen from one angle
    it has a certain appearance; seen from another angle, it has another. Many people look at
    religion from the wrong angle, and Buddhism is no exception. Different individuals looking
    at Buddhism with different mental attitudes are bound to get different views of it.
    Because each of us naturally has confidence in his own opinions, the truth for each of us
    coincides with our own particular understanding and point of view. Consequently, &quot;the
    Truth&quot; is not quite the same thing for different people. They all penetrate questions
    to varying depth by varying methods, and with varying degrees of intelligence A person
    does not recognize as true, according to his own ideas of the Truth, anything that lies
    beyond his own intelligence, knowledge and understanding. And even though he may outwardly
    go along with other people's ideas as to what is the truth, he knows in himself that it is
    not the truth as he himself sees it. Each person's conception of the truth may change and
    develop with the day by day increase in his degree of intelligence, knowledge and
    understanding, until such time as he arrives at the ultimate truth; and each of us has
    different ways of examining and testing before believing. So if Buddhism is viewed with
    differing degrees of intelligence, differing pictures of it will be seen, simply because
    it can be viewed from an aspect. As we have said, Buddhism is a practical method for
    liberating oneself from suffering by means of coming to realize as did the Buddha himself,
    the true nature of things. Now any religious text is bound to contain material which later
    people have found occasion to add to, and our Tipitaka is no exception. People in later
    ages have added sections based on then current ideas, either in order to boost people's
    confidence or out of excessive religious zeal. Regrettably even the rites and rituals
    which have developed and become mixed in with the religion are now accepted and recognized
    as Buddhism proper. Ceremonies, such as setting up trays of sweets and fruit as offerings
    to the &quot;soul&quot; of the Buddha in the same way as alms food is offered to a monk
    just do not fit in with Buddhist principles. Yet some groups consider this to be genuine
    Buddhist practice, teaching it as such and keeping to it very strictly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rites and ceremonies of this kind have become so numerous
    that they now completely obscure the real Buddhism and its original purpose. Take for
    example the procedure of becoming ordained a monk. There has come into existence the
    ceremony of making gifts to the newly ordained bhikkhu Guests are invited to bring food
    and to watch proceedings, and as a result, there is much drunkenness and noise. Ceremonies
    are performed both at the temple and in the home. The new bhikkhu later leaves the Order
    again only a few days after having been ordained, and may become an even stronger
    temple-hater than he was before. It must be borne in mind that there was none of this at
    the time of the Buddha. It is a later development. Ordination at the time of the Buddha
    meant simply, that some individual, who had obtained his parent's consent, renounced home
    and family. He was a person who was able to close accounts at home and go off to join the
    Buddha and the Order of bhikkhus. On some convenient occasion he would go and be ordained,
    and perhaps not see his parents or family again for the rest of his life. Though some
    bhikkhus might go back to visit their parents again on suitable occasions, this was rare.
    There does exist a rule permitting a bhikkhu to go home when there is a good reason for
    doing so, but at the time of the Buddha this was not the done thing. Bhikkhus did not
    receive ordination with their parents in attendance nor did they celebrate the event as a
    great occasion, only to leave the Sangha again after just a few days, no better off than
    at first, as commonly happens in the present day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All this presenting of gifts to newly ordained bhikkhus,
    this performing of ceremonies, including all sorts of celebration - this we are foolish
    enough to call Buddhism! Furthermore we choose to make much of it, thinking nothing of
    spending all our own money, or other people's on account of it. This
    &quot;Neo-Buddhism&quot; is so widespread as to be almost universal. The Dhamma, the
    genuine teaching that once was paramount has become so overlaid by ceremonial that the
    whole objective of Buddhism has been obscured, falsified and changed. Ordination, for
    instance, has become a face-saving gambit for young men whom people have been pointing at
    for never having been ordained, or a prerequisite to finding a wife (as having been a monk
    is considered a sign of maturity), or is done with some other kind of ulterior motive. In
    some places an ordination is regarded as an opportunity for collecting money for which job
    there are always people on hand to help. It is one way of getting rich. Even this they
    call Buddhism! And anyone who goes and criticizes this is considered to be ignorant of
    Buddhism or opposed to it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another example is the presentation of kathina cloth The
    Buddha's original intention was to have cloth for robes given to all the bhikkhus
    simultaneously so that they could sew it together themselves with a minimum loss of time.
    If there was only one robe, it was allocated to some bhikkhu not necessarily the most
    senior one, whom the group considered worthy of using that role or in need of it, and was
    presented to him in the name of the entire order. The Buddha's intention was to avoid any
    bhikkhu's having a high opinion of himself. On that day everyone, regardless of rank, had
    to humble himself and be one of the crowd. Everyone had to lend a hand cutting and sewing
    the cloth, boiling tree pith to make the dye, and whatever else was involved in getting
    the robes ready and finished the same day. Making the cloth into robes was a co-operative
    effort. That is how the Buddha intended it to be, an event not necessarily involving lay
    people at all. But nowadays it has become an affair involving ceremony, fun and games,
    loud laughter and money seeking. It is just a picnic and is devoid of all the desirable
    results originally intended.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This sort of thing is a tumour which has developed in
    Buddhism and thrived. The tumour takes hundreds of different forms too numerous to name.
    It is a dangerous, malignant growth which by degrees has completely overlaid and obscured
    the good material, the real pith of Buddhism, and quite disfigured it. One result of this
    has been the arising of many sects, some large, some insignificant, as off-shoots from the
    original religion. Some sects have even become involved in sensuality. It is essential
    that we always discriminate in order to recognize what is the real, original Buddhism. We
    must not foolishly grasp at the outer shell, or become so attached to the various rituals
    and ceremonies that the real objective becomes quite lost to view. The real practice of
    Buddhism is based on purification of conduct by way of body and speech, followed by
    purification of the mind, which in its turn leads to insight and right understanding.
    Don't go thinking that such and such is Buddhism just because everyone says it is. The
    tumour has been spreading constantly since the day the Buddha died, expanding in all
    directions right up to the present day, so that it is now quite sizeable. The tumour in
    Buddhism must not be misidentified as Buddhism itself. It is also wrong for of other
    religions to come and point at these shameful disgraceful growths as being Buddhism. It is
    unjust, because these things are not Buddhism at all; they are excrescence. Those of us
    interested in furthering Buddhism, whether as a foothold for all people, or for our own
    private well-being, must know how to get hold of the true essence of Buddhism and not just
    grab at some worthless outgrowth. Now even the genuine Buddhism is many-sided, a fact
    which may lead to a false grasp of true meaning. For instance, if looked at from the point
    of view of a moral philosopher, Buddhism is seen to be a religion of morality. There is
    talk of merit and demerit, good and evil, honesty, gratitude, harmony, open-heartedness
    and much more besides. The Tipitaka is full of moral teachings. Many newcomers to Buddhism
    approach it from this angle and are attracted to it on this account.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A more profound aspect is Buddhism as Truth, as the deep
    hidden truth lying below the surface and invisible to the ordinary man. To see this truth
    is to know intellectual emptiness of all things; the transience, unsatisfactoriness and
    non-selfhood of all things; to know intellectually the nature of suffering, of the
    complete elimination of suffering and of the way to attain the complete elimination of
    suffering; to perceive these in terms of absolute truth, the kind that changes and which
    everyone ought to know. This is Buddhism as Truth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism as Religion is Buddhism as a system of practice
    based on morality, concentration and insight, and culminating in liberating insight; a
    system which when practised to completion enables one to break free from suffering. This
    is Buddhism as Religion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then there is Buddhism as Psychology, as it is presented
    to us in the third section of the Tipitaka, where the nature of the mind is described in
    remarkable detail. Buddhist psychology is a source of interest and astonishment to
    students of the mind even in the present day. It is far more detailed and profound than
    present day psychological knowledge.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another aspect is Buddhism as Philosophy. Philosophical
    knowledge can be clearly seen by means of reasoned logical proofs but cannot be
    demonstrated experimentally. It contrasts with science, which is knowledge resulting from
    seeing something clearly, with our eyes, or through physical experimentation and proof, or
    even with the &quot;inner eye&quot; of intuition. Profound knowledge such as that of
    emptiness is just philosophy for a person who has not yet penetrated to the truth, and
    science for another who has done so, such as a fully enlightened individual, or arahant,
    who has seen it clearly, intuitively. Many aspects of Buddhism, in particular the Four
    Noble Truths, are scientific in so far as they can be verified by clear experimental proof
    using introspection. For anyone equipped with awareness and interested in studying and
    carrying out research, the cause - effect relationships are there just as in science.
    Buddhism is not just something obscure and vague, not just philosophy, as are man-made
    subjects.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some look on Buddhism as Culture. Anyone with a high
    regard for culture finds many aspects of Buddhist practice which are common to all
    cultures and also many that are characteristically Buddhist and far better and higher than
    anything in other cultures.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of all these various aspects, the one a real Buddhist
    ought to take most interest in is Buddhism as Religion. We ought to look on Buddhism as a
    direct practical method for gaining knowledge of the true nature of things, knowledge
    which makes it possible to give up every form of grasping and clinging, of stupidity and
    infatuation, and become completely independent of things. To do this is to penetrate to
    the essence of Buddhism. Buddhism considered in this aspect is far more useful than
    Buddhism considered as mere morality, or as truth which is simply profound knowledge and
    not really practical; and more useful than Buddhism considered as philosophy, as something
    to be enjoyed as an object of speculation and argument of no value in the giving up of the
    mental defilements; and certainly more useful than Buddhism considered simply as culture,
    as attractive behaviour, noteworthy from the sociological viewpoint.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the very least, everyone ought to consider Buddhism as
    Art, as the Art of Living - in other words, as skill and competence in being a human
    being, living in a way that is exemplary and praiseworthy, which so impresses others that
    they automatically wish to emulate it. What we have to do is to cultivate the &quot;Three
    Lustres,&quot; firstly developing moral purity, training the mind to be tranquil and
    steady and fit to its job, and finally developing such an abundance of wisdom and clear
    insight into the nature of all things that those things are no longer able to give rise to
    suffering. When anyone's life has these Three Lustres, he can be considered to have
    mastered the art of living. Westerners are extremely interested in Buddhism as the Art of
    Living, and discuss this aspect more than any other. Penetrating so far into the real
    essence of Buddhism that we are able to take it as our guide to living induces spiritual
    good cheer and joy, dispersing depression and disillusionment. It also dispels fears, such
    as the fear that the complete giving up of spiritual defilements would make life dry and
    dreary and utterly devoid of flavour, or the fear that complete freedom from craving would
    make all thought and action impossible, whereas in reality a person who organizes his life
    in accordance with the Buddhist Art of Living is victor over all the things about him.
    Regardless of whether these things be animals, people, possessions, or anything else, and
    regardless of whether they enter that person's consciousness by way of the eye, ear, nose,
    tongue, body, or mind, they will enter as losers, unable to becloud, defile, or perturb
    him. The winning of victory over all things is genuine bliss.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha-Dhamma will enrapture a mind that has developed a
    taste for it. It can be considered an indispensable form of nourishment too. True, a
    person still controlled by the defilements continues to desire nourishment by way of the
    eye, ear, nose, tongue and body and goes in search of it as suits his nature. But there is
    another part of him, something deeper, that does not demand that sort of nourishment. It
    is the free or pure element in his mind. It wishes the joy and delight of spiritual
    nourishment, starting with the delight that results from moral purity. It is the source of
    contentment for fully enlightened individuals, who possess such tranquillity of mind that
    defilements cannot disturb them, who possess clear insight into the true nature of all
    things and have no ambitions with regard to any of them. They are, so to speak, able to
    sit down without being obliged to run hither and yon like those people to whom the Buddha
    applied the simile &quot;smoke by night, fire by day.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Smoke by night&quot; refers to sleeplessness,
    restlessness. A sufferer from this complaint lies all night with hand on brow, planning on
    going after this and that, working out how to get money, how to get rich quickly and get
    the various things he desires. His mind is full of &quot;smoke.&quot; All he can do is lie
    there until morning, when he can get up and go running off in obedience to the wishes of
    the &quot;smoke&quot; he has been holding back all night. This fervent activity is what
    the Buddha referred to as &quot;fire by day.&quot; These are the symptoms of a mind that
    has not achieved tranquillity, a mind that has been deprived of spiritual nourishment. It
    is a pathological hunger and thirst induced by the defilement called craving. All night
    long the victim represses the smoke and heat, which in the morning becomes fire, and then
    blazes hot inside him all day. If a person is obliged, throughout his entire life, to
    suppress the &quot;smoke by night,&quot; which then becomes &quot;fire by day,&quot; how
    can he ever find peace and coolness? Just visualize his condition. He endures suffering
    and torment all his life, from birth up until he enters the coffin, simply for lack of the
    insight that could completely extinguish that fire and smoke. To treat such a complaint
    one has to make use of the knowledge provided by the Buddha. The smoke and fire diminish
    in proportion to one's degree of understanding of the true nature of things.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we have said, Buddhism has a number of different
    aspects or sides. Just as the same mountain when viewed from a different direction
    presents a different appearance, so different benefits are derived from Buddhism according
    to how one looks at it. Even Buddhism has its origins in fear--not the foolish fear of an
    ignorant person who kneels and makes obeisance to idols or strange phenomena, but a higher
    kind of fear, the fear of perhaps never attaining liberation from the oppression of birth,
    ageing, pain and death, from the various forms of suffering we experience. The real
    Buddhism is not books, not manuals, not word for word repetition from the Tipitaka, nor is
    it rites and rituals. These are not the real Buddhism. The real Buddhism is the practice,
    by way of body, speech and mind that will destroy the defilements, in part or completely.
    One need not have anything to do with books or manuals. One ought not to rely on rites and
    rituals, or anything else external, including spirits and celestial beings. Rather one
    must be directly concerned with bodily action, speech and thought. That is, one must
    persevere in one's efforts to control and eliminate the defilements so that clear insight
    can arise. One will then be automatically capable of acting appropriately, and will be
    free of suffering from that moment right up to the end.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the real Buddhism. This is what we have to
    understand. Let us not go foolishly grasping at the tumour that is obscuring Buddhism,
    taking it for the real thing. </font></p>
