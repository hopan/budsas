    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">H</font><font face="Times New Roman">ow can we
    get away from and become completely independent of things, all of which are transient,
    unsatisfactory and devoid of selfhood? The answer is that we have to find out what is the
    cause of our desiring those things and clinging to them. Knowing that cause, we shall be
    in a position to eliminate clinging completely. Buddhists recognize four different kinds
    of clinging or attachment. 1) Sensual attachment (Kamupanana) is clinging to attractive
    and desirable sense objects. It is the attachment that we naturally develop for things we
    like and find satisfaction in: colors and shapes, sounds, odours, tastes, tactile objects,
    or mental images, objects past, present, or future that arise in the mind, and either
    correspond to material objects in the world outside or within the body, or are just
    imaginings. We instinctively find pleasure, enchantment, delight in these six kinds of
    sense objects. They induce delight and enchantment in the mind perceiving them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As soon as an individual is born, he comes to know the
    taste of these six sense objects, and clings to them; and as time passes he becomes more
    and more firmly attached to them. Ordinary people are incapable of withdrawing from them
    again, so they present a major problem. It is necessary to have a proper knowledge and
    understanding of these sense objects and to act appropriately with respect to them,
    otherwise clinging to them may lead to complete and utter dereliction. If we examine the
    case history of any person who has sunk into dereliction, we always find that it has come
    about through his clinging fast to some desirable sense object. Actually every single
    thing a human being does has its origin in sensuality. Whether we love, become angry,
    hate, feel envious, murder, or commit suicide, the ultimate cause must be some sense
    object. If we investigate what is it that drives human beings to work energetically, or to
    do anything at all for that matter, we find it is desire, desire to get things of one kind
    or another. People strive, study, and earn what money they can, and then go off in search
    of pleasure-in the form of colors and shapes, sounds, odors, tastes, and tactile
    objects-which is what keeps them going. Even merit making in order to go to heaven has its
    origins simply in a wish based on sensuality. Taken together, all the trouble and chaos in
    the world has its origin in sensuality. The danger of sensuality lies in the power of
    sensual attachment. For this reason the Buddha reckoned clinging to sensuality as the
    primary form of attachment. It is a real world problem. Whether the world is to be
    completely destroyed, or whatever is to happen, is bound to depend on this very sensual
    clinging. It behooves us to examine ourselves to find out in what ways we are attached to
    sensuality and how firmly, and whether it is not perhaps within our power to give it up.
    Speaking in worldly terms, attachment to sensuality is a very good thing. It conduces to
    family love, to diligence and energy in the search for wealth and fame, and so on. But if
    looked at from the spiritual point of view, it is seen to be the secret en trance for
    suffering and torment. Spiritually speaking, attachment to sensuality is something to be
    kept under control. And if all suffering is to be eliminated, sensual attachment has to be
    done away with completely. 2) Attachment to opinions (Ditthupadana). Clinging to views and
    opinions is not difficult to detect and identify once we do a little introspection. Ever
    since we were born into the world, we have been receiving instruction and training, which
    has given rise to ideas and opinions. In speaking here of opinions, what we have in mind
    is the kind of ideas one hangs on to and refuses to let go of. To cling to one's own ideas
    and opinions is quite natural and is not normally condemned or disapproved of. But it is
    no less grave a danger than attachment to attractive and desirable objects. It can happen
    that preconceived ideas and opinions to which we had always clung obstinately come to be
    destroyed. For this reason it is necessary that we continually amend our views, making
    them progressively more correct, better, higher, changing false views into views that are
    closer and closer to the truth, and ultimately into the kind of views that incorporate the
    Four Noble Truths.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Obstinate and stubborn opinions have various origins, but
    in the main they are bound up with customs, traditions, ceremonies and religious
    doctrines. Stubborn personal convictions are not a matter of great importance. They are
    far less numerous than convictions stemming from long held popular traditions and
    ceremonies. Adherence to views is based on ignorance. Lacking knowledge, we develop our
    own personal views on things, based on our own original stupidity. For instance, we are
    convinced that things are desirable and worth clinging to, that they really endure, are
    worthwhile and are selves, instead of perceiving that they are just a delusion and a
    deception, transient, worthless and devoid of selfhood. Once we have come to have certain
    ideas about something, we naturally don't like to admit later on that we were mistaken.
    Even though we may occasionally see that we are wrong, we simply refuse to admit it.
    Obstinacy of this sort is to be considered a major obstacle to progress, rendering us
    incapable of changing for the better, incapable of modifying false religious convictions
    and other longstanding beliefs. This is likely to be a problem for people who hold to
    naive doctrines. Even though they may later come to see them as naive, they refuse to
    change on the grounds that their parents, grandparents and ancestors all held those same
    views. Or if they are not really interested in correcting and improving themselves, they
    may simply brush away any arguments against their old ideas with the remark that this is
    what they have always believed. For these very reasons, attachment to opinions is to be
    considered a dangerous defilement, a major danger, which, if we are to better ourselves at
    all, we ought to make all efforts to eliminate. 3) Attachment to rites and rituals
    (Silabbatupadana). This refers to clinging to meaningless traditional practices that have
    been thoughtlessly handed down, practices which people choose to regard as sacred and not
    to be changed under any circumstances. In Thailand there is no less of this sort of thing
    than in other places. There are beliefs involving amulets, magical artifacts and all
    manner of secret procedures. There exist, for instance, the beliefs that on rising from
    sleep one must pronounce a mystical formula over water and then wash one's face in it,
    that before relieving nature one must turn and face this and that point of the compass,
    and that before one partakes of food or goes to sleep there have to be other rituals.
    There are beliefs in spirits and celestial beings, in sacred trees and all manner of
    magical objects. This sort of thing is completely irrational. People just don't think
    rationally; they simply cling to the established pattern. They have always done it that
    way and they just refuse to change. Many people professing to be Buddhists cling to these
    beliefs as well and so have it both ways; and this even includes some who call themselves
    bhikkhus, disciples of the Buddha. Religious doctrines based on belief in God, angels and
    sacred objects are particularly prone to these kinds of views; there is no reason why we
    Buddhists should not be completely free of this sort of thing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The reason we have to be free of such views is that if we
    practice any aspect of Dhamma unaware of its original purpose, unconscious of the
    rationale of it, the result is bound to be the foolish, naive assumption that it is
    something magical. Thus we find people taking upon themselves the moral precepts or
    practicing Dhamma, purely and simply to conform with the accepted pattern, the traditional
    ceremonial, just to follow the example that has been handed down. They know nothing of the
    rationale of these things, doing them just out of force of habit. Such firmly established
    clinging is hard to correct. This is what is meant by thoughtless attachment to
    traditional practices. Insight meditation or tranquillity meditation as practiced
    nowadays, if carried out without any knowledge of rhyme and reason and the real objectives
    of it, is bound to motivated by grasping and clinging, misdirected, and just some kind of
    foolishness. And even the taking of the Precepts, five, eight, or ten, or however many, if
    done in the belief that one will thereby become a magical, supernatural, holy individual
    possessing psychic or other powers, becomes just misdirected routine, motivated simply by
    attachment to rite and ritual.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is necessary, then, that we be very cautious. Buddhist
    practice must have a sound foundation in thought and understanding and desire to destroy
    the defilements. Otherwise it will be just foolishness; it will be misdirected, irrational
    a just a waste of time. 4) Attachment to the idea of selfhood (Attavadupadana). The belief
    in selfhood is something important and also something extremely well concealed. Any living
    creature is always bound to have the wrong idea of &quot;me and mine.&quot; This is the
    primal instinct of living things and is the basis of all other instincts. For example, the
    instinct to seek food and eat it, the instinct to avoid danger, the instinct to procreate,
    and many others consist simply in the creature's instinctive awareness of a belief in its
    own selfhood. Convinced first of all of its own selfhood, it will naturally desire to
    avoid death, to search for food and nourish its body, to seek safety, and to propagate the
    species. A belief in selfhood is, then, universally present in all living things. If it
    were not so, they could not continue to survive. At the same time, however, it is what
    causes suffering in the search for food and shelter, in the propagation of the species, or
    in any activity whatsoever. This is one reason why the Buddha taught that attachment to
    the self-idea is the root cause of all suffering. He summed it up very briefly by saying:
    &quot;Things, if clung to, are suffering, or are a source of suffering.&quot; This
    attachment is the source and basis of life; at the same time it is the source and basis of
    suffering in all its forms. It was this very fact that the Buddha was referring to when he
    said that life is suffering; suffering is life. This means the body and mind (five
    aggregates) which are clung to are suffering. Knowledge of the source and basis of life
    and of suffering is to be considered the most profound and most penetrating knowledge,
    since it puts us in a position to eliminate suffering completely. This piece of knowledge
    can be claimed to be unique to Buddhism. It is not to be found in any other religion in
    the world. The most efficacious way of dealing with attachment is to recognize it whenever
    it is present. This applies most particularly to attachment to the idea of selfhood, which
    is the very basis of life. It is something that comes into existence of its own accord,
    establishing itself in us without our needing to be taught it. It is present as an
    instinct in children and the small offspring of animals right from birth. Baby animals
    such as kittens know how to assume a defensive attitude, as we can see when we try to
    approach them. There is always that something, the &quot;self&quot; present in the mind,
    and consequently this attachment is bound to manifest. The only thing to do is to rein it
    in as much as possible until such time as one is well advanced in spiritual knowledge; in
    other words, to employ Buddhist principles until this instinct has been overcome and
    completely eliminated. As long as one is still an ordinary person, a worldling, this
    instinct remains unconquered. Only the highest of the Aryians, the Arahant, has succeeded
    in defeating it. We must recognize this as a matter of no small importance; it is a major
    problem common to all living creatures. If we are to be real Buddhists, if we are to
    derive the full benefits from the teaching, it is up to us to set about overcoming this
    misconception. The suffering to which we are subject will diminish accordingly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To know the truth about these things, which are of
    everyday concern to us, is to be regarded as one of the greatest boons, one of the
    greatest skills. Do give some thought to this matter of the four attachments, bearing in
    mind that nothing whatever is worth clinging to, that by the nature of things, nothing is
    worth getting or being. That we are completely enslaved by things is simply a result of
    these four kinds of attachment. It rests with us to examine and become thoroughly familiar
    with the highly dangerous and toxic nature of things. Their harmful nature is not
    immediately evident as is the case with a blazing fire, weapons, or poison. They are well
    disguised as sweet, tasty, fragrant, alluring things, beautiful things, melodious things.
    Coming in these forms they are bound to be difficult to recognize and deal with.
    Consequently we have to make use of this knowledge the Buddha has equipped us with. We
    have to control this unskillful grasping and subdue it by the power of insight. Doing
    this, we shall be in a position to organize our life in such a way that it becomes free of
    suffering, free of even the smallest trace of suffering. We shall be capable of working
    and living peacefully in the world, of being undefiled, enlightened and tranquil.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us sum up. These four forms of attachment are the only
    problem that Buddhists or people who wish to know about Buddhism have to understand. The
    objective of living a holy life (Brahmacariya) in Buddhism is to enable the mind to give
    up unskillful grasping. You can find this teaching in every discourse in the texts which
    treats of the attainment of arahantship. The expression used is &quot;the mind freed from
    attachment.&quot; That is the ultimate. When the mind is free from attachment, there is
    nothing to bind it and make it a slave of the world. There is nothing to keep it spinning
    on in the cycle of birth and death, so the whole process comes to a stop, or rather,
    becomes world transcending, free from the world. The giving up of unskillful clinging is,
    then, the key to Buddhist practice. </font></p>
