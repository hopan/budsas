    chapter we shall see how concentration may come about naturally on the one hand, and as a
    result of organized practice on the other. The end result is identical in the two cases:
    the mind is concentrated and fit to be used for carrying out close introspection. One
    thing must be noticed, however: the intensity of concentration that comes about naturally
    is usually sufficient and appropriate for introspection and insight, whereas the
    concentration resulting from organized training is usually excessive, more than can be
    made use of. Furthermore, misguided satisfaction with that highly developed concentration
    may result. While the mind is fully concentrated, it is likely to be experiencing such a
    satisfying kind of bliss and well- being that the meditator may become attached to it, or
    imagine it to be the Fruit of the Path. Naturally occurring concentration, which is
    sufficient and suitable for use in introspection, is harmless, having none of the
    disadvantages inherent in concentration developed by means of intensive training.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Tipitaka, there are numerous references to people
    attaining naturally all states of Path and Fruit. This generally came about in the
    presence of the Buddha himself but also happened later with other teachers. These people
    did not go into the forest and sit, assiduously practicing concentration on certain
    objects in the way described in later manuals.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Clearly no organized effort was involved when arahantship
    was attained by the first five disciples of the Buddha on hearing the Discourse on Non -
    selfhood, or by the one thousand hermits on hearing the Fire Sermon. In these cases, keen,
    penetrating insight came about quite naturally. These examples clearly show that natural
    concentration is liable to develop of its own accord while one is attempting to understand
    clearly some question, and that the resulting insight, as long as it is firmly established
    must be quite intense and stable. It happens naturally, automatically in just the same way
    as the mind becomes concentrated the moment we set about doing arithmetic. Likewise in
    firing a gun, when we take aim, the mind automatically becomes concentrated and steady.
    This is how naturally occurring concentration comes about. We normally overlook it
    completely because it does not appear the least bit magical, miraculous, or awe inspiring.
    But through the power of just this naturally occurring concentration, most of us could
    actually attain liberation. We could attain the Fruit of the Path, Nirvana, arahantship,
    just by means of natural concentration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So don't overlook this naturally occurring concentration.
    It is something most of us either already have, or can readily develop. We have to do
    everything we can to cultivate and develop it, to make it function perfectly and yield the
    appropriate results, just as did most of the people who succeeded in becoming arahants,
    none of whom knew anything of modern concentration techniques.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now let us have a look at the nature of the states of
    inner awareness leading up to full insight into &quot;the world,&quot; that is, into the
    five aggregates. The first stage is joy (piti), mental happiness or spiritual well being.
    Doing good in some way, even giving alms, considered the most basic form of merit-making,
    can be a source of joy. Higher up, at the level of morality, completely blameless conduct
    by way of word and action brings an increase in joy. Then in the case of concentration, we
    discover that there is a definite kind of delight associated with the lower stages of
    concentration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This rapture has in itself the power to induce
    tranquillity. Normally the mind is quite unrestrained, continually falling slave to all
    sorts of thoughts and feelings associated with enticing things outside. It is normally
    restless, not calm. But as spiritual joy becomes established, calm and steadiness are
    bound to increase in proportion. When steadiness has been perfected, the result is full
    concentration. The mind becomes tranquil, steady, flexible, manageable, light and at ease,
    ready to be used for any desired purpose, in particular for the elimination of the
    defilements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is not a case of the mind's being rendered silent, hard
    and rocklike. Nothing like that happens at all. The body feels normal, but the mind is
    especially calm and suitable for use in thinking and introspection. It is perfectly clear,
    perfectly cool, perfectly still and restrained. In other words, it is fit for work, ready
    to know. This is the degree of concentration to be aimed for, not the very deep
    concentration where one sits rigidly like a stone image, quite devoid of awareness.
    Sitting in deep concentration like that, one is in no position to investigate anything. A
    deeply concentrated mind cannot practice introspection at all. It is in a state of
    unawareness and is of no use for insight. DEEP CONCENTRATION IS A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO
    INSIGHT PRACTICE. To practice introspection one must first return to the shallower levels
    of concentration; then one can make use of the power the mind has acquired. Highly
    developed concentration is just a tool. In this developing of insight by the nature
    method, we don't have to attain deep concentration and sit with the body rigid. Rather, we
    aim at a calm, steady mind, one so fit for work that when it is applied to insight
    practice, it gains right understanding with regard to the entire world. Insight so
    developed is natural insight, the same sort as was gained by some individuals while
    sitting listening to the Buddha expounding Dhamma. It is conducive to thought and
    introspection of the right kind, the kind that brings understanding. And it involves
    neither ceremonial procedures nor miracles.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This doesn't mean, however, that insight will arise
    instantaneously. One can't be an arahant straight off. The first step in knowledge may
    come about at any time, depending once again on the intensity of the concentration. It may
    happen that what arises is not true insight, because one has been practicing wrongly or
    has been surrounded by too many false views. But however it turns out, the insight that
    does arise is bound to be something quite special, for instance extraordinarily clear and
    profound. If the knowledge gained is right knowledge, corresponding with reality,
    corresponding with Dhamma, then it will progress, developing ultimately into right and
    true knowledge of all phenomena. If insight develops in only small measure, it may convert
    a person into an Aryian at the lowest stage; or if it is not sufficient to do that, it
    will just make him a high- minded individual, an ordinary person of good qualities. If the
    environment is suitable and good qualities have been properly and adequately established,
    it is possible to become an arahant. It all depends on the circumstances. But however far
    things go, as long as the mind has natural concentration, this factor called insight is
    bound to arise and to correspond more or less closely with reality. Because we, being
    Buddhists, have heard about, thought about and studied the world, the five aggregates and
    phenomena, in the hope of coming to under stand their true nature, it follows that the
    knowledge we acquire while in a calm and concentrated state will not be in any way
    misleading. It is bound to be always beneficial.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The expression &quot;insight into the true nature of
    things&quot; refers to seeing transience, unsatisfactoriness and non-selfhood, seeing that
    nothing is worth getting, nothing is worth being, seeing that no object whatsoever should
    be grasped at and clung to as being a self or as belonging to a self, as being good or
    bad, attractive or repulsive. Liking or disliking anything, even if it is only an idea or
    a memory, is clinging. To say that nothing is worth getting or being is the same as to say
    that nothing is worth clinging to. &quot;Getting&quot; refers to setting one's heart on
    property, position, wealth, or any pleasing object. &quot;Being&quot; refers to the
    awareness of one's status as husband, wife, rich man, poor man, winner, loser, or human
    being, or even the awareness of being oneself. If we really look deeply at it, even being
    oneself is no fun, is wearisome, because it is a source of suffering. If one can
    completely give up clinging to the idea of being oneself, then being oneself will no
    longer be suffering. This is what it is to see the worthlessness of being anything, and is
    the gist of the statement that being anything, no matter what, is bound to be suffering in
    a way appropriate to that particular state of being. Any state of being, if it is to
    continue as such, has to be made to last, to endure. At the very least, it must endure in
    one's mind in the form of a belief in that particular state of being. When there exists
    &quot;oneself,&quot; there are bound to exist things which are other than that self and
    belong to it. Thus one has one's children, one's wife, one's this, that and the other.
    Then one has one's duty as husband or wife, master or servant, and so on. All this points
    to the truth of the statement that there is no state of being such that to maintain it
    will not involve struggle. The trouble and struggle necessary to maintain one's state of
    being are simply the result of blind infatuation with things, of clinging to things. If we
    were to give up trying to get or to be anything, how could we continue to exist? This is
    bound to be a major source of skepticism for anyone who has not given much thought to the
    matter. The words &quot;getting&quot; and &quot;being&quot; as used here refer to getting
    and being based on mental defilements, on craving, on the idea of &quot;worth getting,
    worth being,&quot; so that the mind does get and be in real earnest. This is bound to lead
    to depression, anxiety, distress and upset, or at least a heavy burden on the mind, right
    from beginning to end. Knowing this truth, we shall be constantly on the alert, keeping
    watch over the mind to see that it doesn't fall slave to getting and being through the
    influence of grasping and clinging. Aware that in reality things are just not worth
    getting or being, we shall be smart enough to stay aloof from them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If, however, we are not yet in a position to withdraw
    completely from having and being, we must be mindful and wide awake, so that when we do
    get or become something, we do so without emotional upset. We must not be like those
    people who, turning a blind eye and a deaf ear, go ahead brainlessly and inexpertly
    getting or becoming, with the result that they fall right into the pit of their own
    stupidity and attachment, and end up having to commit suicide.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The world and all things have the property of
    impermanence, of worthlessness and of not belonging to anyone. Any individual who grasps
    at and clings to anything will be hurt by it, in the very beginning when he first desires
    to get it or to be it, later while he is in the process of getting it and being it, and
    then again after he has got it or been it. All the time, before, during and after, when
    anyone grasps and clings with deaf ear and blind eye, he will receive his full measure of
    suffering, just as can be seen happening to all deluded worldlings. It is the same even
    with goodness, which everyone values highly. If anyone becomes involved with goodness in
    the wrong way and clings to it too much, he will derive just as much suffering from
    goodness as he would from evil. In becoming involved with goodness, we have to bear in
    mind that it possesses this property.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A skeptic may ask: &quot;If nothing at all is worth
    getting or being, does it follow that nobody ought to do any work or build up wealth,
    position and property?&quot; Anyone who comprehends this subject can see that a person
    equipped with right knowledge and understanding is actually in a far better position to
    carry out any task than one who is subject to strong desires, foolish, and lacking in
    understanding. Very briefly, in becoming involved in things, we must do so mindfully; our
    actions must not be motivated by craving. The result will follow accordingly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha and all the other arahants were completely free
    of desire, yet succeeded in doing many things far more useful than what any of us are
    capable of. If we look at accounts of how the Buddha spent his day, we find that he slept
    for only four hours and spent all the rest of the time working. We spend more than four
    hours a day just amusing ourselves. If the defilements responsible for the desire to be
    and get things had been completely eliminated, what was the force that motivated the
    Buddha and all Arahants to do all this? They were motivated by discrimination coupled with
    goodwill (metta). Even actions based on natural bodily wants such as receiving and eating
    alms food were motivated by discrimination They were free of defilements, free of all
    desire to keep on living in order to be this or to get that, but they did have the ability
    to discriminate between what was worthwhile and what was not as the motivating force that
    sent their bodies out to find food. If they found food, well and good; if not, never mind.
    When they were suffering with fever, they knew how to treat it and did so as well as
    possible on the basis of this knowledge. If the fever was quite overpowering and they were
    not strong, they recalled that to die is natural. Whether they lived or died was of no
    significance to them; they were of equal value in their eyes</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one is to be completely free of suffering, this is the
    very best attitude to have. There need not be any self as master of the body.
    Discrimination alone enables the body to carry on by its natural power. The example of the
    Buddha shows that the power of pure discrimination and pure goodwill alone is sufficient
    to keep an arahant living in the world, and, what is more, doing far more good for others
    than people still subject to craving. Defiled people are likely to do only what benefits
    themselves since they act out of selfishness. By contrast, the deeds of arahants are
    entirely selfless and so are perfectly pure. In desiring to get and be, one is acting
    quite inappropriately, one is mistaking evil for good, not knowing what is what. Let us
    all, then, go about things intelligently, always bearing in mind that, in reality, nothing
    is worth getting or being, nothing is worth becoming infatuated with, nothing is worth
    clinging to. Let us act in a manner in keeping with the knowledge that things are by their
    very nature not worth getting or being. If we do have to become involved in things, then
    let us go about it the right way, acting appropriately. This is the way to keep the mind
    always pure, unobscured, tranquil and cool. It allows us to become involved in the world,
    in things, without doing ourselves any harm in the process. When the ordinary worldly man
    hears that nothing is worth getting or being, he is not convinced, he doesn't believe it.
    But anyone who understands the real meaning of this statement becomes emboldened and
    cheered by it. His mind becomes master of things and independent of them. He becomes
    capable of going after things sure in the knowledge that he will not become enslaved by
    them. His actions are not motivated by desire and he is not so blind with passion that he
    comes to be a slave to things. In getting anything or being anything, let us always be
    aware that we are getting or being something which, in terms of absolute truth, we cannot
    get or be at all, because there is nothing that we can really get or be as we might wish.
    All things are transient and unsatisfactory and can never belong to us; and yet we go
    foolishly ahead, grasping at them and craving for them. In other words, we act
    inappropriately, or in a way which does not accord with the true nature of things, simply
    because we become involved in them while ignorant of their true nature. The result is
    bound to be all manner of suffering and trouble. The reason a person is incapable of doing
    his job perfectly, faultlessly, is that he is always far too concerned with getting
    something and being something, always motivated entirely by his own desires. As a result,
    he is not master of himself and cannot be consistently good, honest and fair. In every
    case of failure and ruin, the root cause is slavery to desire. To come to know the true
    nature of things is the true objective of every Buddhist. It is the means by which we can
    liberate ourselves. Regardless of whether we are hoping for worldly benefits, such as
    wealth, position and fame; or for benefits in the next world, such as heaven; or for the
    supra-mundane benefit, the Fruit of the Path, Nirvana--whatever we are hoping for, the
    only way to achieve it is by means of this right knowledge and insight. We thrive on
    insight. In the Texts it is said that we may become purified through insight and not by
    any other means. Our path to freedom lies in having the insight, the clear vision, that in
    all things there neither is nor has ever been anything at all that is worth grasping at or
    clinging to, worth getting or being, worth risking life and limb for. We have things and
    are things only in terms of worldly, relative truth. In worldly language, we say we are
    this or that, just because in any society it is expedient to recognize by names and
    occupations. But we mustn't go believing that we really are this or that, as is assumed at
    the level of relative truth. To do so is to behave like the crickets, which, when their
    faces become covered with dirt, become disoriented and muddled, and proceed to bite each
    other until they die. We humans, when our faces become covered in dirt, when we are
    subject to all sorts of delusions, become so bewildered and disoriented that we do things
    no human being could ever do under ordinary circumstances--killing for instance. So let us
    not go blindly clinging to relative truths; rather let us be aware that they are just
    relative truths, essential in a society but nothing more. We have to be aware of what this
    body and mind really is, what its true nature is. In particular, we have to be aware of
    its impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and non-selfhood, and make sure we always remain
    independent of it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for the wealth, position and so on, which we can't do
    without, let us regard these too as relative truths so that we can break free from the
    existing custom of saying, for instance: &quot;This belongs to So - and - so. That belongs
    to Such and - such.&quot; The law watches over ownership rights for us; there is no need
    for us to cling to the idea of &quot;mine.&quot; We ought to possess things purely and
    simply for the sake of convenience and ease, and not so that they can be master over our
    minds. When we have this clear knowledge, things will become our servants and slaves and
    we shall remain on top of them. If our thoughts go the way of craving and attachment, so
    that we become conscious of having such - and - such and being so - and - so, clinging
    firmly to these ideas, things will get on top of us, and we shall be the servants and
    slaves, under their control instead. The tables can quite easily be turned in this way, so
    we have to be careful. We have to arrange things in such a way that we are sure of staying
    independent and on top of things. If we don't, we may find ourselves in a most pitiable
    position and feel very sorry for ourselves indeed. When we have really come to perceive
    clearly that nothing is worth getting or being, disenchantment (nibbida) develops in
    proportion to the intensity of the insight. It is a sign that the clinging has become less
    firm and is starting to give way. It is a sign that we have been slaves for so long that
    the idea of trying to escape has at last occurred to us. This is the onset of
    disenchantment and disillusionment, when one becomes fed up with one's own stupidity in
    grasping at and clinging to things, believing things to be worth having and being. As soon
    as disenchantment has set in, there is bound to come about a natural, automatic process of
    disentanglement (vimutti), as if a rope with which one had been tightly bound were being
    untied; or a rinsing out, as when the dye that had been firmly fixed in a piece of cloth
    is washed out by soaking it in the appropriate substances. This process whereby clinging
    gives way to a breaking free from, or a dissolving out from the world, or from the objects
    of that clinging, was called by the Buddha, emancipation (vimutti). This state is most
    important. Though not the final stage, it is a most important step towards complete
    liberation. When one has broken free to this extent, complete liberation from suffering is
    assured.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once broken free from slavery, one need never again be a
    slave to the world. One becomes pure and uncontaminated whereas previously one was defiled
    in every way. To be enslaved to things is to be defiled in body, speech and thought. To
    break free from slavery to the delightful tastes of the world is to achieve the pure
    condition and never be defiled again. This real purity (Visuddhi), once it has been
    attained, will give rise to a genuine calm and coolness free from all turbulence, strife
    and torment. This state of freedom from oppression and turbulence was called by the Buddha
    simply peace (Santi), that is, stillness, coolness in all situations, which is virtually
    the same thing as Nirvana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Nirvana&quot; has been translated as &quot;absence
    of any instrument of torture.&quot; Taken another way, it means &quot;extinction without
    remainder.&quot; So the word &quot;Nirvana&quot; has two very important meanings; firstly,
    absence of any source of torment and burning, freedom from all forms of bondage and
    constraint and secondly, extinction, with no fuel for the further arising of suffering.
    The combination of these meanings indicates a condition of complete freedom from
    suffering. There are several other useful meanings for the word &quot;Nirvana.&quot; It
    can be taken to mean the extinction of suffering, or the complete elimination of
    defilements, or the state, realm, or condition that is the cessation of all suffering, all
    defilements and all karmic activity. Though the word &quot;Nirvana&quot; is used by
    numerous different sects, the sense in which they use it is often not the same at all. For
    instance, one group takes it to mean simply calm and coolness, because they identify
    Nirvana with deep concentration. Other groups even consider total absorption in sensuality
    as Nirvana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha defined Nirvana as simply that condition of
    freedom from bondage, torment and suffering which results from seeing the true nature of
    the worldly condition and all things, and so being able to give up all clinging to them.
    It is essential, then, that we recognize the very great value of insight into the true
    nature of things and endeavor to cultivate this insight by one means or another. Using one
    method, we simply encourage it to come about of its own accord, naturally, by developing,
    day and night, the joy that results from mental purity, until the qualities we have
    described gradually come about. The other method consists in developing mental power by
    following an organized system of concentration and insight practice. This latter technique
    is appropriate for people with a certain kind of disposition, who may make rapid progress
    with it if conditions are right. But we can practice the development of insight by the
    nature method in all circumstances and at all times just by making our own way of daily
    living so pure and honest that there arise in succession spiritual joy (piti and pamoda),
    calm (passaddhi), insight into the true nature of things (yathabhutananadassana),
    disenchantment (nibbida), withdrawal (viraga), escape (vimutti), purification from
    defilements (visuddhi), and coolness (santi), so that we come to get a taste of freedom
    from suffering (nibbana)- steadily, naturally, day by day, month by month, year by year,
    gradually approaching closer and closer to Nirvana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Summing up, natural concentration and insight, which
    enable a person to attain the Path and the Fruit, consist in verifying all day and every
    day the truth of the statement that nothing is worth getting or being. Anyone who wishes
    to get this result must strive to purify himself and to develop exemplary personal
    qualities, so that he can find perpetual spiritual joy in work and leisure. That very joy
    induces clarity and freshness, mental calm and stillness, and serves, naturally and
    automatically, to give the mind ability to think and introspect. With the insight that
    nothing is worth getting or being constantly present, the mind loses all desire for the
    things it once used to grasp at and cling to. It is able to break free from the things it
    used to regard as &quot;me and mine,&quot; and all blind craving for things ceases.
    Suffering, which no longer has anywhere to lodge, dwindles right away, and the job of
    eliminating suffering is done. This is the reward, and it can be gained by anyone of us. </font></p>
