    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">N</font><font face="Times New Roman">ow we shall
    deal with the organized systems of insight training, which were not taught by the Buddha
    but were developed by later teachers. This kind of practice is suitable for people at a
    fairly undeveloped stage, who still cannot perceive the unsatisfactoriness of worldly
    existence with their own eyes, naturally. This doesn't mean, however, that the results
    obtained by these systems have any special qualities not obtainable by the nature method,
    because when we examine the Tipitaka closely, we find the nature method is the only one
    mentioned. Some people consider, however, that natural insight can be developed only by
    someone who has become so remarkably virtuous, or has such a suitable disposition, that
    for him to come to a full understanding of things is just child's play. What is a person
    to do who lacks transcendent virtues and the appropriate disposition? For such people,
    teachers laid down ordered systems of practice, concise courses which start from scratch
    and have to be followed through thoroughly and systematically.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These systems of practice for developing insight are now
    known by the technical term &quot;Vipassana - dhura.&quot; Vipassana - dhura is contrasted
    with Study (Gantha - dhura), the two being considered nowadays complementary aspects of
    training. Vipassana- dhura is study done within; it is strictly mental training, having
    nothing to do with textbooks. Neither the term Study (Gantha - dhura) nor Vipassana -
    dhura is mentioned in the Tipitaka, both appearing only in later books; but Vipassana -
    dhura is nevertheless a genuine Buddhist practice, designed for people intent on
    eliminating suffering. It is based directly on sustained, concentrated introspection. In
    order to explain Vipassana to people, teachers in former ages considered it in terms of
    the following questions: What is the basis, the foundation of Vipassana? What are the
    characteristics by which we may know that this is Vipassana? Just what is the activity
    called Vipassana? What should be the ultimate result of Vipassana?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Asked what is the basis, the foundation of Vipassana, we
    answer: morality and concentration. &quot;Vipassana&quot; means &quot;clear insight,&quot;
    and refers to the unobscured vision that may arise when a person's mind is full of joy and
    devoid of any defilement. Joy develops when there is Moral Purity (Sila visuddhi);
    morality is a prerequisite. This is stated in the texts (Rathavinitasutta, Majjhima -
    nikaya, 24), where the practice is described as proceeding in a series of stages called
    the Seven Purifications, and culminating in the Path and the Fruit. Teachers regard the
    attainment of Moral Purity as the first of the Seven Purifications. It consists of
    faultless behavior and is prerequisite to purification of the mind (Citta - visuddhi).
    Purification of the mind, achieved when the mind has been rendered free of any
    contamination, is conducive to Purification of Views (Ditthi- visuddhi) or freedom from
    misunderstanding. Freedom from misunderstanding leads to purity by freedom from doubt
    (Kankhavitarana- visuddhi), and this conduces in its turn to the arising of purity by
    knowledge and vision of what is the true path to be followed and what is not the path
    (Magga - magga - Nanadassana - visuddhi). This knowledge of the path to be followed leads
    to the purity by knowledge and vision of the progress along the path Patipada -
    Nanadassana visuddhi). This finally leads to the last stage of full intuitive insight or
    purity of knowledge and vision (Nanadassana - visuddhi), which is the perfection of the
    very Noble Path. Because the Fruit of the Path arises automatically once the Path is
    established, the attainment of the Path is regarded as the culmination of the practice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moral purity is faultless behavior by way of body and
    speech. As long as any imperfection in body or speech remains, morality in the true sense
    is lacking. When it has been perfected, that is, when tranquillity of bodily activities
    and speech has been achieved, the result is bound to be mental tranquillity, conducive in
    its turn to the further stages of purification: freedom from misunderstanding, freedom
    from doubt, knowledge as to what is the Path to be followed and what is not, knowledge and
    vision of the progress along the Path and finally full intuitive insight. These last five
    stages constitute vipassana proper. Purification of conduct and mind are merely the
    entrance into the path of vipassana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">THE SEVEN PURIFICATIONS, THE FIVE STAGES IN VIPASSANA, AND
    THE NINE STEPS IN THE PERFECTION OF KNOWLEDGE:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> I Moral purity II Mental purity III(1) Freedom from false
    views IV (2) Freedom from doubt V (3) Knowledge and vision of what is the true Path VI (4)
    Knowledge and vision of the progress along the Path (a) Knowledge of arising and passing
    away (b) Knowledge of passing away (c) Awareness of fearsomeness (d) Awareness of danger
    (e) Disenchantment (f) Desire for freedom (g) Struggle to escape (h) Imperturbability (i)
    Readiness to perceive the Four Noble Truths VII (5) Full Intuitive Insight</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Purification consisting of freedom from
    misunderstanding implies the elimination of all false views, both inborn and acquired. It
    covers the whole range from irrational belief in magic to false ideas as to the true
    nature of things-for instance, regarding this body and mind as something enduring,
    something worthwhile, a self; seeing it as animal, human being, celestial being, or god,
    or as something magical or sacred; failing to perceive that it consists of just the four
    elements, or of just body plus mind, and regarding it instead as a self, as possessing a
    soul or spirit, which enters and leaves it; failing to see it as consisting of the five
    aggregates: body, feeling, perception, active thinking and consciousness; failing to see
    it as just a mass of perceptions received by way of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and
    mind. False views lead to belief in magic and sacred objects, and so give rise to fear.
    Rites and rituals are then performed to neutralize the fear, and the end result is firm
    attachment to rites and rituals-all on account of false views. Such a situation indicates
    views that are not as yet faultless. To have given up false views is to have attained what
    was originally called the third Purification, and what later teachers classed the first
    stage in vipassana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Purification consisting of freedom from doubt is
    brought about by introspection into causes. With freedom from false views, one sees
    oneself as just body plus mind. Freedom from doubt consists in perceiving the nature of
    the causes responsible for the coming into existence of the body-mind complex. One sees
    penetratingly and in fine detail the coming into existence and the interaction of
    ignorance, desire, grasping and clinging karma, &quot;nutriment,&quot; and so on, to form
    body and mind. Freedom from doubt results simply from this clear knowledge of the causes
    and effects of all things. In the vipassana system, teachers recognize twenty or thirty
    kinds of doubt, but summed up they all amount to doubt as to whether or not &quot;one's
    self&quot; exists, whether or not &quot;one's self&quot; existed previously, whether or
    not &quot;one's self&quot; will continue to exist in the future and, if so, in what form.
    The only way doubt can be completely dispelled is to realize that there is no
    &quot;I,&quot; but only elements, aggregates, a nervous system together with such causes
    as ignorance, craving and attachment, karma, &quot;nutriment,&quot; and so on. Because no
    real &quot;I&quot; is involved at all, one starts giving up the foolish idea: &quot;I am,
    I have been, I shall be.&quot; With the complete eradication of doubt, the second stage in
    vipassana has been achieved. This does not mean that the &quot;I&quot;- conceit has been
    given up for good and all; fine vestiges are still present. Adequate understanding of the
    mode of interaction of causes has resulted in the dispelling of doubt and has made it
    possible to give up the idea of &quot;I&quot; in its grossest forms.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When doubt has been transcended, it becomes possible to
    bring about the Purification consisting of perfect knowledge as to what is the right path
    to follow and what is not. There exist several obstacles to this further progress, which
    usually arise in the course of vipassana practice. While the mind is in a concentrated
    state, there are likely to arise various strange phenomena with which the meditator may
    become overawed, such as wonderful impressive auras seen in the mind's eye (the physical
    eyes being shut). If these effects are purposely encouraged, they can become highly
    developed; and if the meditator jumps to the conclusion that &quot;this is the Fruit of
    vipassana practice,&quot; or congratulates himself saying, &quot;This is something
    supernatural; this will do me!&quot; and the like, the arising of these phenomena is
    liable to bar the way to the true Path and Fruit. Consequently, teachers consider it a
    side track, a blind alley. Another example is the arising of feelings of joy and
    contentment which continually overflow the mind to such an extent that it becomes
    incapable of any further introspection, or jumps to the conclusion that &quot;this is
    Nirvana, right here and now,&quot; so that the way becomes blocked and further progress is
    impossible. This is another obstruction to insight. Teachers say, furthermore, that even
    insight into the nature of body and mind may sometimes lead to self satisfaction and the
    delusion that the meditator has a remarkable degree of spiritual insight, so that he
    becomes overconfident. This too is an obstacle to progress in vipassana. Occasionally the
    meditator may make use of the mental power he has developed to make his body go rigid,
    with the result that he loses the awareness necessary for further introspection. This is a
    stubborn obstacle in the path to further progress, yet meditators usually approve of it,
    regarding it as a supernatural faculty, or even as the Fruit of the Path. Anyone who
    becomes so pleased with and infatuated by the attainment of deep concentration, this
    sitting with body rigid and devoid of all sensation, that he is unable to progress further
    in vipassana, is in a most pitiable position.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another condition that may very easily come about is a
    blissful rapture the like of which the meditator has never encountered before. Once arisen
    it induces wonder and amazement and unjustified self satisfaction. While the rapture
    lasts, he body and the mind experience extreme bliss and all problems vanish. Things that
    formerly were liked or disliked are liked or disliked no longer when recalled to mind.
    Things the meditator had formerly feared and dreaded or worried and fretted over no longer
    induce those reactions, so that he gets the false idea that he has already attained
    liberation, freedom from all defilements; because for as long as he is in that condition
    he has all the characteristics of a genuinely perfected individual. Should satisfaction
    arise with respect to this condition, it acts as an obstacle to further progress in
    vipassana. And in time the condition will fade away so that things formerly liked or
    disliked will be liked or disliked again just as before, or even more so.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yet another kind of obstacle involves faith. Faith or
    confidence never felt before becomes firmly established, for example confidence in the
    Threefold Gem, Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, or in theories the meditator thinks out for
    himself. There may even come about a most intense satisfaction in Dhamma. The ability to
    remain unmoved by anything becomes so strongly developed that it may even delude the
    meditator into believing he has already attained the Fruit of the Path and Nirvana itself.
    These things are a great difficulty for anyone encountering them for the first time. As
    you can see they constitute a barrier in the way of vipassana. The meditator, however, is
    likely to regard them as highly desirable until such time as he develops the unobscured
    knowledge that these things are in fact obstacles and succeeds in cutting out these finer
    defilements completely. This knowledge of what is the right path and what is not
    constitutes the third stage in vipassana and the fifth Purification.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Until such time as the aspirant has developed this
    knowledge of what really constitutes the right path, he has to be always steering himself
    away from the various side tracks. Once this knowledge of the path to be followed has
    become fully established, however, any further knowledge will automatically develop along
    the right line. It will progress step by step, bringing perfectly clear understanding of
    the true nature of things and ultimately perfect freedom from, and non-involvement in
    things. The mind, equipped with this right understanding, is all set to attain insight
    into the Four Noble Truths, and is said to have attained the Purity by Knowledge and
    Vision of the progress along the Path. This is counted as the fourth stage in vipassana
    and the sixth Purification. The Tipitaka contains no detailed explanation of the stages in
    this Knowledge and Vision of the progress along the Path, but later teachers recognized in
    it nine steps, as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">a) Vipassana has progressed properly, and the birth,
    aging, pain and death of phenomena have been thoroughly scrutinized. The arising and
    passing away of phenomena has been perceived in all clarity. All phenomenal existence is
    seen to consist of just an endless process of arising and ceasing like the glittering
    dazzle on the surface of the sea, or like the forming and bursting of the foamy crests of
    waves. This is known as knowledge of arising and passing away (Udayabbayanupassana -
    nana). It is brought about by concentrated introspection so clear, and sustained for so
    long a time that the knowledge becomes firmly established, like a dye absorbed by the
    mind, powerful enough to make the meditator become disenchanted with things and give up
    clinging to them. This is the first step in the Knowledge and Vision of the Progress along
    the Path.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">b) Arising and passing away, if observed simultaneously,
    cannot be perceived with such clarity as they can if either one is concentrated on
    separately. At this stage, the meditator gives up watching one of the two, namely arising,
    and concentrates exclusively on the passing away. This permits him to see the process of
    disintegration and decay in such depth and intensity that he comes to realize that decay
    and perishing are universally evident no matter where in the world one looks. A mind
    dwelling in this knowledge is said to be equipped with knowledge of decay and dissolution
    (Bhanganupassana - nana). This is the second step in the developing of knowledge.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">c) Knowledge of decay and dissolution, when sufficiently
    well developed, gives rise next to the awareness that all things are to be feared. All
    phenomenal existence, whether in the sensual realm, in the form realm, or in the formless
    realm, is seen as inherently fearsome. All spheres of existence are seen as thoroughly
    fearsome because the decay and dissolution of all phenomena is perceived in every
    conscious moment. Thus an intense apprehension arises in the mind of one possessing this
    awareness and becomes established as a genuine fear. This awareness sees nothing but
    fearsomeness, like poison, or deadly weapons, or vicious armed bandits, completely filling
    the three spheres of phenomenal existence-nothing but fearsomeness. This awareness of the
    fearsomeness (Bhayatupatthana-nana) of all phenomenal existence is reckoned as the third
    step.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">d) When awareness of the completely fearsome nature of all
    phenomenal existence has been fully developed, there will arise in its turn awareness that
    all things are inherently dangerous. To become involved in things is not safe. They are
    like a forest full of dangerous beasts, and anyone seeking diversion in the forest finds
    nothing pleasing there. This awareness of the danger (Adinavan- upassana - nana) inherent
    in all phenomenal existence is the fourth step.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">e) When all things are seen to be in every way full of
    danger this gives rise to disenchantment. Things are seen as resembling a burntout house
    of which nothing remains but ashes and a skeleton, utterly unattractive. This
    disenchantment (Nibbidanupassanaa - nana) with having to be associated with conditioned
    things is the fifth step in the developing of knowledge.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">f) When genuine disenchantment has become established,
    there arises a desire to become really free from those things. This is quite unlike our
    ordinary desire for freedom, which, lacking the power of concentration or insight to boost
    it up, is not real desire for freedom. The disenchantment arising out of vipassana insight
    involves the entire mind; and the desire for freedom is as great as the disenchantment, so
    is very real and genuine. This desire to escape from the unsatisfactoriness of phenomenal
    existence is as great as the desire for freedom a frog struggling to escape from a snake's
    jaws, or the desire for freedom of a deer or bird struggling to break loose from a snare.
    This real desire to escape (Muncitukamyata - nana) from unsatisfactoriness is the sixth
    step.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">g) Now with the full development of the desire to escape,
    there arises a feeling of an intense struggling to find a way out, an ever- present
    feeling that, phenomenal existence being as it is, one has to escape from it.
    Introspecting, one perceives the clinging and one perceives the defilements that are the
    cause of the mind's bondage, the fetters binding it securely to that condition.
    Consequently one seeks for ways of weakening the defilements. Then seeing the defilements
    weakened, one sets about destroying them completely.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This weakening of the defilements is illustrated by means
    of a simile. A man goes to his fish trap and pulls out a snake thinking it to be a fish.
    When told it is a snake, he doesn't believe it, at least not until he meets a wise,
    benevolent and sympathetic teacher, who guides and instructs him so that he comes to
    realize that it is in fact a snake. He then becomes afraid and searches about for a means
    of killing it. He grabs the snake by the neck and, lifting it above his head, swings it in
    a circle until it is worn out and falls down dead. This simile illustrates the arising of
    the knowledge that the defilements are the cause of people's bondage to a condition much
    to be feared and dreaded.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one has no technique for reducing the force of the
    defilements day by day, eradicating them is bound to be impossible. The power of the
    defilements far exceeds that of the still meager knowledge to be used in destroying them;
    hence knowledge must be developed and increased, and the suffering produced by the
    defilements will simultaneously diminish. Always maintaining and developing the knowledge
    that all things are transient, worthless and devoid of selfhood, that they are not worth
    getting or being, serves to cut off the food supply to the defilements, weakening them day
    by day. It behooves us to build ourselves up, develop, become more skillful and ingenious.
    By this means, we can conquer defilements the size of mountains, small though we may be.
    Our situation can be compared to that of a small mouse faced with the job of killing
    several tigers. We have to be really steadfast and always on the lookout for means
    appropriate to a small mouse. If we get nowhere, we must use all sorts of devices and
    techniques to weaken those tigers day by day rather than trying to kill them outright.
    This intense search for a way of escape (Patisankhanupassana - nana) constitutes the
    seventh step in the Knowledge and Vision of the Progress along the Path. h) This weakening
    of the defilements serves to make us progressively more and more independent of and
    oblivious to things. So this next step in the developing of right understanding, which
    results in imperturbability with respect to all things, consists in seeing all phenomena
    as empty, as devoid of essence, as devoid of status such as &quot;animal&quot; or
    &quot;person,&quot; devoid of substance or real permanence, devoid of worth because they
    are thoroughly unsatisfactory, and devoid of all attraction because they are thoroughly
    disenchanting. Ultimately the mind becomes independent of and unperturbed by anything in
    any realm of existence. Things formerly likable, desirable and infatuating, come to be
    seen as lumps of rock and earth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This too has been explained by means of a simile. A man
    who has always loved a certain woman may one day experience a change of heart and stop
    loving her. For instance, he will stop loving his wife if she is unfaithful. Once
    divorced, however, he is free to go ahead and do as he pleases; his mind can be
    unperturbed. And at this level of knowledge, conditions hitherto delightful, each in its
    own way, are recognized as devoid of substance, so that one can be independent of them and
    unperturbed by them in all circumstances, just like the man who becomes independent on
    divorcing his wife. This indifference to all phenomena (Sankharupekkha - nana) is the
    eighth step.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">i) The mind thus independent of and unmoved by all
    phenomenal existence is ready to perfect the Path and know the Four Noble Truths
    (Saccanulomika - nana). At this stage one is all set to overcome the defilements, to break
    the fetters binding one to the world, and become an Aryian of one degree or another. This
    is the ninth step in the process of Knowledge and Vision of the Progress along the Path.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this stepwise developing of knowledge, from knowledge
    of arising and passing away up to the state of readiness to perceive the Four Noble
    Truths, has been carried through to completion, one is said to have achieved the fourth
    state in vipassana, or the sixth Purification. The pure and perfect knowledge it yields is
    an instrument that reveals to the meditator the path by which he has come, and can lead on
    to the perfect intuitive insight that will destroy the defilements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This perfect intuitive insight, or Purity of Knowledge and
    Vision, the seventh Purification, is the insight that arises out of the perfected Path. It
    is the goal, the Fruit of vipassana practice. This insight that arises out of the
    perfected Path is the fifth and final stage in vipassana. In between the state of
    readiness to perceive the Noble Truths and this perfect intuitive insight comes
    &quot;qualifying&quot; knowledge (Gotrabhu - nana), which marks the point of transition
    from the ordinary defiled individual to the Aryian. But this qualifying knowledge lasts
    only an instant. It is the culmination of the progressive perfection of knowledge and is
    still at the level of good karma, still in the sensual realm.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To sum up, then, vipassana has as its foundation morality
    and concentration. What do we examine? The answer is: We examine all things, or to use
    other terms, the world, or phenomenal existence, or conditioned things, or the five
    aggregates, since all phenomenal existence consists of nothing apart from the five
    aggregates. What do we aim at seeing as a result of this scrutiny? We aim at seeing the
    transience, the unsatisfactoriness, the non-selfhood inherent in all things in the world.
    We observe them arising, persisting and ceasing until we come to perceive them as
    absolutely fearsome and disenchanting, and realize that nothing is worth getting or being.
    These are the conditions that ought to arise in vipassana practice. What is the objective
    of vipassana? The immediate objective of vipassana is to reduce delusion, the meaning of
    &quot;vipassana&quot; being &quot;clear vision.&quot; What is the fruit of vipassana? The
    fruit is the arising of clear intuitive insight, clear and enduring insight into the
    nature of all things, which ultimately will reduce the defilements to nothing. With the
    defilements gone, there is just perfection, enlightenment, peace. Nothing remains to bind
    the mind to any worldly condition. As a result, there comes about a slipping free from the
    world, this place of slavery to sensuality. The mind is freed of suffering because it's
    freed for good of all craving or desire. The Buddha called this the attainment of the
    cessation of suffering, the attainment of the Fruit of the Path, Nirvana. To have achieved
    this is to have carried out to completion the task Buddhism has set for us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This shows us the path of insight that has to be walked.
    There are seven stages of Purification which must be integrated in this way, and nine
    steps in the process of developing knowledge of the world. These taken together are known
    as vipassana. In the Texts it is set out as an ordered system. The finer details can be
    found in the books written by later teachers. There is one important thing that must be
    realized, however, in order to avoid misunderstanding. It so happens that even in the
    field of Dhamma practice, the highest aspect of Buddhism, there are misguided people. At
    the present time there are many who have got hold of things that are not vipassana at all
    and are presenting them as being the real thing. They have made vipassana practice their
    means of livelihood. They win people over in order to get classes together, then proceed
    to certify them as noble ones (Ariyapuggala), modern style, all of which is most
    despicable and regrettable. </font></p>
