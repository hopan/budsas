  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This article originally appeared in <i>Vîma.msâ</i>
  the Journal of the Buddhist Society of Queensland for October 1983. It was
  reprinted subsequently in the <i>Young Buddhist</i> (Singapore). It was later
  issued in the <i>BSQ Tracts on Buddhism</i> series, but has been out of print
  for some time. In view of the continuing interest in this subject the booklet
  is being reissued.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The opportunity has been taken to make some
  stylistic changes, include some additional material and footnotes. There has
  been no change in the general argument advanced in the booklet. <a name="ch1"></a></font></p>
  <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">1. The Buddha's Three-Fold
  Rule</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vegetarianism is a growing practice in modern
  society and some of its-new-found enthusiasts have pointed an accusing finger
  at the Buddha who is recorded as having eaten meat, and at modern Buddhists
  who eat meat. In this situation it is worthwhile examining the attitude of the
  Buddha to the consumption of fish and meat. We shall first state the Rule
  which the Buddha laid down relating the consumption of fish and meat, and then
  investigate the rationale for this rule. While the Buddha's rule has been
  stated many times there is very little discussion of the rationale for this
  rule. It is this that the present work seeks to address.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is some controversy as to the exact
  composition of the last meal of sûkaramaddava eaten by the Buddha, some
  (following Buddhaghosa) considering it to be pork, others (following Mahayana
  sources) to be medicine or truffles. However there are other incidents
  recorded where the Buddha and the early Bhikkhus ate meat. The classic
  reference to this is in the story of the &quot;conversion&quot; of General Siha
  given in the Vinaya Piaka (Mahâvagga, VI, 31-2). The General had invited the
  Buddha and the Bhikkhus for a meal at which meat was served. The Jains who had
  earlier enjoyed the exclusive patronage of the General, now spread the story
  that Siha has a &quot;fat beast&quot; (thûla pasu) killed for the occasion,
  and the Buddha by knowingly partaking of its meat, had committed an act of
  grave karmic consequence (pâticcakamma). In fact the meat had not been
  specially slaughtered, but had been purchased on the market. The Buddha took
  the opportunity created by this incident to lay down the rule governing the
  consumption of fish and flesh. <a name="txt1"></a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Addressing the monks he said: &quot;Do not eat
  meat knowing that it has been killed specially for (your) use; I allow the use
  of fish and meat blameless <a href="#note1">[NOTE1]</a> in three ways, unseen,
  unheard and unsuspected&quot; (na bhikkave jâna.m udissakata ma.msa.m
  paribhunjitabba.m. <a name="txt2"></a>Anujânâmi bhikkave tiko.tiparisuddha.m
  maccama.msa.m adi.t.ta.m asuta.m aparisankitan ti [V I 233]). We shall refer
  to this rule as the Buddha's three-fold rule on meat eating <a href="#note2">[NOTE
  2]</a>. The three conditions postulated amount to not witnessing the actual
  killing, not being told that the meat had been specially killed (for the use
  of the consumer), and even in the absence of such information not suspecting
  that such was the case (i.e. the eye, ear and mind should be satisfied as to
  the &quot;blamelessness&quot; of the meat).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the light of the three-fold rule the Pali
  texts make a distinction between two kinds of meat, called respectively
  uddissakatamasa and pavattamasa. The former term is used to refer to meat
  destined for a specific person's consumption. Such meat would not be cleared
  by the three-fold rule. Although not stated so a rough criterion which could
  be used to identify this kind of meat is that the person doing the killing has
  a clear notion that the meat would be consumed by a specific person, and if
  that person were to consume it that person would partake not only of the meat
  but also of the karmic consequences attached to the provision of that meat.
  The term used for the other kind of which it is permissible to eat
  (pavattamasa) literally means &quot;already existing meat&quot; (translated by
  Ms Horner as &quot;meat at hand&quot;). There has been some controversy as to
  what types of meat would fall into this category of &quot;already existing
  meat&quot;. Some interpreters have taken it to mean that it refers to the meat
  of animals killed accidentally or killed by other animals. But in fact it
  includes meat sold commercially. This is clear from another incident in the
  Vinaya where the lady Suppiyâ sends her servant to the market to fetch meat
  (to make a soup for a sick monk), and is told by the servant that
  &quot;existing meat&quot; could not be found as &quot;today is not a slaughter
  day&quot; (n'atth'ayye pavattama.msa.m mâghâto ajjâ ti). This shows that
  meat slaughtered for sale in the market was regarded as pavatta-masa and
  therefore falling into the category of permissible meat. This kind of meat is
  considered blameless because it is karmically neutral as far as the <a name="txt3"></a>consumer
  is concerned (but not of course for the provider of the meat who must take the
  full karmic responsibility). We shall refer to the two kinds of meat as
  karmically effective and karmically neutral meat <a href="#note2">[NOTE3]</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="txt4"></a>A shorter version of this
  incident is reported in the Anguttara Nikâya. In the Jivakasutta of the
  Majjima Nikâya the same rule is explained to Jivaka the physician. This sutta
  goes to great lengths to specify the wrong karmas that would accompany the
  violation of the three-fold rule. The rule is again reiterated when the Buddha
  rejected Devadatta's request to incorporate vegetarianism into the Vinaya <a href="#note4">[NOTE
  4]</a>. It has been reported that this rule also appears in the Vinayas of the
  other early &quot;Hinayâna&quot; schools like the Dharmaguptas and the Mula
  Sarvastavâdins (although not in their Sutras). It can therefore be considered
  to be an authentic rule of the Buddha.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The distinction between karmically effective
  and karmically neutral meat is based on moral grounds. However there are other
  arguments for vegetarianism; these will be considered in Section 4 below. The
  Buddha attached some importance to at least one of these other reasons as
  well. It was on this grounds that the meat <a name="txt5"></a>of ten kinds of
  living beings were prohibited. These were: humans, elephants, horses, dogs,
  snakes, lions, tigers, leopards, bears and hyenas. The texts simple declare
  that such meat is &quot;unsuitable&quot; (akappiya). There is no detailed
  discussion why these ten species were selected for the prohibition, but one
  would suspect that this was so because they were so considered by the Public
  at large <a href="#note5">[NOTE5]</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In view of the fact that only meat that was
  &quot;karmically neutral&quot; was permitted to the Buddhist community the
  Buddha requested that no meat should be consumed without enquiry as to its
  provenance: na ca bhikkhave appativekkhitvâ masa.m paribhunjitabba.m. Thus
  ignorance was no excuse if the wrong kind had been consumed. It was the
  responsibility of the consumer to determine the suitability of meat for his or
  her own consumption. These rules are specifically laid down with respect to
  monks, but they have been considered as applicable to the whole Buddhist
  community, both monk and lay.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Practices in modern Theravada countries
  differ. By and large in Sri Lanka only fish is served for monks although
  increasing number of monks are vegetarians. In Thailand there appears to be
  greater readiness to serve meat, and it has even been rumoured that some of
  this meat has been &quot;specially slaughtered&quot; for the use of the monks
  and therefore would fall into the category of karmically effective meat which
  violates the three-fold rule of the Buddha. <a name="ch2"></a></font></p>
  <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">2. Other Religious Views on
  Meat Eating</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's views on meat-eating should be
  put in the context of his times. The earliest Indian religious texts, the
  Vedas, did not prohibit meat eating or the killing of animals. Indeed large
  scale sacrifice became the norm, particularly the cruel ritual of the
  asvamedha which gradually assumed large dimensions as the power of the Indian
  rulers grew.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was the Upanishads that introduced, at
  first tentatively, the principle of non-injury (ahi.msâ) into Indian
  religious life. But even here sacrifice to the gods were permitted, though not
  on the scale that it had assumed in later Vedic times. The early Upanishads,
  like the Chandogya, permit the consumption of meat, especially if part of it
  is offered to god. It was only in post-Buddhist times that certain Hindu sects
  adopted vegetarianism as a general rule. But the rule was not universal and
  some Hindu sects, like those following the cult of Tara, engaged in ritual
  killing and consumption of meat. Most Hindus however either became
  vegetarians, or at least avoided some kinds of meat, notably beef.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is amongst the Jains that we find the most
  extreme assertion of the principle of ahi.msâ. They prohibited the killing of
  all forms of life, even microscopic organisms. Most of Jain ethics consists of
  a series of rules and regulations all related to the principle of ahi.msâ.
  Thus the Jain layperson's eight basic restraints (mûlaguna) involve
  abstention from meat, alcohol, honey, and five specific kinds of figs. The
  last seven kinds of foods were prohibited because they could harbour small
  organisms. In addition a whole host of other rules have to be kept, e.g. not
  eating after sunset (because cooking fires could attract insects to their
  death) and not drinking unfiltered water (which may contain organisms). Jain
  laypersons even excluded agriculture from their &quot;right livelihood&quot;
  occupations as agriculture too involves destruction of life. Many of them took
  to commerce and trade. The rules for the Jain monk (muni) was even more
  strict, some sects even avoiding clothing which could be destructive to bodily
  parasites. Some Jain munis even undertook the practice of fasting to death
  (sallekhana) because no kind of food can be really free of harm to animals
  (see the section below on the arguments for vegetarianism).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Amongst Buddhists vegetarianism was extolled
  by certain Mahayanist groups. Already in the Sanskrit version of the
  Mahâparinirvâna Sutra the following statement is attributed to the Buddha:
  &quot;I order the various disciples from today that they cannot any more
  partake of meat&quot;. This statement is, of course, absent in the Pali
  version of this Suttanata. It is well known that various statements have been
  interpolated into this sutta to get the Buddha's authority posthumously. The
  condemnation of meat eating occurs in other Mahayana sutras such as their
  version of the Brahmajâla Sutra, and more importantly the Lankâvatara Sutra.
  Chapter 8 of the latter sutra is devoted entirely to this question, and some
  24 arguments are advanced against the eating of meat. Some representative
  arguments adduced against meat eating in the Lankâvatara are:</font></p>
  <ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">present-day animals may have been one's
      kith and kin in the past;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">one's own parents and relatives may in a
      future life be born as an animal;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">there is no logic in exempting the meat of
      some animals on customary grounds while not exempting all meat;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">meat is impure as it is always contaminated
      by body wastes;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">the prospect of being killed spreads terror
      amongst animals;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">all meat is nothing other than carrion;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">meat eating makes the consumer to be cruel
      and sensual;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">man in not a carnivore by nature.</font></li>
  </ol>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this Sutra the Buddha instructs the
  Bodhisattva Mahamati thus: &quot;There is no meat that is pure in three ways:
  not premeditated, not asked for, and not impelled; therefore refrain from
  eating meat&quot;.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is clear that this is the Mahayana answer
  to the Buddha's three-fold rule given in the Pali and other
  &quot;Hinayana&quot; Canons. But the three conditions mentioned do not
  coincide with the conditions stipulated by the Buddha in the Pali suttas. In
  spite of the textual criticisms of meat eating Mahayanists have generally
  consumed meat in practice. This is particularly true of Tibetan Buddhists. The
  Dalai Lama has given the excuse that this is because of the poor soil and cold
  climate of Tibet which is no condusive to agriculture. But it may also be due
  to tantric influences under which fish and meat and two of the five
  &quot;M&quot;s which tantrists indulge in.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="txt6"></a>As we have seen the
  Theravada School sought to adhere to the Buddha's rule. The only notable
  exception was Devadatta's schism, which the Buddha categorically rejected even
  the rule of vegetarianism. However remnants of Devadatta's schism could still
  be seen in some of the tâpasa sects in Theravada <a href="#note6">[NOTE 6]</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The monotheistic religions that arose in the
  middle east (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) did not develop the ethic of
  non-injury to animals. Both Judaism and Islam required animal sacrifice to
  God, and they also specify the way in which animals have to be killed for
  human consumption (a way that is often cruel). According to the Bible God
  shortly after the Creation ordered humans to be vegetarians. This injunction
  however was short-lived and was revoked after the mythical &quot;Flood&quot;.
  Now humans were allowed to kill and eat meat with some curious restrictions
  relating to the shedding of blood. This is the basis of the cruel method of
  butchery resorted to by Jews and Muslims. The Judeo-Christian Bible sanctions
  the &quot;dominion&quot; which God had given to animals and the environment
  which has had severe consequences in history.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It will be seen that Buddhism takes a middle
  position between the Jain ahi.msâ ideal and the complete abandon of the
  Judeo-Christian-Islamic position. <a name="ch3"></a></font></p>
  <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">3. The Rationale for Buddha's
  Rule</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="txt7"></a>What is the rationale for
  the Buddha's three-fold rule on meat eating? It cannot be said that the hands
  of the consumer of &quot;karmically neutral&quot; meat are clean, especially
  if the meat is bought in the market as is the case with most consumers of
  meat. For it is a rule of the market place that without the demand there would
  be no supply <a href="#note7">[NOTE 7]</a>. At issue is the degree of
  involvement with the act of killing if meat of any sort (excepting
  accidentally killed animals, or those that have died naturally) is to be
  consumed. We may identify various degrees of involvement of the consumer with
  the act of killing. The most direct is where the consumer directly kills the
  animal whose flesh is eaten. The second degree of involvement is when an
  employee of someone under the direct power consumer is asked to do the
  killing. A variant of this degree of involvement is when consumer dines on
  meat offered by a friend or a relative who in turn had either directly killed
  or caused the animal to be directly killed. Both these degrees of involvement
  would fall outside the Buddha three-fold requirement and is prohibited to the
  Buddhist community.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next (third) degree of involvement is when
  the consumer buys the meat on the open market. The Buddha seems to have
  considered this as satisfying the three-fold rule and it is deemed karmically
  neutral. The reasons for permitting the third degree of involvement with the
  act of killing is not directly discussed in the Canon. So the reasons for it
  has to be inferred from the Buddha's position in general. It is this rationale
  that we hope to supply in this section.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The relationship of this degree of involvement
  in killing to the first precept of Buddhism (refraining from the taking of
  life) must first be explored. Karma adheres to acts of sovereign choice. It is
  true that a butcher will only kill animals for the sale of their meat only if
  there are consumers will to buy the meat. But is so doing the butcher is
  making a sovereign choice. There is no compulsion for the butcher to have
  become a butcher rather than say a baker or a candle-stick maker. If there
  were no persons willing to supply the meat trade meat eaters would, if they
  want to persist in their meat eating, be compelled to do their own killing
  thus incurring karmic responsibility. It is this lack of compulsion on the
  part of the consumer of the meat that really frees this type of meat consumer
  from the full karmic responsibility for the act of killing which made it
  possible for this person to buy the meat in the first place. Thus the Buddha
  could logically hold on to both the first precept of Buddhism and the
  three-fold rule of meat eating as not involving a logical contradiction.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most compelling argument for the Buddha's
  rule is that the whole of samsaric existence involves some from of killing or
  other. As will be shown in the next section the supply of
  &quot;vegetarian&quot; food also involves the destruction of life, sometimes
  to a greater extent than the supply of meat products. The stark reality is
  that both the vegetarian and the meat-eater by their very existence in samsara
  causes the destruction of some form of life or other. In fact it may be
  impossible to live at all without the destruction of life (as the Jain munis
  realised).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fundamental point in the Buddha's teaching
  is that the whole of samsâric existence involves some form of killing. This
  is indeed an aspect of dukkha, the omni-present reality. Instead of a
  fruitless effort to end all forms of killing, and make the world perfect in
  this respect, the Buddha laid a path to escape from samsara and all its
  defects. This involves abstaining from the grosser forms of evil, including
  the consumption of &quot;karmically effective&quot; meat, together with the
  co-development of other elements of the Eight-Fold Path.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha stressed graver ethical defects
  than meat-eating. The classic sutta in this regard is the Amagandha Sutta in
  the Sutta Nipâta, one of the earliest books of the Pali Canon. In this an
  unnamed vegetarian Brahmin confronts the Buddha proclaiming the evils of
  eating fish and flesh. The word âmaganda literally means the stench of fish
  and meat, and is also used to denote defilements. In his reply the Buddha
  utters a number of verses listing the real defilements that taint moral
  conduct. At the end of each verse he utters the refrain: ...esâmagandho no hi
  ma.msabhojana.m (&quot;... this is the stench giving defilement, not the
  consumption of meat&quot;).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's approach is validated in
  Darwinian theory. Darwin showed that all species are in constant conflict and
  that only the fittest survive. According to this the survival of any species
  is brought about by the non-survival of other species that compete for the
  same limited bio-space. The survival and proliferation of mankind must
  necessarily involve the destruction of countless lives irrespective of what
  the diet of humans is vegetarian or non-vegetarian. <a name="ch4"></a></font></p>
  <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">4. The Arguments for
  Vegetarianism</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We must next examine the ethical and other
  implications of vegetarianism. There are many arguments advanced for
  vegetarianism amongst which the following arguments should be considered: the
  moral argument, the biological argument, the ecological argument and the
  socio-cultural argument.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the religious point of view the moral
  argument is the most important and will be considered first. Many vegetarians
  relish in taking the moral high-ground. They claim either that their diet does
  not involve the killing and suffering of animals, or that even if it does so
  there would be greater suffering and animal killing if they adopted
  non-vegetarian diets. Of course it is a simple fact is that commercial
  agriculture, which is the basis of vegetarian diets, cannot be undertaken
  without the destruction of life. Even the very act of tilling the ground kills
  many earth-bound insect life, but the main form of killing comes from the need
  to protect crops and harvests from insects, predators and other vermin. We
  need only contemplate the wholesale killing of feral pigs, rabbits, kangaroos,
  etc. for this purpose, often using poison, traps, and man-induced diseases
  involving cruel and horrible deaths. The snails, grasshoppers, grubs, locusts
  and other insects destroyed by powerful insecticides number by the million.
  Even the number of rats killed to save the stored-up grain from being eaten
  greatly exceed the number of cattle slaughtered to feed the meat eaters.
  Indeed it could be argued that the number of animals and insects killed to
  produce the average vegetarian meal greatly exceeds the number of animals
  killed to produce the a non-vegetarian meal of equal food value. If this is so
  the adoption of a vegetarian diet may actually increase the number lives lost
  in the food production process.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also many vegetarians use animal products like
  milk. While it might appear that this is a &quot;humane&quot; food as no
  killing is resorted to this may not really be the case. Suppose that everyone
  gives up meat-eating but retains milk-drinking. A consequence would be that
  male calves will be killed at birth (except for a few kept for stud purposes),
  unless of course the unproductive bulls are maintained which is not likely to
  happen. Milk is meant by nature for the calves, and its forced appropriation
  by humans is questionable morals. It is curious to note that some of
  staunchest vegetarians like the Hare Khrishnas as also the most addicted to
  the use of milk products. They not appear to see the moral dilemma involved in
  their dietary habits. The Buddha's three-fold rule, while not a perfect one as
  none such exits, at least avoids the moral conundrums that must remain to
  confuse the ethically motivated vegetarian.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The biological argument for vegetarianism has
  greater validity than the moral one. It may well be that the human body is not
  designed to subsist on meat (as the Lankavatara Sutra claims). The two aspects
  of the human anatomy may suggest that vegetarian food is the normal food for
  humans. The first is the composition of human teeth (where molars are more
  important than the incisors), and the other is the rather large ratio of the
  length of the intestines to the body length in humans. Carnivores have incisor
  teeth to tear the flesh, and short intestines as the putrefying meat has to be
  expelled from the body as soon as possible. The human body is closer to that
  of herbivores, but not exclusive herbivores who have a different structure to
  their stomachs. In fact the human anatomy is a compromise between the pure
  herbivore and the pure carnivore - in fact it is that of an omnivore. Also the
  harmful effects from the consumption of animal products (e.g. cholesterol) are
  not counterbalanced by the alleged lack of high grade protein in vegetarian
  diets. On balance the biological argument seems to favour vegetarianism over
  meat-eating.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ecological argument too is in favour of
  vegetarianism. Meat is a very inefficient way of converting energy into food.
  It is far easier and cheaper to convert energy into biomass that is suitable
  for direct consumption by humans rather than indirectly after feeding it to
  animals and then consuming the flesh of the animals. Mass production of
  livestock (chickens, pigs, cattle) would either lead to cutting down of native
  forests to create grazing lands, or under the battery method lead to great
  cruelty, release of methane, etc. Selective breeding of farm animals and use
  of chemicals and hormones to enhance growth can have unexpected side effects
  in other areas. But it must be mentioned that conversion into vegetarianism
  will not necessarily improve the environment ecologically. What is needed is a
  decline in the population, and the adoption of living standards that are
  sustainable without environmental damage.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The socio-cultural argument involves the
  aesthetic argument of what society considers fit to eat. Social norms differ
  in this respect. Most societies have ruled out cannibalism, and do not permit
  the consumption of carrion and scavenging of dead animals. In most Western
  countries and in the Indian subcontinent there is a general aversion to eating
  pets (dogs, cats) or reptiles. However no such inhibitions exist in parts of
  Africa and the Far East (although in China in 511 CE the Emperor Wu of Liang
  prohibited the consumption of meat). Logically there is no difference between
  eating one species of animal and avoiding another. But aesthetically and
  culturally there can be a significant difference. Certainly vegetarians foods
  are more aesthetic than mead products however well the latter may be dressed
  up to be. <a name="ch5"></a></font></p>
  <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">5. Conclusion</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The foregoing argument should not be taken as
  a justification of meat-eating. Our concern is to speculate on the rationale
  behind the three-fold rule on this subject enunciated by the Buddha and to
  refute the charge that the Buddha's rule involves a moral contradiction with
  the other parts of the Buddha's teaching such as his insistence on
  loving-kindness and the precept on the taking of life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many compelling arguments for
  vegetarianism, the most important of these being the biological, ecological
  and social arguments we have identified in the previous section. The moral
  argument on which many vegetarians adopt to claim to a morality which is even
  higher than that taught by the Buddha has been shown to be invalid. In fact if
  people were to switch over from meat-eating to vegetarianism there will not
  necessarily be a reduction in the amount of killing and cruelty involved in
  the provision of food. Only different kinds of animals are likely to suffer.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is also another interesting moral point
  to resolve. Most of the animals killed for human consumption are deliberately
  bred for this purpose (e.g. chickens, pigs and cattle). If there were no
  demand for their meat the animals would not simply exist. Thus abolition of
  meat eating will not in the long run &quot;save&quot; any animals as these
  animals will simply not be reared. The problem is whether it is morally
  preferable for some animals to be kept alive for a limited period rather than
  not allow them to exist at all. Without meat consumers most of the animals not
  slaughtered for food would not have existed at all. We shall not examine the
  moral conundrum involved in this question.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's requirement was for moderation in
  eating (matta¤¤uta ca bhattasmi). Whether vegetarian or meat diets are used
  eating should be restricted to the minimum that is necessary to keep the
  bodily functions going. The Vinaya rule of not eating after mid-day may be
  related to this rule of moderation in consumption. But however careful one may
  be in the matter of diet, there is no way to keep one's body going in a
  material sense that does not cause harm to some other organism. The
  interdependence between organisms ensures that the survival of any one species
  - even the human species - must involve the destruction of other forms of
  life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even though there is no blanket proscription
  on meat eating in the Buddha's teaching the three-fold rule that he enunciated
  has considerable value. The Buddha was concerned with devising a practical
  rule that will reconcile the dilemma involved in living in samsara and
  allowing other life forms too to exist. The fact that the three-fold rule is
  not ideal is not a reflection on the Buddha but of the existential fact that
  samsâra-faring must involve harm to others. The Buddha's final solution to
  this is perhaps the only way in which this problem could be satisfactorily
  solved. This solution is to chart a course to get out of phenomenal existence,
  i.e. chart a path to Nibbâna.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="note1"></a><b>1.</b> The term
  parisuddha is best translated as &quot;blameless&quot; rather than the more
  literal &quot;pure&quot; which is the rendition favoured by Horner (who
  translated the Vinaya for the Pali Text Society). It is the karmic quality of
  the meat that is important, not its purity in other respects. <a href="#txt1">[Return]</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="note2"></a><b>2.</b> The word
  &quot;meat&quot; will be used to designate all forms of food derived from
  animals whether they fish, flesh or fowl. From the ethico-moral perspective
  there is no essential difference between these various form of flesh. <a href="#txt2">[Return]</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="note3"></a><b>3.</b> The relationship
  of meat-eating to karma is not specifically made by the Buddha. The
  distinction we have made should be treated with care. Even the consumption of
  what we have termed-&quot;non-karmically effective&quot; meat can have adverse
  karmic effects depending on the thought moments that accompany the consumption
  of that meat. What is meant however is that the consumption of what we have
  called &quot;karmically effective meat&quot; will always have adverse karmic
  consequences, while the other kind of meat may have adverse consequence. In
  neither case can there be any good karmic effects. <a href="#txt3">[Return]</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="note4"></a><b>4.</b> The rule of
  vegetarianism was the fifth of a list of rules which Devadatta had proposed to
  the Buddha. Devadatta was the founder of the tâpasa movement in Buddhism and
  his special rules involved ascetic and austere practices (forest-dwelling,
  wearing only rags, etc). The Buddha rejected all the proposed revisions of
  Devadatta, and it was in this context that he reiterated the tikoiparisuddha
  rule. (On this see the author's <b>Western Buddhism and a Theravâda
  heterodoxy</b>, <i>BSQ Tracts on Buddhism.</i> <a href="#txt4">[Return]</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="note5"></a> <b>5.</b> In general the
  Buddha tended to accept currently prevailing social customs unless there was a
  direct conflict with the Dhammic principles. In this case there was no need to
  change current practices. It is interesting to note that the ten kinds of
  animals does not include the ox or cow. This was later to become of one of the
  greatest taboos of Hinduism. Perhaps at the time of this Buddha this aspect of
  Hinduism had not developed the importance that it was later to assume. <a href="#txt5">[Return]</a></font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="note7"></a> <b>7.</b> The argument
  that the animal is already dead when its meat is bought is not a valid one.
  Most butchers and meat shops sell out of stocks they hold. When a sale is made
  the seller orders more stock to replace the item sold. Thus when an already
  dead chicken is bought an order is sent out to kill another chicken to replace
  the one sold. <a href="#txt7">[Return]</a></font></p>
