      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>his fullmoon day of Unduvap the Buddhists of Sri Lanka honour the memory
    of Sanghamitta Theri who together with her brother Mahinda Thera was responsible for the
    establishing of Buddhism in this country 2300 years ago in the reign of Devanampiya Tissa.
    A significant feature is that when Mahinda Thera preached the Dhamma in Anuradhapura the
    most enthusiastic listeners were women; those of royal rank as well as the commoners. This
    remains so to this day for in any Buddhist event the women far outnumber the men.
      </FONT> <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Having
    listened to Mahinda Thera's sermon, Queen Anula, wife of the sub king Mahanaga, convinced
    of the truth of the Buddha word, informed the king of her desire to become a bhikkhuni.
    When this was conveyed to Mahinda Thera he pointed out that according to the rules of the
    Vinaya it was not permissable for him to bestow the pabbajja on women. Further he said
    that this could be accomplished if the king sent a message to king Asoka Maurya who ruled
    from Pataliputra (modern Patna) requesting him to send his daughter Sanghamitta Theri and
    also to bring with her a branch of the Bodhi Tree at Gaya under which the Buddha attained
    enlightenment. </FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It should be mentioned that diplomatic relations had already been established between
    the Court of Anuradhapura and that of Pataliputra. Hence Devanampiya Tissa did not
    hesitate to send his minister Arittha to the Mauryan king with these two earnest requests.
    </FONT>
    </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The king was reluctant to send his daughter on an overseas mission but because of the
    insistence of Sanghamitta Theri he finally agreed. Several nuns accompanied the Theri who
    sailed to Sri Lanka carrying the Bo sapling, together with the Minister Arittha. This was
    a very courageous action on the part of Sanghamitta. In an age when rigid Brahmanic ideas
    regarding women were prevailing in society it was indeed an act of great courage for a
    woman of royal birth to embark on a hazardous voyage unaccompanied by any male member of
    her family. She was indeed a liberated woman to defy the challenges of a male-dominated
    society. </FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At Jambukolapattana (modern Point Pedro in Jaffna Peninsula), a multitude of devotees
    headed by the king and Mahinda Thera received the Theri and the Bodhi Tree. It was brought
    in procession to Anuradhapura, a journey which took 14 days on foot, and planted it in the
    Mahamegha park on a specially prepared terrace. In the words of Paul E Pieris who was not
    a Buddhist, &quot;It is doubtful if any other single incident in the long story of their
    race has seized upon the history of the Sinhalese with such tenacity as this of the
    planting of the aged tree. </FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Like the pliant roots which find sustenance on the face of their bare rock and cleave
    their way through the stoutest fabric, the influence of what it represents has penetrated
    into the innermost being of the people till the tree itself has become almost human.&quot;
    The king and the people of Sri Lanka throughout 23 centuries have cherished this tree like
    a priceless treasure, the oldest historical tree in the world. Its hold on the people was
    so deep rooted that even the modern day terrorists thought that the best way to destroy
    the Sinhala psyche was to exterminate the Tree. </FONT> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Historical evidence</b></font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
    </FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Some scholars have expressed doubts on the Mahavamsa account of Sanghamitta and the
    historicity of the tree on the ground that there is no external evidence to corroborate
    the Sri Lanka tradition. Wilhelm Geiger, the german Orientalist who translated the
    Mahavansa into German firmly upholds the Mahavansa tradition. </FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The narrative of the transplanting of the Bodhi Tree finds interesting confirmation
    from archaeological evidence. He says that another scholar Grundewel has shown in a very
    convincing way that the sculptures of the gate of the Sanchi Stupa are representations of
    that event. </FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sanchi, it should be remembered is the childhood home of Sanghamitta and Mahinda and it
    is reasonable to assume that Sanghamitta's memory was revered in the place of her birth.
    Since the Sanchi sculptures belong to the 2nd Century BC the representation is only about
    100-150 years after the coming of Sanghamitta. Hence we have near contemporary evidence on
    stone to corroborate the Mahavansa story of the coming of Sanghamitta. Further there is a
    village called Kantarodai in the Jaffna Peninsula originally known as Kadurugoda Vihara.
    </FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The entire area was preserved as an archaeological site when I visited Jaffna in 1971
    and the surrounding villagers informed me that there is a strong tradition prevailing up
    to that day saying that Sanghamitta rested on that spot on her way to Anuradhapura. I am
    not aware what has happened to the archaeological site now but at that time it was
    scattered with pre Christian ruins and also a number of small stupas resembling the stupa
    at Sanchi. </FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is clear that Kadurugoda Vihara developed into a hallowed spot and because of the
    Sanghamitta connection had brisk intercourse with Sanchi. Paul E Pieris writing in 1919 to
    the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society said that Kantarodai is a miniature Anuradhapura.
    </FONT>
    </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Besides all this evidence there is the far famed tree itself still firmly rooted in Sri
    Lankan soil while literary works like the Bodhivamsa, Maha Bodhivamsa, Sulu Bodhivamsa
    bear witness to its antiquity and sacrosanctity. </FONT> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>The Bhikkhuni Sasana</b></font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
    </FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sanghamitta Theri then accomplished her most important mission by ordaining Anuladevi
    and her retinue and established the Bhikkhuni Sasana in Sri Lanka. The charisma and impact
    of the founder was such that the Sri Lanka Bhikkunis were illustrious and erudite women
    who were internationally renowned and emulated their founder by travelling overseas to
    spread the Dhamma. </FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">According to Chinese sources, they sailed to China and began a Chinese Order of Nuns
    which lasts to this day. They specialised in different sections of the Pali Canon and
    taught their specialties all over the island. </FONT> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Liberation of Sri Lankan women</b></font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
    </FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The arrival of Sanghamitta had a significant impact on Sri Lankan womanhood. Many
    visitors to Sri Lanka long before the impact of the West was ever felt have commented on
    the social freedom that Sri Lankan women enjoyed that there was no segregation of the
    sexes and that they participated in the social, religious and economic life of the
    community. </FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This was Sanghamitta's legacy and the example of the bold and adventurous band of nuns
    she nurtured. </FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">She was the first woman ambassador mentioned in recorded history, sent from one Head of
    State at the express invitation of another Head of State. Belonging to the ecclesiastical
    tradition of Maha Prajapati Gotami, the first Buddhist nun, she displayed the same
    qualities as the latter - courage and determination and not taking no for an answer.
    </FONT> </p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">She remained in Sri Lanka for the rest of the life working for the uplift of Sri Lankan
    women, far away from home, kith and kin. To Sanghamitta Theri, a woman liberated in every
    sense of the word, the women of Sri Lanka owe a deep debt of gratitude.
