    <p>&quot;Monks, these <a name="4indiv">four types</a> of
    individuals are to be found existing in world. Which four? </p>
    <p>&quot;There is the case of the individual who has attained
    internal tranquillity of awareness, but not insight into
    phenomena through heightened discernment. Then there is the
    case of the individual who has attained insight into
    phenomena through heightened discernment, but not internal
    tranquillity of awareness. Then there is the case of the
    individual who has attained neither internal tranquillity of
    awareness nor insight into phenomena through heightened
    discernment. And then there is the case of the individual who
    has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness and
    insight into phenomena through heightened discernment. </p>
    <p>&quot;The individual who has attained internal
    tranquillity of awareness, but not insight into phenomena
    through heightened discernment, should approach an individual
    who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened
    discernment and ask him: 'How should fabrications be
    regarded? How should they be investigated? How should they be
    seen with insight?' The other will answer in line with what
    he has seen and experienced: 'Fabrications should be regarded
    in this way. Fabrications should be investigated in this way.
    Fabrications should be seen in this way with insight.' Then
    eventually he [the first] will become one who has attained
    both internal tranquillity of awareness and insight into
    phenomena through heightened discernment. </p>
    <p>&quot;As for the individual who has attained insight into
    phenomena through heightened discernment, but not internal
    tranquillity of awareness, he should approach an individual
    who has attained internal tranquillity of awareness...and ask
    him, 'How should the mind be steadied? How should it be made
    to settle down? How should it be unified? How should it be
    concentrated?' The other will answer in line with what he has
    seen and experienced: 'The mind should be steadied in this
    way. The mind should be made to settle down in this way. The
    mind should be unified in this way. The mind should be
    concentrated in this way.' Then eventually he [the first]
    will become one who has attained both internal tranquillity
    of awareness and insight into phenomena through heightened
    discernment. </p>
    <p>&quot;As for the individual who has attained neither
    internal tranquillity of awareness nor insight into phenomena
    through heightened discernment, he should approach an
    individual who has attained both internal tranquillity of
    awareness and insight into phenomena through heightened
    discernment...and ask him, 'How should the mind be steadied?
    How should it be made to settle down? How should it be
    unified? How should it be concentrated? How should
    fabrications be regarded? How should they be investigated?
    How should they be seen with insight?' The other will answer
    in line with what he has seen and experienced: 'The mind
    should be steadied in this way. The mind should be made to
    settle down in this way. The mind should be unified in this
    way. The mind should be concentrated in this way.
    Fabrications should be regarded in this way. Fabrications
    should be investigated in this way. Fabrications should be
    seen in this way with insight.' Then eventually he [the
    first] will become one who has attained both internal
    tranquillity of awareness and insight into phenomena through
    heightened discernment. </p>
    <p>&quot;As for the individual who has attained both internal
    tranquillity of awareness and insight into phenomena through
    heightened discernment, his duty is to make an effort in
    establishing ('tuning') those very same skillful qualities to
    a higher degree for the ending of the (mental) fermentations.
    </p>
    <p>&quot;These are four types of individuals to be found
    existing in world.&quot; </p>
