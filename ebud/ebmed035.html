          </I><FONT SIZE="6">
          <P>M</FONT>editation is the way to achieve letting go. In meditation 
          one lets go of the complex world outside in order to reach the serene 
          world inside. In all types of mysticism, in many traditions, this is 
          known as the path to the pure and powerful mind. The experience of 
          this pure mind, released from the world, is very wonderful and 
          blissful.</P>
          <P>Often with meditation, there will be some hard work at the 
          beginning, but be willing to bear that hard work knowing that it will 
          lead you to experience some very beautiful and meaningful states. They 
          will be well worth the effort! It is a law of nature that without 
          effort one does not make progress. Whether one is a layperson or a 
          monk, without effort one gets nowhere, in meditation or in anything.</P>
          <P>Effort alone, though, is not sufficient. The effort needs to be 
          skilful. This means directing your energy just at the right places and 
          sustaining it there until its task is completed. Skilful effort 
          neither hinders nor disturbs you, instead it produces the beautiful 
          peace of deep meditation.</P>
          <P>In order to know where your effort should be directed, you must 
          have a clear understanding of the goal of meditation. The goal of this 
          meditation is the beautiful silence, stillness and clarity of mind. If 
          you can understand that goal then the place to apply your effort, the 
          means to achieve the goal become very clear.</P>
          <P>The effort is directed to letting go, to developing a mind that 
          inclines to abandoning. One of the many simple but profound statements 
          of the Lord Buddha is that &quot;a meditator whose mind inclines to 
          abandoning, easily achieves <I>Sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi</FONT></I>&quot;. 
          Such a meditator gains these states of inner bliss almost 
          automatically. What the Lord Buddha was saying was that the major 
          cause for attaining deep meditation, for reaching these powerful 
          states, is the willingness to abandon, to let go and to renounce.</P>
          <P>During meditation, we are not going to develop a mind which 
          accumulates and holds on to things, but instead we develop a mind 
          which is willing to let go of things, to let go of burdens. Outside of 
          meditation we have to carry the burden of our many duties, like so 
          many heavy suitcases, but within the period of meditation so much 
          baggage is unnecessary. So, in meditation, see much baggage you can 
          unload. Think of these things as burdens, heavy weights pressing upon 
          you. Then you have the right attitude for letting go of these things, 
          abandoning them freely without looking back. This effort, this 
          attitude, this movement of mind that inclines to giving up, is what 
          will lead you into deep<I> </I>meditation<I><B>. </B></I>Even during 
          the beginning stages of this meditation, see if you can generate the 
          energy of renunciation, the willingness to give things away, and 
          little by little the letting go will occur. As you give things away in 
          your mind you will feel much lighter, unburdened and free. In the way 
          of meditation, this abandoning of things occurs in stages, step by 
          step.</P>
          <P>You may go through the initial stages quickly if you wish, but be 
          very careful if you so do. Sometimes, when you pass through the 
          initial steps too quickly, you find that preparatory work has not been 
          completed. It is like trying to build a town house on a very weak and 
          rushed foundation. The structure goes up very quickly, but it comes 
          down very quickly as well! So you are wise to spend a lot of time on 
          the foundations, and on the &quot;first storey&quot; as well, making the 
          groundwork well done, strong and firm. Then when you proceed to the 
          higher storeys, the bliss states of meditation, they too are stable 
          and firm.</P>
          <P>In the way that I teach meditation, I like to begin at the very 
          simple stage of giving up the baggage of past and future. Sometimes 
          you may think that this is such an easy thing to do, that it is too 
          basic. However, if you give it your full effort, not running ahead to 
          the higher stages of meditation until you have properly reached the 
          first goal of <I><B>sustained attention on the present moment</B></I>, 
          then you will find later on that you have established a very strong 
          foundation on which to build the higher stages.</P>
          <P>Abandoning the past means not even thinking about your work, your 
          family, your commitments, your responsibilities,<I> </I>your history, 
          the good or bad times you had as a child..., you abandon all past 
          experiences by showing no interest in them at all. You become someone 
          who has no history during the time that you meditate. You do not even 
          think about where you are from, where you were born, who your parents 
          were or what your upbringing was like. All of that history is 
          renounced in meditation. In this way, everyone here on the retreat 
          becomes equal, just a meditator. It becomes unimportant how many years 
          you have been meditating, whether you are an old hand or a beginner. 
          If you abandon all that history, then, we are all equal and free. We 
          are freeing ourselves of some of these concerns, perceptions and 
          thoughts which limit us and which stop us from developing the peace 
          born of letting go. So every &quot;part&quot; of your history you finally let go 
          of, even the history of what has happened to you so far in this 
          retreat, even the memory of what happened to you just a moment ago! In 
          this way, you carry no burden from the past into the present. Whatever 
          has just happened, you are no longer interested in it and you let it 
          go. You do not allow the past to reverberate in your mind.</P>
          <P>I describe this as developing your mind like a padded cell! When 
          any experience, perception or thought hits the wall of the &quot;padded 
          cell&quot;, it does not bounce back again. It just sinks into the padding 
          and stops right there. Thus we do not allow the past to echo in our 
          consciousness, certainly not the past of yesterday and all that time 
          before, because we are developing the mind inclined to letting go, 
          giving away and unburdening.</P>
          <P>Some people have the view that if they take up the past for 
          contemplation they can somehow learn from it and solve the problems of 
          the past. However, you should understand that when you gaze at the 
          past, you invariably look through distorted lenses. Whatever you think 
          it was like, in truth it was not quite like that! This is why people 
          have arguments about what actually happened, even a few moments ago. 
          It is well known to police who investigate traffic accidents that even 
          though the accident may have happened only half an hour ago, two 
          different eyewitnesses, both completely honest, will give different 
          accounts. Our memory is untrustworthy. If you consider just how 
          unreliable memory is, then you do not put value on thinking over the 
          past. Then you can let it go. You can bury it, just as you bury a 
          person who has died. You place them in a coffin then bury it, or 
          cremate it, and it is done with, finished. Do not linger on the past. 
          Do not continue to carry the coffins of dead moments on your head! If 
          you do, then you are weighing yourself down with heavy burdens which 
          do not really belong to you. Let all of the past go and you have the 
          ability to be free in the present moment.</P>
          <P>As for the future, the anticipations, fears, plans, and 
          expectations -- let all of that go too. The Lord Buddha once said 
          about the future &quot;whatever you think it will be, it will always be 
          something different&quot;! This future is known to the wise as uncertain, 
          unknown and so unpredictable. It is often complete stupidity to 
          anticipate the future, and always a great waste of your time to think 
          of the future in meditation.</P>
          <P>When you work with your mind, you find that the mind is so strange. 
          It can do some wonderful and unexpected things. It is very common for 
          meditators who are having a difficult time, who are not getting very 
          peaceful, to sit there thinking &quot;Here we go again, another hour of 
          frustration&quot;. Even though they begin thinking like that, anticipating 
          failure, something strange happens and they get into a very peaceful 
          meditation.</P>
          <P>Recently I heard of one man on his first ten day retreat. After the 
          first day his body was hurting so much he asked to go home. The 
          teacher said &quot;Stay one more day and the pain will disappear, I 
          promise&quot;. So he stayed another day, the pain got worse so he wanted to 
          go home again. The teacher repeated &quot;just one more day, the pain will 
          go&quot;. He stayed for a third day and the pain was even worse. For each 
          of nine days, in the evening he would go to the teacher and, in great 
          pain, ask to go home and the teacher would say, &quot;just one more day and 
          the pain will disappear&quot;. It went completely beyond his expectations 
          that, on the final day, when he started the first sit of the morning, 
          the pain did disappear! It did not come back. He could sit for long 
          periods with no pain at all! He was amazed at how wonderful is this 
          mind and how it can produce such unexpected results. So, you don't 
          know about the future. It can be so strange, even weird, completely 
          beyond whatever you expect. Experiences like this give you the wisdom 
          and courage to abandon all thoughts about the future, and all 
          expectation as well.</P>
          <P>When you're meditating and thinking &quot;How many more minutes are 
          there to go? How much longer have I to endure all of this?&quot; then that 
          is just wandering off into the future again. The pain could just 
          disappear in a moment. The next moment might be the free one. You just 
          cannot anticipate what is going to happen.</P>
          <P>When on retreat, you have been meditating for many sessions, you 
          may sometimes think that none of those meditations have been any good. 
          In the next meditation session you sit down and everything becomes so 
          peaceful and easy. You think &quot;Wow! Now I can meditate!&quot;, but the next 
          meditation is awful again. What's going on here?</P>
          <P>The first meditation teacher I had told me something which then 
          sounded quite strange. He said that there is no such thing as a bad 
          meditation! He was right. All those meditations which you called bad, 
          frustrating and not meeting your expectations, all those meditations 
          are where you do the hard work for your &quot;pay cheque&quot;...</P>
          <P>It is like a person who goes to work all day Monday and gets no 
          money at the end of the day. &quot;What am I doing this for?&quot;, he thinks. 
          He works all day Tuesday and still gets nothing. Another bad day. All 
          day Wednesday, all day Thursday, and still nothing to show for all the 
          hard work. That's four bad days in a row. Then along comes Friday, he 
          does exactly the same work as before and at the end of the day the 
          boss gives him a pay cheque. &quot;Wow! Why can't every day be a pay-day?!&quot;</P>
          <P>Why can't every meditation be &quot;pay-day&quot;? Now, do you understand the 
          simile? It is in the difficult meditations that you build up your 
          credit, you build up the causes for success. Working for peace in the 
          hard meditations, you build up your strength, the momentum for peace. 
          Then when there's enough credit of good qualities, the mind goes into 
          a good meditation and it feels like &quot;pay-day&quot;. It is in the bad 
          meditations that you do the work.</P>
          <P>In a recent retreat that I gave in Sydney, during interview time, a 
          lady told me that she had been angry with me all day, but for two 
          different reasons. In her early meditations she was having a difficult 
          time and was angry at me for not ringing the bell to end the 
          meditation early enough. In the later meditations she got into a 
          beautiful peaceful state and was angry at me for ringing the bell too 
          soon. The sessions were all the same length, exactly one hour. You 
          just can't win as a teacher, ringing the bell!</P>
          <P>This is what happens when you go anticipating the future, thinking 
          &quot;How many more minutes until the bell goes?&quot; That is where you torture 
          yourself, where you pick up a heavy burden which is none of your 
          business. So be very careful not to pick up the heavy suitcase of &quot;How 
          many more minutes are there to go?&quot; or &quot;What should I do next?&quot; If 
          that is what you are thinking, then you are not paying attention to 
          what is happening now. You are not doing the meditation. You have lost 
          the plot and are asking for trouble.</P>
          <P>In this stage of the meditation keep your attention right in the 
          present moment, to the point where you don't even know what day it is 
          or what time it is -- morning? afternoon? -- don't know! All you know 
          is what moment it is -- right now! In this way you arrive at this 
          beautiful monastic time scale where you are just meditating in the 
          moment, not aware of how many minutes have gone or how many remain, 
          not even remembering what day it is.</P>
          <P>Once, as a young monk in Thailand, I had actually forgotten what 
          year it was! It is marvelous living in that realm that is timeless, a 
          realm so much more free than the time driven world we usually have to 
          live in. In the timeless realm, you experience this moment, just as 
          all wise beings have been experiencing this same moment for thousands 
          of years. It has always been just like this, no different. You have 
          come into the reality of &quot;now&quot;.</P>
          <P>The reality of now is magnificent and awesome. When you have 
          abandoned all past and all future, it is as if you have come alive. 
          You are here, you are mindful. This is the first stage of the 
          meditation, just this mindfulness sustained only in the present. 
          Reaching here, you have done a great deal. You have let go of the 
          first burden which stops deep meditation. So put forth a lot of effort 
          to reach this first stage until it is strong, firm and well 
          established. Next, we will refine the present moment awareness into 
          the second stage of the meditation -- <I><B>silent awareness of the 
          present moment</B></I>.</P>

          <P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;Silence is so much more productive of wisdom and 
          clarity than thinking.&quot;</P>
          </I><FONT SIZE="6">
          <P>I</FONT>n Part 1 of this three-part article, I outlined the goal of 
          this meditation, which is the beautiful silence, stillness and clarity 
          of mind, pregnant with the most profound of insights. Then I pointed 
          out the underlying theme which runs like an unbroken thread throughout 
          all meditation, that is the letting go of material and mental burdens. 
          Lastly, in Part 1, I described at length the practice which leads to 
          what I call the first stage of this meditation, and that first stage 
          is attained when the meditator comfortably abides in the present 
          moment for long, unbroken periods of time. As I wrote in the previous 
          article &quot;The reality of now is magnificent and awesome... Reaching 
          here you have done a great deal. You have let go of the first burden 
          which stops deep meditation.&quot; But having achieved so much, one should 
          go further into the even more beautiful and truthful silence of the 
          mind.</P>
          <P>It is helpful, here, to clarify the difference between <I>silent 
          awareness of the present moment</I> and <I>thinking about it</I>. The 
          simile of watching a tennis match on TV is informative. When watching 
          such a match, you may notice that, in fact, there are two matches 
          occurring simultaneously -- there is the match that you see on the 
          screen, and there is the match that you hear described by the 
          commentator. Indeed, if an Australian is playing a New Zealander, then 
          the commentary from the Australian presenter or New Zealander 
          presenter is likely to be much different from what actually occurred! 
          Commentary is often biased. In this simile, watching the screen with 
          no commentary stands for silent awareness in meditation, paying 
          attention to the commentary stands for thinking about it. You should 
          realize that you are much closer to Truth when you observe without 
          commentary, when you experience just the silent awareness of the 
          present moment.</P>
          <P>Sometimes it is through the inner commentary that we think we know 
          the world. Actually, that inner speech does not know the world at all! 
          It is the inner speech that weaves the delusions that cause suffering. 
          It is the inner speech that causes us to be angry at those we make our 
          enemies, and to have dangerous attachments to those we make our loved 
          ones. Inner speech causes all of life's problems. It constructs fear 
          and guilt. It creates anxiety and depression. It builds these 
          illusions as surely as the skilful commentator on TV can manipulate an 
          audience to create anger or tears. So if you seek for Truth, you 
          should value silent awareness, considering it more important, when 
          meditating, than any thought whatsoever.</P>
          <P>It is the high value that one gives to one's thoughts that is the 
          major obstacle to silent awareness. Carefully removing the importance 
          one gives to one's thinking and realizing the value and truthfulness 
          of silent awareness is the insight that makes this second stage -- 
          silent awareness of the present moment -- possible.</P>
          <P>One of the beautiful ways of overcoming the inner commentary is to 
          develop such refined present moment awareness, that you are watching 
          every moment so closely that you simply do not have the time to 
          comment about what has just happened. A thought is often an opinion on 
          what has just happened, e.g. &quot;That <I><B>was</B></I> good&quot;, &quot;That <I>
          <B>was</B></I> gross&quot;, &quot;What <I><B>was</B></I> that?&quot; All of these 
          comments are about an experience which has just passed by. When you 
          are noting, making a comment about an experience which has just 
          passed, then you are not paying attention to the experience which has 
          just arrived. You are dealing with old visitors and neglecting the new 
          visitors coming now!</P>
          <P>You may imagine your mind to be a host at a party, meeting the 
          guests as they come in the door. If one guest comes in and you meet 
          them and start talking to them about this that or the other, then you 
          are not doing your duty of paying attention to the new guest that 
          comes in the door. Because a guest comes in the door every moment, all 
          you can do is to greet one and then immediately go on to greet the 
          next one. You cannot afford to engage in even the shortest 
          conversation with any guest, since this would mean you will miss the 
          one coming in next. In meditation, all experiences come through the 
          door of our senses into the mind one by one in succession. If you 
          greet one experience with mindfulness and then get into conversation 
          with your guest, then you will miss the next experience following 
          right behind.</P>
          <P>When you are perfectly in the moment with every experience, with 
          every guest which comes in your mind, then you just do not have the 
          space for inner speech. You can not chatter to yourself because you 
          are completely taken up with mindfully greeting everything just as it 
          arrives in your mind. This is refined present moment awareness to the 
          level that it becomes silent awareness of the present in every moment.</P>
          <P>You discover, on developing that degree of inner silence, that this 
          is like giving up another great burden. It is as if you have been 
          carrying a big heavy rucksack on your back for forty or fifty years 
          continuously and during that time you have wearily trudged through 
          many many miles. Now you have had the courage and found the wisdom to 
          take that rucksack off and put it on the ground for a while. One feels 
          so immensely relieved, so light, so free because one is now not 
          burdened with that heavy rucksack of inner chatter.</P>
          <P>Another useful method of developing silent awareness is to 
          recognize the space between thoughts, between periods of inner 
          chatter. If you attend closely with sharp mindfulness, when one 
          thought ends and before another thought begins -- There! That is 
          silent awareness! It may be only momentary at first, but as you 
          recognize that fleeting silence you become accustomed to it, and as 
          you become accustomed to it then the silence lasts longer. You begin 
          to enjoy the silence, once you have found it at last, and that is why 
          it grows. But remember, silence is shy. If silence hears you talking 
          about her, she vanishes immediately!</P>
          <P>It would be marvelous for each one of us if we could abandon the 
          inner speech and abide in silent awareness of the present moment long 
          enough to realize how delightful it is. Silence is so much more 
          productive of wisdom and clarity than thinking. When you realize how 
          much more enjoyable and valuable it is to be silent within, then 
          silence becomes more attractive and important to you. The Inner 
          Silence becomes what the mind inclines towards. The mind seeks out 
          silence constantly, to the point where it only thinks if it really has 
          to, only if there is some point to it. Since, at this stage, you have 
          realized that most of our thinking is really pointless anyway, that it 
          gets you nowhere, only giving you many headaches, you gladly and 
          easily spend much time in inner quiet.</P>
          <P>The second stage of this meditation, then, is <I><B>silent 
          awareness of the present moment</B></I>. You may spend the majority of 
          your time just developing these two stages because if you can get this 
          far then you have gone a long way indeed in your meditation. In that 
          silent awareness of &quot;Just Now&quot; you will experience much peace, joy and 
          consequent wisdom.</P>
          <P>If you want to go further, then instead of being silently aware of 
          whatever comes into the mind, you choose silent present moment 
          awareness of just ONE THING. That ONE THING can be the experience of 
          breathing, the idea of loving kindness (Mett<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā), 
          a coloured circle visualised in the mind (Kasina) or several other, 
          less common, focal points for awareness. Here we will describe the
          </FONT><I><B>silent present moment awareness of the breath</B></I>.</P>
          <P>Choosing to fix one's attention on one thing is letting go of 
          diversity and moving to its opposite, unity. As the mind begins to 
          unify, sustaining attention on just one thing, the experience of 
          peace, bliss and power increases significantly. You discover here that 
          the diversity of consciousness, attending to six different senses -- 
          like having six telephones on one's desk ringing at the same time -- 
          is such a burden. Letting go of this diversity -- only permitting one 
          telephone, a private line at that, on one's desk -- is such a relief 
          it generates bliss. The understanding that diversity is a burden is 
          crucial to being able to settle on the breath.</P>
          <P>If you have developed silent awareness of the present moment 
          carefully for long periods of time, then you will find it quite easy 
          to turn that awareness on to the breath and follow that breath from 
          moment to moment without interruption. This is because the two major 
          obstacles to breath meditation have already been subdued. The first of 
          these two obstacles is the mind's tendency to go off into the past or 
          future, and the second obstacle is the inner speech. This is why I 
          teach the two preliminary stages of present moment awareness and 
          silent awareness of the present moment as a solid preparation for 
          deeper meditation on the breath.</P>
          <P>It often happens that meditators start breath meditation when their 
          mind is still jumping around between past and future, and when 
          awareness is being drowned by the inner commentary. With no 
          preparation they find breath meditation so difficult, even impossible 
          and give up in frustration. They give up because they did not start at 
          the right place. They did not perform the preparatory work before 
          taking up the breath as a focus of their attention. However, if your 
          mind has been well prepared by completing these first two stages, then 
          you will find when you turn to the breath, you can sustain your 
          attention on it with ease. If you find it difficult to keep attention 
          on your breath then this is a sign that you rushed the first two 
          stages. Go back to the preliminary exercises! Careful patience is the 
          fastest way.</P>
          <P>When you focus on the breath, you focus on the experience of the 
          breath happening now. You experience &quot;that which tells you what the 
          breath is doing&quot;, whether it is going in or out or in between. Some 
          teachers say to watch the breath at the tip of the nose, some say to 
          watch it at the abdomen and some say to move it here and then move it 
          there. I have found through experience that it does not matter where 
          you watch the breath. In fact, it is best not to locate the breath 
          anywhere! If you locate the breath at the tip of your nose, then it 
          becomes nose awareness, not breath awareness; and if you locate it at 
          your abdomen, then it becomes abdomen awareness. Just ask yourself the 
          question right now &quot;Am I breathing in or am I breathing out?&quot; How do 
          you know? There! That experience which tells you what the breath is 
          doing, that is what you focus on in breath meditation. Let go of 
          concern about where this experience is located; just focus on the 
          experience itself.</P>
          <P>A common hindrance at this stage is the tendency to control the 
          breathing, and this makes the breathing uncomfortable. To overcome 
          this hindrance, imagine that you are just a passenger in a car looking 
          through the window at your breath. You are not the driver, nor a &quot;back 
          seat driver&quot;, so stop giving orders, let go and enjoy the ride. Let 
          the breath do the breathing while you simply watch without 
          interfering.</P>
          <P>When you know the breath is going in, or the breath is going out, 
          for say one hundred breaths in a row, not missing one, then you have 
          achieved what I call the third stage of this meditation, <I><B>
          sustained attention on the breath</B></I>. This again is more peaceful 
          and joyful than the previous stage. To go deeper, you now aim for full 
          sustained attention on the breath.</P>
          <P>This fourth stage, or <I><B>full sustained attention on the breath</B></I>, 
          occurs when one's attention expands to take in every single moment of 
          the breath. You know the in-breath at the very first moment, when the 
          first sensation of in-breathing arises. Then you observe those 
          sensations develop gradually through the whole course of one 
          in-breath, not missing even a moment of the in-breath. When that 
          in-breath finishes, you know that moment, you see in your mind that 
          last movement of the in-breath. You then see the next moment as a 
          pause between breaths, and then many more pauses until the out-breath 
          begins. You see the first moment of the out-breath and each subsequent 
          sensation as the out-breath evolves, until the out-breath disappears 
          when its function is complete. All this is done in silence and just in 
          the present moment.</P>
          <P>You experience every part of each in-breath and out-breath, 
          continuously for many hundred breaths in a row. This is why this stage 
          is called &quot;FULL sustained attention on the breath'. You cannot reach 
          this stage through force, through holding or gripping. You can only 
          attain this degree of stillness by letting go of everything in the 
          entire universe, except for this momentary experience of breath 
          happening silently now. &quot;You&quot; don't reach this stage; the mind reaches 
          this stage. The mind does the work itself. The mind recognizes this 
          stage to be a very peaceful and pleasant abiding, just being alone 
          with the breath. This is where the &quot;doer&quot;, the major part of one's 
          ego, starts to disappear.</P>
          <P>You will find that progress happens effortlessly at this stage of 
          the meditation. You just have to get out of the way, let go, and watch 
          it all happen. The mind will automatically incline, if you only let 
          it, towards this very simple, peaceful and delicious unity of being 
          alone with one thing, just being with the breath in each and every 
          moment. This is the unity of mind, the unity in the moment, the unity 
          in stillness.</P>
          <P>The fourth stage is what I call the &quot;springboard&quot; of meditation, 
          because from here one can dive into the blissful states. When you 
          simply maintain this unity of consciousness, by not interfering, the 
          breath will begin to disappear. The breath appears to fade away as the 
          mind focuses instead on what is at the centre of the experience of 
          breath, which is the awesome peace, freedom and bliss.</P>
          <P>At this stage I use the term &quot;the beautiful breath&quot;. Here the mind 
          recognizes that this peaceful breath is extraordinarily beautiful. You 
          are aware of this beautiful breath continuously, moment after moment, 
          with no break in the chain of experience. You are only aware of the 
          beautiful breath, without effort, and for a very long time.</P>
          <P>Now you let the breath disappear and all that is left is &quot;the 
          beautiful&quot;. Disembodied beauty becomes the sole object of the mind. 
          The mind is now taking its own object. You are now not aware at all of 
          breath, body, thought sound or the world outside. All that you are 
          aware of is beauty, peace, bliss, light or whatever your perception 
          will later call it. You are experiencing only beauty, with nothing 
          being beautiful, continuously, effortlessly. You have long ago let go 
          of chatter, let go of descriptions and assessments. Here, the mind is 
          that still that you can not say anything.</P>
          <P>You are just experiencing the first flowering of bliss in the mind. 
          That bliss will develop, grow, become very firm and strong. Thus you 
          enter into those states of meditation called Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna.

          <P>P</FONT>arts 1 and 2 describe the first four stages (as they are 
          called here) of meditation. These are:</P>
          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>- Present moment awareness;<BR>
            - Silent awareness of the present moment;<BR>
            - Silent present moment awareness of the breath; and<BR>
            - Full sustained attention on the breath.</P>
          </BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>Each of these stages needs to be well developed before going <I>in</I> 
          to the next stage. When one rushes through these &quot;stages of letting 
          go&quot;, then the higher stages will be unreachable. It is like 
          constructing a tall building with inadequate foundations. The first 
          storey is built quickly and so is the second and third storey. When 
          the fourth storey is added, though, the structure begins to wobble a 
          bit. Then when they try to add a fifth storey, it all comes tumbling 
          down. So please take a lot of time on these four initial stages, 
          making them all firm and stable, before proceeding on to the fifth 
          stage. You should be able to maintain the fourth stage, &quot;full 
          sustained attention on the breath&quot;, aware of every moment of the 
          breath without a single break, for two or three hundred breaths in 
          succession with ease. I am not saying to count the breaths during this 
          stage, but I am giving an indication of the sort of time interval that 
          one should remain with stage four before proceeding further. In 
          meditation, patience is the fastest way!</P>
          <P>The fifth stage is called &quot;<I><B>full sustained attention on the 
          beautiful breath</B></I>&quot;. Often, this stage flows on naturally, 
          seamlessly, from the previous stage. As one's full attention rests 
          easily and continuously on the experience of breath, with nothing 
          interrupting the even flow of awareness, the breath calms down. It 
          changes from a coarse, ordinary breath, to a very smooth and peaceful 
          &quot;beautiful breath&quot;. The mind recognizes this beautiful breath and 
          delights in it. The mind experiences a deepening of contentment. It is 
          happy just to be there watching this beautiful breath. The mind does 
          not need to be forced. It stays with the beautiful breath by itself. 
          &quot;You&quot; don't do anything. If you try and do something at this stage, 
          you disturb the whole process, the beauty is lost and, like landing on 
          a snake's head in the game of snakes and ladders, you go back many 
          squares. The &quot;doer&quot; has to disappear from this stage of the meditation 
          on, with just the &quot;knower&quot; passively observing.</P>
          <P>A helpful trick to achieve this stage is to break the inner silence 
          just once and gently think to yourself: &quot;Calm!&quot;. That's all. At this 
          stage of the meditation, the mind is usually so sensitive that just a 
          little nudge like this causes the mind to follow the instruction 
          obediently. The breath calms down and the beautiful breath emerges.</P>
          <P>When you are passively observing just the beautiful breath in the 
          moment, the perception of &quot;in&quot; (breath) or &quot;out&quot; (breath), or 
          beginning or middle or end of a breath, should all be allowed to 
          disappear. All that is known is this experience of the beautiful 
          breath happening now. The mind is not concerned with what part of the 
          breath cycle this is in, nor on what part of the body this is 
          occurring. Here we are simplifying the object of meditation, the 
          experience of breath in the moment, stripping away all unnecessary 
          details, moving beyond the duality of &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot;, and just being 
          aware of a beautiful breath which appears smooth and continuous, 
          hardly changing at all.</P>
          <P>Do absolutely nothing and see how smooth and beautiful and timeless 
          the breath can appear. See how calm you can allow it to be. Take time 
          to savour the sweetness of the beautiful breath, ever calmer, ever 
          sweeter.</P>
          <P>Now the breath will disappear, not when &quot;you&quot; want it to but when 
          there is enough calm, leaving only &quot;the beautiful&quot;. A simile from 
          English literature might help. In Lewis Carrol's &quot;Alice in 
          Wonderland&quot;, Alice and the Red Queen saw a vision of a smiling 
          Cheshire cat appear in the sky. As they watched, first the cat's tail 
          disappeared, then its paws followed by the rest of its legs. Soon the 
          Cheshire cat's torso completely vanished leaving only the cat's head, 
          still with a smile. Then the head started to fade into nothing, from 
          the ears and whiskers inwards, and soon the smiling cat's head had 
          completely disappeared -- except for the smile which still remained in 
          the sky! This was a smile without any lips to do the smiling, but a 
          visible smile nevertheless. This is an accurate analogy for the 
          process of letting go happening at this point in meditation. The cat 
          with a smile on her face stands for the beautiful breath. The cat 
          disappearing represents the breath disappearing and the disembodied 
          smile still visible in the sky stands for the pure mental object 
          &quot;beauty&quot; clearly visible in the mind. </P>
          <P>This pure mental object is called a <I>Nimitta</I>. &quot;Nimitta&quot; means 
          &quot;a sign&quot;, here a mental sign. This is a real object in the landscape 
          of the mind (<I>citta</I>) and when it appears for the first time it 
          is extremely strange. One simply has not experienced anything like it 
          before. Nevertheless, the mental activity called &quot;perception&quot; searches 
          through its memory bank of life experiences for something even a 
          little bit similar in order to supply a description to the mind. For 
          most meditators, this &quot;disembodied beauty&quot;, this mental joy, is 
          perceived as a beautiful light. It is not a light. The eyes are closed 
          and the sight consciousness has long been turned off. It is the mind 
          consciousness freed for the first time from the world of the five 
          senses. It is like the full moon, here standing for the radiant mind, 
          coming out from behind the clouds, here standing for the world of the 
          five senses. It is the mind manifesting, not a light, but for most it 
          appears like a light, it is perceived as a light, because this 
          imperfect description is the best that perception can offer.</P>
          <P>For other meditators, perception chooses to describe this first 
          appearance of mind in terms of physical sensation, such as intense 
          tranquillity or ecstasy. Again, the body consciousness (that which 
          experiences pleasure and pain, heat and cold, and so on) has long 
          since closed down and this is not a physical feeling. It is just 
          &quot;perceived&quot; as similar to pleasure. Some see a white light, some a 
          gold star, some a blue pearl…the important fact to know is that they 
          are all describing the same phenomena. They all experience the same 
          pure mental object and these different details are added by their 
          different perceptions.</P>
          <P>You can recognize a nimitta by the following 6 features: </P>
          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>1) It appears only after the 5th stage of the meditation, after 
            the meditator has been with the beautiful breath for a long time;
            <BR>
            2) It appears when the breath disappears; <BR>
            3) It only comes with the external five senses of sight, hearing, 
            smell, taste and touch are completely absent; <BR>
            4) It manifests only in the silent mind, when descriptive thoughts 
            (inner speech) are totally absent;<BR>
            5) It is strange but powerfully attractive; and <BR>
            6) It is a beautifully simple object. </P>
          </BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>I mention these features so that you may distinguish real nimittas 
          from imaginary ones.</P>
          <P>The sixth stage, then, is called &quot;<I><B>experiencing the beautiful 
          nimitta</B></I>&quot;. It is achieved when one lets go of the body, 
          thought, and the five senses (including the awareness of the breath) 
          so completely that only the beautiful nimitta remains.</P>
          <P>Sometimes when the nimitta first arises it may appear &quot;dull&quot;. In 
          this case, one should go immediately back to the previous stage of the 
          meditation, continuous silent awareness of the beautiful breath. One 
          has moved to the nimitta too soon. Sometimes the nimitta is bright but 
          unstable, flashing on and off like a lighthouse beacon and then 
          disappearing. Again this shows that you have left the beautiful breath 
          too early. One must be able to sustain one's attention on the 
          beautiful breath with ease for a long, long time before the mind is 
          capable of maintaining clear attention on the far more subtle nimitta. 
          So train the mind on the beautiful breath, train it patiently and 
          diligently, then when it is time to go on to the nimitta, it is 
          bright, stable and easy to sustain.</P>
          <P>The main reason why the nimitta can appear dull is that the depth 
          of contentment is too shallow. You are still &quot;wanting&quot; something. 
          Usually, you are wanting the bright nimitta or you are wanting Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna. 
          Remember, and this is important, Jhānas are states of letting go, 
          incredibly deep states of contentment. So give away the hungry mind, 
          develop contentment on the beautiful breath and the nimitta and Jhāna 
          will happen by themselves.</P>
          </FONT>
          <P>The main reason why the nimitta is unstable is because the &quot;doer&quot; 
          just will not stop interfering. The &quot;doer&quot; is the controller, the back 
          seat driver, always getting involved where it does not belong and 
          messing everything up. This meditation is a natural process of coming 
          to rest and it requires &quot;you&quot; to get out of the way completely. Deep 
          meditation only occurs when you really let go, and this means <B>
          REALLY LET GO</B> to the point that the process becomes inaccessible 
          to the &quot;doer&quot;.</P>
          <P>A skilful means to achieve such profound letting go is to 
          deliberately offer the gift of confidence to the nimitta. Interrupt 
          the silence just for a moment, so so gently, and whisper as it were 
          inside your mind that you give complete trust to the nimitta, so that 
          the &quot;doer&quot; can relinquish all control and just disappear. The mind, 
          represented here by the nimitta before you, will then take over the 
          process as you watch it all happen.</P>
          <P>You do not need to do anything here because the intense beauty of 
          the nimitta is more than capable of holding the attention without your 
          assistance. Be careful, here, not to go assessing. Questions such as 
          &quot;What is this?&quot;, &quot;Is this Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna?&quot;, 
          &quot;What should I do next?&quot;, and so on are all the work of &quot;the doer&quot; 
          trying to get involved again. This is disturbing the process. You may 
          a</FONT>ssess 
          everything once the journey is over. A good scientist only assesses 
          the experiment at the end, when all the data are in. So now, do not 
          assess or try to work it all out. There is no need to pay attention to 
          the edge of the nimitta &quot;Is it round or oval?&quot;, &quot;Is the edge clear or 
          fuzzy?&quot;. This is all unnecessary and just leads to more diversity, 
          more duality of &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot;, and more disturbance.</P>
          <P>Let the mind incline where it wants, which is usually to the centre 
          of the nimitta. The centre is where the most beautiful part lies, 
          where the light is most brilliant and pure. Let go and just enjoy the 
          ride as the attention gets drawn into the centre and falls right 
          inside, or as the light expands all around enveloping you totally. 
          This is, in fact, one and the same experience perceived from different 
          perspectives. Let the mind merge in the bliss. Let the seventh stage 
          of this path of meditation, <I><B>First Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></B></I>, 
          occur.</P>
          <P>There are two common obstacles at the door into Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna: 
          exhilaration and fear. Exhilaration is becoming excited. If, at this 
          point, the mind thinks &quot;Wow, this is it!&quot; then the Jhāna is most 
          unlikely to happen. This &quot;Wow&quot; response needs to be subdued in favour 
          of absolute passivity. You can leave all the &quot;Wows&quot; until after 
          emerging from the Jhāna, where they properly belong. The more likely 
          obstacle, though, is fear. Fear arises at the recognition of the sheer 
          power and bliss of the Jhāna, or else at the recognition that to go 
          fully inside the Jhāna, something must be left behind -- You! The 
          &quot;doer&quot; is silent before Jhāna but still there. Inside Jhāna, the 
          &quot;doer&quot; is completely gone. The &quot;knower&quot; is still functioning, you are 
          fully aware, but all the</FONT> controls are now beyond reach. You 
          cannot even form a single thought, let alone make a decision. The will 
          is frozen, and this can appear scary to the beginner. Never before in 
          you whole life have you ever experienced being so stripped of all 
          control yet so fully awake. The fear is the fear of surrendering 
          something so essentially personal as the will to do.</P>
          <P>This fear can be overcome through confidence in the Buddha's 
          Teachings together with the enticing bliss just ahead that one can see 
          as the reward. The Lord Buddha often said that this bliss of Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna 
          &quot;should not be feared but should be followed, developed and practised 
          often&quot; (</FONT><I>Latukikopama Sutta, Majjhima Nik<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āya</FONT></I>). 
          So before fear arises, offer your full confidence to that bliss and 
          maintain faith in the Lord Buddha's Teachings and the example of the 
          Noble Disciples. Trust the Dhamma and let the Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna 
          warmly embrace you for an effortless, body-less and ego-less, blissful 
          experience that will be the most profound of your life. Have the 
          courage to fully relinq</FONT>uish control for a while and experience 
          all this for yourself.</P>
          <P>If it is a Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna it will last a long 
          time. It does not deserve to be called Jhāna if it lasts only a few 
          minutes. Usually, the higher Jhānas persist for many hours. Once 
          inside, there is no choice. You will emerge from the Jhāna only when 
          the mind is ready to come out, when the &quot;fuel&quot; of relinquishment that 
          was built up before is all used up. These are such still and 
          satisfying states of consciousness that their very nature is to 
          persist for a very long time. Another feature of Jhāna is that it 
          occurs only after the nimitta is discerned as described above. 
          Furthermore, you should know that while in any Jhāna it is impossible 
          to experience the body (e.g. physical pain), hear a sound from outside 
          o</FONT>r produce any thought, not even &quot;good&quot; thoughts. There is just 
          a clear singleness of perception, an experience of non-dualistic bliss 
          which continues unchanging for a very long time. This is not a trance, 
          but a state of heightened awareness. This is said so that you may know 
          for yourself whether what you take to be a Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna 
          is real or imaginary.</P>
          </FONT>
          <P>There is much more to meditation, but here only the basic method 
          has been described using seven stages culminating with the First Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna. 
          Much more could be said about the &quot;five hindrances&quot; and how they are 
          overcome, about the me</FONT>aning of mindfulness and how it is used, 
          about the Four <I>Satipatth<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna</FONT></I> 
          and the Four Roads to Success (<I>Iddhip<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āda</FONT></I>) 
          and the Five Controlling Faculties (<I>Indriya</I>) and, of course, 
          about the higher Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ānas. All these 
          concern this practice of meditation but must be l</FONT>eft for 
          another occasion.</P>
          <P>For those who are misled to conceive of all this as &quot;just <I>
          Samatha</I> practice&quot; without regard to Insight (<I>Vipassan<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT></I>), 
          please know that this is neither <I>Vipassan<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT></I> 
          nor <I>Samatha</I>. It is called &quot;<I>Bh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āvanā</FONT></I>&quot;, 
          the method taught by the Lord Buddha and repeated in the Forest 
          Tradition of N.E. Thailand of which my teacher, Ven. Ajahn Chah, was a 
          part. Ajahn Chah often said that <I>Samatha</I> and <I>Vipassan<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT></I> 
          can not be separated, nor can the pair be developed apart from Right 
          View, Right Thought, Right Moral Conduct and so forth. Indeed, to make 
          progress on the above seven stages, the meditator needs an 
          understanding and acceptance of the Lord Buddha's Teachings and one's 
          precepts must be pure. Insight will be needed to achieve each of these 
          stages, that is insight into the meaning of &quot;letting go&quot;. The further 
          one develops these stages, the more profound will be the insight, and 
          if you reach as far as Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna then it will 
          change your whole understanding. As it were, Insight dances around 
          Jhāna and Jhāna dances around Insight. This is the Path to </FONT><I>
          Nibb<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna,</FONT></I> for the Lord Buddha 
          said, &quot;for one who indulges in Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna, 
          four results are to be expected: Stream Winn</FONT>er, Once Returner, 
          Non Returner or Arahant&quot; (<I>P<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āsādika 
          Sutta, Dīgha Nikāya</FONT></I>).</P>
