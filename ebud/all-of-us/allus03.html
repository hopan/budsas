      <td width="100%"><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">O</font>ur
      old friend, //dukkha//, arises in the mind as dissatisfaction caused by all sorts of
      triggers. It can be triggered by bodily discomfort, but more often it is caused by the
      mind's own aberrations and convolutions. The mind creates //dukkha//, and that's why we
      must really watch and guard our minds.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Our own mind can make us happy, our own mind
      can make us unhappy. There is no person or thing in the whole world that will do this for
      us. All happenings act as triggers for us, which constantly catch us unawares. Therefore
      we need to develop strong awareness of our own mind-moments.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We have a good chance to do that in
      meditation. There are two directions in meditation, calm (//samatha//) and insight
      (//vipassana//). If we can achieve some calm, that indicates that concentration is
      improving. But unless that valuable skill is used for insight, it's a waste of time. If
      the mind becomes calm, joy often arises, but we must observe how fleeting and impermanent
      that joy is, and how even bliss is essentially still only a condition which can be easily
      lost. Only insight is irreversible. The stronger the calm is established, the better it
      will withstand disturbances. In the beginning any noise, discomfort or thought will break
      it up, especially if the mind has not been calm during the day.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Impermanence (//anicca//) needs to be seen
      quite clearly in everything that happens, whether it is in or out of meditation. The fact
      of constant change should and must be used for gaining insight into reality. Mindfulness
      is the heart of Buddhist meditation and insight is its goal. We're spending our time in
      many different ways and some portion of it in meditation, but all our time can be used to
      gain some insight into our own mind. That's where the whole world is happening for us.
      Nothing, except what we are thinking, exists for us.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The more we watch our mind and see what it
      does to us and for us, the more we will be inclined to take good care of it and treat it
      with respect. One of the biggest mistakes we can make is taking the mind for granted. The
      mind has the capacity to create good and also evil for us, and only when we are able to
      remain happy and even- minded no matter what conditions are arising, only then can we say
      that we have gained a little control. Until then we are out of control and our thoughts
      are our master.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whatever harm a foe may do to foe, or
        hater unto one he hates, the ill-directed mind indeed can do one greater harm.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What neither mother, nor father too, nor any
        other relative can do, the well-directed mind indeed can do one greater good.&quot; --
        Dhp. 42, 43 (Trans. by Ven. Khantipalo)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The above words of the Buddha show quite
      clearly that there is nothing more valuable than a controlled and skillfully directed
      mind. To tame one's mind does not happen only in meditation, that is just one specific
      training. It can be likened to learning to play tennis. One works out with a trainer,
      again and again, until one has found one's balance and aptitude, and can actually play in
      a tennis match. Our match for taming the mind happens in day-to-day living, in all
      situations we encounter.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The greatest support we can have is
      mindfulness, which means being totally present in each moment. If the mind remains
      centered then it can't make up stories about the injustice of the world or one's friends,
      or about one's desires, or one's lamentations. All these mind-made stories would fill many
      volumes, but we are mindful such verbalizations stop. &quot;Mindful&quot; is being fully
      absorbed in the moment, leaving no room for anything else. We are filled with the
      momentary happening, whether that may be standing or sitting or lying down, being
      comfortable or uncomfortable, feeling pleasant or unpleasant. Whichever it may be, it is a
      non-judgmental awareness, &quot;knowing only,&quot; without evaluation.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Clear comprehension brings evaluation. We
      comprehend the purpose of our thought, speech or action, whether we are using skilful
      means or not and whether we have actually achieved the required results. One needs some
      distance to oneself in order to be able to evaluate dispassionately. If one is right in
      the middle, it's very difficult to get an objective view. Mindfulness coupled with clear
      comprehension provides one with the necessary distance, the objectivity, the dispassion.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Any //dukkha// that one has, small, medium or
      large, continuous or intermittent, is all created by one's mind. We are the creators of
      all that happens to us, forming our own destiny, nobody else is involved. Everybody else
      is playing his own role, we just happen to be near some people and farther away at other
      times. But whatever we are doing, all is done to our own mind-moments.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The more we watch our thoughts in meditation,
      the more insight can arise, if there is an objective viewing of what is happening. When we
      watch mind-moments arising, staying and ceasing, detachment from our thinking process will
      result, which brings dispassion. Thoughts are coming and going all the time, just like the
      breath. If we hang on to them, try to keep them, that's when all the trouble starts. We
      want to own them and really do something with them, especially of they are negative, which
      is bound to create //dukkha//.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's formula for the highest effort
      is worth remembering: &quot;Not to let an unwholesome thought arise, which has not yet
      arisen. Not to sustain an unwholesome thought which has already arisen. To arouse a
      wholesome thought which has not yet arisen. To sustain a wholesome thought which has
      already arisen.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The quicker we can become a master of this
      effort, the better. This is part of the training we undergo in meditation. When we have
      learned to quickly drop whatever is arising in meditation, then we can do the same with
      unwholesome thoughts in daily living. When we are alert to an unwholesome thought in
      meditation, we can use the same skill to protect our mind at all times. The more we learn
      to shut our mind-door to all negativities which disturb our inner peace, the easier our
      life becomes. Peace of mind is not indifference. A peaceful mind is a compassionate mind.
      Recognizing and letting go is not suppression.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">//Dukkha// is self-made and self-perpetuated.
      If we are sincere in wanting to get rid of it, we have to watch the mind carefully, to get
      an insight into what's really happening within. What is triggering us? There are
      innumerable triggers, but there are only two reactions. One is equanimity and one is
      craving.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We can learn from everything. Today some
      //anagarikas// had to wait quite a long time in the bank, which was an exercise in
      patience. Whether the exercise was successful or not, doesn't matter as much as that it
      was a learning experience. Everything we do is an exercise, this is our purpose as human
      beings. It's the only reason for being here, namely to use the time on our little planet
      for learning and growing. It can be called an adult education class. Everything else we
      can think of as the purpose of life, is a mistaken view.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We're guests here, giving a limited guest
      performance. If we use our time to gain insight into ourselves utilizing our likes and
      dislikes, our resistances, our rejections, our worries, our fears, then we're spending
      this lifetime to the best advantage. It's a great skill to live in such a way. The Buddha
      called it &quot;urgency' (//samvega//), a sense of having to work on ourselves now and not
      leave it for some future unspecified date, when one may have more time. Everything can be
      a learning experience and the only time is now.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we meet our old friend //dukkha//, we
      would ask: &quot;Where did you come from?&quot; When we get an answer, we should inquire
      again, getting deeper into the subject. There's only one true answer, but we won't get it
      immediately. We have to go through several answers until we get to the bottom line, which
      is &quot;ego.&quot; When we've come to that one, we know we have come to the end of the
      questioning and to the beginning of insight. We can then try to see how the ego has
      produced //dukkha// again. What did it do, how did it react? When we see the cause, it may
      be possible to let go of that particular wrong view. Having seen cause and effect by
      ourselves, we'll never forget it again. Single drops fill a bucket, little by little we
      purify. Every moment is worthwhile.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The more we experience every moment as
      worthwhile, the more energy there is. There are no useless moments, every single one is
      important, if we use it skillfully. Enormous energy arises from that, because all of it
      adds up to a life which is lived in the best possible way.</font></td>
