      <td width="100%"><i><b><p ALIGN="center"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The Dhamma of
      the Blessed One is perfectly expounded, <br>
      to be seen here and now, not a matter of time.&quot;</font></b></i></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he first line of this
      chant proclaims real faith in the Dhamma. Not believing everything without inquiring, but
      an inner relationship of trust. When one is faithful to someone, then one also trusts that
      person, one gives oneself into his or her hands, has a deep connection and an inner
      opening. How much more is this true of the faith in the teaching of the Buddha. Those
      aspects of the Dhamma which we don't understand yet can be left in abeyance. Yet that
      doesn't shake our faith and trust.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we feel that it is &quot;<strong>perfectly
      expounded</strong>,&quot; then we are very fortunate, for we know one thing in this
      universe which is perfect. There's nothing else to be found that's without blemish, nor is
      there anything that is becoming perfect. If we have that trust, faithfulness and love
      towards the Dhamma and believe it to be perfectly expounded, then we have found something
      beyond compare. We are blessed with an inner wealth.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<strong>To be seen here and now</strong>,&quot;
      is up to each of us. the Dhamma has been made clear by the Enlightened One who taught it
      out of compassion, but we have to see it ourselves with an inner vision.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<strong>Here and now</strong>,&quot;
      needs to be stressed, because it means not forgetting but being aware of the Dhamma in
      each moment. This awareness helps us to watch our reactions before they result in
      unskilful words or actions. Seeing the positive within us and cultivating it, seeing the
      negative and substituting it. When we believe all our thoughts and claim justification for
      them, we're not seeing the Dhamma. There are no justifications, there are only arising
      phenomena which cease again.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<strong>Not a matter of time</strong>,&quot;
      means that we are not dependent upon a Buddha being alive in order to practice the Dhamma;
      though this is a wide-spread belief, it is quite possible to practice now. Some people
      think there has to be a perfect situation or a perfect teacher or perfect meditation. None
      of that is true. Mental and physical phenomena (//dhammas//) are constantly coming and
      going, changing without pause. When we hang onto them and consider them ours, then we will
      believe any story our mind will tell us, without discrimination. We consist of body,
      feelings, perceptions, mental formations and consciousness, which we grip tightly and
      believe them to be &quot;me&quot; and &quot;mine.&quot; We need to take a step back and be
      a neutral observer of the whole process.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<strong>Inviting one to come and see,
      leading inwards</strong>.&quot; The understanding of the Dhamma leads us into our inner
      depth. We are not invited to come and see a meditation hall or a Buddha statue, a dagoba
      or a shrine. We are invited to come and see the phenomena (//dhammas//) arising within us.
      The defilements as well as the purifications are to be found inside one's own heart and
      mind.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Our minds are very busy, always remembering,
      planning, hoping or judging. This body could also be very busy picking up little stones
      and throwing them into the water all day long. But we would consider that a foolish
      expenditure of energy, and we direct the body towards something useful. We need to do the
      same with the mind. Instead of thinking about this and that, allowing the defilements to
      arise, we could also direct the mind towards something beneficial such as investigating
      our likes and dislikes, our desires and rejections, our ideas and views.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When the mind inquires, it doesn't get
      involved in its own creations. It can't do both at the same time. As it becomes more and
      more observant, it remains objective for longer periods of time. That's why the Buddha
      taught that mindfulness is the one way for the purification of beings. The clear and lucid
      observation of all arising phenomena eventually shows that there are only phenomena
      manifesting as mind and body, which are constantly expanding and contracting in the same
      way as the universe does. Unless we become very diligent observers, we will not see that
      aspect of mind and body and will not know the Dhamma &quot;here and now,&quot; even though
      we have been &quot;invited to come and see.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<strong>To be known by the wise, each
      for themselves</strong>.&quot; No one can know the Dhamma for another. We can chant, read,
      discuss and listen, but unless we watch all that arises, we will not know the Dhamma by
      ourselves. There's only one place where Dhamma can be known, in one's own heart and mind.
      It has to be a personal experience which comes about through constant observation of
      oneself. Meditation helps. Unless one inquires into one's own reactions and knows why one
      wants one thing and rejects another, one hasn't seen Dhamma. Then the mind will also get a
      clear perception of impermanence (//anicca//) because our desires and dislikes are
      constantly changing. We'll see that the mind which is thinking and the body which is
      breathing are both painful (//dukkha//).</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When the mind doesn't operate with an
      uplifted, transcending awareness, it creates suffering (//dukkha//). Only a measureless,
      illumined mind is free from that. The body certainly produces //dukkha// in many ways
      through its inability to remain steady. Seeing this clearly will give us a strong
      determination to know Dhamma by ourselves.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Wisdom arises within and comes from an
      understood experience. Neither knowledge nor listening can bring it about. Wisdom also
      means maturity, which has nothing to do with age. Sometimes ageing may help, but it
      doesn't always do that either. Wisdom is an inner knowing which creates self-confidence.
      We need not look for somebody else's confirmation and good-will, we know with certainty.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we chant anything at all, it is vital
      that we know the meaning of the words and inquire whether they have any connection to
      ourselves.</font></p>

      </blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Though a thousand speeches are made of
        meaningless lines, better the single meaningful line by hearing which one is at
        peace.&quot; -- Dhp. 100 (Trans. by Ven. Khantipalo)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we can practice one line of Dhamma, it's
      so much more valuable than knowing the whole chanting book by heart.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The arising and ceasing phenomena, which are
      our teachers, never take a rest. Dhamma is being taught to us constantly. All our waking
      moments are Dhamma teachers, if we make them so. The Dhamma is the truth expounded by the
      Enlightened One, which is the law of nature surrounding us and imbedded within us.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Once the Buddha said: &quot;Ananda, it is
      owing to my being a good friend to them that living beings subject to birth are freed from
      birth.&quot; (S. III, 18, XLV, 2).</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Everyone needs a good friend, who has enough
      selflessness, not only to be helpful, but also to point out when one is slipping. Treading
      the Dhamma path is like walking a tightrope. It leads along one straight line and every
      time one slips, one hurts. If we have a painful feeling inside, we're no longer on the
      tightrope of the Dhamma. Our good friend (//kalyana mitta//) might say to us then:
      &quot;You stepped too far to the right, or to the left, (whatever the case may be). You
      weren't careful, that's why you fell into depression and pain. I'll point out to you when
      you're slipping next time.&quot; We can only accept this from someone whom we trust and
      have confidence in.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One can be fooled by a person's beautiful
      words or splendid appearance. The character of a person is shown not only in words, but in
      the small day-to-day activities. One of the very important guidelines to a person's
      character is how they react when things go wrong. It's easy to be loving, helpful and
      friendly when everything goes well, but when difficulties arise our endurance and patience
      are being tested as well as our equanimity and determination. The less ego-consciousness
      one has, the easier one can handle all situations.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At first, when one starts to walk on the
      tightrope of the Dhamma path, it may feel uncomfortable. One isn't used to balancing
      oneself, but rather to swaying all over the place, going in all directions, wherever it's
      most comfortable. One may feel restricted and coerced, not being allowed to live according
      to one's natural instincts. Yet in order to walk on a tightrope, one has to restrict
      oneself in many ways with mindfulness. These restrictions may at first feel irksome, like
      fetters or bonds, later they turn out to be the liberating factors.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To have this perfect jewel of the Dhamma in
      our hearts, we need to be awake and aware. Then we can prove by our own watchfulness that
      &quot;the Dhamma of the Blessed One is perfectly expounded.&quot; There is no worldly
      jewel that can match the value of the Dhamma. Each one of us can become the owner of this
      priceless gem. We can call ourselves most fortunate to have such an opportunity. When we
      wake up in the morning, let that be our first thought: &quot;What good fortune it is for
      me to practice the Dhamma.&quot;</font></td>
