  <div align="center"><center><table border="0" width="600" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he
      &quot;twelve-point-dependent-origination&quot; (//paticcasamuppada//) starts with
      ignorance (//avijja//) and goes through kamma formations (//sankhara//), rebirth
      consciousness, mind and matter, sense contacts, feeling, craving, clinging, becoming,
      birth, and ends with death. Getting born means dying. During that sequence there is one
      point of escape -- from feeling to craving.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">While this is called the mundane (//lokiya//)
      dependent- origination, the Buddha also taught a supermundane, transcendental
      (//lokuttara//) series of cause and effect. That one starts with unsatisfactoriness
      (//dukkha//). //Dukkha// needs to be seen for what it really is, namely the best starting
      point for our spiritual journey. Unless we know and see //dukkha//, we would have little
      reason to practice. If we haven't acknowledged the over-all existence of //dukkha//, we
      wouldn't be interested in getting out of its clutches.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The transcendental-dependent-origination
      starts out with the awareness and inner knowledge of the inescapable suffering in the
      human realm. When we reflect upon this, we will no longer try to find a way out through
      human endeavour, nor through becoming more informed or knowledgeable, or richer, or owning
      more or having more friends. Seeing //dukkha// as an inescapable condition, bound up with
      existence, we no longer feel oppressed by it. It's inescapable that there is thunder and
      lightning, so we don't try to reject the weather. There have to be thunder, lightning and
      rain, so we can grow food.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">//Dukkha// is equally inescapable. Without
      it, the human condition would not exist. There wouldn't be rebirth, decay and death.
      Having seen it like that, one loses one's resistance to it. The moment one is no longer
      repelled by //dukkha//, suffering is greatly diminished. It's our resistance which creates
      the craving to get rid of it, which makes it so much worse.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Having understood //dukkha// in this way, one
      may be fortunate enough to make contact with the true Dhamma, the Buddha's teaching. This
      is due to one's own good kamma. There are innumerable people who never get in touch with
      Dhamma. They might even be born in a place where the Dhamma is being preached, but they
      will have no opportunity to hear it. There are many more people who will not be searching
      for the Dhamma, because they're still searching for the escape route in the human
      endeavour, looking in the wrong direction. Having come to the conclusion that the world
      will not provide real happiness, then one also has to have the good kamma to be able to
      listen to true Dhamma. If these conditions arise, then faith results.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Faith has to be based on trust and
      confidence. If these are lacking, the path will not open. One becomes trusting like a
      child holding the hand of a grown-up when crossing the street. The child believes that the
      grown-up will be watching out for traffic so that no accident will happen. The small child
      doesn't have the capacity to gauge when it's safe to cross, but it trusts someone with
      greater experience.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We are like children compared to the Buddha.
      If we can have a child-like innocence, then it will be possible for us to give ourselves
      unstintingly to the teaching and the practice, holding onto the hand of the true Dhamma
      that will guide us. Life and practice will be simplified when the judging and weighing of
      choice is removed. No longer: &quot;I should do it another way, or go somewhere else, or
      find out how it is done by others.&quot; These are possibilities, but they are not
      conducive to good practice or to getting out of //dukkha//. Trust in the Dhamma helps to
      keep the mind steady. One has to find out for oneself if this is the correct escape route,
      but if we don't try, we won't know.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If //dukkha// is still regarded as a
      calamity, we will not have enough space in the mind to have trust. The mind will be full
      of grief, pain, lamentation, forgetting that all of us are experiencing our kamma
      resultants and nothing else. This is part of being a human being, subject to one's own
      kamma.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Resistance to //dukkha// saps our energy and
      the mind cannot stretch to its full capacity. If //dukkha// is seen as the necessary
      ingredient to spur one on to leave //samsara// behind, then one's positive attitude will
      point in the right direction. //Dukkha// is not a tragedy, but rather a basic ingredient
      for insight. This must not only be a thinking process, but felt with one's heart. It's too
      easy to think like that and not to do anything about it. But when our heart is truly
      touched, trust and confidence in the Dhamma arise as the way out of all suffering.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhamma is totally opposed to worldly
      thinking, where suffering is considered to be a great misfortune. In the Dhamma suffering
      is seen as the first step to transcend the human condition. The understanding of
      //dukkha// has to be firm, in order to arouse trust in that part of the teaching which one
      hasn't experienced oneself yet. If one has already tried many other escape routes and none
      of them actually worked, then one will find it easier to become that trusting, child-like
      person, walking along this difficult path without turning right or left, knowing that the
      teaching is true, and letting it be one's guide. Such faith brings joy, without which the
      path is a heavy burden and will not flourish. Joy is a necessary and essential ingredient
      of the spiritual life.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Joy is not to be mistaken for pleasure,
      exhilaration or exuberance. Joy is a feeling of ease and gladness, knowing one has found
      that which transcends all suffering. People sometimes have the mistaken idea that to be
      holy or pious means having a sad face and walking around in a mournful way. Yet the Buddha
      is said never to have cried and is usually depicted with a half-smile on his face.
      Holiness does not stand for sadness, it means wholeness. Without joy there is no
      wholeness. This inner joy carries with it the certainty that the path is blameless, the
      practice is fruitful and the conduct is appropriate.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We need to sit down for meditation with a
      joyous feeling and the whole experience of meditation will culminate in happiness. This
      brings us tranquility, as we no longer look around for outside satisfaction. We know only
      to look into ourselves. There's nowhere to go and nothing to do, it's all happening
      within. Such tranquility is helpful to concentrated meditation and creates the feeling of
      being in the right spot at the right time. It creates ease of mind, which facilitates
      meditation and is conducive to eliminating sceptical doubt (//vicikicha//).</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sceptical doubt is the harbinger of
      restlessness, joy begets calm. We need not worry about our own or the world's future, it's
      just a matter of time until we fathom absolute reality. When the path, the practice and
      effort mesh together, results are bound to come. It is essential to have complete
      confidence in everything the Buddha said. We can't pick out the ideas we want to believe
      because they happen to be in accordance with what we like anyway and discard others. There
      are no choices to be made, it's all or nothing.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Tranquility helps concentration to arise.
      //Dukkha// itself can lead us to proper concentration if we handle it properly. But we
      mustn't reject it, thinking that it is a quirk of fate that has brought all this grief to
      us, or think that other people are causing it. If we use //dukkha// to push us onto the
      path, then proper concentration can result.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Right concentration makes it possible for the
      mind to stretch. The mind that is limited, obstructed and defiled cannot grasp the
      profundity of the teaching. It may get an inkling that there is something extraordinary
      available, but it cannot go into the depth of it. Only the concentrated mind can extend
      its limitations. When it does that, it may experience the knowledge-and-vision-of-things-
      as-they-really-are.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha often used this phrase
      &quot;the-knowledge-and-vision-of- things-as-they-really-are&quot;
      (//yatha-bhuta-nanadassana//). This is distinct from the way we think they are or might
      be, or as we'd like them to be, hopefully comfortable and pleasant. But rather birth,
      decay, disease and death, not getting what one wants, or getting what one doesn't want, a
      constant perception of what we dislike, because it fails to support our ego-belief. In
      knowing and seeing things as they really are, we will lose that distaste.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We will come to see that within this realm of
      impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and corelessness (//anicca, dukkha, anatta//), there is
      nothing that can be grasped and found to be solid and satisfying. No person, no
      possession, no thought, no feeling. Nothing can be clung to and found to be steady and
      supportive.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is right view, beyond our ordinary
      every-day perception. It results from right concentration and comes from dealing with
      //dukkha// in a positive, welcoming way. When we try to escape from //dukkha// by either
      forgetting about it, running away from it, blaming someone else, becoming depressed by it
      or feeling sorry for ourselves, we are creating more //dukkha//. All these methods are
      based on self-delusion. The knowledge-and-vision-of-things-as-they- really-are is the
      first step on the noble path, everything else has been the preliminary work.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes our understanding may feel like one
      of those mystery pictures that children play with. Now you see it, now you don't. When any
      aspect of Dhamma is clearly visible to us, we must keep on resurrecting that vision. If it
      is correct, //dukkha// has no sting, it just is. Decay, disease and death do not appear
      fearful. There is nothing to fear, because everything falls apart continually. This body
      disintegrates and the mind changes every moment.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Without knowledge and vision of reality, the
      practice is difficult. After having this clear perception, the practice is the only
      possible thing to do. Everything else is only a side-issue and a distraction. From the
      knowledge-and-vision arises disenchantment with what the world has to offer. All the
      glitter that seems to be gold turns out to be fool's gold, which cannot satisfy. It gives
      us pleasure for one moment and displeasure the next and has to be searched for again and
      again. The world of the senses has fooled us so often that we're still enmeshed in it and
      still experiencing //dukkha//, unless the true vision arises.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There's a poster available in Australia which
      reads: &quot;Life, be in it.&quot; Wouldn't it be better if it said, &quot;Life, be out of
      it?&quot; Life and existence is bound up with the constant renewal of our sense contacts,
      seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, smelling and thinking. Only when we have clear
      perception, will disenchantment set in and then the most wonderful sense contact will no
      longer entice us to react. It just exists, but doesn't touch our heart. //Mara//, the
      tempter, has lost his grip and has been shown the door. He's waiting at the doorstep to
      slip in again, at the first possible opportunity, but he isn't so comfortably ensconced
      inside any more.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This brings a great deal of security and
      satisfaction to the heart. One won't be swayed to leave this path of practice. When
      //Mara// is still calling, there's no peace in the heart. One can't be at ease and
      satisfied, because there's always something new to tempt us. With
      knowledge-and-vision-of-things-as-they-really-are and subsequent disenchantment, we
      realize that the Buddha's path leads us to tranquility, peace and the end of //dukkha//.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">//Dukkha// is really our staunchest friend,
      our most faithful supporter. We'll never find another friend or helpmate like it, if it is
      seen in the right way, without resistance or rejection. When we use //dukkha// as our
      incentive for practice, gratitude and appreciation for it will arise. This takes the sting
      out of our pain and transforms it into our most valuable experience.</font></td>
