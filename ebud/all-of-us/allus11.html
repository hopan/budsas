    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">S</font>orrowless,
      stainless and secure are three attributes of an Enlightened One (//Arahant//). Sorrowless:
      no //dukkha//; Stainless: no defilements; and Secure: no fear. Obviously these three are
      extremely desirable, as they make for happiness. When we think that they are
      characteristics of an //Arahant//, we might wonder: &quot;This is so far removed from me,
      how can I even aspire to that?&quot; The conviction might arise that it's too immense to
      consider for one's own achievement.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We all know what it means to have sorrow
      (//dukkha//). We are familiar with our defilements, when we get upset, worried, anxious,
      envious or jealous. We have all experienced fear. It can be fear of death of oneself or of
      loved ones, or fear of not being liked, praised, accepted, or fear of not reaching one's
      goals, or of making a fool of oneself.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We can also experience the opposites of those
      three states. The seeds are within us, otherwise Enlightenment would be a myth. It is
      possible to have moments of being sorrowless, stainless and secure. If one has a really
      concentrated meditation, momentarily //dukkha// doesn't arise. Only one-pointedness. No
      defilements can enter because the mind is otherwise occupied. It can either have
      defilements or be concentrated, which is wonderful, though may last only one single
      moment. There can be no fear because all is well at such a time. The more often one
      regenerates these moments of being sorrowless, stainless and secure, the more they become
      part of oneself and we can revert to them again.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even just remembering that it is possible and
      trying to bring up a little of these feelings, enters into a person as part of his or her
      makeup. Just as a person with fear of not being accepted, or worried about achievements,
      experiencing a lack of self-confidence, will always act accordingly. He or she doesn't
      even have to make an effort, but remembers his or her fears and re-enacts them. The same
      goes for the liberated mind-states.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Every moment of concentration during
      meditation is a moment of no defilements, no sorrow and no fear. That sort of experience
      must be duplicated over and over again. Thereby we reinforce our liberated mind-states and
      as we remember them we can retain them and act in accordance with them even under ordinary
      or trying circumstances. Defilements need not arise constantly, there are pauses when
      there is no ill-will, only loving-kindness (//metta//), no sensual desire, only generosity
      and renunciation.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sensual desire means wanting, renunciation
      means giving up. When one gives, one isn't desiring, unless one is wishing for applause or
      gratitude. If one gives for giving's sake, then there is a moment of no defilement. The
      same holds true for loving-kindness, compassion and helpfulness, which are all opposed to
      greed.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we have no doubt, being absolutely sure
      of what we're doing -- and these moments do arise -- that too is an instant of being
      stainless. No worries, no restlessness also add to our freedom. Not wanting to go anywhere
      or do anything; not worrying about what was done or left undone in the past, which is
      absurd anyway, when one realizes that nobody cares a year or even a month from now, least
      of all oneself.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We all know moments without all this
      //dukkha//. When those moments arise, we are &quot;stainless,&quot; without any blemishes,
      sorrowless and fearless. We feel at ease and secure at such a time, which is difficult to
      find in the world. There are so many dangers threatening our desire for survival, and they
      are constantly with us. But when heart and mind are fully occupied with purified states,
      fear does not have a chance to arise.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On our way to the &quot;deathless,&quot; we
      need to regenerate these liberated moments and bring them up over and over again. We can
      relish these mind states, enjoying the knowledge that they are possible. It is a natural
      tendency to resurrect our moments of freedom again and again, so that we stay on the path
      to liberation.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Concentration in meditation brings a quiet
      and joy with it which prove with absolute certainty that they have nothing to do with
      outer conditions. They are strictly factors of the mind, which are our doorway to freedom.
      We cannot cultivate them successfully if we neglect them during those hours when we're not
      meditating. We need to guard and protect the mind from evil thoughts at all times.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we do experience liberated mind-moments,
      we must not think they have come to us from outside. Just as we cannot blame the external
      trigger for what goes wrong in the mind, so we cannot praise it for the opposite. Outside
      occurrences are quite unreliable and beyond our control. To depend on anything so
      unreliable is foolishness. Our practice is to generate the undefiled states in our mind,
      which opens the way to successful meditation and is the pathway to liberation. When the
      mind is without defilements, clear and at ease, without the convolutions of discursive
      thinking, simply aware, happiness and peace arise. These moments, though short-lived, are
      like a light at the end of a tunnel, which appears dark and suffocating. It seems never
      ending, because for the lack of light, one cannot see its length. If we cultivate and make
      much of these single moments, then there is an illumination and we can see that the tunnel
      does have an end. Because of that, joy is generated in one's heart, which is an important
      adjunct to practice.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught a balanced path, namely to
      see reality for what it is, to know that //dukkha// is inescapable, but to have the
      counterbalance of joy from knowing that there is a way out. If we are too imbued with
      sorrow and are feeling weighed down under that, believing only that to be the path, then
      our actions and reactions will have to be based on our suffering. Being oppressed with
      //dukkha// doesn't make for successful meditation, nor for harmonious living. If we try to
      negate //dukkha//, and suppress it, then we are not facing reality. But if we see
      //dukkha// as an universal characteristic, knowing we can do something about its
      abandonment then we are keeping in balance. We need equipoise in order to practice
      successfully.</font></td>
