      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Ariya</strong> - Noble Ones. Noble Persons.</p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Avijja</strong> - Ignorance, nescience, unknowing, synonymous with

      and unwholesome volitions and their concomitant mental factors, causing rebirth and

      worldling, ordinary man, anyone still possessed of all the ten fetters binding to the
      round of rebirths.</p>

      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Sakadagamami</strong> - The Once-Returner, having shed the lower

      //samadhi// (concentration).</p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Samsara</strong> - Round of rebirth, lit. &quot;perpetual

      up and down.</p>

      becoming a noble one.</p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Vicikiccha</strong> - Sceptical doubt is one of the five mental
      hindrances and one of the three fetters which disappears forever at stream-entry.</p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Vipassana</strong> - Insight into the truth of the impermanence,
      suffering and impersonality of all corporeal and mental phenomena of existence.</p>
