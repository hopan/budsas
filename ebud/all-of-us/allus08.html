    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>n the
      //Sutta Nipata// we find a discourse by the Buddha entitled &quot;The Rhinoceros
      Horn&quot; in which he compares the one horn of the rhinoceros with the sage's solitude.
      The Buddha praises being alone and the refrain to every stanza of the sutta is: &quot;One
      should wander solitary as a rhinoceros horn.&quot; (//K.R. Norman transl. P.T.S.//)</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are two kinds of solitude, that of the
      mind (//citta- viveka//) and that of the body (//kaya-viveka//). Everyone is familiar with
      solitude of the body. We go away and sit by ourselves in a room or cave or tell the people
      we are living with, that we want to be left alone. People usually like that sort of
      solitude for short periods. If this aloneness is maintained, it is often due to people not
      being able to get along with others or being afraid of them because there isn't enough
      love in their own hearts. Often there may be a feeling of loneliness, which is detrimental
      to solitude. Loneliness is a negative state of mind in which one feels bereft of
      companionship.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When one lives in a family or community, it
      is sometimes difficult to find physical solitude, it's not even very practical. But
      physical solitude is not the only kind of aloneness there is. Mental solitude is an
      important factor for practice. Unless one is able to arouse mental solitude in oneself,
      one will not be able to be introspective, to find out what changes in oneself are
      necessary.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mental solitude means first and foremost not
      to be dependent on others for approval, for companionable talk, for a relationship. It
      doesn't mean that one becomes unfriendly towards others, just that one is mentally
      independent. If another person is kind to us, well and good. If that isn't the case,
      that's fine too, and makes no difference.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The horn of a rhinoceros is straight and
      solid and so strong that we can't bend it. Can our minds be like that? Mental solitude
      cuts out idle chatter, which is detrimental to spiritual growth. Talking about nothing at
      all, just letting off steam. When we let the steam go from a pot, we can't cook the food.
      Our practice can be likened to putting the heat on oneself. If we let off steam again and
      again, that inner process is stopped. It's much better to let the steam accumulate and
      find out what is cooking. That is the most important work we can do.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Everybody should have occasion each day to be
      on her own physically for some time, so that we can really feel alone, totally by
      ourselves. Sometimes we may think: &quot;People are talking about me.&quot; That doesn't
      matter, we are the owners of our own kamma. If somebody talks about us, it's their kamma.
      If we get upset, that's our kamma. Getting interested in what is being said is enough to
      show that we are dependent on people's approval. Who's approving of whom? Maybe the five
      //khandha// (body, feeling, perception, mental formations and consciousness) are
      approving. Or possibly the hair of the head, the hair of the body, nails, teeth and skin?
      Which &quot;self&quot; is approving, the good one, the bad one, the mediocre one, or maybe
      the non-self?</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Unless one can find a feeling of solidity in
      oneself, from the centre, where there is no movement, one is always going to feel
      insecure. Nobody can be liked by everyone, not even the Buddha. Because we have
      defilements, we are always on the lookout for everybody else's pollutions. None of that
      matters, it's all totally unimportant. The only thing that is significant is to be
      mindful; totally attentive to each step on the way, to what one is doing, feeling,
      thinking. It's so easy to forget this. There's always somebody with whom to talk or
      another cup of tea to be had. That's how the world lives and the inhabitants are mostly
      unhappy. But the Buddha's path leads out of the world to independent happiness.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Letting off steam, idle chatter and looking
      for companionship are the wrong things to do. Trying to find out what people are thinking
      about one, is immaterial and irrelevant and has nothing to do with the spiritual path.
      Solitude in the mind means that one can be alone in the midst of the crowd. Even in a
      large and agitated crowd of people, one would still be able to operate from one's own
      centre, giving out love and compassion, and not being influenced by what is happening
      around one.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">That can be called ideal solitude and means
      one has removed oneself from the future and past, which is necessary in order to stand
      straight and alone. If one is attached to the future, then there is worry, and if one is
      hankering for the past, there is either desire or rejection. That is the constant chatter
      of the mind, not conducive to mental solitude.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Solitude can only be fully experienced when
      there is inner peace. Otherwise loneliness pushes one to try and remedy a feeling of
      emptiness and loss. &quot;Where is everybody? What can I do without some companionship? I
      must discuss my problems.&quot; Mindfulness is able to take care of all that because it
      has to arise in the present moment and has nothing to do with future and past. It keeps
      one totally occupied and saves one from making mistakes, which are natural to human
      beings. But the greater the mindfulness, the fewer mistakes. Errors on the mundane level
      also have repercussions on the supermundane path, because they are due to a lack of
      mindfulness, which will not allow us to get past our self-inflicted //dukkha//. We will
      try again and again to find someone who is to blame or someone who can distract us.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Ideal solitude arises when a person can be
      alone or with others and remain of one piece, not getting caught in someone else's
      difficulties. We may respond in an appropriate manner, but we are not affected. We all
      have our own inner life and we only get to know it well when the mind stops chattering and
      we can attend to our inner feelings. Once we have seen what is happening inside of us, we
      will want to change it. Only the fully Enlightened One (//Arahant//) has an inner life
      which needs no changing. Our inner stress and lack of peace push us outward to find
      someone who will remove a moment of //dukkha//, but only we, ourselves, can do it.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Solitude may be physical, but that's not its
      main function. The solitary mind is one which can have profound and original thoughts. A
      dependent mind thinks in cliches, the way everybody else does, because it wants approval.
      Such a mind understands on a surface level, just like the world does, and cannot grasp the
      profundity and depth of the Buddha's teaching. The solitary mind is at ease because it is
      unaffected.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It's interesting that a mind at ease, which
      can stand on its own, also can memorize. Because such a mind is not filled with the desire
      to remove //dukkha//, it can remember without much trouble. This is one of its side
      benefits. The main value of a solitary mind is its imperturbability. It can't be shaken
      and will stand without support, just as a strong tree doesn't need a prop. Because it's
      powerful in its own right. If the mind doesn't have enough vigour to stand on its own, it
      won't have the strength and determination to fulfil the Dhamma.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Our practice includes being on our own some
      time each day to introspect and contemplate. Reading, talking and listening are all
      communication with others, which are necessary at times. But it is essential to have time
      for self-inquiry: &quot;What is happening within me? What am I feeling? Is it wholesome or
      not? Am I perfectly contented on my own? How much self-concern is there? Is the Dhamma my
      guide or am I bewildered?&quot; If there's a fog in one's mind, all we need is a
      searchlight to penetrate it. The searchlight is concentration.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Health, wealth and youth do not mean no
      //dukkha//. They are a cover-up. Ill-health, poverty and old age make it easier to realize
      the unsatisfactoriness of our existence. When we are alone, that is the time to get to
      know ourselves. We can investigate the meaning of the Dhamma we've heard and whether we
      can actualize it in our own lives. We can use those aspects of the Dhamma which are most
      meaningful for us.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The solitary mind is a strong mind, because
      it knows how to stand still. That doesn't mean not associating with people at all, that
      would lack loving-kindness (//metta//). A solitary mind is able to be alone and introspect
      and also be loving towards others. Living in a Dhamma community is an ideal place to
      practice this.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation is the means for concentration,
      which is the tool to break through the fog enveloping everyone who is not an //Arahant//.
      At times, in communal living, there is togetherness and lovingness and service. These
      should be the results of //metta// not of trying to get away from //dukkha//. Next time we
      start a conversation, let's first investigate: &quot;Why am I having this discussion? Is
      it necessary, or am I bored and want to get away from my problems.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Clear comprehension is the mental factor
      which joins with mindfulness to give purpose and direction. We examine whether our speech
      and actions are having the right purpose, whether we are using skilful means and whether
      the initial purpose has been accomplished. If we have no clear-cut direction, idle chatter
      results. Even in meditation the mind does it, which is due to lack of training. When we
      practice clear comprehension, we need to stop a moment and examine the whole situation
      before plunging in. This may become one of our skillful habits, not often found in the
      world.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">An important aspect of the Buddha's teaching
      is the combination of clear comprehension with mindfulness. The Buddha often recommends
      them as the way out of all sorrow, and we need to practice them in our small every-day
      efforts. These may consist of learning something new, a Dhamma sentence remembered, one
      line of chanting memorized, one new insight about oneself, one aspect of reality realized.
      Such a mind gains strength and self-confidence.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Renunciation is the greatest help in gaining
      self-confidence. One knows one can get along without practically everything, for instance
      food, for quite some time. Once the Buddha went to a village where nobody had any faith in
      him. He received no alms-food at all, nobody in the village paid any attention to him. He
      went to the outskirts and sat down on a bit of straw and meditated. Another ascetic came
      by who had seen that the Buddha had not received any food and commiserated with him:
      &quot;You must be feeling very badly not having anything to eat. I'm very sorry. You don't
      even have a nice place to sleep, just straw.&quot; The Buddha replied: &quot;Feeders on
      joy we are. Inner joy can feed us for many days.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One can get along without many things when
      they are voluntarily given up. If someone takes our belongings, we resist, which is
      //dukkha//. But when we practice self-denial, we gain strength and enable the mind to
      stand on its own. Self-confidence arises and creates a really strong back-bone.
      Renunciation of companionship shows us whether we are self-sufficient.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha did not advocate exaggerated and
      harmful ascetic practices. but we could give up -- for instance -- afternoon conversations
      and contemplate instead. Afterwards the mind feels contented with its own efforts. The
      more effort one can make, the more satisfaction arises.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We need a solitary mind in meditation, so we
      need to practice it some time during each day. The secluded mind has two attributes; one
      is mindfulness, full attention and clear comprehension and the other is introspection and
      contemplation. Both of them bring the mind to unification. Only in togetherness lies
      strength; unification brings power.</font></td>
