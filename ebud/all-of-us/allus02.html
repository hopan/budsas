    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>t's a
      strange phenomenon how difficult people find it to love themselves. One would think it is
      the easiest thing in the world, because we're constantly concerned with ourselves. We're
      always interested in how much we can get, how well we can perform, how comfortable we can
      be. The Buddha mentioned in a discourse that &quot;oneself is dearest to oneself.&quot; So
      with all that, why is it so difficult to actually love oneself?</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Loving oneself certainly doesn't mean
      indulging oneself. Really loving is an attitude towards oneself that most people don't
      have, because they know quite a few things about themselves which are not desirable.
      Everybody has innumerable attitudes, reactions, likes and dislikes which they'd be better
      off without. Judgement is made and while one likes one's positive attitudes, one dislikes
      the others. With that comes suppression of those aspects of oneself that one is not
      pleased with. One doesn't want to know about them and doesn't acknowledge them. That's one
      way of dealing with oneself, which is detrimental to growth.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Another unskilful way is to dislike that part
      of oneself which appears negative and every time it arises one blames oneself, which makes
      matters twice as bad as they were before. With that comes fear and very often aggression.
      If one wants to deal with oneself in a balanced way, it's not useful to pretend that the
      unpleasant part doesn't exist, those aggressive, irritable, sensual, conceited tendencies.
      If we pretend we are far from reality and put a split into ourselves. Even though such a
      person may be totally sane, the appearance given is that of not being quite real. We've
      all come across people like that, who are too sweet to be true, as a result of pretense
      and suppression.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Blaming oneself doesn't work either. In both
      instances one transfers one's own reactions to other people. One blames others for their
      deficiencies, real or imagined, or one doesn't see them as ordinary human beings. Everyone
      lives in an unreal world, because it's ego-deluded, but this one is particularly unreal,
      because everything is considered either as perfectly wonderful or absolutely terrible.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The only thing that is real is that we have
      six roots within us. Three roots of good and three roots of evil. The latter are greed,
      hate and delusion, but we also have their opposites: generosity, loving-kindness and
      wisdom. Take an interest in this matter. If one investigates this and doesn't get anxious
      about it, then one can easily accept these six roots in everybody. No difficulty at all,
      when one has seen them in oneself. They are the underlying roots of everyone's behaviour.
      Then we can look at ourselves a little more realistically, namely not blaming ourselves
      for the unwholesome roots, not patting ourselves on the back for the wholesome ones, but
      rather accepting their existence within us. We can also accept others more clear-sightedly
      and have a much easier time relating to them.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We will not suffer from disappointments and
      we won't blame, because we won't live in a world where only black or white exists, either
      the three roots of unwholesomeness or their opposites. Such a world doesn't exist
      anywhere, and the only person to be like that is an //Arahant//. It's largely a matter of
      degree in everyone else. These degrees of good and evil are so finely tuned, there's so
      little difference within the degrees in each one of us, that it really doesn't matter.
      Everybody has the same job to do, to cultivate the wholesome tendencies and uproot the
      unwholesome ones.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Apparently we're all very different. That too
      is an illusion. We're all having the same problems and also the same faculties to deal
      with them. The only difference is the length of training that one has had. Training which
      may have been going on for a number of lifetimes has brought about a little more clarity,
      that's all.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Clarity of thinking comes from purification
      of one's emotions, which is a difficult job that needs to be done. But it can only be done
      successfully when it isn't an emotional upheaval, but clearcut, straightforward work that
      one does on oneself. When it is considered to be just that, it takes the sting out of it.
      The charge of &quot;I'm so wonderful&quot; or &quot;I'm so terrible&quot; is defused. We
      are neither wonderful nor terrible. Everyone is a human being with all the potential and
      all the obstructions. If one can love that human being, the one that is &quot;me&quot;
      with all its faculties and tendencies, then one can love others realistically, usefully
      and helpfully. But if one makes a break in the middle and loves the part which is nice and
      dislikes the part which isn't nice enough, one's never going to come to grips with
      reality. One day we'll have to see it, for what it is. It's a &quot;working ground,&quot;
      a //kammatthana//. It's a straightforward and interesting affair of one's own heart.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we look at ourselves in that manner, we
      will learn to love ourselves in a wholesome way. &quot;Just as a mother at the risk of
      life, loves and protects her child....&quot; Become your own mother! If we want to have a
      relationship with ourselves that is realistic and conducive to growth, then we need to
      become our own mother. A sensible mother can distinguish between that which is useful for
      her child and that which is detrimental. But she doesn't stop loving the child when it
      misbehaves. This may be the most important aspect to look at in ourselves. Everyone, at
      one time or another, misbehaves in thought or speech or action. Most frequently in
      thought, fairly frequently in speech and not so often in action. So what do we do with
      that? What does a mother do? She tells the child not to do it again, loves the child as
      much as she's always loved it and just gets on with the job of bringing up her child.
      Maybe we can start to bring up ourselves.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The whole of this training is a matter of
      maturing. Maturity is wisdom, which is unfortunately not connected to age. If it were, it
      would be very easy. One would have a guarantee. Since it isn't it's hard work, a job to be
      done. First comes recognition, then learning not to condemn, but to understand: &quot;This
      is the way it is.&quot; the third step is change. Recognition may be the hardest part for
      most people, it's not easy to see what goes on inside of oneself. This is the most
      important and the most interesting aspect of contemplation.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We lead a contemplative life, but that does
      not mean we sit in meditation all day long. A contemplative life means that one considers
      every aspect of what happens as part of a learning experience. One remains introspective
      under all circumstances. When one becomes outgoing, with what the Buddha termed
      &quot;exuberance of youth,&quot; one goes to the world with one's thoughts, speech and
      action. One needs to recollect oneself and return within. A contemplative life in some
      orders is a life of prayer. In our way it's a combination of meditation and life-style.
      The contemplative life goes on inside of oneself. One can do the same thing with or
      without recollection. Contemplation is the most important aspect of introspection. It
      isn't necessary to sit still all day and watch one's breath. Every move, every thought,
      every word can give rise to understanding oneself.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This kind of work on oneself will bring about
      deep inner security, which is rooted in reality. Most people are wishing and hoping for
      this kind of security, but are not even able to voice their longing. Living in a myth,
      constantly hoping or being afraid is opposed to having inner strength. The feeling of
      security arises when one sees reality inside of oneself and thereby the reality in
      everyone else and comes to terms with it.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Let us accept the fact that the Buddha knew
      the truth when he said everybody had seven underlying tendencies: sensual desire, ill-
      will, speculative views, sceptical doubt, conceit, craving for continued existence,
      ignorance. Find them in yourself. Smile at them, do not burst into tears because of them.
      Smile and say: &quot;Well, there you are. I'll do something about you.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The contemplative life is often lived
      heavy-handedly. A certain lack of joy is compensated for by being outgoing. This doesn't
      work. One should cultivate a certain light-heartedness, but stay within oneself. There's
      nothing to be worried or fearful about, nothing that is too difficult. Dhamma means the
      law of nature and we are manifesting this law of nature all the time. What can there be to
      get away from? We cannot escape the law of nature. Wherever we are, we are the Dhamma, we
      are impermanent (//anicca//), unfulfilled (//dukkha//), of no core-substance (//anatta//).
      It doesn't matter whether we sit here or on the moon. It's always the same. So we need a
      light-hearted approach to our own difficulties and those of everyone else, but not
      exuberance and outpouring. Rather a constant inwardness, which contains a bit of
      amusement. This works best. If one has a sense of humour about oneself, it is much easier
      to love oneself properly. It's also much easier to love everybody else.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There used to be a television show in
      America, called &quot;People are Funny.&quot; We do have the oddest reactions. When they
      are analyzed and taken apart, they are often found to be absurd. We have very strange
      desires and wishes and unrealistic images of ourselves. It's quite true, &quot;people are
      funny,&quot; so why not see that side of oneself? It makes it easier to accept that which
      we find so unacceptable in ourselves and others.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is one aspect of human life which we
      cannot change, namely, that it keeps on happening moment after moment. We've all been
      meditating here for some time. What does the world care? It just keeps on going. The only
      one who cares, who gets perturbed, is our own heart and mind. When there is perturbance,
      upheaval, unreality and absurdity, then there is also unhappiness. This is quite
      unnecessary. Everything just is. If we learn to approach all happenings with more
      equanimity by being accepting, then the work of purification is much easier. This is our
      work, our own purification, and it can only be done by each one for himself.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One of the best aspects about it is that if
      one remembers what one is doing, keeps at it day after day without forgetting and
      continues to meditate, not expecting great results, little by little it does happen. That,
      too, just is. As one keeps working at it, there is a constant chipping away at the
      defilements and at the unreal thinking, because there is no happiness in that and few want
      to hang on to unhappiness. Eventually one runs out of things to do outside of oneself. The
      books are all saying the same things, the letters have all been written, the flowers have
      all been watered, there's nothing left except to look inside. As this happens again and
      again, a change takes place. It may be slow, but when we have been here so many lifetimes,
      what's a day, a month, a year, ten years? They're all just happening.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There's nothing else to do and there's
      nowhere else to go. The earth is moving in a circle, life is moving from birth to death
      without us having to move at all. It's all happening without our help. The only thing we
      need to do is to get to reality. Then when we do, we will find that loving ourselves and
      loving others is a natural outcome of that. Because we are concerned with reality and that
      is the heart's real work -- to love. But only if we've also seen the other side of the
      coin in ourselves and have done the work of purification. Then it is no longer an effort
      or a deliberate attempt, but it becomes a natural function of our inner feelings, inward
      directed but shining outward.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The inward direction is an important aspect
      of our contemplative life. Whatever happens inwardly has direct repercussions on what
      takes place outwardly. The inner light and purity cannot be hidden, nor can the
      defilements.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We sometimes think we can portray something
      we are not. That is not possible. The Buddha said that one only knows a person after
      having heard him speak many times and having lived with him for a long time. People
      generally try to show themselves off as something better than they really are. Then, of
      course, they become disappointed in themselves when they fail, and equally disappointed in
      others. To realistically know oneself makes it possible to truly love. That kind of
      feeling gives the light-heartedness to this job in which we're engaged, which is needed.
      By accepting ourselves and others as we truly are, our job of purification, chipping away
      at the defilements, is made much easier.</font></td>
