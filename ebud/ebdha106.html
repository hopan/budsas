  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
  It has often been said that Western Buddhism is distinguished from its Asian prototype by
  three innovative shifts: the replacement of the monastery by the lay community as the
  principal arena of Buddhist practice; the enhanced position of women; and the emergence of
  a grass-roots engaged Buddhism aimed at social and political transformation. These three
  developments, however, have been encompassed by a fourth which is so much taken for
  granted that it is barely noticed. This last innovation might be briefly characterized as
  an attempt to transplant Buddhist practice from its native soil of faith and doctrine into
  a new setting governed by largely secular concerns. While for Asian Buddhists, including
  Eastern masters teaching in the West, this shift is so incomprehensible as to be
  invisible, for Western Buddhists it seems so obvious that they rarely see a need to
  comment on it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Stephen Batchelor, however, has clearly discerned the
  significance of this development and what it portends for the future. Having been trained
  in Asia in two monastic lineages (Tibetan <i>Gelugpa</i> and Korean <i>Soen</i>) and
  relinquished his monk's vows to live as a lay Buddhist teacher in the West, he is
  acquainted with both traditional Buddhism and its Western offshoots. His book <i>Buddhism
  Without Beliefs</i> is an intelligent and eloquent attempt to articulate the premises of
  the emerging secular Buddhism and to define the parameters for a style of &quot;dharma
  practice&quot; appropriate to the new situation. Batchelor is a highly gifted writer with
  a special talent for translating abstract explanation into concrete imagery drawn from
  everyday life. His book is obviously the product of serious reflection and a deep urge to
  make the Dhamma viable in our present sceptical age. Whether his vision is adequate to
  that aim is a tantalizing question which I hope to explore in the course of this review. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The book is divided into three parts, each with several
  short sections. In the first part, entitled &quot;Ground,&quot; Batchelor sketches the
  theoretical framework of his &quot;Buddhism without beliefs.&quot; He begins by drawing a
  sharp distinction between two entities that are so closely intertwined in Buddhist history
  as to seem inseparable, but which, he holds, must be severed for the Dhamma to discover
  its contemporary relevance. One is &quot;dharma practice,&quot; the Buddha's teaching as a
  path of training aimed at awakening and freedom from &quot;anguish&quot; (his rendering of
  <i>dukkha</i>); the other is &quot;Buddhism,&quot; a system of beliefs and observances
  geared towards social stability and religious consolation. For Batchelor, the religious
  expressions and world view in which the Dhamma has come down to us have no intrinsic
  connection to the Buddha's teaching at its core. They pertain solely to the Asian cultural
  soil within which Buddhism took root. While they may have served a purpose in earlier
  times, in relation to the continued transmission of the Dhamma, they are more a hindrance
  than a help. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Batchelor, if the Dhamma is to offer an
  effective alternative to mainstream thought and values, it has to be divested of its
  religious apparel and recast in a purely secular mode. What then emerges is an
  &quot;agnostic&quot; style of dharma practice aimed at personal and social liberation from
  the suffering created by egocentric clinging. On the great questions to which religious
  Buddhism provides answers&#151;the questions concerning our place in the grand scheme of
  things&#151;Batchelor's agnostic version of the Dhamma takes no stand. In his view,
  &quot;the dharma is not something to believe in but something to do&quot; (p. 17). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At first glance Batchelor's approach seems to echo the
  Buddha's advice in his famous simile about the man struck with the poisoned arrow (MN no.
  63): &quot;Just practice the path and don't speculate about metaphysical questions.&quot;
  But are the two really pointing in the same direction? I don't think so. Let us first note
  that Batchelor seems curiously ambivalent about how he conceives his own task relative to
  the historical Buddha. He starts off as if he has set out to salvage the authentic vision
  of the Buddha from the cultural accretions that have obscured its pristine clarity; yet,
  when he runs up against principles taught by the Buddha that collide with his own agenda,
  he has no hesitation about discarding them. This suggests that more than cultural
  accretions are at stake. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the fact that the Buddha kept silent on the
  metaphysical questions of his day and said that he taught only suffering and its
  cessation, Batchelor concludes that his teaching should be viewed as &quot;an existential,
  therapeutic, and liberating agnosticism&quot; (p. 15). A look at the Paali suttas,
  however, will show us that while the Buddha did not answer the ten &quot;undetermined
  questions,&quot; he made quite explicit pronouncements on the questions that Batchelor
  would wave aside. In a telling passage, Batchelor states that an agnostic Buddhist would
  not turn to the dharma for answers to questions about &quot;where we came from, where we
  are going, what happens after death . . . [but] would seek such knowledge in the
  appropriate domains: astrophysics, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, etc.&quot; (p. 18).
  From Batchelor's point of view, this would then mean that in answering the above
  questions, the Buddha was stepping outside his own domain and trespassing on that of
  science, which is doubly ironic in that responsible scientists usually say either that
  such questions are unanswerable or that they come within the domain of religion rather
  than of science. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At one point Batchelor tries to escape this predicament by
  suggesting that, in speaking of rebirth, the Buddha was merely adopting &quot;the symbols,
  metaphors, and imagery of his world&quot; (p. 15). Later he admits that the Buddha
  &quot;accepted&quot; the ideas of rebirth and kamma, but he still finds it &quot;odd that
  a practice concerned with anguish and the ending of anguish should be obliged to adopt
  ancient Indian metaphysical theories and thus accept as an article of faith that
  consciousness cannot be explained in terms of brain function&quot; (p. 37). Batchelor
  himself cannot endorse these &quot;metaphysical theories.&quot; It is not that he actually
  rejects the idea of rebirth. He claims, rather, that the most honest approach we can take
  to the whole issue of life after death is simply to acknowledge that we don't know. To
  accept the doctrines of rebirth and kamma, even on the authority of the Buddha, indicates
  a &quot;failure to summon forth the courage to risk a nondogmatic and nonevasive stance on
  such crucial existential matters&quot; (p. 38). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To justify his interpretation of the Dhamma, Batchelor
  resorts to a variety of arguments that gain their cogency through selective citation,
  oversimplification, and rationalization. For example, when discussing the &quot;four
  ennobling truths,&quot; Batchelor points out (in accordance with the First Sermon) that
  these truths are &quot;not propositions to believe [but] challenges to act&quot; (p. 7).
  This, however, is only partly true, firstly because, in order to act upon the truths, one
  has to believe them; but even more pointedly, because Batchelor fails to mention that the
  tasks imposed by the truths acquire their meaning from a specific context, namely, the
  quest for liberation from the vicious round of rebirths (see MN no. 26; SN chap. 15). To
  lift the four Noble Truths out of their original context, shared by the Buddha and his
  auditors, and transpose them to a purely secular one is to alter their meaning in crucial
  ways, as Batchelor does when he interprets the first truth as &quot;existential
  anguish.&quot; For the Buddha and Buddhist tradition, <i>dukkha</i> really means the
  suffering of repeated becoming in the round of rebirths, and thus, once one dismisses the
  idea of rebirth, the Four Truths lose their depth and scope. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sharp dichotomy that Batchelor posits between
  &quot;dharma practice&quot; and &quot;religious Buddhism&quot; is also hard to endorse.
  Rather, we should recognize a spectrum of Buddhist practices, ranging from simple
  devotional and ethical observances to more advanced contemplative and philosophical ones.
  What makes them specifically part of the Buddhist Dhamma is that they are all enfolded in
  a distinctive matrix of faith and understanding, which disappears when &quot;dharma
  practice&quot; is pursued on the basis of different presuppositions. Batchelor describes
  the premises that underlie traditional lay Buddhist practice, such as kamma and rebirth,
  as mere &quot;consolatory elements&quot; that have crept in to the Dhamma and blunted its
  critical edge (pp. 18&#150;19). But to speak thus is to forget that such principles were
  repeatedly taught by the Buddha himself, and not always for the sake of consolation, as a
  glance through the Paali Nikaayas would show. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even the notion that Buddhist religiosity is defined by a
  set of beliefs seems to derive its plausibility from viewing Buddhism in terms of a
  Christian model. Dhamma practice as taught by the Buddha makes no demands for blind faith;
  the invitation to question and investigate is always extended. One first approaches the
  Dhamma by testing those teachings of the Buddha that come into range of one's own
  experience. If one finds that they stand up under scrutiny, one then places faith in the
  teacher and accepts on trust those points of his teaching that one cannot personally
  validate. Collectively, all these principles make up Right View (<i>sammaa di.t.thi</i>),
  the first factor of the Noble Eightfold Path, and thus to subject them to an insistent
  agnostic questioning, as Batchelor proposes, is to derail one's practice from the start.
  In the Buddha's version of the path, one begins with certain beliefs that one uses as
  guidelines to Right Understanding and Right Practice. Then, when one's practice matures,
  one goes beyond belief to personal realization based on insight. Once one arrives at the
  far shore, one can leave behind the entire raft (see MN no. 22), but one doesn't discard
  the compass before one has even stepped on board. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The middle portion of the book is called &quot;Path&quot;
  and provides a sketch of Batchelor's agnostic conception of dharma practice. His
  explanations here are clear and lively, allowing him to display the creative side of his
  literary gifts. Separate sections deal with mindful awareness, insight into emptiness, and
  the development of compassion, each introduced by a simple example: the practice of
  mindfulness, by showing how unmindfully we usually go about such everyday tasks as walking
  to the store for a carton of milk; emptiness, by the challenge of finding a ballpoint pen
  amidst its parts; and compassion, by reflection on the suffering common to those we
  consider our friends, enemies, and mere acquaintances. He also includes a section on the
  twelve links of dependent origination, which he interprets in an imaginative way,
  illustrated by the mistaken perception of a garden hose as a snake. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is notably absent in Batchelor's conception of the
  path is the traditional foundation for Buddhist practice: the Going for Refuge to the
  Three Jewels. Of course, such an obviously religious act hardly makes sense in the
  framework of agnostic dharma practice. This omission, however, is quite significant, I
  think, for a world of difference must separate the practice of the agnostic dharma
  follower from that of the confirmed Buddhist who has gone for refuge. Batchelor also makes
  no mention of any code of moral rules, not even the Five Precepts. At several points, in
  fact, he speaks lightly of the codification of ethics, proposing moral integrity in its
  place. While his analysis of moral integrity includes some impressive insights, it remains
  questionable to me whether this alone, without concrete guidelines, is a sufficient basis
  for ethics. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the final part, &quot;Fruition,&quot; Batchelor
  explores the consequences of his conception of dharma practice as a &quot;passionate
  agnosticism.&quot; He begins with an account of the meditative path that strikes me as
  very strange. As mindfulness develops, he explains, the process of meditation evolves into
  a radical, relentless questioning of every aspect of experience, until we find ourselves
  immersed in a profound perplexity that envelopes our whole being. For Batchelor,
  &quot;this perplexed questioning is the central path itself&quot; (p. 98), a path that
  does not seek any answers nor even a goal. Now for one like myself, nurtured on the Paali
  texts, this seems a bizarre conception of &quot;dharma practice.&quot; Granted, the
  purpose of meditation is not simply to gain confirmation of one's belief system, but does
  this justify using the raft of the Dhamma to founder in the treacherous sea of doubt,
  rather than to cross to the far shore? The Buddha repeatedly emphasized that insight
  meditation leads to direct knowledge of the true nature of things, a knowledge that pulls
  up doubt by its roots. This shows once again the bearing of one's starting point on one's
  destination. If one starts off with the agnostic imperative, one descends ever deeper into
  mystery and doubt; if one places trust in the Dhamma and accedes to Right View, one's path
  culminates in Right Knowledge and Right Liberation (see MN no. 117). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the last sections of the book, on
  &quot;imagination&quot; and &quot;culture,&quot; Batchelor tackles the problem of the
  encounter between Buddhism and the contemporary world. He points out that throughout its
  history, the Dhamma has rejuvenated itself by continually altering its forms to respond to
  changing social and cultural conditions. This creative adjustment was an act of
  imagination, of creative vision, on the part of gifted Buddhist thinkers, who thereby gave
  birth to a fresh manifestation of the teaching. Soon afterwards, however, religious
  orthodoxy stepped in, placed the new forms under its authority, and thereby squelched the
  creative impulse imparted by the founders. Again, while I cannot deny that orthodoxy and
  creativity have had an uneasy relationship, I find Batchelor's version of Buddhist history
  too simplistic, almost as if he were viewing Buddhist orthodoxy as a mirror image of
  Western faiths. He also fails to provide sufficient acknowledgement of the role of
  orthodoxy in encouraging Dhamma practice rather than suppressing it, which accounts for
  its ability to turn out accomplished spiritual masters through the centuries. Orthodoxy
  and contemplative realization, though often at odds with each other, are by no means
  necessarily incompatible. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Batchelor argues that the meeting of Buddhism with the
  contemporary West has given rise to the need to create, from the resources of the dharma,
  a new &quot;culture of awakening that addresses the specific anguish of the contemporary
  world&quot; (p. 110). Such a culture must respond to the unprecedented situation we find
  today, when the promise of spiritual liberation has converged with a universal striving
  for personal and social freedom. In attempting to create such a culture of awakening, he
  stresses the need for dharma followers to preserve the integrity of the Buddhist tradition
  while at the same time fulfilling their responsibility to the present and the future. With
  this much I am in full agreement and acknowledge that the problem is especially acute for
  Theravaada Buddhism, which has historically been tied to a very particular cultural
  environment. Where I differ with him is on the question of what is central to the Dhamma
  and what is peripheral. In my view, Batchelor is ready to cast away too much that is
  integral to the Buddha's teaching in order to make it fit in with today's secular climate
  of thought. I'm afraid that the ultimate outcome of such concessions could be a
  psychologically oriented humanism tinged with Buddhist philosophy and a meditative mood. I
  certainly think that Buddhists should freely offer other religions and secular disciplines
  the full resources of their own tradition&#151;philosophy and ethics, meditation and
  psychology&#151;with perfect liberty, to use them for their own ends: &quot;The Tathaagata
  does not have a teacher's closed fist.&quot; But we still have to draw a sharp line
  between what is the Buddha's Dhamma and what is not, and I would say, all such practices
  undertaken outside the context of Going for Refuge are still on the hither side of the
  Dhamma, not yet within its fold. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I would also maintain that when the secular
  presuppositions of modernity clash with the basic principles of Right Understanding
  stressed by the Buddha, there is no question which of the two must be abandoned. Sa.msaara
  as the beginningless round of rebirths, kamma as its regulative law, Nibbaana as a
  transcendent goal&#151;surely these ideas will not get a rousing welcome from sceptical
  minds. A sense of refuge, renunciation, compassion based on the perception of universal
  suffering, a striving to break all mental bonds and fetters&#151;surely these values are
  difficult in an age of easy pleasure. But these are all so fundamental to the true Dhamma,
  so closely woven into its fabric, that to delete them is to risk nullifying its liberative
  power. If this means that Buddhism retains its character as a religion, so be it. In this
  I see nothing to fear; the greater danger is in diluting the teaching so much that its
  potency is lost. The secularization of life and the widespread decline in moral values
  have had grave consequences throughout the world, jeopardizing our collective sanity and
  survival. Today a vast cloud of moral and spiritual confusion hangs over humankind, and
  Batchelor's agnostic dharma practice seems to me a very weak antidote indeed. In my view,
  what we require is a clear articulation of the essential principles taught by the
  Buddhahimself in all their breadth and profundity. The challenge&#151;and it is a
  difficult one&#151;is to express these principles in a living language that addresses the
  deep crises of our time. </font></p>
