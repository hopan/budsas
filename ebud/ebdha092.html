    <p>As lay people living an ordinary lay life with all the
    commitments, involvements and responsibilities that are
    normally involved in lay living, it's difficult to devote
    much time to really develop meditation. So I think for many
    Western people Buddhism seems to create a bit of a dilemma
    because of the way Buddhism is taught in the West. You come
    here and the teachings that we give are quite high aspects of
    Buddhist teaching, quite refined aspects, pointing always to
    meditation, pointing always to the development of awareness
    in order for insight, a deeper understanding, to arise. A
    penetration into the way things really are rather than the
    way they appear to be. I think for many Westerners it's very
    difficult to apply that teaching within the normal daily life
    they're living. Many Westerners who are now becoming
    interested in Buddhism and trying to practise the teachings
    of the Buddha, trying to really follow them, feel somehow a
    bit of conflict there.</p>
    <p>It's difficult to live your ordinary daily life with its
    ordinary responsibilities, commitments, social involvements,
    and still want to develop this degree of refinement of the
    Buddhist path. And it's a dilemma because it's difficult to
    do. If one's life is very much involved with socialising,
    very much involved with family, very much involved with
    commitments, and responsibilities, then of course one has to
    compromise one's time, one's energy, one's interests. You
    can't devote that much time to the practise of making
    yourself calm and clearing the mind, and developing a refined
    sort of introspection. And so that teaching which is so
    refined sometimes seems a bit out of a reach for you.</p>
    <p>The Buddha's teaching is still very applicable, very
    useful, very relevant even if one can't meditate every day.
    Even if one can't spend hours meditating, one can still
    appreciate the Buddha's teachings and apply a lot of that
    teaching. A lot of the teaching is to do with ordinary daily
    living, knowing how to make the best use of this life as an
    ordinary person. Being born as a human being in Buddhism is
    considered a great blessing and privilege because human
    beings can free themselves from mechanical, habitual
    existence patterns. A human being can reflect on the results
    of living and can choose which direction to go. But one must
    make that choice, one must take that opportunity to make the
    choice. That is one must take an interest in one's life,
    reflecting on it.</p>
    <p>So many people want to escape from themselves and they do
    all sorts of things to escape from themselves because it's
    difficult and there are problems. So when I said that human
    beings have the opportunity to reflect on their lives, this
    is what I mean. Observing our lives. <b><i>Observing the
    problems in our lives</i></b>.</p>
    <p>The Buddha reflected on life, he reflected on his own
    life, he reflected on other people's lives. He observed and
    he came to the conclusion that the source of the problem is
    the ego. The ego gets in the way. Reflect on this. What is
    the ego? It's a sense of <b><i>me</i></b>. A separation, me
    separate from you, and when I'm separate I have my own
    interest. Desire and aversion only arise from ego, nothing
    else. <b><i>Where there's no ego, there's no desire, no
    aversion</i></b>. Desire for what? What do we desire? That
    which gratifies and flatters the ego. We like that, we want
    that, it makes the ego feel good. I see somebody, they say
    I'm wonderful, so I want to get close to them. What is
    aversion? That which challenges the ego, threatens the ego,
    insults the ego, humiliates the ego. The ego doesn't like
    that so it reacts with aversion and anger.</p>
    <p>When there is this ego present there are bound to be
    problems arising in relationships. When I say relationships I
    don't mean just relationships between you and another person,
    I mean in every experience in life. Every experience that
    you're involved in is a relationship. And where there is ego,
    there will be problems. That's the situation, that's why life
    is not ideal. The Buddha had no ego. The Buddha was at peace
    and he is a blessing to the world, a blessing to all beings;
    that's the result of having no ego.</p>
    <p>But of course, we have an ego. You can hear the Buddha's
    teaching, 'Everything is not self,' There is no self. But you
    feel you have a self. So there's an ego. What do we do with
    it? This is what the Buddha taught when he spoke about
    skilful ways of living. Learning to live within this
    limitation. Learning to live with an ego. Learning to work
    with this ego. How can one live with an ego and still create
    more happiness than misery? What do we do? The Dhamma the
    Buddha taught is something which he said is self-evident.
    Anyone who observes can see it. The Buddha said that if there
    is a problem, there's a cause. If you get rid of the cause,
    the problem is also removed. What is the problem? It is the
    problem of suffering and of unhappiness of
    unsatisfactoriness. The cause of it is the ego. Can you get
    rid of it? Not yet. So what do you do in the meantime. There
    are a few qualities which are absolutely essential and yet
    they are very much lacking in life. That's why there are so
    many problems today.</p>
    <p>The first quality is called <b><i>'sacca'</i></b> in Pali.
    Sacca is like honesty, truthfulness. It's an openness,
    frankness, being able to share. Openness doesn't mean just
    giving out. Openness means that you can also receive, it's an
    exchange. Bring this openness into your relationships, all
    relationships.</p>
    <p>Just think of meditation, you've really got to be honest
    with yourself, frank with yourself. Why are you meditating?
    Because meditation is an opening up, you are sitting there
    listening to yourself, not trying to distract yourself. So
    you need this quality of inner honesty, of being able to look
    at yourself and seeing what's there.</p>
    <p>The second quality which I've observed to be lacking is
    patience (<b><i>khanti</i></b>). Patience means 'space',
    giving a lot of 'space', allowing failings, allowing
    shortcomings, allowing imperfections, allowing differences.
    Allowing and giving room is to be patient, it's being kind.
    You can allow failings within yourself Allowing, giving
    space, being patient enough to allow people to be different,
    to have failings, to have good and bad sides is very
    important.</p>
    <p>In meditation you must be patient, you must allow the mind
    space, give it room. Give the mind time to settle down, to
    calm down. Concentration is not a forced thing, concentration
    is an agreement, the mind agrees to calm down, agrees to come
    to rest here. You can't force it. Brute force is not
    necessary, you have to give it this space.</p>
    <p>In a relationship give yourselves space. Allow
    differences. Allow imperfections. This giving of space
    requires a lot of humility. To accept failings in yourself,
    to accept failings in others requires humility, doesn't it?
    The ego can't tolerate failure, so you've got to be very
    humble to accept the nature of the body, to accept that this
    body is imperfect. To accept the failings and limitations of
    your own mind.</p>
    <p>So if you can just begin to implement some of these
    qualities, you will see how many problems would very, very
    quickly be resolved in our lives. Problems in our meditation,
    problems in our relationships. We would be able to cope with
    life a lot better. We would be at peace with life for a
    greater portion of the day.</p>
