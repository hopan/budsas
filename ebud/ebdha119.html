        <p><em>A popular theory today maintains that the Buddha's
        teachings have survived all these years thanks to
        Buddhism's ability to adapt to the customs of whatever
        culture it finds itself at a particular moment in
        history. The history of the Thai forest </em><em><strong>Kammatthana</strong></em><em>
        tradition, however, stands in stark opposition to this
        notion. In fact, as the author argues in this essay,
        history suggests that the Dhamma truly survives only
        where people have been willing to adapt their own customs
        and habits so as to meet the Dhamma face-to-face,
        &quot;on its own terms,&quot; in the wilderness. </em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="center">-oOo-</p>
    <p>Throughout its history, Buddhism has worked as a
    civilizing force. Its teachings on karma, for instance -- the
    principle that all intentional actions have consequences --
    have taught morality and compassion to many societies. But on
    a deeper level, Buddhism has always straddled the line
    between civilization and wilderness. The Buddha himself
    gained awakening in a forest, gave his first sermon in a
    forest, and passed away in a forest. The qualities of mind he
    needed in order to survive physically and mentally as he
    went, unarmed, into the wilds, were key to his discovery of
    the Dhamma. They included resilience, resolve, and alertness;
    self-honesty and circumspection; steadfastness in the face of
    loneliness; courage and ingenuity in the face of external
    dangers; compassion and respect for the other inhabitants of
    the forest. These qualities formed the &quot;home
    culture&quot; of the Dhamma. </p>
    <p>Periodically, as Buddhism spread and adapted to different
    societies, some practitioners felt that the original message
    of the Dhamma had become diluted. So they returned to the
    wilderness in order to revive its home culture. Many
    wilderness traditions are still alive today, especially in
    the Theravada countries of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.
    There, mendicant ascetic monks continue to wander through the
    remaining rainforests, in search of awakening in the same
    environment where the Buddha found awakening himself. Among
    these wilderness traditions, the one that has attracted the
    largest number of Western students, and is beginning to take
    root in the West, is the Kammatthana (Meditation) Forest
    tradition of Thailand. </p>
    <p>The Kammatthana tradition was founded by Ajahn Mun
    Bhuridatto in the early decades of this century. Ajahn Mun's
    mode of practice was solitary and strict. He followed the<i>
    Vinaya</i> (monastic discipline) faithfully, and also
    observed many of what are known as the thirteen classic <i>dhutanga</i>
    (ascetic) practices, such as living off almsfood, wearing
    robes made of cast-off rags, dwelling in the forest, eating
    only one meal a day. Searching out secluded places in the
    wilds of Thailand and Laos, he avoided the responsibilities
    of settled monastic life and spent long hours of the day and
    night in meditation. In spite of his reclusive nature, he
    attracted a large following of students willing to put up
    with the hardships of forest life in order to study with him.
    </p>
    <p>He also had his detractors, who accused him of not
    following traditional Thai Buddhist customs. He usually
    responded by saying that he wasn't interested in bending to
    the customs of any particular society -- as they were, by
    definition, the customs of people with greed, anger, and
    delusion in their minds. He was more interested in finding
    and following the Dhamma's home culture, or what he called
    the customs of the noble ones: the practices that had enabled
    the Buddha and his disciples to achieve awakening in the
    first place. This phrase -- the customs of the noble ones --
    comes from an incident in the Buddha's life: not long after
    his awakening, he returned to his home town in order to teach
    the Dhamma to the family he had left six years earlier. After
    spending the night in a forest, he went for alms in town at
    daybreak. His father the king learned of this and immediately
    went to upbraid him. &quot;This is shameful,&quot; the king
    said. &quot;No one in the lineage of our family has ever gone
    begging. It's against our family customs.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Your majesty,&quot; the Buddha replied, &quot;I now
    belong, not to the lineage of my family, but to the lineage
    of the noble ones. Theirs are the customs I follow.&quot; </p>
    <p>Ajahn Mun devoted many years of his life to tracking those
    customs down. Born in 1870, the son of rice farmers in the
    northeastern province of Ubon, he was ordained as a monk in
    the provincial capital in 1892. At the time of his
    ordination, there were two broad types of Buddhism available
    in Thailand. The first can be called Customary Buddhism --
    the mores and rites handed down over the centuries from
    teacher to teacher with little, if any, reference to the Pali
    Canon. For the most part, these customs taught monks to live
    a sedentary life in the village monastery, serving the local
    villagers as doctors or fortune tellers. Monastic discipline
    tended to be loose. Occasionally, monks would go on a
    pilgrimage they called &quot;dhutanga&quot; which bore little
    resemblance to the classic dhutanga practices. Instead, it
    was more an undisciplined escape valve for the pressures of
    sedentary life. Moreover, monks and lay people practiced
    forms of meditation that deviated from the path of
    tranquillity and insight outlined in the Pali canon. Their
    practices, called <i>vichaa aakhom,</i> or incantation
    knowledge, involved initiations and invocations used for
    shamanistic purposes, such as protective charms and magical
    powers. They rarely mentioned nirvana except as an entity to
    be invoked for shamanic rites. </p>
    <p>The second type of Buddhism available at the time was
    Reform Buddhism, based on the Pali canon and begun in the
    1820's by Prince Mongkut, who later became King Rama IV (and
    still later was portrayed in the musical <i>The King and I).</i>
    Prince Mongkut was ordained as a monk for twenty-seven years
    before ascending the throne. After studying the canon during
    his early years as a monk, he grew discouraged by the level
    of practice he saw around him in Thai monasteries. So he
    reordained among the Mons -- an ethnic group that straddled
    the Thai-Burmese border and occupied a few villages across
    the river from Bangkok -- and studied Vinaya and the classic
    dhutanga practices under the guidance of a Mon teacher.
    Later, his brother, King Rama III, complained that it was
    disgraceful for member of the royal family to join an ethnic
    minority, and so built a monastery for the Prince-Monk on the
    Bangkok side of the river. There, Mongkut attracted a small
    but strong following of like-minded monks and lay supporters,
    and in this way the Dhammayut (lit., <i>In Accordance with
    the Dhamma</i>) movement was born. </p>
    <p>In its early years, the Dhammayut movement was an informal
    grouping devoted to Pali studies, focusing on Vinaya, the
    classic dhutanga practices, a rationalist interpretation of
    the Dhamma, and the revival of meditation techniques taught
    in the Pali canon, such as recollection of the Buddha and
    mindfulness of the body. None of the movement's members,
    however, could prove that the teachings of the Pali canon
    actually led to enlightenment. Mongkut himself was convinced
    that the path to nirvana was no longer open, but he felt that
    a great deal of merit could be made by reviving at least the
    outward forms of the earliest Buddhist traditions. Formally
    taking a bodhisattva vow, he dedicated the merit of his
    efforts to future Buddhahood. Many of his students also took
    vows, hoping to become disciples of that future Buddha. </p>
    <p>Upon disrobing and ascending the throne after his
    brother's death in 1851, Rama IV was in a position to impose
    his reforms on the rest of the Thai Sangha, but chose not to.
    Instead, he quietly sponsored the building of new Dhammayut
    centers in the capital and the provinces, which was how -- by
    the time of Ajahn Mun -- there came to be a handful of
    Dhammayut monasteries in Ubon. </p>
    <p>Ajahn Mun felt that Customary Buddhism had little to offer
    and so he joined the Dhammayut order, taking a student of
    Prince Mongkut as his preceptor. Unlike many who joined the
    order at the time, he wasn't interested in the social
    advancement that would come with academic study and
    ecclesiastical appointments. Instead, his life on the farm
    had impressed on him the sufferings inherent in the cycle of
    life and death, and his single aim was to find a way out of
    the cycle. As a result, he soon left the scholarly
    environment of his preceptor's temple and went to live with a
    teacher named Ajahn Sao Kantasilo (1861-1941) in a small
    meditation monastery on the outskirts of town. </p>
    <p>Ajahn Sao was unusual in the Dhammayut order in that he
    had no scholarly interests but was devoted to the practice of
    meditation. He trained Ajahn Mun in strict discipline and
    canonical meditation practices, set in the context of the
    dangers and solitude of the wilderness. He could not
    guarantee that this practice would lead to the noble
    attainments, but he believed that it headed in the right
    direction. </p>
    <p>After wandering for several years with Ajahn Sao, Ajahn
    Mun set off on his own in search of a teacher who could show
    him for sure the way to the noble attainments. His search
    took nealy two decades and involved countless hardships as he
    trekked through the jungles of Laos, central Thailand, and
    Burma, but he never found the teacher he sought. Gradually he
    realized that he would have to follow the Buddha's example
    and take the wilderness itself as his teacher, not simply to
    conform to the ways of nature -- for nature is samsara itself
    -- but to break through to truths transcending them entirely.
    If he wanted to find the way beyond aging, illness, and
    death, he would have to learn the lessons of an environment
    where aging, illness, and death are thrown into sharp relief.
    At the same time, his encounters with other monks in the
    forest convinced him that learning the lessons of the
    wilderness involved more than just mastering the skills of
    physical survival. He would also have to develop the acuity
    not to be misled by dead-end sidetracks in his meditation.
    So, with a strong sense of the immensity of his task, he
    returned to a mountainous region in central Thailand and
    settled alone in a cave. </p>
    <p>In the long course of his wilderness training, Ajahn Mun
    learned that -- contrary to Reform and Customary beliefs --
    the path to nirvana was not closed. The true Dhamma was to be
    found not in old customs or texts but in the well-trained
    heart and mind. The texts were pointers for training, nothing
    more or less. The rules of the Vinaya, instead of simply
    being external customs, played an important role in physical
    and mental survival. As for the Dhamma texts, practice was
    not just a matter of confirming what they said. Reading and
    thinking about the texts could not give an adequate
    understanding of what they meant -- and did not count as
    showing them true respect. True respect for the texts meant
    taking them as a challenge: putting their teachings seriously
    to the test to see if, in fact, they are true. In the course
    of testing the teachings, the mind would come to many
    unexpected realizations that were not contained in the texts.
    These in turn had to be put to the test as well, so that one
    learned gradually by trial and error to the point of an
    actual noble attainment. Only then, Ajahn Mun would say, did
    one understand the Dhamma. </p>
    <p>This attitude toward the Dhamma parallels what ancient
    cultures called &quot;warrior knowledge&quot; -- the
    knowledge that comes from developing skills in difficult
    situations -- as opposed to the &quot;scribe knowledge&quot;
    that people sitting in relative security and ease can write
    down in words. Of course, warriors need to use words in their
    training, but they view a text as authoritative only if its
    teachings are borne out in practice. The Canon itself
    encourages this attitude when it quotes the Buddha as
    teaching his aunt, &quot;As for the teachings of which you
    may know, 'These teachings lead to dispassion, not to
    passion; to being unfettered, not to being fettered; to
    divesting, not to accumulating; to modesty, not to
    self-aggrandizement; to contentment, not to discontent; to
    seclusion, not to entanglement; to aroused persistence, not
    to laziness; to being unburdensome, not to being burdensome':
    You may definitely hold, 'This is the Dhamma, this is the
    Vinaya, this is the Teacher's instruction.'&quot; </p>
    <p>Thus the ultimate authority in judging a teaching is not
    whether the teaching can be found in a text. It lies in each
    person's relentless honesty in putting the Dhamma to the test
    and carefully monitoring the results. </p>
    <p>When Ajahn Mun had reached the point where he could
    guarantee that the path to the noble attainments was still
    open, he returned to the northeast to inform Ajahn Sao and
    then to continue wandering. Gradually he began to attract a
    grassroots following. People who met him were impressed by
    his demeanor and teachings, which were unlike those of any
    other monks they had known. They believed that he embodied
    the Dhamma and Vinaya in everything he did and said. As a
    teacher, he took a warrior's approach to training his
    students. Instead of simply imparting verbal knowledge, he
    put them into situations where they would have to develop the
    qualities of mind and character needed in surviving the
    battle with their own defilements. Instead of teaching a
    single meditation technique, he taught them a full panoply of
    skills -- as one student said, &quot;Everything from washing
    spittoons on up&quot; -- and then sent them into the wilds. </p>
    <p>It was after Ajahn Mun's return to the northeast that a
    third type of Buddhism emanating from Bangkok -- State
    Buddhism -- began to impinge on his life. In an effort to
    present a united front in the face of imperialist threats
    from Britain and France, Rama V (1868-1910) wanted to move
    the country from a loose feudal system to a centralized
    nation-state. As part of his program, he and his brothers --
    one of whom was ordained as a monk -- enacted religious
    reforms to prevent the encroachment of Christian
    missionaries. Having received their education from British
    tutors, they created a new monastic curriculum that subjected
    the Dhamma and Vinaya to Victorian notions of reason and
    utility. Their new version of the Vinaya, for instance, was a
    compromise between Customary and Reform Buddhism designed to
    counter Christian attacks that monks were unreliable and
    lazy. Monks were instructed to give up their wanderings,
    settle in established monasteries, and accept the new state
    curriculum. Because the Dhammayut monks were the best
    educated in Thailand at the time -- and had the closest
    connections to the royal family -- they were enlisted to do
    advance work for the government in outlying regions. </p>
    <p>In 1928, a Dhammayut authority unsympathetic to meditation
    and forest wanderers took charge of religious affairs in the
    northeast. Trying to domesticate Ajahn Mun's following, he
    ordered them to establish monasteries and help propagate the
    government's program. Ajahn Mun and a handful of his students
    left for the north, where they were still free to roam. In
    the early 1930's, Ajahn Mun was appointed the abbot of an
    important monastery in the city of Chieng Mai, but fled the
    place before dawn of the following day. He returned to settle
    in the northeast only in the very last years of his life,
    after the local ecclesiastical authorities had grown more
    favorably disposed to his way of practice. He maintained many
    of his dhutanga practices up to his death in 1949. </p>
    <p>It wasn't until the 1950's that the movement he founded
    gained acceptance in Bangkok, and only in the 1970's did it
    come into prominence on a nationwide level. This coincided
    with a widespread loss of confidence in state monks, many of
    whom were little more than bureaucrats in robes. As a result,
    Kammatthana monks came to represent, in the eyes of many
    monastics and lay people, a solid and reliable expression of
    the Dhamma in a world of fast and furious modernization. </p>
    <p>Buddhist history has shown that wilderness traditions go
    through a very quick life cycle. As one loses its momentum,
    another often grows up in its place. But with the wholesale
    destruction of Thailand's forests in the last few decades,
    the Kammatthana tradition may be the last great forest
    tradition that Thailand will produce. Fortunately, we in the
    West have learned of it in time to gather lessons that will
    be help in cultivating the customs of the noble ones on
    Western soil and establishing authentic wilderness traditions
    of our own. </p>
    <p>Perhaps the most important of those lessons concerns the
    role that the wilderness plays in testing and correcting
    trends that develop among Buddhists in cities and towns. The
    story of the Kammatthana tradition gives lie to the facile
    notion that Buddhism has survived simply by adapting to its
    host culture. The survival of Buddhism and the survival of
    the Dhamma are two different things. People like Ajahn Mun --
    willing to make whatever sacrifices are needed to discover
    and practice the Dhamma on its own terms -- are the ones who
    have kept the Dhamma alive. Of course, people have always
    been free to engage in Buddhist traditions in whatever way
    they like, but those who have benefited most from that
    engagement are those who, instead of reshaping Buddhism to
    fit their preferences, reshape themselves to fit in with the
    customs and traditions of the noble ones. To find these
    customs isn't easy, given the bewildering variety of
    traditions that Buddhists have spawned over the centuries. To
    test them, each individual is thrown back on his or her own
    powers of relentless honesty, integrity, and discernment.
    There are no easy guarantees. And perhaps this fact in itself
    is a measure of the Dhamma's true worth. Only people of real
    integrity can truly comprehend it. As Ajahn Lee, one of Ajahn
    Mun's students, once said, &quot;If a person isn't true to
    the Buddha's teachings, the Buddha's teachings won't be true
    to that person -- and that person won't be able to know what
    the Buddha's true teachings are.&quot; </p>
