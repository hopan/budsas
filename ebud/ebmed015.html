  The mental exercise known as meditation is found in all religious
  systems.  Prayer is a form of discursive meditation, and in Hinduism
  the reciting of slokas and mantras is employed to tranquilize the
  mind to a state of receptivity.  In most of these systems the goal is
  identified with the particular psychic results that ensue, sometimes
  very quickly; and the visions that come in the semi-trance state, or
  the sounds that are heard, are considered to be the end-result of the
  exercise.  This is not the case in the forms of meditation practiced
  in Buddhism.
  <P>
  There is still comparatively little known about the mind, its
  functions and its powers, and it is difficult for most people to
  distinguish between self-hypnosis, the development of mediumistic
  states, and the real process of mental clarification and direct
  perception which is the object of Buddhist mental concentration.  The
  fact that mystics of every religion have induced on themselves states
  wherein they see visions and hear voices that are in accordance with
  their own religious beliefs indicates that their meditation has
  resulted only in bringing to the surface of the mind and objectifying
  the concepts already embedded in the deepest strata of their
  subconscious minds.  The Christian sees and converses with the saints
  of whom he already knows; the Hindu visualizes the gods of the Hindu
  pantheon, and so on.  When Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the Bengali
  mystic, began to turn his thoughts towards Christianity, he saw
  visions of Jesus in his meditations, in place of his former eidetic
  images of the Hindu Avatars.
  <P>  
  The practiced hypnotic subject becomes more and more readily able to
  surrender himself to the suggestions made to him by the hypnotiser,
  and anyone who has studied this subject is bound to see a connection
  between the mental state of compliance he has reached and the facility
  with which the mystic can induce whatever kind of experiences he wills
  himself to undergo.  There is still another possibility latent in the
  practice of meditation; the development of mediumistic faculties by
  which the subject can actually see and hear beings on different planes
  of existence, the Devalokas and the realm of the unhappy ghosts, for
  example. These worlds being nearest to our own are the more readily
  accessible, and this is the true explanation of the psychic phenomena
  of Western Spiritualism.
  <P>  
  The object of Buddhist meditation, however, is none of these things.
  They arise as side-products, but not only are they not its goal, but
  they are hindrances which have to be overcome.  The Christian who has
  seen Jesus, or the Hindu who has conversed with Bhagavan Krishna may
  be quite satisfied that he has fulfilled the purpose of his religious
  life, but the Buddhist who sees a vision of the Buddha knows by that
  very fact that he has only succeeded in objectifying a concept in his
  own mind, for the Buddha after his Parinibbana is, in his own words,
  no longer visible to gods or men.
  <P>  
  There is an essential difference, then, between Buddhist meditation
  and concentration and that practiced in other systems.  The Buddhist
  embarking on a course of meditation does well to recognize this
  difference and to establish in his own conscious mind a clear idea of
  what it is he is trying to do.
  <P>  
  The root-cause of rebirth and suffering is //avijja// conjoined with
  and reacting upon //tanha//. These two causes form a vicious circle;
  on the one hand, concepts, the result of ignorance, and on the other
  hand, desire arising from concepts.  The world of phenomena has no
  meaning beyond the meaning given to it by our own interpretation.
  <P>  
  When that interpretation is conditioned by //avijja//, we are subject
  to the state known as //vipallasa//, or hallucination.
  //Sanna-vipallasa//, hallucination of perception; //citta-vipallasa//,
  hallucination of consciousness, and //ditthi-vipallasa//,
  hallucination of views, cause us to regard that which is impermanent
  (//anicca//) as permanent, that which is painful (//dukkha//) as a
  source of pleasure, and that which is unreal (//anatta//), or
  literally without any self existence, as being a real, self-existing
  entity. Consequently, we place a false interpretation on all the
  sensory experiences we gain through the six channels of cognition,
  that is, the eye, ear, nose, tongue, sense of touch and mind //cakkhu,
  sota, ghana, jivha, kaya// and //mano (ayatana)//.  Physics, by
  showing that the realm of phenomena we know through these channels of
  cognition does not really correspond to the physical world known to
  science, has confirmed this Buddhist truth.  We are deluded by our own
  senses.  Pursuing what we imagine to be desirable, an object of
  pleasure, we are in reality only following a shadow, trying to grasp a
  mirage.  It is //anicca, dukkha, anatta// -- impermanent, associated
  with suffering, an insubstantial.  Being so, it can only be the cause
  of impermanence, suffering and insubstantiality, since like begets
  like; and we ourselves, who chase the illusion, are also impermanent,
  subject to suffering and without any persistent ego-principle.  It is
  a case of a shadow pursuing a shadow.
  <P>  
  The purpose of Buddhist meditation, therefore, is to gain more than an
  intellectual understanding of this truth, to liberate ourselves from
  the delusion and thereby put an end to both ignorance and craving.  If
  the meditation does not produce results tending to this consummation
  -- results which are observable in the character and the whole
  attitude to life -- it is clear that there is something wrong either
  with the system or with the method of employing it.  It is not enough
  to see lights, to have visions or to experience ecstasy.  These
  phenomena are too common to be impressive to the Buddhist who really
  understands the purpose of Buddhist meditation.  There are actual
  dangers in them which are apparent to one who is also a student of
  psychopathology.
    <P>
  In the Buddha's great discourse on the practice of mindfulness, the
  Maha-Satipatthana Sutta, both the object and the means of attaining it
  are clearly set forth. Attentiveness to the movements of the body, to
  the ever-changing states of the mind, is to be cultivated in order that
  their real nature should be known.  Instead of identifying these
  physical and mental phenomena with the false concept of "self," we are
  to see them as they really are:  movements of a physical body, an
  aggregate of the four elements, (//mahabhutas//) subject to physical
  laws of causality on the one hand, and on the other, a flux of
  successive phases of consciousness arising and passing away in
  response to external stimuli.  They are to be viewed objectively, as
  though they were processes not associated with ourselves but belonging
  to another order of phenomena.
    <P>
  From what can selfishness and egotism proceed if not from the concept
  of "self" (//sakkayaditthi//)?  If the practice of any form of
  meditation leaves selfishness or egotism unabated, it has not been
  successful.  A tree is judged by its fruits and a man by his actions;
  there is no other criterion.  Particularly is this true in Buddhist
  psychology, because the man //is// his actions.  In the truest sense
  they, or the continuity of kamma and //vipaka// which they represent,
  are the only claim he can make to any persistent identity, not only
  through the different phases of this life but also from one life to
  another.  Attentiveness with regard to body and mind serves to break
  down the illusion of self; and not only that, it also cuts off craving
  and attachment to external objects, so that ultimately there is
  neither the "self" that craves nor any object of craving.  It is a
  long and arduous discipline, and one that can only be undertaken in
  retirement from the world and its cares.
<P>
  Yet even a temporary retirement, a temporary course of this
  discipline, can bear good results in that it establishes an attitude
  of mind which can be applied to some degree in the ordinary situations
  of life. Detachment, objectivity, is an invaluable aid to clear
  thinking; it enables a man to sum up a given situation without bias,
  personal or otherwise, and to act in that situation with courage and
  discretion. Another gift it bestows is that of concentration -- the
  ability to focus the mind and keep it steadily fixed on a single point
  (//ekaggata//, or one-pointedness), and this is the great secret of
  success in any undertaking. The mind is hard to tame; it roams here
  and there restlessly as the wind, or like an untamed horse, but when
  it is fully under control, it is the most powerful instrument in the
  whole universe.  He who has mastered his own mind is indeed master of
  the Three Worlds.
  <P>
  In the first place he is without fear.  Fear arises because we
  associate mind and body (//nama-rupa//) with "self"; consequently any
  harm to either is considered to be harm done to oneself.  But he who
  has broken down this illusion by realizing that the five //khandha//
  process is merely the manifestation of cause and effect, does not fear
  death or misfortune.  He remains equable alike in success and failure,
  unaffected by praise or blame.  The only thing he fears is
  demeritorious action, because he knows that no thing or person in the
  world can harm him except himself, and as his detachment increases, he
  becomes less and less liable to demeritorious deeds.  Unwholesome
  action comes of an unwholesome mind, and as the mind becomes purified,
  healed of its disorders, bad kamma ceases to accumulate.  He comes to
  have a horror of wrong action and to take greater and greater delight
  in those deeds that are rooted in //alobha//, //adosa//, and //amoha//
  -- generosity, benevolence and wisdom.
<P>
<P>


<H3>Anapana Sati</H3>

  One of the most universally-applicable methods of cultivating mental
  concentration is //anapanasati//, attentiveness on the in-going and
  out-going breath.  This, unlike the Yogic systems, does not call for
  any interference with the normal breathing, the breath being merely
  used as a point on which to fix the attention, at the tip of the
  nostrils.  The attention must not wander, even to follow the breath,
  but must be kept rigidly on the selected spot.  In the initial stages
  it is advisable to mark the respiration by counting, but as soon as it
  is possible to keep the mind fixed without this artificial aid, it
  should be discontinued and only used when it is necessary to recall
  the attention.
<P>  
  As the state of mental quiescence (//samatha//) is approached, the
  breath appears to become fainter and fainter, until it is hardly
  discernible.  It is at this stage that certain psychic phenomena
  appear, which may at first be disconcerting.  A stage is reached when
  the actual bodily //dukkha//, the sensation of arising and passing
  away of the physical elements in the body, is felt.  This is
  experienced as a disturbance, but it must be remembered that it is an
  agitation that is always present in the body but we are unaware of it
  until the mind becomes stabilized.  It is the first direct experience
  of the //dukkha// (suffering) which is inherent in all phenomena --
  the realization within oneself of the first of the Four Noble Truths,
  //Dukkha Ariya Sacca//.  When that is passed there follows the
  sensation of //piti//, rapturous joy associated with the physical
  body.  The teacher of //vipassana//, however, is careful never to
  describe to his pupil beforehand what he is likely to experience, for
  if he does so, there is a strong possibility that the power of
  suggestion will produce a false reaction, particularly in those cases
  where the pupil is very suggestible and greatly under the influence of
  the teacher.
  <P>
<P>
<H3> Devices in Meditation</H3>

  In //kammattana//, it is permissible to use certain devices, such as
  the earth or colour //kasina//, as focal points for the attention.  A
  candle flame, a hole in the wall, or some metal object can also be
  used, and the method of using them is found in the Pali texts and the
  //Visuddhi-magga//.  In the texts themselves it is to be noted that
  the Buddha gave objects of meditation to disciples in accordance with
  their individual characteristics, and his unerring knowledge of the
  right technique for each came from his insight into their previous
  births.  Similarly with recursive meditation, a subject would be given
  which was easily comprehensible to the pupil, or which served to
  counteract some strong, unwholesome tendency in his nature.  Thus, to
  one attracted by sensual indulgence, the Buddha would recommend
  meditation on the impurity of the body, or the "cemetery meditation."
  Here the object is to counterbalance attraction by repulsion, but it
  is only a "skillful means" to reach the final state, in which
  attraction and repulsion both cease to exist.  In the Arahant there is
  neither liking nor disliking: he regards all things with perfect
  equanimity, as did Thera Maha Moggallana when he accepted a handful of
  rice from a leper.
<P>
<P>
  
 <H3>Beads</H3>
 
  The use of the rosary in Buddhism is often misunderstood.  If it is
  used for the mechanical repetition of a set formula, the repeating of
  so many phrases as an act of piety, as in other religions, its value
  is negligible. When it is used as means of holding the attention and
  purifying the mind, however, it can be a great help.  One of the best
  ways of employing it, because it calls for undivided attention, is to
  repeat the Pali formula of the qualities of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha,
  beginning "//Iti'pi so Bhagava -- //" with the first bead, starting
  again with the second and continuing to the next quality: "//Iti'pi so
  Bhagava, Arahan -- //" and so on until with the last bead the entire
  formula is repeated from beginning to end.  This cannot be carried out
  successfully unless the mind is entirely concentrated on what is being
  done.  At the same time the recalling of the noble qualities of
  Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha lifts the mind to a lofty plane, since the
  words carry with them a meaning the impresses itself on the pattern of
  the thought-moments as they arise and pass away.  The value of this in
  terms of Abhidhamma psychology lies in the wholesome nature of the
  //cittakkhana//, or "consciousness-moment" in its //uppada//
  (arising), //thiti// (static) and //bhanga// (disappearing) phases.
  Each of these wholesome //cittakkhana// contributes to the improvement
  of the //sankhara//; or aggregate of tendencies; in other words, it
  directs the subsequent thought-moments into a higher realm and tends
  to establish the character on that level.
  
<P>
<P>
<H3>Samatha Bhavana</H3>

  //Samatha bhavana//, the development of mental tranquility with
  concentration, is accompanied by three benefits; it gives happiness in
  the present life, a favorable rebirth, and the freedom from mental
  defilements which is a prerequisite for attainment of insight.  In
  //samatha// the mind becomes like a still, clear pool completely free
  from disturbance and agitation, and ready to mirror on its surface the
  nature of things as they really are, the aspect of them which is
  hidden from ordinary knowledge by the restlessness of craving.  It is
  the peace and fulfillment which is depicted on the features of the
  Buddha, investing his images with a significance that impresses even
  those who have no knowledge of what it means.  Such an image of the
  Buddha can itself be a very suitable object of meditation, and is, in
  fact, the one that most Buddhists instinctively use.  The very sight
  of the tranquil image can calm and pacify a mind distraught with
  worldly hopes and fears.  It is the certain and visible assurance of
  Nibbana.
 <P> 
<P>

<H3> Vipassana Bhavana</H3>

  //Vipassana bhavana// is realization of the three signs of being,
  //anicca//, //dukkha//, and //anatta//,  by direct insight.  These
  three characteristics, impermanence, suffering and non-self, can be
  grasped intellectually, as scientific and philosophical truth, but
  this is not in itself sufficient to rid the mind of egoism and
  craving.  The final objective lies on a higher level of awareness, the
  direct "intuitional" plane, where it is actually experienced as
  psychological fact.  Until this personal confirmation is obtained, the
  sphere of sense perception (//ayatana//) and sensory-responses remain
  stronger than the intellectual conviction; the two function side by
  side on different levels of consciousness, but it is usually the
  sphere dominated by //avijja// which continues to determine the course
  of life by volitional action.  The philosopher who fails to live
  according to his philosophy is the most familiar example of this
  incompatibility between theory and practice.  When the direct
  perception is obtained, however, what was at its highest intellectual
  level still merely a theory becomes actual knowledge, in precisely the
  same way that we "know" when we are hot or cold hungry or thirsty. The
  mind that has attained it is established in the Dhamma, and //panna//,
  wisdom, has taken the place of delusion.
 <P> 
  Discursive meditation, such as that practiced in Christian devotion,
  is entirely on the mental level, and can be undertaken by anyone at
  any time.  It calls for no special preparation or conditions.  For the
  more advanced exercises of //samatha// and //vipassana//, however, the
  strictest observance of //sila//, the basic moral rules, becomes
  necessary.  These techniques are best followed in seclusion, away from
  the impurities of worldly life and under the guidance of an
  accomplished master.  Many people have done themselves psychic harm by
  embarking on them without due care in this respect.  It is not
  advisable for anyone to experiment on his own; those who are unable to
  place themselves under a trustworthy teacher will do best to confine
  themselves to discursive meditation.  It cannot take them to
  enlightenment but will benefit them morally and prepare them for the
  next stage.
  
<P>
<P>
<H3>The Practice of Metta Bhavana</H3>

  //Metta bhavana// is the most universally beneficial form of
  discursive meditation, and can be practiced in any conditions.
  Thoughts of universal, undiscriminating benevolence, like radio waves
  reaching out in all directions, sublimate the creative energy of the
  mind.  With steady perseverance in //metta bhavana// a point can be
  reached at which it becomes impossible even to harbor a thought of
  ill-will.  True peace can only come to the world through minds that
  are at peace, If people everywhere in the world could be persuaded to
  devote half an hour daily to the practice of //metta bhavana//, we
  should see more real advance towards world peace and security than
  international agreements will ever bring us.  It would be a good thing
  if, in this new era of the Buddha Sasana, people of all creeds could
  be invited to take part in a world-wide movement for the practice of
  //metta bhavana// and pledge themselves to live in accordance with the
  highest tenets of their own religion, whatever it may be.  In so doing
  they would be paying homage to the Supreme Buddha and to their own
  particular religious teacher as well, for on this level all the great
  religions of the world unite.  If there is a common denominator to be
  found among them, it is surely here, in the teaching of universal
  loving-kindness which transcends doctrinal differences and draws all
  being together by the power of a timeless and all-embracing truth.
<P>  
  The classic formulation of //metta// as an attitude of mind to be
  developed by meditation is found in the //Karaniya Metta Sutta//
  (Sutta Nipata, Khuddaka-patha) [See appendix]. It is recommended that
  this sutta be recited before beginning meditation, and again at its
  close, a practice which is invariably followed in the Buddhist
  countries.  The verses of the sutta embody the highest concept to
  which the thought of loving-kindness can reach, and it serves both as
  a means of self-protection against unwholesome mental states and as a
  subject of contemplation (//kammatthana//).
<P>  
  It is taught in Buddhism that the cultivation of benevolence must
  begin with oneself.  There is a profound psychological truth in this,
  for no one who hates or despises himself consciously or unconsciously
  can feel true loving-kindness for others.  To each of us the self is
  the nearest object; if one's attitude towards oneself is not a
  wholesome one, the spring of love is poisoned at its source. This does
  not mean that we should build up an idealized picture of ourselves as
  an object of admiration, but that, while being fully aware of our
  faults and deficiencies, we should not condemn but resolve to improve
  ourselves and cherish confidence in our ability to do so.
<P>  
  //Metta bhavana//, therefore, begins with the thought:  "May I be free
  from enmity; may I be free from ill-will; may I be rid of suffering;
  may I be happy."
<P>  
  This thought having been developed, the next stage is to apply it in
  exactly the same form and to the same degree, to someone for whom one
  has naturally a feeling of friendship.
<P>
  In so doing, two points must be observed:  the object should be a
  living person, and should not be one of the opposite sex.  The second
  prohibition is to guard against the feeling of //metta// turning into
  its "near enemy," sensuality. Those whose sensual leanings have a
  different orientation must vary the rule to suit their own needs.
<P>  
  When the thought of //metta// has been developed towards a friend, the
  next object should be someone towards whom one has no marked feelings
  of like or dislike.  Lastly, the though of //metta// is to be turned
  towards someone who is hostile.  It is here that difficulties arise.
  They are to be expected, and the meditator must be prepared to meet
  and wrestle with them.  To this end, several techniques are described
  in the //Visuddhimagga// and elsewhere. The first is to think of the
  hostile personality in terms of //anatta// -- impersonality.  The
  meditator is advised to analyze the hostile personality into its
  impersonal components -- the body, the feelings, the perceptions, the
  volitional formations and the consciousness. The body, to begin with,
  consists of purely material items: hair of the head, hair of the body,
  skin, nails, teeth and so on.  There can be no basis for enmity
  against these.  The feelings, perceptions, volitional formations and
  consciousness are all transitory phenomena, interdependent,
  conditioned and bound up with suffering.  They are //anicca//,
  //dukkha// and //anatta//, impermanent, fraught with suffering and
  void of selfhood.  There is no more individual personality in them
  than there is in the physical body itself.  So towards them, likewise,
  there can be no real ground for enmity.
<P>  
  If this approach should prove to be not altogether effective, there
  are others in which emotionally counteractive states of mind are
  brought into play, as for example regarding the hostile person with
  compassion.  The meditator should reflect:  "As he (or she) is, so am
  I.  As I am, so is he. We are both bound to the inexorable Wheel of
  Life by ignorance and craving.  Both of us are subject to the law of
  cause and effect, and whatever evil we do, for that we must suffer.
  Why then should I blame or call anyone my enemy?  Rather should I
  purify my mind and wish that he may do the same, so that both of us
  may be freed from suffering."
 <P> 
  If this thought is dwelt upon and fully comprehended, feelings of
  hostility will be cast out.  When the thought of loving-kindness is
  exactly the same, in quality and degree, for all these four objects --
  oneself, one's friend, the person toward whom one is neutral, and the
  enemy -- the meditation has been successful.
 <P> 
  The next stage is to widen and extend it. This process is a threefold
  one:  suffusing //metta// without limitation, suffusing it with
  limitation, and suffusing it in all of the ten directions, east, west,
  north, south, the intermediate points, above and below.
 <P> 
  In suffusing //metta// without limitation (//anodhiso-pharana//), the
  meditator thinks of the objects of loving-kindness under five heads:
  all sentient beings; all things that have life; all beings that have
  come into existence; all that have personality; all that have assumed
  individual being.  For each of these groups separately he formulates
  the thought:  "May they be free from enmity; may they be free from
  enmity; may they be free from ill will; may they be rid of suffering;
  may they be happy.  For each object he specifies the particular group
  which he is suffusing with //metta//:  "May all sentient beings be
  free from enmity, etc... May all things that have life be free from
  enmity, etc."  This meditation embraces all without particular
  reference to locality, and so is called "suffusing without
  limitation."
 <P> 
  In suffusing //metta// with limitation (//odhiso-pharana//), there are
  seven groups which form the objects of the meditation.  They are:  all
  females; all males; all Noble Ones (those who have attained any one of
  the states of Sainthood); all imperfect ones; all Devas; all human
  beings; all beings in states of woe.  Each of the groups should be
  meditated upon as described above:  "May all females be free from
  enmity, etc."  This method is called "suffusing //metta// with
  limitation" because it defines the groups according to their nature
  and condition.
 <P> 
  Suffusing with //metta// all beings in the ten directions is carried
  out in the same way.  Directing his mind towards the east, the
  meditator concentrates on the thought:  "May all beings in the east be
  free from enmity; may they be free from ill will; may they be rid of
  suffering; may they be happy!"  And so with the beings in the west,
  the north, the south, the north-east, south-west, north-west,
  south-east, above and below.
 <P> 
  Lastly, each of the twelve groups belonging to the unlimited and
  limited suffusions of //metta// can be dealt with separately for each
  of the ten directions, using the appropriate formulas.
 <P> 
  It is taught that each of these twenty-two modes of practicing //metta
  bhavana// is capable of being developed up to the stage of a
  //appana-samadhi//, that is, the concentration which leads to jhana,
  or mental absorption. For this reason it is described as the method
  for attaining release of the mind through //metta// (//metta
  cetovimutti//).  It is the first of the Four Brahma Viharas, the
  sublime states of which the Karaniya Metta Sutta:  "//Brahmam etam
  viharam idhamahu//" -- "Here is declared the Highest Life."
 <P> 
  //Metta//, //karuna//, //mudita//, //upekkha//: [Nyanaponika Thera,
  //The Four Sublime States//, WHEEL 6.]  loving-kindness, compassion,
  sympathetic joy and detachment, these four states of mind represent
  the highest levels of mundane consciousness.  One who has attained to
  them and dwells in them is impervious to the ills of life.  Like a god
  he moves and acts in undisturbed serenity, armored against the blows
  of fate and the uncertainty of worldly conditions.  And the first of
  them to be cultivated is //metta//, because it is through boundless
  love that the mind gains its first taste of liberation.

        Unswayed by the emotions of the clans;<BR>
        And let him never do the slightest thing<BR>
        That other wise men might hold blamable.<P>

        (And let him think:)  "In safety and in bliss<BR>
        May creatures all be of a blissful heart.<BR>
        Whatever breathing beings there may be,<BR>
        No matter whether they are frail or firm,<BR>
        With none excepted, be they long or big<BR>
        Or middle sized, or be they short or small<BR>
        Or thick, as well as those seen or unseen,<BR>
        Or whether they are dwelling far or near,<BR>
        Existing or yet seeking to exist,<BR>
        May creatures all be of a blissful heart.<P>

        Let no one work another one's undoing<BR>
        Or even slight him at all anywhere;<BR>
        And never let them wish each other ill<BR>
        Through provocation or resentful thought.<P>

        And just as might a mother with her life<BR>
        Protect the son that was her only child,<BR>
        So let him then for every living thing<BR>
        Maintain unbounded consciousness in being,<BR>
        And let him too with love for all the world<BR>
        Maintain unbounded consciousness in being<BR>
        Above, below, and all round in between,<BR>
        Untroubled, with no enemy or foe.<BR>
        And while he stands or walks or while he sits<BR>
        Or while he lies down, free from drowsiness,<BR>
        Let him resolve upon this mindfulness<BR>
        This is Divine Abiding here, they say.<BR>
        But when he has no trafficking with views,<BR>
        Is virtuous, and has perfected seeing,<BR>
        And purges greed for sensual desires.<BR>
        He surely comes no more to any womb."
