    figure promi- nently in the early Buddhist texts is given in the following pages. The
    account will show that women were not a negligible factor in the ancient Buddhist
    community of India.</em></font><p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Abhirupananda</b> was
    the daughter of a Sakya noble named Khemaka. She was called Nanda the Fair for her great
    beauty and amiability. Her beloved kinsman, Carabhuta, died on the day on which she was to
    choose him from amongst her suitors. She had to leave the world against her will. Though
    she entered the order, she could not forget that she was beautiful. Fearing that, the
    Buddha would rebuke her, she used to avoid his presence. The Buddha knew that the time had
    come for her to acquire knowledge and asked Mahapajapati Gotami to bring all the
    bhikkhunis before him to receive instruction. Nanda sent a proxy for her. The Buddha said,
    &quot;Let no one come by proxy.&quot; So she was compelled to come to him. The Buddha by
    his supernatural power conjured up a beautiful woman, who became transformed into an old
    and fading figure. If had the desired effect, and Abhirupananda became an arhat.
    (Therigatha Commy., pp. 25-26.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Jenti or Jenta</b> was born in a princely family of the
    Licchavis at Vaisali. She won arhatship after hearing the dhamma preached by the Buddha.
    She developed the seven Sambojjhangas. (Ibid., p.27).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Citta</b> was born at Rajagaha in the family of a
    leading burgess. When she was of age, she one day heard the master preach and believed in
    his doctrine. She was ordained by Mahapajapati the Gotami. In her old age she climbed the
    vulture's peak and lived like a recluse. Her insight expanded and she won arhatship.
    (Ibid., p.33.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Sukka</b> was born at Rajagaha in the family of a rich
    householder. When she attained years of discretion, she believed in the Master's teaching
    and became a lay disciple. One day she heard Dhammadinna preach and was so greatly moved
    that she renounced the world and followed Dhammadinna. She performed all the exercises for
    acquiring insight and very soon attained arhatship with patisambhida. Thereupon she became
    a great preacher and was attended by 500 bhikkhus. One day, along with the other
    bhikkhunis, she went to the hermitage of the bhikkhunis and taught the Buddha's doctrine
    in such a way that everybody listened to her with rapt attention; even the tree-spirit was
    so much moved that it began to praise her. At this the people were excited and came to the
    sister and listened attentively. (Ibid., pp.57-61.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Sela</b> was born in the kingdom of Alavi, as the
    king's daughter. She was also known as Alavika. One day, while yet a maid, she went with
    the king and heard the Master preach. She became a believer and lay disciple. A few days
    after, she took orders and performed the exercises for insight. She subjugated the
    complexities of thought, word and deed and soon won arhatship. Thereafter she lived at
    Savatthi when the Buddha was there. She entered Andhavana to meditate after finishing her
    midday meal. Mara once tried in vain to persuade her to choose the sensuous life (Ibid.,
    p.61, f. Cf. Samyutta Nikaya, part 1, p.128).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Siha</b> was born at Vesali as the daughter of General
    Siha's sister. She was named after her maternal uncle. When she grew up, she heard the
    Master teaching the Norm to her maternal uncle and became a believer. She was permitted by
    her parents to enter the order. For seven years she could not acquire insight as her mind
    became always inclined to objects of external charm. Then she intended to die. She took a
    noose, hung it round the bough of a tree and fastened it round her neck. Thus she
    succeeded in impelling her mind to insight which grew within and she won arhatahip. She
    then took off the rope from her neck and went back to her hermitage. (Ibid., pp.79-80).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Sundari Nanda</b> was born in the royal family of the
    Sakyas. She was known as the beautiful Nanda. Thinking about the fact that her elder
    brother, her mother, her brother, her sister and her nephew had renounced the world, she
    too left it. Even after her renunciation, she was obsessed with the idea of her beauty and
    would not approach the Lord lest she should ber eproached for her folly. The Lord taught
    her in the same way as he did in the case of Nanda the Fair. She listened to the Master's
    teaching and enjoyed the benefit of the fruition of the first stage of sanctification. He
    then instructed her saying, &quot;Nanda, there is in this body not even the smallest
    essence. It is but a heap of bones covered with flesh and besmeared with blood under the
    shadow of decay and death.&quot; Afterwards she became an arhat. (Ibid., pp.80 f.; cf.
    Manora- thapurani, pp. 217-218).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Khema</b> was born in the royal family of Sagala. She
    was very beautiful and her skin was like gold. She became the consort of Bimbisara. One
    day she heard that the Buddha was in the habit of speaking ill of beauty, since then she
    did not appear before the Buddha. The king was a chief supporter of the Buddha. He asked
    his court-poets to compose a song on the glories of the Veluvana hermitage and to sing the
    song very loudly so that the queen might hear it. The royal order was carried out. Khema
    heard of the beauty of the hermitage and with the king's consent she came to the Veluvana
    Vihara, where the Buddha was staying at that time. When she was led before the Buddha, the
    latter conjured up a woman to be celestial nymph who stood fanning him with a palm leaf.
    Khema observed this woman like a more beautiful than she and was ashamed of her own grace.
    Sometime after she noticed again that the woman was passing from youth to middle age and
    then to old age, till with broken teeth, grey hair, and wrinkled skin, she fell on earth
    with her palm leaf. Then thought Khema that her beautiful body would meet with the same
    fate as that of the nymph. Then the Master, who knew her thoughts, said that persons
    subject to lust suffer from the result of their action, while those freed from all bondage
    forsake the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Master had finished speaking, Khema, according to
    the commentary, attained arhatship and according to the Apadana, she was established in
    the fruition of the first stage of sanctification and with the king's permission she
    entered the order before she became an arhat. Thereafter she made a name for her insight
    and was ranked foremost amongst the bhikkhunis possessing great wisdom. In vain Mara tried
    to tempt her with sensuous ideas. (Ibid., pp. 126 f.; cf. Manorathapurani, p.205; cf.
    Anguttara, n. 1, p.25).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Anopama</b> was the daughter of a banker named Majjha
    living in Saketa. She was of unique beauty. She was sued by many sons of bankers, higher
    officers of the State, but she thought that there was no happiness in household life. She
    went to the Master and heard his teachings. Her intelligence matured. She strove hard for
    insight and was established in the third fruition. On the seventh day thereafter she
    attained arhatship. (Ibid., pp.138-139.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Rohini</strong> was born at Vesali in the house of
    a very prosperous Brahman. When grown up she went to the Master and heard him preach the
    doctrine. She obtained sotapattiphalam. She converted her parents to Buddha's faith and
    got permission from them and entered the order. She performed the exercises for acquiring
    insight and very soon attained arhatship (Ibid., pp.214 f.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Subha</b> was the daughter of a certain goldsmith of
    Rajagaha. She was very beautiful and was therefore called Subha. When grown up she saw the
    Master and believed in his doctrine. The Master saw the maturity of her moral faculties
    and taught her the dhamma. She was afterwards established in the fruition of the first
    stage of sanctification. Thereafter she entered the order under Mahapajapafi Gotami. She
    strove hard for insight and in course of time she won arhatship. (Ibid., pp.236 f.).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Tissa</b> was born at Kapilavastu among the Sakyas. She
    renounced the world with Mahapajapati Gotami and became spiritually so developed that she
    attained arhatship. (Ibid., pp.11-13)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Sumedha</b>, daughter of King Konca of Mantavati, was
    averse to the pleasures of senses from her childhood. She renounced the world hearing the
    doctrine of the Buddha from the bhikkhunis. Very soon she acquired insight and attained
    arhatship (Ibid., 272 f.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Visakha</b> was the daughter of Sumanadevi, wife of
    Dhananjayasetthi, son of Mundakasetthi. Her abode was at Bhaddiyanagara in the kingdom of
    Anga. When seven years old Buddha with the bhikkhusamgha went to Bhaddiyanagara.
    Sumanadevi was one of the advisers of the king. Visakha with 500 female companions and 500
    chariots received Buddha, who gave instructions to her according to her nature and she
    obtained sotapattiphalam. The Buddha was invited to Visakha's house. Visakha who was
    endowed with five kinds of beauty was married to Punnavaddhana of Savatthi. The presents
    sent by the citizens of Savatthi for her, were distributed by her among the citizens with
    great courtesy. She made the citizens her own relatives. She refused to salute the naked
    heretics who were worshipped by her father-in-law. Her father-in-law was converted to
    Buddhism through her efforts. Once Visakha invited the bhikkhus and her father-in-law on
    hearing the sermon obtained sotapattiphalam (D.C., I, 384 f.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the death of her grandchild, who was very dear to her,
    Visakha went to see the Buddha with wet clothes and wet hair. The Buddha asked her whether
    she would be satisfied if all the people of Savatthi became her sons and grandsons. She
    replied in the affirmative. The Master asked her as to how many people met with their
    death at Savatthi. Visakha said from one to ten. The Buddha told her, &quot; Just think
    whether you would be free from wet clothes and wet hair&quot;. Visakha said that she did
    not want so many sons and grandsons, because acquisition of more sons and grandsons would
    bring greater suffering (Udana, 91-92).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Visakha, mother of Migara</b>, was the foremost of the
    female supporters of the Buddha (A.N., 1, p. 26). Once on a sabbath day she went to the
    Buddha while the latter was in her palace named Pubbarama. Buddha instructed Visakha thus,
    &quot;There were three kinds of uposatha and the ariya uposatha is the best of the
    uposathas. The Master then said that in order to observe ariya uposatha one should
    meditate on the Buddha, Dhamma and Samgha. Silas must be unbroken and fully observed. One
    should also meditate on the qualities of gods. One should follow Arhats who follow
    precepts throughout their lives. By observing ariya uposatha one may obtain great
    happiness and may be reborn in one of the heavens commencing from the Catumaharajika to
    the Paranimmittavasavatti and enjoy great celestial happiness there (A.N., I, 205-215).
    Visakha was further instructed by the Buddha thus, &quot;Dependence on others is
    suffering, independence brings happiness&quot;. (Udana, p.18). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visakha once blamed the bhikkhus for not allowing her
    grandson to be ordained during the lent, as owing to this delay her grandson's mind was
    changed. (Vinaya Pitaka, 1, 153.) She once went to the Buddha and invited him together
    with the bhikkhus to take food at her house the next morning. Heavy rains fell on the
    following morning and the bhikkhus, as they had no bathing costumes, bathed themselves
    naked. Visakha came to know this fact from her maid servant who was sent to call the
    bhikkhus. The Buddha together with the bhikkhus came to her house. She fed the Buddha, and
    the bhikkhus satisfactorily. After they had finished their meal, Visakha prayed to the
    Buddha for the following boons:--As long as she lived, she would give garments for the
    rainy season to the bhikkhus, food to the guests and food to those going abroad, diet to
    the sick bhikkhus, food to the sick-- nurses, medicine for the sick bhikkhus, rice gruel
    to the bhikkhus daily and bathing garments to the bhikkhunis (V.P., vol. 1, pp.290-292).
    From this fact it is evident that Visakha introduced bathing garments for the bhikkhunis.
    It was Visakha who offered to the Buddha a napkin which he accepted. (V.P., 1, 296). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We are further informed that Visakha, as soon as she heard
    of the advent of the quarrelsome Kosambian bhikkhus, approached the Buddha to take his
    advice as to how she should deal with them. The Buddha advised her to offer charities to
    the two parties of the quarrelsome Kosambian monks, (V.P.,1, 356). Visakha prepared a
    golden water-pot for the Buddha. A samanera named Sumana brought water in that pot for the
    Buddha from Anotatta lake. (D.C., IV, P.135) She offered a water pot and a broom to the
    Buddha, which he accepted and also instructed the bhikkhus to use them. Once she went to
    the Buddha and offered a palm-leaf fan, which he accepted (V.P., II, 129-130). Visakha was
    so very kind to the bhikkhus that she built a mansion for them, The bhikkhus at first
    hesitated to use it, but afterwards asked for Buddha's permission which was granted.
    (V.P., II, 169).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visakha once went to the hermitage of Khadiravaniyarevata,
    but she found it to be in the midst of thorns and not fit for human habitation. (D.C., II,
    194-195). Visakha was an important personage, because among the Bhikkhus if there were any
    matter for reference, it was referred to her, as we find in the case of Kundadhanathera
    who used to walk about with a woman behind him. (D.C.,111, 54-55.) In the family of
    Visakha young girls used to serve the Bhikkhus by making arrangements for their food, etc.
    (D.C., III, 161). Visakha's son's daughter named Datta who was entrusted with the care of
    the Bhikkhusamgha died in her absence. Visakha was very much afflicted with grief. The
    Buddha, consoled her (D.C., III, pp.278-279).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visakha was one day going to the city garden wearing all
    sorts of rich ornaments amongst which may be mentioned mahalata, an ornament of
    extraordinary beauty and of immense value. (Cf. Dhammapada Commy., I, 412.) On the way she
    thought why should she go to the city garden like a mere girl; it was better that she
    should go to the Vihara and listen to the discourses of the Buddha. Moved by the thought,
    she went to the Lord, put off her ornament, mahalata and gave it to her maid-servant to
    keep it and return it when she came out of the Vihara. Thereafter she listened to the
    noble discourses of the Buddha. On coming out of the Vihara, she asked for her ornament.
    The maid-servant said that she had left it in the Vihara. Both of them returned to the
    Vihara and found it. Visakha offered it to the Lord, and under his directions built a
    Vihara with the sale proceeds of the ornament, which amounted to nine crores and a lakh.
    Visakha offered to her maid-servant all the merit that accrued for constructing the
    Vihara. The latter approved of her charity and died shortly afterwards. (Vimanavatthu
    Commy., pp.187-189.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Anula</b> was the queen of the king of Ceylon.
    Surrounded by five hundred girls, she bowed to the theras and honoured them to her heart's
    content. Thera Mahinda preached dhamma to them. Peta stories, Vimana stories and
    Saccasamyutta more narrated to them. When they heard the most excellent portion of the
    doctrine, princess Anula and her five hundred attendants attained sotapatti. She became a
    believer in the Buddha, Dhamma and the Samgha. With her five hundred attendants she
    received the Pabbajja ordination from Samghamitta Mahatheri. (Dipavamsa, p.68; cf.
    Mahavamsa, Geiger's Text, pp. 108, 155.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Gopika</b> was a Sakya princess. She was pleased with
    the Buddha, Dhamma and Samgha. She used to observe precepts fully, became disgusted with
    female life and meditated in order to become a man. (Digha N., II, 271.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Canda</b> came of a Brahman family. She earned her
    living by begging from door to door. One day she came to the spot where Patacara had just
    finished her meal. The bhikkhunis saw her hungry and gave her some food to eat. She ate
    the food and took her seat on one side. She then listened to the discourse of the Theri
    and renounced the world. She practised hard to attain insight. Her knowledge matured and
    her determination was strong. Hence she succeeded in attaining arhatship with patisambhida
    (Th. Commy., pp. 120-121.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Gutta</b> came of a Brahman family at Savatthi. In her
    youth household life became repugnant to her. She obtained her parents' consent and
    entered the order under Mahapajapati Gotami. Thereafter she could not for sometime control
    her mind from external interests. Then the Master gave her suitable instructions, and she
    attained arhatship together with patisambhida. (Th. Commy., pp. 157-159.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Vijaya</b> came of a certain clansmen's family of
    Rajagaha. She was a friend of Khema. When she heard that Khema, a king's consort, had
    renounced the world, she went to Khema, who taught her the Norm and ordained her. Very
    soon she won insight and after a short time attained arhatship with analytical knowledge.
    (Th. Commy, pp.159-160.) Mara came, to tempt her by saying, &quot;You are young and
    beautiful, I am also young and beautiful, let us enjoy ourselves with music.&quot; She
    replied, &quot;I find delight in rupa, sadda, gandha, etc. and I don't like soft-touch. I
    hate very much my rotten body which is easily destructible. My ignorance is
    dispelled.&quot; Then Mara left her. (S.N., 1, pp. 130-131).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Cala, Upacala and Sisupacala</b> were born in Magadha
    at the village of Nalaka as the children of a Brahmani named Surupasari. They were younger
    sisters of Sariputta. When they heard that their brother had left the world for the order,
    they too renounced the world and striving hard, attained arhatship. In vain Mara tried to
    stir up sensual desires in them. (Th. Commy., 162-163; cf. S.N., Pt. I, PP. 132-134).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Uppalavanna</b> came of a banker's family at Savatthi.
    Her skin was of the colour of the heart (gabbha) of the blue lotus. Hence she was called
    Uppalavanna. Many princes and banker's sons wanted to marry her. But she renounced the
    world, went to the bhikkhunis and was ordained. Thereafter one day she lighted a lamp, and
    by continually contemplating on the flame of the lamp, she gradually obtained arhatship
    with adhinna and patisambhida. (Th. Commy., 182 ff.) She was assigned a chief place among
    those who had the gift of iddhi. (Manorathapurani, p.207 ff.; Anguttara N., I, 25).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Samyutta Nikaya tells us that Theri Uppalavanna went
    to Andhavana to meditate. There she sat at the foot of the Sala tree. Mara came to her and
    said to her, &quot;You are Sitting at the foot of a fully blossomed Sala tree, are you not
    afraid of the wicked?&quot; She replied, &quot;I do not care for the wicked. I do not care
    for you.&quot; Mara left her. (Pt. 1, pp. 131-132). After defeating Mara, Uppalavanna was
    molested by her maternal uncle's son Ananda, who was enamoured of her beauty and who
    wanted to marry her. Although Uppalavanna had become a bhikkhuni, Ananda could not give up
    the desire of marrying her. Once Ananda concealed himself in the room of the Theri under
    her bedstead in her absence. When the Theri returned home and lay herself down on the
    bedstead, Ananda suddenly came out and committed rape on her. The Theri informed the
    bhikkhunis of this fact, and through the bhikkhunis brought this to the notice of the
    Buddha, who prohibited the bhikkhunis from living in forests. (D.C., II, 48-51.)
    Uppalavanna Theri acquired the power of performing a miracle by coming in to the presence
    of the Buddha to worship him with the pomp and grandeur of an individual monarch, being
    surrounded by a retinue extending over 36,000 yojanas and this miracle was visible to an
    assembly extending over twelve yojanas. (D.C., III, P.211.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Sumangalamata</b> came of a poor family of Savatthi.
    She was married to a basket maker. She acquired great merit. One day while reflecting on
    all she had suffered, she was much affected and her insight quickening, she attained
    arhatship with analytical knowledge. (Th. Commy., 28-30.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Punna or Punnika</b> acquired great merit in her
    previous birth, but owing to her pride she could not root out klesas (sins). She was born
    of a domestic slave at Savatthi in the household of Anathapindika, the banker. She
    obtained sotapattiphalam after hearing the Sihanada Suttanta. Afterwards Anathapindika
    gave her freedom because she defeated a Brahman named Udakasuddhika. Punna renounced
    worldly life and entered the order. She practised insight and very soon attained arhatship
    with patisambhida. (Th. Commy., pp. 199 f.).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Sundari</b> was born at Benares as the daughter of
    Sujata, a Brahman. On her brother's death, her father became overwhelmed with grief. With
    the advice of Theri Vasitthi her father renounced the world, met the Buddha at Mithila,
    entered the order and in course of time attained arhatship. Sundari heard of her father's
    renouncing the world. She sacrificed all her wealth and pleasures of all kinds. She
    secured her mother's consent to leave the world. She then entered the order and striving
    hard she attained arhatship with patisambhida (Th. Commy., 228 f.).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Vimala</b> was born at Vesali as the daughter of a
    public woman. When advanced in years she was moved to see one day the venerable
    Mahamoggallana going about for alms. She went to his house to entice him. Mahamoggallana
    rebuked her. She was ashamed and became a believer and lay sister. Sometime affer she
    entered the order and very soon attained arhatship. (Th. Commy., 76-77.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Mittakalika</b> came of a Brahman's family in the town
    of Kammasadamma in the kingdom of the Kurus. When she grew up she one day heard the
    teaching of the Great Discourse on the Mahasatipatthana and entered the order of sisters.
    For seven years she could not elevate herself intellectually. Later on she won arhatship
    together with analytical knowledge. (Th. Commy., pp. 89-90).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Sakula (Pakula)</b> was born in a Brahman family at
    Savatthi. Seeing the Master accepting the gift of the Jetavana, she became a believer. One
    day she heard the preaching of an arhat and was greatly convinced. She entered the order,
    strove hard for insight and soon won arhatship. She was given the foremost place by the
    Master among the bhikkhunis possessing divine eyes. (Th. Commy., pp. 91 f.; cf.

    flowers. She told Samavati that she had acquired knowledge and came to realise that
    stealing things is a sin committed by a person who listened to the Buddha's sermon.

    after his father's death. He then defeated all the kings gradually and went to worship the
    deity, but the deity, seeing that many kings would be killed, being compassionate to them,
    refused his worship on the ground that the queen of King Uggasena whom he had defeated was
    not brought. The king had her brought, and she preached a sermon on the avoidance of
    life--slaughter in their presence. The deity approved and the king refrained from
    life-slaughter, and released the defeated and captured kings, who praised Dinna for this

    II, pp.276--278). On her husband renouncing the world she divided all her riches equally
    between her sons. In a very short time her sons and daughters-in-law ceased to show
    respect. She then entered the Order of the bhikkhunis and began to practise insight
    strenuously in her old age. The master gave her suitable instructions. Sona Bhikkhuni then
    attained arhatship. (Th. Commy,, 95.) She occupied the foremost place among the

    if she did not get him. Her father heard of this and got Satthuka released by bribing the
    guard heavily. Satthuka was brought to Bhadda, who, decked in jewels, waited upon him. He
    saw her jewels and coveted them. He told Bhadda to get ready an offering to be given to
    the cliff deity. Bhadda did so. She adorned herself with all her jewels and accompanied
    her husband to the precipice with an offering. On reaching the top of the precipice,
    Satthuka told her to put off all her ornaments which he had come there to take. In vain
    Bhadda pleaded that She herself and all her ornaments belonged to him. Satthuka did not
    take any notice of her pleadings. He wanted all her ornaments. Bhadda then prayed for an
    embrace with all her jewels on. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Satthuka granted her prayer. Bhadda embraced him in front
    and then, as if embracing him from the back, pushed him over the precipice. Satthuka died
    (cf. Dhammapada Commy., vol. II, pp.217 f.). Thereafter Bhadda did not come home, but she
    left the world and entered the Order of the Niganthas. She learnt the doctrine of the
    Niganthas and left their company. Thereafter she found no one equal to her in debate. She
    setup the branch of a jambu tree on a heap of sand at the gate of some village or town,
    with the declaration that any body able to join issue with her in debate should trample on
    this bough. Sariputta ordered some children who were near the bough, to trample on it. The
    children did so. When Bhadda saw the bough trampled, she challenged Sariputa to a debate
    before some Sakyan recluses and was advised to go to Buddha for refuge. She went to the
    Buddha who discerned the maturity of her knowledge. Buddha spoke a verse and she attained
    arhatship with analytical knowledge. (Th. Commy., pp. 99f.) Bhadda was assigned a chief
    place among the bhikkhunis possessing ready wit. (Manorathapurani, p. 375; cf. Anguttara

    the child and was very much pleased. He then had Ubbiri anointed as queen. After a few
    years Jiva died. The mother used to go to the cemetery and shed tears. Questioned by the
    Exalted One as to why she was weeping, she said that she was sheding tears for her
    deceased daughter. She was questioned by the Exalted One as to which of the 84,000.
    daughters she was weeping for. She then spent a little thought and intelligence over the
    Norm thus taught by the Buddha. She was established in insight, and in due course she won
    arhatship by virtue of great merits. (Th. Commy.,53-54).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Kisagotami</b> came of poor family at Savatthi. She was
    married to a rich banker's son who had forty crores of wealth. (D.C., II., pp. 270-75).
    Bodhisatta was her maternal uncle's son. One day, while the Bodhisatta was returning home
    after receiving the news of Rahula's birth, he was seen by Kisagotami from her palace.
    Buddha's beauty pleased Kisagotami so much that she uttered a stanza, the purport of which
    is, &quot;the mother who has such a child and the father who has such a son and the wife
    who has such a husband are surely happy&quot; (nibbuta), but the Bodhisatta took the word
    nibbuta in the sense of nibbanam. The Bodhisatta presented her with a pearl necklace for
    making him hear such auspicious and sacred words. (D.C., vol. I, p. 85; cf. Atthasalini,
    p. 34.) On the death of her only child she went to the Buddha with the dead body and
    requested him to bring the dead to life. Buddha asked her to bring a little mustard seed
    from a house where no man had died. Kisagotami went from house to house, but she came back
    to Buddha quite unsuccessful. The Buddha delivered a sermon which led her to become a
    bhikkhuni. Her insight grew within a short time and she attained arhatship. (Th. Commy.,
    174 f.). Then the master assigned her the foremost place among the bhikkhunis who used
    very rough and simple robes. (A.N., 1, p.25; cf.,Manoratha; purani, p.380.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once Kisagotami went to Andhavana to meditate. Mara, came
    to her and said,&quot; You have killed your sons and now you are crying. Why are you not
    searching for another man? &quot; Kisagotami replied, &quot;I have completely destroyecl
    my sons and my husband and I have no sorrow. I am not afraid of you, my attachment is
    destroyed and ignorance is dispelled. Killing the army of death I live sinless.&quot; Mara
    then left her. (S.N., I, pp.129-130). Once Kisagotami was coming through the sky to
    worship the Buddha while Sakka with his retinue was seated before the Buddha. She did not
    come to the Buddha, but worshipped him from the sky and went away. Being questioned by
    Sakka, the Buddha answered that she was his daughter. Kisagotami, who was the foremost
    among the bhikkhunis, used very rough and simple robes. (D.C.,IV, 156-157.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Patacara</b> came of a banker's family at Savatthi. In
    her youth she formed an intimacy with a servant of her house. On the day fixed for her
    marriage with another youth of equal rank she eloped with her lover and dwelt in a hamlet.
    There she used to perform household duties, and her lover used to bring wood from the
    forest and work in a field belonging to others. Shortly afterwards Patacara gave birth to
    a child, but at the time of the birth of her second child, a storm arose. Her husband went
    to a forest to cut grass and sticks. While he cut a stake standing on an ant-hill, a snake
    came from the ant-hill and bit him. He fell there and died. The next morning Patacara went
    to the forest with her two children and found her husband dead. She lamented and left the
    place. On her way to her father's house there was a river, the water of which was
    knee-deep. She lost her children while crossing the river. With tears of grief she came to
    Savatthi and learnt that her parents and brother had perished under the debris of the
    fallen house. She turned mad. Since then she did not wear clothing, and was therefore
    known as Patacara. One day the Exalted One saw her in that plight and said, &quot;Sister!
    Cover your shamelessness.&quot; She regained her consciousness, and the Lord taught her
    that sons, parents and kinsfolk were no shelter, and asked her to discern this truth in
    order to make clear quickly the way to nibbana. Then she was established in the
    sotapattiphalam. She attained arhatship with analytical knowledge (Th. Commy., p.108 f;
    Manorathapurani, pp.356-360; cf. A.N., I, 25) Thereafter she preached the Buddha's dhamma
    and converted many afflicted women to the Buddhist faith. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Therigatha Commy. says that Patacara had five hundred
    female disciples, who came of different families of different places. They were married,
    bore children and lived domestic lives. Overwhelmed with grief at the loss of children
    they went to Patacara, who asked them not to weep when the manner of birth and death was
    unkown to them. They were greatly moved by Patacara's teachings and renounced the world
    under her. They performed exercises for insight and soon became established in arhatship
    with patisambhida. (Th. Commy., pp. 122-123; cf. Dhammapada Commy., II, p.260 f.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Vasitthi</b> came of a clansmen's family at Vaisali.
    Her parents gave her in marriage to a clansman's son of equal position. She had a son.
    When the child was able to run about, he died. Vasitthi went mad with grief. She came to
    Mithila and there she saw the Exalted One, self-controlled and self-contained. At the
    sight of the Buddha the frenzy left her and she recovered her normal mind. The master
    taught her the outlines of the Norm. Performing all proper duties, she acquired insight,
    and struggling with the help of full Knowledge, she soon attained arhatship together with
    a thorough grasp of the Norm in form and spirit. (Th. Commy., 124-125.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Dhammadinna</b> came of a clansmen's family at Rajagaha
    and became the wife of a Setthi named Visakha. One day her husband heard the master
    teaching, and after hearing him he did not hold converse with her as he used to do before,
    but renounced the worldly life. Dhammadinna too became a bhikkhuni and took up her
    residence in a village. One of the great merits acquired in her previous births was her
    subjugation of the complexities of thought, word and deed. By virtue of this merit, she
    soon attained arhatship together with thorough mastery of the form and meaning of the
    Dhamma. Then she returned to Rajagaha and was questioned by her husband on the khandas and
    the like. She answered so correctly that she was praised by the Buddha and was ranked as
    foremost among the sisters who could preach. (Th. Commy., 15; cf. Manorathpurani, pp.
    360-363; Anjuttara N., I, 25.)</font></p>

    she entered the order of the bhikkhunis. She performed exercises of insight and within a
    short time won arhatship. Mara tried in vain to divert her from this path. From the
    Samyutta Nikaya we learn that Mara came to her and said,&quot;What is to be obtained by
    the Rishis, you are, with slight wisdom, trying to have it. That which is difficult to be
    obtained by great sages, you being a silly woman, want to have.&quot; She replied: &quot;
    If my mind is steadfast, I must acquire it, my womanly nature will not prevent me from
    acquiring it.&quot; Mara then left her. (Th. Commy., pp. 66-67; cf. S.N., 1, p.129.) </font></p>

    kinsfolk. She then left the world and dwelt five years in the hermitage of the heretics.
    Thereafter, she was ordained by Mahapajapati Gotami. Establishing insight she soon won
    arhatship. By the master she was ranked first among the bhikkhunis who could remember
    previous births (Th. Commy., 67 f.; cf. Manorathapurani, p.375; cf. Anguttara N., I,

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Besides the women who embraced a homeless life and became
    bhikkhunis and theris, there were others who were staunch believers in the Buddha's
    dhamma. These women used to lead a domestic life, offering charities in the shape of coin
    and kind to theras, bhikkhunis and bhikkhus in the expectation of a happier rebirth or for
    the benefit of departed relations. The incidents in the life of some of these women are
    recorded in the Buddhist literature, and it would not be out of place here to mention them
    below. </font></p>

    departed father. (Vide my Buddhist Conception of Spirits, p.48).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Lakhuma</b> lived near one of the gates of Benares. She
    used to offer a spoonful of rice to the bhikkhus when they entered the town by that gate.
    Thus she acquired the habit of offering charity. In the asanasala (rest house), she used
    to prepare seats for, and supply water to, the bhikkhus. She was established in sotapatti.
    After death she was reborn in the Tavatimsa heaven. (Vide my Heaven and Hell, p.50.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A daughter of a certain upasaka of Rajagaha</b> was
    very much devoted to Mahamoggallana. One day she welcomed a thera, offered him a seat,
    worshipped him with a garland of sumana flower and gave him sweets, etc. On her death, she
    was reborn in the Tavatimsa heaven. (Vimanavatthu Commy., 179-179.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Mallilka</b> was the daughter of a Brahman steward of
    the Sakya Mahanaman. On her father's death she was taken by Mahanaman to his house. She
    was at first named Chandra. She made a wreath which satisfied Mahanaman so much that he
    changed her name to Mallika. One day Mallika went to the garden with her food, and just
    then the Blessed One passed them collecting alms. Mallika thought of offering her food to
    the Buddha, and the latter knowing her thought held out his bowl. She put her offering in
    it and wished at the same time that some day she might be free from slavery or poverty.
    One day Pasenadi carried away by his horse in the heat of the chase came to Mahanaman's
    garden. There he saw Mallika. Re- quested by the king, Mallika rubbed his feet with a
    towel. As soon as she did so the king fell asleep. When he awoke he found out who she was,
    went to Mahanaman and married her. She was then taken to Sravasti and in time she brought
    forth a son named Virudhaka (Rockhill, Life of the Buddha, pp, 75-77), and also a
    daughter. (S.N., I, p. 86). This story is nothing but a Tibetan version of the story of
    Pasenadi and Vasabhakhattiya. Cf. Svapnavasabhadatta of Bhasa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again we read that Mallikadevi went to the Buddha and
    asked him thus, &quot;What is the cause of a woman's getting an ugly appearance, bad
    habit, wretched state and poverty in this world? What is the cause of a woman who is of
    this nature becoming very rich and influential? What is the cause of a woman who is of
    good appearance and lovely becoming poor and uninfluential, and vice versa? &quot;The
    Buddha answered thus: &quot; The woman who is very hot-tempered and who gets angry for
    slight reason becomes poor and ugly if she does not offer any charity to the Samanas or
    Brahmanas, but if she offers charity to the Samanas or Brahamanas, she becomes rich and
    influential alth- ough she is hot-tempered.&quot; The Buddha further said &quot;She who is
    not hot-tempered and does not become angry for slight reason becomes poor and influential
    if she does not offer any charity to the Samanas or Brahmanas.&quot; Mallika admitted that
    on account of her hot-temper and peevish nature she had an ugly appearance, but she, on
    account of her previous charities, became a queen. She further said that she would treat
    properly the daughter of the Ksatriyas, the Brahmanas and the other householders who were
    subordinate to her. She became a devotee of the Buddha, being very pleased with him.
    (Anguttara Nikaya, II, pp. 202-205). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is noteworthy that once Mallika was asked by Pasenadi
    whether she had anybody dearer to her than her own soul. She replied in the negative.
    Pasenadi was asked the same question by his wife, and he too answered it in the negative.
    She then went to the Buddha and related the matter to him. The Buddha said that they were
    right in holding that there was nothing more favourite than one's own soul. (Udana,
    p.47;cf. also S.N., 1, p.75.) Once Pasenadi invited Buddha to teach Dhamma to queens
    Mallika and Vasabhakhattiya as they were desirous of learning it. Buddha asked the king to
    engage Ananda for the purpose as it was not possible for him to go every day. Mallikadevi
    learnt it thoroughly, but Vasabhakhattiya was not so mindful of learning Dhamma. (D.C., 1,
    382). It was Mallika who saved the life of many living beings who were brought for
    sacrifice to save Pasenadi from the evil effect of hearing four horrible sounds at
    midnight by inducing him to go to the Buddha to take instructions from him. (D.C. vol. II,
    pp. 7-8). After her death, Mallikadevi had to suffer in the Avici hell because she
    deceived her husband by telling a lie about her misconduct. (D.C., III, 119f.).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mallikadevi made the following arrangements on the
    occasion of Pasenadi's offering a unique gift to the Buddha and the bhikkhus:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. She made a canopy with Sala wooden parts, under which
      five hundred bhikkhus could sit within the parts and five hundred outside them.</font></p>

      hundred elephants standing at the back of five hundred bhikkhus.</font></p>

    sent her to her father's house. On the way she went to the Jetavana to salute the Buddha
    who was informed by her that her husband was sending her home as she was childless. The
    Buddha asked her to go to her husband's house. Bandhula was informed of this fact and
    thought that the Buddha must have got the idea that she would be pregnant. The sign of
    pregnancy was visible in her, and she desired to drink water and bathe in the well-guarded
    tank of the Licchavis. Bandhula with his wife visited the tank and he made his wife bathe
    and drink water therefrom. (D.C., I, pp. 349-351.) Mallika, wife of Bandhula, and daughter
    of a Malla king of Kusinara, offered worship to the relic of the Buddha with plenty of
    perfumes and garlands and also an ornament named mahalata which was very valuable. In
    consequence of this, she, after death, was reborn in the Tavatimsa heaven where she was
    bedecked all in yellow. (Vimanavatthu Commy., 165.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Vajira</b> was a bhikkuni who was tempted by Mara when
    she went to Andhavana to meditate. Mara came to her and asked her, &quot; Who has created
    the being? Wherefrom it has come, and. where will it go?&quot; She said, &quot;The
    aggregation of five khandhas constitutes the sattas.&quot; Mara then left her. (Samyutta
    Nikaya, I, PP. 134-135.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Cira bhikkhuni</b> was given a robe by an upasika of
    the Buddha. This message was declared by a Yakkha in the streets of Rajagaha saying that
    the giver by giving a robe to Cira who was free from fetters, could acquire much merit.
    (Samyutta Nikaya, I, p. 213.)</font></p>

    Rajagaha. Once the banker went to attend a famous ceremony, and Uttttra with her husband
    was at home. The husband of Uttara went to cultivate in the morning. Uttara was going with
    cooked food to her husband in the field. On the way she met Sariputta who was just rising
    up from nirodha-samapatti (meditation on cessrttion) and offered the food to him, with the
    result that she became the richest lady of Rajagaha, and her husband became a banker named
    Mahadhanasetthi. (D.C., III, pp. 302 f.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Punna</b> was the maid-servant of a banber of Savatthi.
    Once she was asked to husk a large quantity of paddy. While engaged in husking the paddy
    at night, she went outside the house to take rest. At this time Dabba, a Mallian, was in
    charge of making arrangements for the sleeping accommodation of the bhikkhus who were
    guests. Punna with some cakes went out to enquire of the cause of their movements with
    lights at night. The Buddha went out for alms by the way in which Punna was. She offered
    all the cakes to the Buddha without keeping any for herself. The Buddha accepted them.
    Punna was thinking whether Buddha would partake of her food. The Buddha did partake of it
    in her house. The effect of this offer was that Punna obtained sotapattiphalam where the
    offer was made. (D.C., III, pp. 321 f.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Rohini</b> was Anuruddha's sister. She was suffering
    from white leprosy. She did not go to her brother as she was suffering. Anuruddha sent for
    her and asked her to build a rest- house for bhikkhus to get rid of her sin. She kept the
    rest-house clean even when if was under construction, and she did this with great devotion
    for a long time. She became free from her disease. Shortly afterwards the Buddha went to
    Kapilavatthu and sent for Rohini. The Buddha told her that she was the queen of the king
    of Benares in her former birth. The king was enamoured of the beauty of a dancing girl.
    The queen knowing this, became jealous of her, and to punish her she put something in her
    cloth and bathing water which produced terrible itching all over her body. On account of
    this sin, she got this disease. She obtained sotapattiphalam and the colour of her body
    became golden. (D.C., III, pp. 295 f.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Suppavasa</b>, a daughter of a Koliyan was pregnant for
    seven years, but she did not give birth to any child. After seven years, labour pain began
    and she sufffered terribly for seven days, but no child was born. She requested her
    husband to go to the Buddha and to salute him on her behalf, reporting the matter to him.
    Her husband went to the Buddha and informed him. The Buddha desired that Suppavasa would
    give birth to a son without any pain and disease. While the Buddha was expressing this
    desire, a son was born. Her husband was sent again to invite the Buddha to her house for
    seven days. The Buddha accepted the invitation. The Master took his meal there for seven
    days and converted both of them (Udana, pp. 15-17; Cf, D.C., IV, 192-193). Suppavasa used
    to give alms daily to five hundred bhikkhus. (Dhamapada Commy.,1, 339.) She became the
    foremost of the upasikas, offering the best food to the Buddha. Buddha told her the good
    effect of offering food, and he further said that an offerer by offering rice offers the
    lease of life, beauty, happiness and strength. The offerer in return obtains celestial
    life, celestial beauty, happiness and strength. (Anguttara Nikaya, II, pp. 62-63).</font></p>

    When her husband was ill and was ready to die, free from anxiety, she told him that she
    knew spinning and weaving and management of household affairs and children. She also told
    her husband that she would never remarry after his death, as both of them lived the life
    of a recluse for sixteen years. She informed her husband that after his death she would
    meet the Buddha and the bhikkhusamgha. She also promised to observe the precepts. She also
    told her husband that she was one of the female devotees who fully observed the precepts,
    controlled the mind, had strong faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and Samgha, and who became
    fearless and did not depend on others except the Buddha for support. (A.N., III, 295 f.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Bojjha</b> was a devotee who approached the Buddha, who
    preached to her the reward of observing the precepts and the Sabbath. The Master said to
    her. &quot;Happiness obtained by observing Sabbath is sixteen times greater than that
    enjoyed by the sixteen countries.&quot; (A.N., IV, pp.259-260.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Velukantaki Nandamata</b> was a devotee of the Buddha.
    She gave offerings to Sariputta and Moggallana. Referring to this the Buddha said, &quot;A
    giver must be pleased before he gives dana; his mind must be pleased while giving dana and
    after giving dana. The receiver of the offering must be free from passion, hatred and
    delusion. The consequence of such a gift is immeasurable&quot;. Nandamata gave such a gift
    to Sariputta and Moggallana, and she obtained immeasurable consequence of the gift. (A.N.,

    once repeating the Parayana Sutta of the Sutta Nipata in a sweet voice. King Vessavana was
    going from north to south, and he waited there till Nandamata finished her repetition and
    praised her much. Nandamata told Vessavans that the merit acquired by the act would he
    beneficial to him. Vessavana gladly assented and said that the merit which would be
    acquired by her through the gift made to Sariputta and Moggallana would prove beneficial
    to him. (A. N., IV, p.63 f.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Migasala</b> was an upasika who went to Ananda and
    said, &quot;According to the instruction of the Buddha, a brahmacari and an abrahamacari
    go to the same place after death and enjoy the same amount of happiness.&quot; Ananda went
    to the Buddha to have this problem solved. The Buddha said that the lay devotee was
    ignorant and uneducated and therefore she could not realize it properly. The Buddha
    further said, &quot;Even a householder may acquire the same amount of merit as acquired by
    a brahmacari who does not fulfil his duties properly.&quot;</font></p>

    rising up from nirodhasamapatti and vedana. Dhammadina gave satisfactory answers to all
    the questions. She said, &quot;Five upadana khandhas constitute, sakkayaditthi. Tanha
    means sakkaya samudayo. Destruction of tanha means sakkaya nirodha. The noble eight-fold
    path is the means of attaining sakkayanirodha. Ignorant people take the five upadana
    khandhas jointly and separately as atta (soul); the learned and noble disciples do not
    take them in this sense. Those who obtain nirodha samapatti are stopped one after another.
    The three kinds of vedana are sukha, dukkha and adukkhamasukha (M.N., 1., 299 f.)</font></p>

    father-in-law and mother-in-law. On her death she became a peti. One day she appeared
    before her husband and gave him an account of her past misdeeds. The husband made gifts
    for her sake to the bhikkhus, and Nanda was released from her miseries. (P.D. on the
    Petavathu, pp. 89-92.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Revati</b> was the daughter of a householder of
    Benares. She had no faith in the Buddha, and was very uncharitable. For some days she was
    forced by her parents to do meritorious deeds in order to win Nandiya, a neighbour's son,
    as her husband. After marriage, Nandiya made her follow him in his meritorious deeds.
    Thereafter Nandiya had to go abroad. He asked his wife to continue all the meritorious
    deeds. Revati did so for seven days. Then she stopped all meritorious deeds and began to
    abuse the bhikkhus who had come to her house for alms. Nandiya, on his return, found that
    all his acts of charity had been discontinued. After death Revati became a hellish
    creature. On his death Nandiya became a devata. He saw with his divine eyes that Revati
    had become a hellish creature. He then went to her and asked her to approve of the
    meritorious acts done by him. As soon as she did so, she became a devata and resided with
    Nandiya in heaven. (B.C. Law, Buddhist Conception of Spirits, p.79.)</font></p>

    The harem containing Samavati with 500 female attendants was burnt while Udena was in the
    royal garden. The matter was referred to the Buddha, who said, &quot; Each upasika had
    gone according to her kamma, some have become sotapanna sakadagami and anagami and so
    forth (Udana, p.79).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There was a maid-servant named <b>Birani</b> engaged by
    Asoka Brahmana to give food daily to the samgha which was enough for eight bhikkhus. This
    she used to do with devotion, with the result that after her death she was born in avimana
    in the sky. (Mahavamsa, p.214.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Rupananda</b> was Buddha's step-sister. She thought
    that her eldest brother renounced the world and had become a Buddha. Her younger brother
    Nanda was a bhikkhu and Rahulakumara had obtained ordination. Her husband too became a
    bhikkhu and her mother, Mahapajapatigotami, became a bhikkhuni. She renounced the world
    thinking that so many of her relatives had renounced the world. she did not go before the
    Buddha as she was proud of her beauty, while the Buddha used to preach the impermanency
    and worthlessness of form. The other bhikkhunis and bhikkhus always used to praise the
    Buddha in her presence and tell her that all having different tastes became blessed by
    seeing the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Nanda</b> thought of going to the Buddha with other
    bhikkhunis but she would not show herself to the Buddha. Ananda came to know that Nanda
    had come with the bhikkhunis. The Buddha desired to lower her pride in her beauty by
    showing the bad effect of it. By his miraculous power the Buddha created a most beautiful
    girl who was engaged in fanning the Buddha. Nanda seeing her beauty found out that her own
    beauty was much inferior. The girl was seen gradually attaining youth, the state of a
    mother of a child and then old age and disease and death. Nanda, seeing this, gave up her
    pride in her beauty and came to realize the impermanence of beauty. The Buddha, knowing
    the state of her mind, delivered a suitable sermon and she became an arhat after hearing
    it. (D.C., 111, pp. 113 f.)&nbsp;</font></p>
