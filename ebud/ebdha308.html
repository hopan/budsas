      is reported in the Pali Commentaries that the Pali Tipitaka which was 
      rehearsed in the First Council as well as in the subsequent Councils was 
      brought to Sri Lanka by the Arahant Mahinda.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">1)</FONT> 
      The Vinaya, Sutta and Abhidhamma are the three Pitakas. The Vinaya Pitaka 
      consists of the Parajikapali, Pacittiyapali, Mahavaggapali, Culavaggapali 
      and Parivarapali. The Sutta Pitaka contains the following five Nikayas: 
      Digha, Majjhima, Samyutta, Anguttara and Khuddaka while the Khuddaka 
      Nikaya includes the following texts as its contents: Khuddakapatha, 
      Dhammapada, Udana, Itivuttaka, Sutta Nipata, Vimanavatthu, Petavatthu, 
      Theragatha, Therigatha. Jataka, Niddesa, Patisambhidamagga, Apadana, 
      Buddhavamsa and Cariyapitaka. The Abhidhammapitaka comprises seven texts 
      such as Dhammasangani, Vibhanga, Dhatukatha, Puggalapannatti, Kathavatthu, 
      Yamaka and Patthana. It is believed that these thirty one texts which are 
      considered the Tripitaka, exist even today, as they were brought to Sri 
      Lanka by the Arahant Mahinda in the third century B.C.. However, the 
      reality goes against this general belief. The Pali Tripitaka seems to have 
      undergone various changes in Sri Lanka due to interpolations and editions. 
      The aim of this paper is to pay attention to such changes which occurred 
      in Sri Lanka</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">According to the Sri 
      Lankan tradition, the Vibhanga section of the Vinaya Pitaka consists of 
      the Parajikapali and the Pacittiyapali. However, two Vibhangas are not 
      reckoned anywhere as the Parajikapali and the Pacittiyapali in the Pali 
      Commentarial literature. When the Samantapasadika, Sumangalavilasini and 
      the Atthasalini are examined, it can be observed that the terms 
      Mahavibhanga - Bhikkhunivibhanga, Bhikkhu - Bhikkhunivibhanga or 
      dvevibhanga are used for the purpose of indicating the Vibhanga section of 
      the Vinaya Pitaka.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">2)</FONT> The structural change 
      the took place in Sri Lanka with regard to the Vinaya Pitaka on accepting 
      the Parajikapali and the Pacittiyapali as the Vibhangas is not as minor as 
      it seems. What the Arahant Mahinda brought to Sri Lanka is the Maha/ 
      Bhikkhuvibhanga and Bhikkhunivibhanga. Their nature is explicitly given in 
      the Nidanakatha of the Sumangalavilasini.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">3)</FONT> 
      The Maha/ Bhikkhuvibhanga was compiled by collecting together the precepts 
      in their entirety with seven adhikaranasamathas enacted for the monks. 
      Subsequently, the Bhikkhunivibhanga was rehearsed as a collection of all 
      precepts with the adhikaranasamathas prescribed for the nuns. The accounts 
      of the First Council found in the Samantapasadika, Sumangalavilasini and 
      the Atthasalini make it very clear that two separate texts by the names of 
      Bhikkhuvibhanga and Bhikkhunivibhanga were prepared in the First Council. 
      These two texts were rehearsed in the subsequent Councils too. Contrary to 
      the truth, these two texts are considered identical with the Parajikapali 
      and the Pacittiyapali. The following observation shows that this popular 
      belief is quite far from the truth.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Parajikapali as it 
      exists today, contains the Bhikkhu-precepts belonging to the categories of 
      Parajika, Aniyata, Sanghadisesa and Nissaggiyapacittiya and their 
      expositions. The Pacittiyapali comprises not only the remaining 
      Bhikkhu-precepts belonging to the categories of Pacittiya, Patidesaniya, 
      Sekhiya and Adhikaranasamatha and their expositions but also the 
      Bhikkuni-precepts in toto and their expositions too. The Parajikapali and 
      the Pacittiyapali which are substantially different from the 
      Bhikkhuvibhanga and Bhikkhunivibhanga compiled in the First Council as two 
      collections of precepts pertaining to monks and nuns respectively came 
      into existence in Sri Lanka. The causes that led to this change and the 
      exact period when it took place cannot be ascertained. However, some 
      problems that had arisen due to this should be mentioned here.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The decision arrived at in 
      the First Council to name the text that contained the Bhikkhu-precepts as 
      the Bhikkhuvibhanga and the text that contained the Bhikkhuni-precepts as 
      the Bhikkhunivibhanga is quite justifiable. However, the designations of 
      Parajikapali and Pacittiyapali which came into existence in Sri Lanka in 
      place of Bhikkhuvibhanga and Bhikkhunivibhanga do not seem to be either 
      suitable or meaningful. The Parajikapali and the Pacittiyapali would have 
      been named thus since the Parajikas are treated first in the Parajikapali 
      and the Pacittiyas are treated first in the Pacittiyapali. It should 
      however be mentioned here that the Parajikas promulgated for Bhikkhunis 
      are found in the Pacittiyapali and certain Pacittiyas promulgated for 
      Bhikkhus are found in the Parajikapali. This shows that a categorical 
      division of precepts arranged according to a set pattern is not found in 
      the Parajikapali and Pacittiyapali. It is quite obvious that the precepts 
      for Bhikkhunis are absolutely ignored in proposing the designations of 
      Parajikapali and Pacittiyapali. On the other hand, the balance maintained 
      in the Bhikkhuvibhanga and Bhikkhunivibhanga is pathetically lost in the 
      Parajikapali and the Pacittiyapali. Only the meagre number of forty-nine 
      precepts are treated in the Parajikapali, while the rest, four hundred and 
      eighty nine in number, are treated in the Pacittiyapali. Another salient 
      point pertaining to the Pacittiyapali is that does not treat the 
      Bhikkhuni-precepts with same enthusiasm shown towards the 
      Bhikkhu-precepts. The redactors of the Pacittiyapali have sometimes 
      ignored certain Bhikkhuni-precepts by not providing relevant details. In 
      addition, various portions of the Bhikkhunivibhanga are deliberately 
      omitted in the process of inserting the contents of it into the 
      Pacittiyapali. The conclusion that can be arrived at accordingly, is that 
      Bhikkhu-vibhanga in its entirety and the Bhikkhunivibhanga partially have 
      remained in the Parajikapali and Pacittiyapali.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">4)</FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Sarvastivadi, 
      Dharmagupta, Mahisasaka and Mahasanghika schools of Indian Buddhism have 
      designated their Vibhanga sections of the Vinaya Pitaka by the names of 
      Bhiksuvibhanga and Bhikksunivibhanga. The Mulasarvastivada and Kasyapiya 
      schools have utilized the terms Bhiksupratimoksa and Bhiksunipratimoksa 
      instead.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">5)</FONT> This shows that the terms 
      Parajikapali and Pacittiyapali were first introduced by the Sri Lankans, 
      even though they were commonly used later in the Theravada tradition. The 
      maltreatment of Bhikkhuvibhanga in the Pacittiyapali shows that the terms 
      Parajikapali and Pacittiyapali gain sway in an era in which the Bhikkhuni 
      Order was disappearing.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If the Parajikapali and 
      the Pacittiyapali are accepted as the Vibhanga section of the Pali Vinaya 
      Pitaka, the inevitable conclusion that should be arrived at is that the 
      Pali Vinaya Pitaka is not a collection of all Bhikkhuni-precepts. The 
      reason for this conclusion is the non-inclusion of the Bhikkhunivibhanga 
      in its entirety into the Pacittiyapali. Only one hundred and twenty eight 
      Bhikkhuni precepts are treated in the Pacittiyapali with their relevant 
      details such as vatthu and nidana out of three hundred and eleven rules 
      counted with the Adhikaranasamathas. If the Sri Lankan tradition that the 
      Vibhanga section of the Vinaya Pitaka is nothing but the Parajikapali and 
      the Pacittiyapali is accepted, one hundred and eighty three 
      Bhikkhuni-precepts lose their Canonical authority. The commentators 
      rightly understood this problem. To solve it meaningfully, they came 
      forward with a new definition of the Vinaya Pitaka, which states that the 
      Vinaya Pitaka comprises not only two Vibhangas but also the two 
      Pratimoksas.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">6)</FONT> The attempt to introduce two 
      Pratimoksas in addition to two Vibhangas can be seen in this definition. 
      Such an attempt was quite necessary to confer the Canonical authority on 
      the Bhikkhuni-precepts that were excluded by accepting the Parajikapali 
      and the Pacittiyapali in place of the Bhikkhuvibhanga and the 
      Bhikkhunivibhanga. The compilation of the Kankhavitarani, in addition to 
      the Samantapasadika written on the entire Vinaya Pitaka, was also an 
      attempt to establish the authority and authenticity of the two Pratimoksas 
      without which the Pali Vinaya Pitaka is not complete.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Accordingly, a situation 
      which compelled the compulsory inclusion of the two Pratimoksas into the 
      Vinaya Pitaka arose in Sri Lanka. Such a necessity was not there when the 
      Bhikkuvibhanga and the Bhikkhunivibhanga were included in the Vinaya 
      Pitaka. The acceptance of the Parajikapali and the Pacittiyapali instead 
      of the Bhikkhuvibhanga and the Bhikkhunivibhanga gave rise to the Sri 
      Lankan tendency that the Vinaya Pitaka comprises seven texts. This goes 
      against the generally accepted number of the texts of the Vinaya Pitaka as 
      decided by the Indian schools of Buddhism.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Parivara is another 
      text of the Vinaya Pitaka which underwent a drastic change in Sri Lanka. 
      There is no doubt that the Vinaya Pitaka which was brought to Sri Lanka by 
      the Arahant Mahinda had a Parivara, an addendum, in it. Various studies 
      have already been done on the Vinaya Pitaka belonging to several Indian 
      schools of Buddhism. These studies have shown that almost all Indian 
      schools of Buddhism, except Mahasanghikas and Mahisasakas, had a Parivara 
      in their Canonical Vinaya. The Sarvastivadins had several Parivaras in 
      their Vinaya Pitaka while the Dharmaguptilas had two.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">7)
      </FONT>The Dipavamsa reports that the Mahasanghikas rejected the 
      traditional Parivara and substituted it with another.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">8)</FONT> 
      It shows that the Parivara was known at the time of the emergence of the 
      Mahasanghika school. The Apadana has recognized the sub-sections of the 
      Vinaya Pitaka by the names of Vinaya, Khandhaka, Tikaccheda and Pancama.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">9)</FONT> 
      The term Pancama in this context indicates nothing but the Parivara 
      according to the Apadanatthakatha.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">10)</FONT> Even 
      though the Apadana developed through centuries, the Canonical dignity was 
      conferred on it before Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka. All these 
      point to the fact that there was a text called Parivara in the Tripitaka 
      which was brought to Sri Lanka in the third century B.C.. The 
      Sumangalavilasini informs us that the Parivara in the size of twenty five 
      bhanavaras was rehearsed in the First Council.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">11)</FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However, there is evidence 
      to prove that present Parivara and the Parivara which was brought to Sri 
      Lanka by the Arahant Mahinda are not identical. A definite criterion to 
      identify the original Parivara is suggested in the definition of the 
      Vinaya Pitaka found in the Samantapasadika. Accordingly, the original 
      Parivara is reckoned as so asaparivara. The so asaparivara does not 
      embrace the entire Parivara now existing, but is confined to a segment of 
      it. There are two sixteenfold Parivaras as So asaparivara in the 
      Bhikkhuvibhanga and So asaparivara in the Bhikkhunivibhanga in the present 
      Parivara. The redactors of the Councils were careful enough to insert the 
      statements &quot;<I>mahavibhange so asaparivara nitthita</I>&quot; &quot;<I>bhikkhunivibhange 
      so asaparivara nitthita</I>&quot; at the end of the first and the second 
      Vibhangas in the Parivara.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">12)</FONT> It is 
      legitimate, therefore, to think that the original Parivara comprised only 
      the first two chapters of the present Parivara. The remaining portions of 
      the present Parivara can be considered as being interpolated into it at a 
      later stage. The nature of the first two chapters of the Parivara is quite 
      different from that of the rest. Since the first two chapters discuss the 
      matters pertaining to the Vibhangas of the Vinaya Pitaka, it is legitimate 
      to think that the remaining chapters are on the problems arising form the 
      Khandbakas. However, the remaining chapters have gone beyond the subject 
      matter of the Khandhakas. What can be found in a careful scrutiny is that 
      the present Parivara is an amalgamation of two distinctive parts. The 
      first part, which is the original Parivara, comprises only the first two 
      chapters of the text and the second part the rest. The two salient 
      characteristics of the second part are the abundance of small chapters and 
      the stanzas. The second part is not a precise and methodical essay as the 
      first part is. It is therefore obvious that the first two chapters of the 
      present Parivara and the rest were composed at two different times. The 
      Indian origin of the first part which covers only the first two chapters 
      is quite obvious. It is what was brought to Sri Lanka by the Arahant 
      Mahinda. The second part which covers the remaining chapters, seems to 
      have been added in Sri Lanka as an appendix to the original Parivara.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The supplementary evidence 
      that can be adduced to prove the fact that the Parivara underwent a 
      tremendous change in Sri Lanka, should be briefly mentioned here. At the 
      end of the text, it is observed that the Parivara was caused to be 
      compiled by a Bhikkhu named Dipa for the benefit of the learners.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">13)</FONT> 
      The colophon further states that the methodology of the ancient teachers 
      was inserted freely and the text was abridged in doing so. It is therefore 
      legitimate to think that the role played by the Venerable Dipa was not 
      confined to wanting down of the Parivara which was orally transmitted till 
      then. The opportunity that the Venerable Dipa had to abridge the text, 
      would have been enjoyed by another to expand the text. The Parivara 
      mentions the names of the participants of the Third Council held in the 
      reign of king Dharmasoka.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">14)&nbsp;</FONT> The Parivara 
      reveals the succession of teachers who orally handed down the Vinaya 
      Pitaka.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">15)</FONT> It is important to note here that 
      some of those teachers flourished during the reign of king 
      Vattagamaniabhaya.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">16)</FONT> The Parivara informs us 
      of Sri Lankan Bhikkhu named Puppha who reestablished the Buddhasasana in 
      India after Buddhism disappeared from its soil.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">17)</FONT> 
      Vamsatthappakasini, the sub-commentary on the Mahavamsa, records that the 
      controversies with regard to the Parivara paved the way for schism in Sri 
      Lankan Buddhism.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">18)</FONT> The Parivara is the only 
      Canonical work where Sri Lanka is mentioned by the name of Tambapanni.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">19)</FONT> 
      According to the available evidence, Sri Lanka was not known among those 
      who formulated the Pali Canon. On the other hand, the Parivara is the only 
      Canonical work where the Arahant Mahinda&#39;s arrival in Sri Lanka is 
      mentioned. The Parivara specifically states that the Arahant Mahinda came 
      &quot;here&quot; from India.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">20)</FONT> The word &quot;here&quot; in the 
      relevant statement indicates Sri Lanka without any doubt. Such an 
      information can be available only in a text which underwent a marked 
      change in Sri Lanka. On the data scattered throughout, the Parivara can be 
      identified as a text where the stanzas, sermons and dialogues, composed, 
      preached and compiled by the Sri Lankan monks are heavily collected.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As mentioned before, the 
      Venerable Dipa was instrumental in preserving the Parivara for the benefit 
      of learners. As the statement &quot;<I>likhapesi sissakanam sukhavaham</I>&quot; 
      points out, the Parivara was meant to be a text book to he studied by 
      those who had an interest in the matters concerning discipline. It is the 
      therefore justifiable to conclude that the present Parivara is a revision 
      and expansion of the original Parivara which was brought to Sri Lanka by 
      the Arahant Mahinda. In this revision and expansion where the interests of 
      the learners were looked into, the Parivara was transformed into a text 
      book prepared on the curriculum of the Mahavihara at Anuradhapura.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">21)</FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The first four Nikayas of 
      the Sutta Pitaka in the Pali Canon too underwent certain changes in Sri 
      Lanka. The first glimpse of this kind can be seen in the Mahaparinibbana 
      Sutta of the Digha Nikaya. It is well known that the Mahaparinibbana Sutta 
      grew for centuries collecting material from various sources. Its Indian 
      development culminated with the interpolations added in the Third Council 
      held in the reign of king Dharmasoka. Sumangalavilasini, the commentary on 
      the Digha Nikaya, explicitly states that the sections on the distribution 
      of relics and erection of ten stupas were added to the Sutta in the Third 
      Council.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">22)</FONT> The Digha Nikaya with the 
      Mahaparinibbana Sutta thus developed in India was brought to Sri Lanka by 
      the Arahant Mahinda. When the Sumangalavilasini is carefully examined, it 
      is evident that the Mahaparinibbana Sutta further developed in Sri Lanka.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Mahaparinibbana Sutta, 
      with six bhanavaras, is supposed to be the longest discourse found in the 
      entire Pali Canon. The sexth bhanavara of the Sutta comprises the last 
      statement of the Buddha, Buddha&#39;s great demise, arrival of the Arahant 
      Kasyapa, distribution of relics and the worship of the relic stupas. The 
      discourse ends with five stanzas appended to the sixth bhanavara.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">23)</FONT> 
      With regard to these stanzas, the Sumangalavilasini points out that they 
      were added to the discourse by the Sri Lankan monks.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">24)</FONT> 
      It should be remembered here that the stanzas identical with these five 
      are found in the Buddhavamsa of the Khuddaka Nikaya too.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">25)</FONT> 
      It is therefore reasonable to think that the Buddhavamsa was also enriched 
      with these stanzas by the Sri Lankan monks.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is an explicit 
      example of Sri Lankan interpretations in the Pali Canon. What is important 
      here is that the commentators themselves attribute the authorship of these 
      stanzas to the Sri Lankan monks. It further implies that, though they are 
      not definitely identified, there may be more Sri Lankan interpolations of 
      this nature in the Pali Canon.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It should be emphasized 
      here that the five stanzas added to the Mahaparinibbana Sutta by the Sri 
      Lankan monks laid the foundation for various tendencies which emerged 
      latter in the Sri Lankan culture. The stories of relics found in the Pali 
      commentaries, Sinhala classics on Buddhism and legends were influenced by 
      these stanzas. There is no evidence to prove the worship of Tooth Relics 
      was known in India before Buddhism was brought to Sri Lanka. The present 
      day dominance of the worship of Tooth Relic seems to have been a Sri 
      Lankan innovation. The five stanzas added to the Mahaparinibbana Sutta and 
      the Buddhavamsa seem to have inspired the Sri Lankan writers who filled 
      the gaps of the history of the tooth Relic which was brought here in the 
      reign of king Kittisirimegha.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The fact that there are 
      four stanzas authored by the Sri Lankan monks in the Sammaditthi Sutta of 
      the Majjhima Nikaya is extremely important to the subject matter of this 
      paper. The undivided honour of this discovery should go to the Venerable 
      Yakkaduwe Sri Pragnarama, the late principal of the Vidyalankara Pirivena 
      in Sri Lanka.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">26)&nbsp;</FONT> As observed by the 
      Venerable Pragnarama, the four stanzas were added to highlight topics 
      discussed in the discourse. Since three of the four stanzas are cryptic, 
      some editors of the Majjhima Nikaya were anxious enough to expunge them 
      from the Sammaditthi Sutta. These four stanzas seem to be ambiguous and 
      meaningless only if they are considered as Pali compositions. As pointed 
      out by the Venerable Pragnarama, they are composed in Sinhala Prakrit. He 
      was led to this remarkable discovery by the word &quot;<I>vadanake</I>&quot; found 
      in each of the four stanzas. The Venerable Pragnarama has made it clear 
      that these four stanzas can be easily comprehended with help of Asokan 
      Prakrit, language employed in the early Sinhala inscriptions and the 
      quotations taken to the Dhampiya Atuwa Gatapadaya from Sinhala 
      Commentaries. As observed further by the Venerable Pragnarama, it cannot 
      be concluded that the additions were not made to the Pali Tripitaka in Sri 
      Lanka. It is well known that there are additions done in Sri Lanka in the 
      Pali Commentaries, since they are full of events and information of Sri 
      Lankan origin. In the same way, the Canonical works have evidence to prove 
      that the Sri Lankan monks prepared the lists of contents to the discourses 
      of extreme importance and inserted them at the proper places. The purpose 
      of this endeavour was not only refreshing their memories but also helping 
      the learners.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">27)</FONT> The Venerable Pragnarama has 
      adduced the four stanzas found in the Sammaditthi Sutta to substantiate 
      this assumption.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As pointed out by the 
      Venerable Pragnarama further, there are eight Sinhala sentences in the 
      Mulapariyaya Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya. The services rendered by the 
      Venerable Pragnarama to the Sinhala language by editing and interpreting 
      these sentences, which were deleted and wrongly quoted by some editors of 
      the Majjhima Nikaya should be greatly appreciated. According to the 
      Venerable Pragnarama, one finds it easy to understand how the Arahant 
      Mahinda preached the Dhamma and communicated with the Sinhala people as 
      soon as he arrived in Sri Lanka, when one examines these Sinhala 
      sentences. It is also easy to solve the problems pertaining to the nature 
      of early Sri Lankan language and its affinities to the other languages. 
      Venerable Pragnarama emphasizes the fact that the Aryan origin of Sinhala 
      language can be proved beyond doubt on the basis of the eight sentences 
      enshrined in the Mulapariyaya Sutta.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">28)</FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is no direct 
      evidence of Sri Lankan interpolations either in the Samyutta Nikaya or in 
      the Anguttara Nikaya. However, our attention should be paid here to two 
      commentarial remarks regarding their extent. According to these remarks, 
      the Samyutta Nikaya comprises seven thousand seven hundred and sixty two 
      discourses while the Anguttara Nikaya is a collection of nine thousand 
      nine hundred fifty seven discourses.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">29)</FONT> The 
      numbers of the discourses in the present Samyutta Nikaya and the Anguttara 
      Nikaya differ from the above numbers. As pointed out by the Venerable 
      Polwatte Buddhadatta, the number of the discourses in the present Samyutta 
      Nikaya, counted with repetitions, is nine thousand seven hundred and 
      twenty six. This exceeds the commentarial number by one thousand nine 
      hundred and sixty four. The Venerable Buddhadatta is of the opinion that 
      the number of the discourses of the present Samyutta Nikaya can be reduced 
      to six thousand one hundred and forty six if the repetitions are not 
      counted separately. This shows a reduction of one thousand six hundred and 
      ten discourses from the commentarial number. According to the Venerable 
      Buddhadatta&#39;s computation, the present Anguttara Nikaya consists of seven 
      thousand seven hundred and ninety one discourses.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">30)</FONT> 
      The reduction of the number of discourses in the present Anguttara Nikaya 
      is then one thousand seven hundred and sixty six when compared to the 
      commentarial number. According to the PTS editions, the numbers of the 
      discourses of these two Nikayas are lesser than the numbers given by the 
      Venerable Buddhadatta. Compared with the commentarial numbers of the 
      discourses, it is obvious that the present Samyutta and Anguttara Nikayas 
      are quite abridged.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As we know, the Venerable 
      Buddhaghosa wrote two commentaries on the Samyutta and Anguttara Nikayas 
      under the names of Saratthappakasini and Manorathapurani respectively. 
      When these two commentaries are examined, the obvious conclusion that can 
      be arrived at, is that the present Samyutta and Anguttara Nikayas are 
      identical with those that the Venerable Buddhaghosa had before him. What 
      can then be said about the Samyutta with 7762 discourses and the Anguttara 
      with 9957 discourses? Did the Venerable Mahinda bring to Sri Lanka the 
      extended versions or the abridged versions of the Samyutta and Anguttara? 
      Or else, are the present Samyutta and Anguttara Nikayas the revised 
      editions of the extended versions brought to Sri Lanka by the Arahant 
      Mahinda? There is yet another point that should be considered here: the 
      similarity that exists between the first two Nikayas and the corresponding 
      gamas whethers away among the remaining Nikayas and the gamas. In other 
      words, Samyutta and Anguttara Nikayas are quite different from the 
      corresponding gamas of Samyutta and Ekottara. This dissimilarity points to 
      the fact that these Nikayas and gamas underwent drastic changes in their 
      own traditions. What was preserved and established in the Theravada School 
      of Buddhism in Sri Lanka was the Pali Canon which was brought here by the 
      Arahant Mahinda. It is therefore resonable to ask the question whether the 
      Samyutta and Anguttara Nikayas were revised and edited in Sri Lanka to 
      minimize the repetitions the originals had.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is the Khuddaka Nikaya that undergone a 
      qualitative and a quantitative difference in Sri Lanka. The Khuddaka 
      Nikaya developed in India for centuries before Buddhism was introduced to 
      Sri Lanka. The developments that took place in Sri Lanka in the Khuddaka 
      Nikaya should not therefore be considered unnatural and alien.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Even though it is well 
      known that the Khuddaka Nikaya is fifteenfold,<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">31)</FONT> 
      it is unknown that this is a Sri Lankan concept. There is no evidence to 
      prove that none of the Indian Schools of Buddhism which emerged before or 
      after Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka accepted that the Khuddaka 
      Nikaya is fifteenfold. In fact, there was no definite decision of the 
      number of the Ksudrakagama in any of the Indian Schools of Buddhism. Even 
      the Bhanaka traditions which emerged and developed in India and later came 
      to Sri Lanka had not taken a decision in this regard. The idea that the 
      Khuddaka Nikaya is fifteenfold was first expressed in the commentaries 
      attributed to the Venerable Buddhaghosa. It can safely be concluded that 
      the Khuddaka Nikaya comprises fifteen texts is a concept well established 
      in the Mahavihara tradition.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With the establishment of 
      the concept that the Khuddaka Nikaya is fifteenfold in the Mahavihara 
      tradition, a new text not known to the Indian Buddhists was introduced to 
      the Khuddaka Nikaya in Sri Lanka. That is the Khuddakapatha. What was 
      expected by the statement that the Khuddaka Nikaya is fifteenfold is to 
      justify the inclusion of the Khuddakapatha in the Khuddaka Nikaya and to 
      put an end to its future developments. Whether these expectations were 
      fulfilled in the history should be separately examined. What is to be 
      noted here is that the Mahavihara tradition of Sri Lanka seems to have had 
      the opinion that the non-commitment of the Indian Schools of Buddhism as 
      to the definite number of the texts of the Khuddaka Nikaya had paved the 
      way for the contamination of the Buddha&#39;s word.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When the sources in which 
      the list of the Khuddaka texts is found are examined, it is quite obvious 
      that it is only the Venerable Buddhaghosa who translated the Sinhala 
      commentaries, following the Mahavihara tradition that includes the 
      Khuddakapatha in the Khuddaka Nikaya. The Khuddakapatha is not mentioned 
      either in the list of the Digha-bhanakas or in the list of the 
      Majjhima-bhanakas as revealed in the Sumangalavilasini. The Indian 
      Buddhists did not have any knowledge of a text called Khuddakapatha, 
      according to the information available with regard to the Khuddaka texts 
      accepted by the Indian Schools of Buddhism. The Samantapasadika of 
      Buddhaghosa was translated into Chinese within the first century of its 
      compilation. This Chinese translation had taken all precautionary measures 
      not to mention the name of the Khuddakapatha. This shows that only the Sri 
      Lankan tradition had accepted the Khuddakapatha as a canonical text. The 
      authority of the Khuddakapatha has been questioned even by the ancient Sri 
      Lankan teachers. The Palimahabodhivamsa, written five centuries after 
      Buddhaghosa, the Saddharmaratnakaraya and the Sinhala translation of the 
      Milindapanha, written ten centuries after Buddhaghosa, have deliberately 
      dropped the Khuddakapatha from the list of the Khuddaka texts. No other 
      Khuddaka text has undergone this treatment.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The request extended to 
      the Venerable Buddhaghosa to write a commentary on the Khuddakapatha was 
      yet another Sri Lankan attempt to insert the Khuddakapatha into the 
      Khuddaka Nikaya. The selection of the Khuddakapatha by Buddhaghosa over 
      various other authentic texts was justified by placing the Khuddakapatha 
      as the first among the Khuddaka texts. The Paramatthajotika is the 
      commentary written by Buddhaghosa on the Khuddakapatha. Buddhaghosa wrote 
      a commentary on the Sutta Nipata too by the same name. According to the 
      commentarial order of the Khuddaka texts, which runs as Khuddakapatha, 
      Dhammapada, Udana, Itivuttaka, Sutta Nipata, etc., Buddhaghosa should have 
      selected the Udana after the Khuddakapatha, since he has written the 
      commentary on the Dhammapada. However, Buddhaghosa selected the Sutta 
      Nipata overstepping even the Itivuttaka and wrote a commentary on it by 
      the name of the Khuddakapatha commentary. The reason behind this attempt 
      should be the conferment of the authority and authenticity of the Sutta 
      Nipata on the Khuddakapatha. The introductory remarks of the Khuddakapatha 
      imply this further. According to Buddhaghosa, the Khuddakapatha is 
      absolutely complete. Buddhaghosa expresses how difficulty it is for a 
      person such as himself, not understanding the doctrine, to write a 
      commentary on the Khuddakapatha. However, Buddhaghosa states that he 
      summons up courage to attempt the task as the decisions of the ancient 
      teachers exist up to his day. When the nature of the Khuddakapatha is 
      considered, the above statements of Buddhaghosa would be meaningful only 
      when they are taken as an attempt to confer canonical dignity on the 
      Khuddakapatha. The contents of the Khuddakapatha, with the only exception 
      of the Nidhikhanda Sutta, are found elsewhere in the Pali Canon. 
      Therefore, the Indian Schools of Buddhism did not confront with the 
      problem of conferring Canonical authority on the Khuddakapatha.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The position assigned to 
      the Khuddakapatha in the Mahavihara curriculum would have prompted 
      Buddhaghosa to insert it in the Khuddaka Nikaya. The Nidhikhanda Sutta, 
      whose canonical authority would have otherwise been lost, would have 
      greatly contributed towards this attempt. Its suitability as a text book 
      meant for the novices, its conciseness and popularity as a prescribed text 
      would have been conducive to the inclusion of the Khuddakapatha in the 
      Pali Cannon in Sri Lanka.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">32)</FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Kokaliya Sutta of the 
      Sutta Nipata is an ideal example of the Sri Lankan interpolations in the 
      Pali Canon.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">33)</FONT> The Kokaliya Sutta, which is 
      an exposition of both prose and verse, is the tenth discourse of the 
      Mahavagga of the Sutta Nipata. The prose passages which constitute the 
      first part of the discourse comprises a dialogue between the Buddha and 
      the monk Kokaliya, the destiny of Kokaliya who did not pay heed to the 
      Buddha&#39;s admonitions, the message of Sahampati, the Brahma, conveyed to 
      the Buddha and the Buddha&#39;s account of hells given in connection with 
      Kokaliya&#39;s sorrowful birth. The actual discourse preached after these 
      preliminary remarks is given in verse. Therefore, the stanzas of this 
      sutta are more important than the prose passages. The present Kokaliya 
      Sutta consists of twenty two stanzas, however, the commentary on the Sutta 
      Nipata observes clearly that this is a discourse of twenty stanzas.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">34)</FONT> 
      To justify his statement that the Kokaliya Sutta, which in fact has twenty 
      two stanzas, consists only of twenty stanzas, the author of the 
      Commentary, the Venerable Buddhaghosa in this case, observes that the last 
      two stanzas are not available in the concluding expositions of the 
      Mahatthakatha. In other words, the Mahatthakatha, which was brought to Sri 
      Lanka and translated into Sinhala by the Arahant Mahinda, did not contain 
      the comments on the last two stanzas of the present Kokaliya Sutta. The 
      author of the Sutta Nipata commentary confirms the fact that these two 
      stanzas had become the integral part of the Kokaliya Sutta by the fifth 
      century A.D.. The meaning of all this is that the two stanzas were 
      interpolated to the Kokaliya Sutta after the Arahant Mahinda&#39;s and the 
      Venerable Buddhaghosa&#39;s commentarial pursuits. &quot;The fact recorded here is 
      significant because it points with more or less certainty to a specific 
      instance of an addition, however small, made to the Pali Canon a 
      considerable time after it was brought to Ceylon and probably after it was 
      committed to writing at Matula Janapada.&quot;<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">35)</FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Apadana of the 
      Khuddaka Nikaya too has evidence to prove that it was edited several 
      times. The Apadana is a poetical composition divided mainly into two parts 
      as Therapadana and Theriapadana. The PTS edition of the text contain 547 
      stories of Theras categories in 55 Vaggas, However, a statement found in 
      the text itself indicates that there are 550 stories of Theras.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">36)</FONT> 
      Accordingly, the PTS editions has lost three stories. Even though there 
      should be ten stories in the thirty-fourth Vagga, in actual fact, there 
      are only seven stories. Non inclusion of these stories in the PTS edition 
      seems to be a result of an inadvertence. The Sinhala edition of the 
      Apadana prepared and published by the Venerable Polwatte Buddhadatta has 
      552 stories of Theras belonging to 50 Vaggas. This exceeds the number of 
      stories given in the text itself by two. The commentary on the Apadana has 
      made this position more confused and perplexed. According to the 
      introductory remarks of the Apadanatthakatha, there are 510 stories of 
      Theras divided into 51 Vaggas.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">37)</FONT> However,

      Theras in the Apadana.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">38)</FONT> The last ten 
      stories, on which the comments are found in the Apadanatthakatha, are not 
      available in any printed edition of the Apadana. The Buddhadatta edition 
      and the commentarial expositions obviously manifest that the omission of 
      the three stories in the PTS edition, is an editor&#39;s error. It is however 
      not clear why the stories, ten in number, on which the expositions are 
      found in the Commentary are missing in the printed editions. The following 
      hypothesis can be suggested in this regard.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Though the Apadana which 
      was brought to Sri Lanka by the Arahant Mahinda consisted only of 550 
      stories of Theras, certain stories were added to it in Sri Lanka. The 
      commentary was written not on the original version but on the extended Sri 
      Lankan version. It was, however, later decided to accept the original 
      version uncontaminated with later interpolations. The differences that 
      have arisen between the present Apadana and its commentary might be due to 
      this reason. The lateness and non authenticity of the 
      Visuddhajanavilasini, the Apadana commentary, justify this assumption.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Apadana has forty 
      stories of Theris, the number of which is not controversial.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">39)</FONT> 
      A commentary was never written on these stories. It is therefore 
      unreasonable to think on this ground that the stories of Theris were added 
      to the Apadana only after the Visuddhajanavilasini was written. As the 
      remarks given at the very outset introducing the numbers of Theras and 
      Theris indicate, the author of the Apadana commentary was well aware of 
      the forty stories pertaining to the Theris. However, there is no way of 
      deciding whether the author of the commentary did not have the opportunity 
      to write a commentary on the stories of Theris or whether he left it to 
      another scholar. The stories of Theris have not yet been commented upon.</FONT></P>

      is very difficult to restore the original Buddhavamsa. The details 
      pertaining to this have been unearthed by Adikaram sometime back.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">40)</FONT> 
      There are differences between the present Buddhavamsa and its Commentary 
      to the extent that the Commentary seems to have been written on some other 
      text. There is a large number of stanzas in the Buddhavamsa whose 
      existence was unknown to the author of the Commentary, while the 
      Commentary contains a huge number of stanza not found in the present 
      Buddhavamsa. &quot;These differences are so great that we may rightly infer 
      that the Text which the Commentator had before him was different from the 
      one we have today, and that the original Text received in Ceylon many 
      additional verses after the Pali Commentary was written&quot;. The Jatakanidana 
      quotes two chapters from the Buddhavamsa. They are identical not with the 
      relevant chapters of the present Buddhavamsa but with the Commentarial 
      versions. It also shows that the present Buddhavamsa is quite different 
      from the Buddhavamsa which is referred to in the Pali Commentaries.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddhapakinnakakhanda 
      and the Dhatubhajaniya, the last two chapters of the Buddhavamsa, are not 
      commented on in the Buddhavamsa Atthakatha. A statement found at the end 
      of the Commentary indicates that the first of these two was known to the 
      Commentator.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">41)</FONT> However, the statement 
      further shows that the chapter known to the Commentator had only eighteen 
      stanzas. Since there are twenty stanzas in the present 
      Buddhapakinnakakhanda, it can be easily concluded that last two stanzas 
      were added to it later. The Commentator had no knowledge whatsoever of the 
      Dhatubhajaniya, the last chapter of the present Buddhavamsa. This shows 
      its non existence in the pre-commentarial era. It should be remembered 
      here that the Dhatubhajaniya consists of stanzas identical with the

      Puggalapannatti, Yamaka and Patthana as they were brought to Sri Lanka by 
      the Arahant Mahinda. There is no concrete evidence of Sri Lankan 
      interpolations even in the Kathavatthu. However, the inference that the 
      Kathavatthu underwent editorial changes in Sri Lanka cannot be ruled out 
      when the problems pertaining to the Kathavatthu at times in the history 
      are closely scrutinized.</FONT></P>

      Kathavatthu is a collection of thousand discourses taken five hundred from 
      Sakavada and Paravada each.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">42)</FONT> It is, 
      however, counted that the number of points discussed and discarded in the 
      Text is two hundred and seventeen. This gives an indication of two 
      different versions of the Kathavatthu. Atthasalini, the Commentary on the 
      Dhammasangani, categorically states on three occasions that the 
      Kathavatthu is equivalent to the Digha Nikaya in size.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">43)</FONT> 
      Nonetheless, the present Kathavatthu and the Digha Nikaya are not 
      identical in size. The Digha Nikaya is in fact larger than the 
      Kathavatthu. According to the Commentary, the Digha Nikaya has sixty four 
      bhanavaras,<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">44)</FONT> while the Kathavatthu is a 
      text of thirty five bhanavaras in the light of a statement given at the 
      end of the text itself.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">45)</FONT> Accordingly, the 
      Kathavatthu is only about half the size of the Digha Nikaya. A Kathavatthu 
      version equivalent to the size of the Digha Nikaya is not available at 
      present.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A statement of extreme 
      significance found in the Atthasalini observes that there were various 
      versions of the Kathavatthu. It reiterates that the Digha Nikaya and the 
      Kathavatthu are identical in size when what was rehearsed (in the Third 
      Council), not what is written now in books, is considered.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">46)</FONT> 
      Firstly, this statement indicates the multiplicity of the Kathavatthu 
      versions. Secondly, it indicates that some versions of the Kathavatthu 
      were more comprehensive than the others. The criteria suggested by the 
      Commentary to identify the original Kathavatthu were its size and the 
      nature of its contents. The original size according to the Commentator was 
      that of the Digha Nikaya, while the contents contained thousand 
      discourses. The word &quot;<I>idani</I> (now) found in the statement &quot;<I>idani 
      potthake likhitam agahetva sangitiaropitanayena</I>&quot; emphasizes that the 
      criteria suggested in the Commentary dealt with the situation prevalent in 
      Sri Lanka when the Atthasalini was compiled. How far the extent to which 
      this Sri Lankan effort to identify the original Kathavatthu had been 
      successful cannot be now decided. If the present Kathavatthu was selected 
      as the original one on the above criteria, what should be mentioned here 
      is that it does not conform them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">According to the foregoing 
      analysis, it is quite obvious that there had been a noteworthy Sri Lankan 
      contribution not only to preserve but also to foster the Pali Canon. After 
      the Venerable Mahinda&#39;s arrival, Sri Lanka became the centre of the 
      Theravada School of Buddhism. The Sri Lankan teachers perpetuated the Pali 
      Canon by word of mouth for three centuries. Sri Lanka undertook the 
      responsibility of preserving it even after the writing down. The 
      translation of the Pali Commentaries to Sinhala first and the subsequent 
      Pali translation of the Sinhala Commentaries after eight centuries were 
      also carried out in Sri Lanka under the supervision of the Theras at 
      Mahavihara in Anuradhapura. In these circumstances, it was quite natural 
      that the Pali Tripitaka underwent certain changes and editions, as an 
      integral part of the activities carried out by the Sri Lankan teachers to 
      preserve it. It is not surprising that a religious literature undergoes 
      certain changes in the course of its history. What is surprising is that 
      the Pali Canon, which is so extensive in size and subject matter, has been 
      preserved as it exists today without much dilution and contamination. The 
      credit of this should definitely go to Sri Lanka. [The end]</FONT></P>

      Lanka by Mahinda. The careful scrutiny of the Chronicles and Commentaries 
      would reveal that it was the Arahant Mahinda who brought not only the 
      Commentaries but also the Pali Canon to Sri Lanka.<BR>
