    during a 9-day meditation retreat in 1997, Perth, Western Australia.</em></font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So this evening's talk will be a Dhamma talk rather than a
  question time because I missed giving the Dhamma talk this morning and one of the monks
  reminded me at tea time that this retreat has gone to Thursday now. So there's only
  actually a couple more dhamma talks left. So he said it's about time I got into the
  &quot;oomphy&quot; Dhamma talks and the &quot;oomphy&quot; Dhamma talk this evening is
  talking about <em><strong>anatta</strong></em>. I'm going to bring this one up right now
  because it's going to bring together a few threads about what I've been talking about so
  far. If the talk goes according to the direction I want it to go, I'm also going to bring
  in how we use the perspective of <em><strong>anatta</strong></em>, how to develop the
  deeper stages of meditation, and wherever you are in your meditation how this perspective,
  looking at things through the prism of <em><strong>anatta</strong></em> can help develop
  the meditation into more profound and deeper levels. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I did say in an earlier talk that it's through wisdom
  power that you get very deep in meditation not through mere willpower and a little bit of
  insight, a little bit of understanding. Seeing this process from a different perspective
  has enormous power to quieten the mind down, and so I wanted to especially emphasise this
  in the latter part of this talk how <em><strong>anatta</strong></em> can be used in this
  process of meditation. But first of all, just the meaning of <em><strong>anatta</strong></em>
  should be apprehended by us and it's one of those subjects, or <strong><i>the</i></strong>
  subject in Buddhism, which to many people is very hard to understand and to get your mind
  around, and that by itself is a good point for insight to arise. Why in many parts of
  Buddhism when we come to the teaching of <em><strong>anatta</strong></em> there's
  something inside us which rebels? That is the illusion of self getting uncomfortable. This
  is stirring up something which is very deeply rooted inside us and something which does
  not want to even contemplate <em><strong>anatta</strong></em>, non-self, and that is a
  symptom of the whole problem. The Buddha was very uncompromising when he taught <em><strong>anatta</strong></em>
  and it's one of the reasons why people find it a bit difficult because there's no way
  around. When you read the Buddha's teachings, there's no way around coming to the
  conclusion that there is no-one in here. There is no controller. There is no knower. There
  is no doer. There is no self, no soul, no being. And this uncompromising conclusion which
  you get from looking at the teachings causes you to actually investigate because so much
  other teachings of the Buddha seem to be so powerful, so deep, so true, so effective, and
  this one, seems to be the hard one. It<strong> <i>is</i></strong> the hard one because on
  the realisation of <em><strong>anatta</strong></em>, of uncovering the illusion of self
  that, the whole path towards enlightenment revolves. This is the insight, the discovery,
  the understanding which changes one from just being a person who wanders around the
  samsara, lifetime after lifetime, to one who is on the way out of the samsara, inevitably,
  certainly, surely bound for Nibbana. It's the crux, the fulcrum, of the whole practice.
  Why is it difficult to see? It's difficult to see because we don't want to see it, but at
  least we can get a handle on what the Buddha was talking about, because first of all that
  he asked you to not look at <em><strong>anatta</strong></em> from a philosophical point of
  view - which is one of the big mistakes as we intellectualise it -&nbsp; but to start
  looking at <em><strong>anatta</strong></em> from the practical point of view: how it
  affects our views, perceptions, thoughts, in particular, to look at what do we take to be
  a self, a soul, a me. And this is where we really get to grip with this teaching of <em><strong>anatta</strong></em>:
  how we use it. Instead of thinking &quot;is there a self?&quot; or &quot;who am I?&quot;,
  you say &quot;what do I perceive my self to be? What do I perceive is mine? What do I
  think is me? What do I think is mine? What do I know? What do I view as me? What do I view
  as mine?&quot;. And here the Buddha started taking apart this illusion bit by bit. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">First of all, you've got to identify what this illusion
  is. The illusion is all your perceptions which assume a self, all your thoughts which
  conclude there's a self, and all your views which think there's somebody there. What is
  all of this? This is what we call like the mirage. The simile of a mirage is powerful
  because you know with a mirage there is some aspect which is real there. A mirage is not
  pure imagination. In a mirage there is a real light arriving in your eyes. There is an
  image on the back of your eyes. The point is that the brain or the mind misinterprets what
  you're seeing and gives it an interpretation, gives it a label which it does not deserve.
  The mirage thinks there's a body of water there or rather the mind interprets the mirage
  to be a body of water on the road. But we all know it's just the light being reflected
  from the sky. This is a mirage of the self. Now in order to find out it's a mirage we've
  got to actually know what this is that we're misinterpreting, to know this experience we
  are taking to be a self . It's incredible sometimes that even the ordinary aspects of life
  which we should really know better are not ours, they're nothing to do with us, we take to
  be a self. Our body we take to be a self when we're concerned about it. A self has
  property. A self owns things. Any person in this world has their property, their
  possessions, their area of control because what you own you have rights over. People think
  that they have human rights over their body because they think it is their body. People
  think they have rights over their mind because they think it is their mind. They think
  they have rights over their thoughts. I can think what I like. Can you? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are things we possess. First of all, our body. Do
  you possess your body? Do you own it? Is it yours? The older you become the more you
  realise just how out of control this body is. If there is an owner to this body, it's
  nature, not you. It gets sick. It hurts. It gets old. It gets better again. And you have
  just a little influence over this, but not that much. However you can understand that
  whenever you assume this body to be you or yours, you suffer because as soon as you think
  that this body which a mosquito is biting belongs to you, you suffer. If you could just
  imagine this mosquito was biting not your body but say, this microphone in front of me,
  would you worry about it? Would you be concerned about it? You would not, because this
  microphone isn't yours. If you could actually perceive, even like through your
  imagination, that this arm or this leg which the mosquito was biting wasn't yours,
  suffering will disappear straight away. The concern would be gone. There would be a sense
  of peace. Whenever you regard something as not yours, the result is this thing we call <strong><em>&quot;letting
  go&quot;</em></strong>. What is the opposite of letting go? It is called owning. I won't
  call it controlling. I'll call it owning now because the owning always assumes an owner,
  and so we look at what we own and what we possess or rather what we <i><strong>think</strong>
  </i>we possess, and this is the way of accessing the teaching of <em><strong>anatta</strong></em>
  using the Buddha's teaching which I mentioned earlier. That if there's a self, a soul, a
  me, there'll be things which belong to me. If there's things which belong to me, if
  there's possession, there has to be an owner. These two go together. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So you look for the teaching of <em><strong>anatta</strong></em>,
  just what you think you own. What do you own in this world? Do you own your body? If you
  do, you suffer. If you think you own your body you'll be attached to it. If you think you
  own the body you will not be able to let it go. I've seen many people in that predicament,
  close to death in pain but not willing to let the body go. Sometimes it's very sad to see
  a person thrashing about in the last few moments of their life, struggling for the breath,
  struggling for a comfortable position, struggling to stop death happening. Even though
  they're in pain, they'd rather have that pain and discomfort than have death. Why is that?
  It's attachment to the body. Why are they attached to their body? It's because they think
  it's theirs. They can't let it go. It's like a child with a little teddy bear or a doll.
  Someone's trying to take it from you. &quot;No, leave it, it's mine. You can't have
  it&quot;. You won't let that teddy bear or little doll go. You can see that in a child,
  and you know that the child's being stupid. However, this little doll, this little teddy
  bear is also the body we carry around with us. When nature takes it back, do you scream?
  Do you cry &quot;No, no, no. I'm too young to die. I've got too many things to do. Not
  yet, tomorrow maybe, but not today, not now&quot;?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is what we're talking about with attachment and the
  cause of this is this mirage of self and soul. This mirage of ownership. You can actually
  see this happening in certain moments of your life, when the body is threatened by
  sickness, by disease, or even just simple pain, when there's a pain in the legs when
  you're meditating, What is the problem? What is the <strong><i>real</i></strong> problem?
  Is it the pain or is it because you think it's <strong><em>my</em></strong> pain? Why
  can't you let go of the pain? Why can't you just go to the breath and just stay with the
  breath? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you look closely you'll know you'll go to that which
  concerns you, which you think is your business, which you think is what you're supposed to
  be doing. You go to that which is your assumed responsibility, that which you own or think
  you own. You go to the pain in your legs because you think it's <strong><em>your</em></strong>
  legs. It's <strong><em>your</em></strong> pain. You have to do something about it. If you
  could realise at that point, or do a little imagining, not self: &quot;This is not mine.
  Nothing to do with me. This is not my concern. Let the body look after the pain. I can
  look after the breath or look after the <strong><em>nimitta</em></strong> or look after
  the mind.&quot; You could do it then. When you understand you don't own these things, only
  then can you let them go. Attachment is born by the illusion of ownership. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You try that the next time you have an irritation, a
  distraction, just to let go of the body, understanding you don't own this, it only belongs
  to nature. You'll find the disturbance of the pain will vanish and you'll be free to go
  back to the breath or the <em><strong>nimitta</strong></em> or into <em><strong>deep
  samadhi</strong></em>. You won't be concerned with the body because you're not regarding
  it as yours. This particular way of looking at the body becomes extremely important the
  deeper you go in meditation, because there comes a time and this is the time when the <strong><em>nimitta</em></strong>
  arises, when you are about to leave the body completely and with it you're leaving the
  five external senses. So many mediators experience fear at this point, because it's one of
  the <em><strong>upakkilesas</strong></em>, one of the great hindrances to attaining the<em><strong>
  jhanas</strong></em>. You can get to the <em><strong>nimitta</strong></em> but you can't
  go in. You can't absorb into it. There's something holding you back, some fear, some
  inability to let go and it's good to understand what you can't let go of and why. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is where the insight starts to uncover deep-seated
  attachments, deep-seated illusions which cause attachments. If you get to that point many
  times and investigate it, you will find that what you're afraid of letting go is this body
  and these instruments of the five senses which give us a sense of protection and security
  about the longevity and protection of the body. It's as if sight disappears, sound
  disappears, hearing disappears, smell, taste and especially physical feelings disappear,
  we're not quite sure what will happen to this body, as if all of the guards to the safety
  of this body go to sleep, as if we've got no guards on our house, no alarms, no
  protection, we're afraid that somebody might go in and steal something or destroy our
  whole house. We can't let go because we're worried about the safety of that which we left
  behind. We're worried about letting go of the body. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The only way you can pass that hurdle or the usual way you
  can get past that hurdle is another way of just being so fascinated by the <em><strong>nimitta</strong></em>
  you don't really realise what you're letting go of. But the very good way of passing that
  hurdle is to realise at that point that what you're letting go of is nothing to do with
  you. The body is not yours. The senses are not yours. You don't own, you're not part of
  them. These are just something what you just take up and use, which you can put back down
  again. You feel free to abandon the body only when you realise on a very deep level, it's
  not yours. So at that stage of the meditation a little bit of <em><strong>anatta</strong></em>,
  a little bit of non-self, does wonders for freeing you to go into deep <em><strong>jhanas</strong></em>.
  You look at that body and you can let it go. It's quite safe. It's not yours anyway. It
  doesn't matter if it does die in <em><strong>jhana</strong></em> and let go of all these
  senses. You realise they're nothing to do with you. Not your business. Leave it alone. Let
  it go and this control which comes up. The control which is always trying to
  control,&nbsp;especially&nbsp; the body. Let that go. Give it away. It's not yours.
  Nothing to do with you. And the control which is trying to control your mind, trying to
  force it into <em><strong>jhana</strong></em>, trying to nudge it into j<em><strong>hanas</strong></em>,
  trying to mold it this way and that way so that <em><strong>jhanas</strong></em> will
  happen. Nothing to do with you. Let it go. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the great monks in Thailand who's been to visit
  here a few times says that when he meditates he just does nothing. He just goes into deep<em><strong>
  jhanas</strong></em>. He's a really great meditator and that's the way he meditates. Just
  give up. Give up the doer, and the only way he can do that is because it just doesn't
  belong to him. Why am I doing something which doesn't belong to me? Like mowing someone
  else's garden on a Saturday afternoon. What are you doing that for? Let them mow their own
  garden. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So this is <em><strong>anatta</strong></em> which actually
  starts to propel you into the <em><strong>jhanas</strong></em> and the Buddha actually
  said again and again when he started talking about not just looking at the body as
  non-self but look at some of the senses. He said very clearly, it's in the <em><strong>Anattalakana
  Sutta</strong></em>, the second teaching which he gave. So what you see isn't yours.
  Seeing isn't yours. Sight consciousness isn't yours and it's not you. He said like hearing
  what you hear. Just hearing consciousness is not you. Smelling, tasting, touching, the
  feelings in your body, they're not you. The feeling organ, the body, is not yours. Feeling
  consciousness is not yours. Mind objects aren't yours. The mind consciousness isn't yours.
  The mind isn't yours. He actually said that very carefully, in order for people to
  understand that these senses are part of nature. Because of the nature of illusion is like
  the function of a mirage, we mistake these things to be something that they're not,
  especially the five external senses. We are attached to these which is why we can't let
  them go. We take them to be ours, my sight, my hearing, my smell, my taste, my physical
  touch, because we take them to be ours, because we think we own them, we are concerned
  with them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why is it that during meditation we get disturbed by
  sounds outside? Have you ever investigated that? The traffic outside, the sound of someone
  banging or the lanmower going or helicopter going overhead. Why do they disturb us? What's
  the point of listening to these sounds? What do we get out of it? Why do we do it? The
  reason why we do it is because we think that sound is ours and we're scared of letting it
  go. It's as if we don't attend to sound it will disappear once and for all, forever. We're
  so used to this. We've grown up with it. It's like a good friend. Once they go we think
  we've lost something. How many years when one person dies and gets cremated the other
  person always thinks there's something missing there somewhere? They don't feel
  comfortable. Isn't it the same that we're so used to these five senses that when one
  disappears, I mean really disappears, it's not quite right. We turn it on again
  deliberately. We want to hear anything rather than have silence or rather than have no
  sound at all. Even with the body. We've grown up with these feelings in the body. We're
  used to them and when all these feelings disappear it can feel so weird sometimes. We're
  not quite used to this, as if there's something missing somewhere. We get afraid. Our
  comfort blankets are taken away and we just snatched them back again. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With these five senses, if you realise these are nothing
  to do with you, sound becomes just like a telephone ringing but it's somebody else's call.
  Not yours. Nothing to do with you. When the body starts to itch, there's a message with
  someone else's name on it. Not yours. So you don't open the envelope. You just don't
  communicate with that which doesn't belong to you, which is not your concern. If you could
  do that, understanding the Buddha's teaching as <em><strong>anatta</strong></em> with the
  five external senses, it's easy to let them go, to turn them off., not to pick them up. If
  you can do that, <em><strong>jhana</strong></em> becomes so easy. The burden with <em><strong>jhana</strong></em>
  is the mosquitoes biting you, the sound disturbing you, the pain in the knees and all the
  thinking about that. That's what disturbs you. If you can let go of the body, abandon the
  body, <em><strong>jhana</strong></em> becomes easy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Remember somebody brought this question up in question
  time a few days ago about that Christian monk who was torturing his body by whipping
  himself until the five senses got so unpleasant that he turned them all off and gave them
  away. That's one way of abandoning the five senses. Make them just so unpleasant that you
  just can't stand them any longer. Then you chuck them away. But that's the hard way. The
  easy way is to realise that these things aren't yours, don't belong to you. When you can
  do that, the meditation just becomes so easy. You can let go of these things because you
  realise they aren't yours. So this is the way we can actually use the understanding of
  non-self to look at the five external senses and to let them go. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we go into the world of the mind and that is much
  harder to let go because we have more attachment to the world of the mind than even to the
  world of the body and it's five external senses. In particular we have this thing which we
  call <em><strong>&quot;thought&quot;</strong></em>. Why is thought so hard to give up?
  Again because we think it's me thinking. It's my thoughts. If you could actually look upon
  thoughts as being irrelevant chatter, if you could imagine all this thought is like coming
  from this little demon inside of you who's managed to creep in through your ear-hole when
  you were asleep and it's getting into a stupid conversation with another demon who's gone
  in your other ear-hole at night and they're having this conversation with each other and
  it's completely stupid, you would then realise that it's not yours. It's just two little
  devils inside your head speaking with one another. Even that imagination should be enough
  to realise this is not your thoughts. It's not your conversation, just don't listen to it.
  You don't give it importance. You realise it's not your responsibility. You don't need to
  listen to that commentary. You can let it go only when you realise it's not yours. That
  inner commentary is what we call the doer because if you listen to that commentary just so
  often - it's giving advice, giving criticism, very rarely give praise but sometimes it
  does that as well - you would see that it always gives orders. This is what we're talking
  about, <em><strong>the doer</strong></em>. This is how the doer manifests. This is the
  order, the speech. This is how the doer governs you. You think something and then you
  follow those thoughts. An order is given and you do that. This doer, this is what we call
  &quot;will&quot;, &quot;choice&quot;. You can actually see it happening. Not
  &quot;will&quot; and &quot;choice&quot; as an idea but &quot;will&quot; and
  &quot;choice&quot; as an experience which you can view happening in your mind. You can
  actually see the mind moving into thought and from that thought an action following very
  often. This is how there's a governing of your actions of body and speech and mind. This
  is how volition appears to you. You can actually see it happening and that's what I was
  saying is conditioned. That's what I was saying you can see the causes for two little
  demons who've crawled in your ears. Not you, nothing to do with you. Not coming from a me.
  In particular, nothing belonging to me. This is not your orders. These are words,
  thoughts, ideas completely conditioned. Why do you think those thoughts and not other
  thoughts? Why do you do these things and not other things? If you look very closely you
  can see the connections, how one thought leads to another, how inclinations sort of lead
  to another. In particular the Buddha actually taught to really understand how thinking
  works and how thinking especially is full of delusion. We're taught these <em><strong>vipallasas</strong></em>,
  the working of delusion. It's the physics of it, the mechanics of it. Where does thought
  come from? You start to see, if you look carefully, that thought is built up of your
  perceptions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, whenever you have your lunch, if you perceive
  something to be delicious you actually think &quot;that was really nice, I'll have some
  more of that&quot;. Whatever you perceive, if you perceive in a certain way, the thought
  follows on from that and the thoughts build up the views that &quot;this is
  delicious&quot; or &quot;Bianca's a good cook&quot; or &quot;you really get good food in
  this place&quot;. Your views are built up by the thoughts which are built up by the
  perceptions, and where do the perceptions come from? You perceive according to your views.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I often give a story of when I was a young teenager. I
  went into a pub in London for my first pint of British beer, vastly under-age but that
  didn't really matter. It was just a dare with your mates and drinking that first sip of
  beer and being completely taken aback at how dreadful it tasted. The actual experience was
  that this was really an awful thing because it was just so bitter and it wasn't to my
  taste at all. But the view, the current view amongst all of my friends and most of society
  was that this was something delicious. So that first perception came up and by the time
  I'd finished that beer I'd changed it completely because I wanted it to taste nice and it
  did taste nice. And I developed a love of British beer and spent a lot of money, a lot of
  time, drinking it and you can see what happens there. Because of your view that this must
  be delicious it becomes delicious, and perceptions follow accordingly, and from your
  perceptions you build up the thoughts, and because of the thoughts you reinforce the
  views. This is how delusion happens and keeps us in this circle which we find it so hard
  to get out of. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we look at our thoughts, we think that they're true
  because they fit our perceptions and they fit our views. Of course they do because they're
  made out of this. Your views create your perceptions. Your perceptions build your
  thoughts. Your thoughts justify your views and here you go on with more perceptions,
  thoughts and views each supporting each other, justifying one another. You never can see
  the fallacy of that. Only when you can actually start to stop those thoughts to realise
  that they're just a part of nature - not trusting them, not thinking they're yours,
  &nbsp; to be able to let go of them by knowing that this is the doer which you can
  abandon. The doer is one of the biggest hurdles to overcome, both in meditation and in
  insight practice, and many of you just know how hard it is to find a way of letting go of
  this doer. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">See if you can practice by suggesting, just for a few
  moments,&nbsp; non-self, not mine, on this thing, the doer, which is manifesting as your
  thought. Nothing to do with me. Not mine. Not my business. And you'll find it's much
  easier to let go when you don't own it. When it's not your responsibility, you don't mind
  people taking it away. Somebody, if you heard, like a thief breaks into the carpark and
  steals a car. If you went out there and find &quot;Oh, it's not my car&quot;, would you
  feel the same as if you went out there and found it was your car? You can see how
  ownership causes a problem. We don't allow things to disappear. We can't let go of them
  when we think we really own them, that they're mine. So if you do a little bit of <em><strong>anatta</strong></em>
  practice here, called <strong><em>anatta sanna</em></strong>, just the perception of
  non-self, then you'll find that it's easy to let go of the thinking, easy to let go of the
  thoughts. Also, <strong><em>anatta</em></strong> means that there is no-one in here, so
  you don't do the meditation. How can you do the meditation? Who can do the meditation?
  This meditation just becomes a natural process. Not you doing it, but meditation happens
  when you let go of you and allow things to disappear and to get quiet. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you for a moment, actually practice <em><strong>anatta</strong></em>
  towards the doer, you allow the meditation to be done by non-self rather than coming from
  a self, a doer, my meditation, me doing it. The other place where the illusion of self
  dies is in the knower and again we think that consciousness is us. I am the one who is
  conscious. I am the one who is experiencing all of this. This consciousness belongs to me
  which is also why if you really thinks that the consciousness is yours and you own it, you
  like to keep as much consciousness as you can. In other words, you like to experience as
  much as you can in this world, which is basically the way of the world. The way of
  meditation is actually letting go of all that area of consciousness, all those experiences
  which you can be indulging in, during these nine days. Instead you're just limiting
  yourself to a very small area of all possible conscious experience, just the breath. Just
  this moment, no past, no future. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's interesting what happens when you let go of a lot of
  the pasture of consciousness and you just limit it to just a small paddock. Usually
  consciousness can just go anywhere. You'll be conscious of just anything, go experience
  all of the delights, all of the pleasures in the world. But here you're putting the
  consciousness in a very small pasture and what happens when you've let go of so much
  pasture for your consciousness. You say, &quot;Oh, I'm just going to be conscious of the
  breath. I'm just going to be conscious of the present moment. All these other
  possibilities I'm going to renounce&quot;. You find there is freedom. There is peace. This
  is some happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why is that? What's going on? Start to realise that all
  these other areas don't really belong to you. Nothing to do with you. Give them away and
  you find the more you can give up of consciousness, the more you can let go of
  consciousness, let go of the consciousnesses of sight, sound, smells, tastes and touches
  and things get very peaceful, things get very nice, things get very free. It's because
  that we think that consciousness is somehow ours, we're unable to let it go. We just still
  want to be alive. We want to hear. We want to think because deep down that we don't want
  anyone to take it away from us. We think it's ours. We possess it. We own it and we're not
  wiling to let it go. If you think that consciousness is yours then it's just so hard to
  let it go. At the very least we can let go of the consiousnesses of the external five
  senses and just keep a little bit of consiousness of something, but bit by bit when one
  develops <em><strong>jhana</strong></em> one lets go of more of the pasture where
  consciousness usually lives, and little by little we let go of consciousness itself. We
  can only enter into that final <strong><em>jhana of cessation</em></strong> because it's
  cessation of consciousness. We can even let go of the last vestige of consciousness only
  when we understand this consciousness isn't us, doesn't belong to us. Only then we can let
  it go. People are afraid to let go of consciousness when you think it's yours. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So this is actually how we can use this <em><strong>anatta</strong></em>
  to understand the <em><strong>first jhana</strong></em> or <em><strong>second jhana</strong></em>
  where there is no doer. You're getting more data, more experience on which to check
  whether your views, whether your perceptions and thoughts are true or not. And again one
  of the reasons why&nbsp; the Buddha taught <strong><em>jhanas</em></strong>, one of the
  reasons why monks like myself keep pushing <em><strong>jhanas</strong></em>, is not just
  because it makes a nice experience when you bliss out during a retreat and you want to
  come back next time. It's because that when you enter these <strong><em>jhanas</em></strong>
  you get these experiences of first of all <em><strong>a doer disappearing</strong></em>.
  There's something has gone which you thought was yours. There's something has gone which
  you thought was you. It's not just gone for a moment. It's gone for a long time. It's like
  basically you're sitting here and your arm disappears. &quot;Wow, where did that go? I
  thought that was mine. I thought that belonged to my body. How can you have a body without
  an arm? There it is. That's really weird&quot;. If you see your arm just coming and going,
  just coming and going, it becomes quite clear. It doesn't belong to you. You see like your
  leg coming and going. That doesn't belong to you. You see the doer, disappearing for long
  periods of time. It becomes just as obvious as the nose in front of your face. This thing
  doesn't belong to you. You can exist without it and actually you exist much happier
  without it, without a doer. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When I'm talking about a doer, I'm talking about all
  manifestations of will, choice, decision making, judging. All of that disappears in these
  states. The simile I usually give for these <em><strong>jhanas</strong></em> is like a
  tadpole born in the water. The tadpole born in the water, grown up in the water. It only
  knows water. Actually, it doesn't know very much about water because it's just too close.
  It's got nothing to compare it with and thinks that's the whole world. It's only when the
  tadpole grows up and leaves that world, becomes the frog and goes to dry land. It's got
  that extra data to the world. It's only when you go to dry land that you know what wet
  means. It's only when you can actually get out of the doer, when the doer disappears, that
  you know what the doer was, that you know what it truly is. It's just water. It's not the
  whole world. It's just part of nature. It's not your essential being. So once you enter a <em><strong>jhana</strong></em>
  or experience the <em><strong>jhanas</strong></em> and come out afterwards, just usually
  they're so strong an experience, so marvellous, powerful experiences, that most people
  think when they just get off: &quot;Wow, that was really nice!&quot; But in Buddhism we
  also teach not to just indulge in the pleasure of having attained these states but also to
  review them, look back upon them and investigate them: &quot;What was that?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Powerful experiences are very easy to remember. You can
  recall them just so well and you look back and see what was strange about that? What was
  enjoyable about that? And one thing you look back on is to see that the doer has
  completely gone. What does that actually mean? If you look back upon that enough times
  you'll come to the insight inevitably. You have to. I don't see how you can miss it. You
  would see that a great part of you, a great chunk which you thought was you, which you
  took to be a self, which you assume to be a self, was a great mistake. You just summed it
  up all wrong. You made an assumption without all the evidence, and now all the evidence is
  here, you can't keep that assumption again. Just like, you know, people used to think that
  the world was flat. It is obvious, isn't it, that the world is flat. Just go and look
  outside. It's flat. You can even put a spirit level on it. There - it's flat. And for most
  people that's obvious. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The world is round&quot; takes a jump of perception,
  especially if somehow you can leave the world and go up in a rocket or a spaceship and you
  can actually see the world is round. The same with the doer being a self. Right down here,
  unenlightened human beings. It's just so obvious that the doer is a self. That I am doing
  these things. That I am choosing. You make that assumption all the time. It's only if we
  can somehow get apart, away, somehow separated from this, get a perspective on it. See the
  doer disappear. Only then it'll become very clear, that the doer is nothing to do with a
  self. The doer has gone. The existence is still there. You're still conscious, still feel
  like you're there but the doer has gone. Consciousness has remained. Imagine what it's
  like if you actually could see this and understand this, and accept this. It completely
  changes your perspective on will-power, on choosing, on doing, on desiring, on craving. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is craving anyway but another type of doing? If you
  can actually see this doer is not self, a lot of craving disappears. Also, the other part
  which one assumes to be a self is just experiencing consciousness. Even though if we
  attain to just the first <em><strong>jhana</strong></em> we can actually experience for
  ourselves the doer ceasing. There's still like a conscious experience there. Your mind is
  still fully awake and there's still knowing. Then, little by little, that knowing
  disappears. First of all, if you can see the doer as non-self then at least you can have
  some confidence or you can have some understanding. It's very suggestive. It's a
  suggestion that it&nbsp; is possible that the knower may not be not you either. If you can
  develop another <em><strong>jhana</strong></em>, at least you can see a whole heap of
  knowing disappearing. As the <em><strong>jhanas</strong></em> get more and more refined, a
  whole chunk of consciousness disappears. Then again you can get an idea, an inkling, that
  consciousness isn't you. But not only that because in the Dhamma, in Buddhism, the Buddha
  sort of described consciousness as actually what it actually is, in terms of the six
  senses. And that each of these senses has got a completely different type of consciousness
  to it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sight consciousness, you know, seeing, is not the same as
  hearing, is not the same as smelling, tasting, touching or mind consciousness. But why is
  it we call each of these things consciousness as though it was the same thing? Why is it
  that we assume that it's like a continuity of knowing? What is it that seems to be the
  same between seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching? And this is where the
  experiences of <strong><em>jhanas</em></strong> start to let you understand the illusion
  of continuity in consciousness which gives us the illusion that this is always me here
  rather than the reality of the fragmentory nature of consciousness. The one consciousness
  arising and passing away and a completely different consciousness arising and then passing
  away. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Like you're given a simile in a monastery. It's like you
  are sitting here and now you are a banana. Then, the banana completely vanishes and then
  you're a mango, and the mango completely vanishes and then you're a melon, and the melon
  completely vanishes and you're a banana again. And that vanishes and then you're an apple
  and that vanishes and then you're a mango again. If that was your experience that you know
  you're a completely different fruit each moment, would you ever think that there was
  actually something continuing across from one moment to another? Would you actually think
  there's some sort of identity which was there in the banana, which was there in the apple,
  which was there in the mango, and so on? That's actually the fragmentary nature of
  consciousness. Now the reason why people don't see this is because whatever you see with
  the eyes, the mind also sees. It takes up as an object of its consciousness. You see
  something, you know you see. Seeing something is sight consciousness. Knowing you see this
  is mind consciousness. You hear something. You know you hear. Sound consciousness followed
  immediately by mind consciousness. You smell, taste, you touch something. You know you've
  touched it. Touch consciousness followed by mind consciousness. Even you imagine
  something. You know you've imagined it. A thought arises. You know you've thought that
  thought. You know something. You know you know you know. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What's happening here is even with mind consciousness,
  whatever arises in the mind, the mind can take that again as its object. Mind
  consciousness following on mind consciousness. The reality, the truth, if you're going to
  be more accurate, more precise, is not that you know. It's that you know you know. If you
  add that time factor there, this whole process of what we call self-consciousness becomes
  quite clear. It's just the mind taking up the last object of consciousness and repeating
  it again and it's because mind consciousness is there with what we see, what we hear, what
  we smell, what we taste, what we touch. It gives the illusion of sameness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the simile we have of the different fruit arising,
  manifesting. It's like there's a fruit. It's like an apple arises with a coconut next to
  it and then there's a banana. They both disappear and then there's a banana arises with a
  coconut next to it. Then there's an apple arises with a coconut next to it, and there's a
  mango with a coconut next to it. Then there's a banana with a coconut next to it and
  there's a coconut with a coconut next to it and there's a banana again with a coconut next
  to it. The coconut stands for mind consciousness. Always holding onto the other
  consciousness. Always being there with it giving the illusion of sameness. What happens if
  you get into <em><strong>jhanas</strong></em> is that there all you've got is coconuts.
  All that you've got is mind consciousness. All the other five consciousnesses have
  completely disappeared. Only if you have the<em><strong> jhanas</strong></em> you really
  understand what the mind is, what mind consciousness is, what a coconut is, because you've
  separated it out. You've distilled it. You've purified it. You know what this thing, mind,
  consciousness, experience actually is, rather than just thinking about it or
  philosophising about it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once you recognise this sixth consciousness - call it <em><strong>citta</strong></em>,
  call it <em><strong>vinnana</strong></em>, <em><strong>mano</strong></em>, ... whatever
  you wish - once you understand what that actually is - mind or mind consciousness - then
  when you come out of <strong><em>jhanas</em></strong> you can see it. Instead of just
  having the apple-coconut or mango-coconut, thinking it's just one fruit with sort of the
  sameness to it, you can actually split off mind consciousness. You can actually see, there
  is seeing, mind consciousness comes up right next. You can actually recognise it. You've
  seen it in its purity, alone, and you can actually see sound consciousness and then mind
  consciousness come up right afterwards. What you actually see if you can recognise what
  mind, <em><strong>citta</strong></em> or consciousness truly is, is that you can actually
  take apart this sensory experience. You can actually see the fragmentary nature of it.
  Banana then coconut. Apple then coconut. There's nothing which is there all the time.
  Consciousness changes. Six types, each completely different. &quot;Which one is
  you?&quot;, the Buddha asked. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you are consciousness, if the conscious experience is
  the identity which you say is your self and soul, if it's that which sees, which one is it
  which is you? If it is any one of them, then where do you go when that consciousness which
  is you disappears and one of the other five is there? It just does not make sense. It
  cannot hold. You can never look again at consciousness once you see it fragmentary, as
  being a self, being a soul, being a me, being mine. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's only if consciousness is continuous, has got this
  continuity about it, that you can think it's a self or a soul. It's something which
  belongs to you. Also, when you can see it's fragmentary then it passes away, you can allow
  it to go. You can let it stop. When you see especially these two what I call &quot;abodes
  of delusion of self&quot;, the doer and consciousness, or will and consciousness, you can
  see that each one of these can never be regarded as a self, a me or a mine. Nothing to do
  with this and there's no other place where a self can hang out. Then you can see that
  consciousness is just a process, a natural process. It's nothing to do with a person or a
  being. It's something which arises and passes away according to causes. Same as will, it's
  something which arises and passes away because of causes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When it doesn't belong to you then you can let it go. You
  can let it cease. You can let it end. Only then can <em><strong>Nibbana</strong></em> be
  possible. <em><strong>Nibbana</strong></em> is the ceasing of all of this. It was very
  clearly described what <strong><em>Nibbana</em></strong> was by the Buddha. When a flame
  goes out, it's <em><strong>Nibbana</strong></em>. Where's it go out to? Does it go and
  become unified with the great flame being? Does it go to some great home where all flames
  go to but you can't see them but they're really there? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha actually said, &quot;does the flame go
  East?&quot; No. &quot;Does it go West?&quot; No. &quot;Does it go up?&quot; No. &quot;Does
  it go down?&quot; No. &quot;Does it go anywhere?&quot; No. It's just gone out. That's what
  <em><strong>Nibbana</strong></em> means. What was once there is now finished, gone. The
  process has ended. You can only allow that to happen. It only makes sense. It can only be
  a possibility for you if you realise that none of this has an essence to it and none of
  this has a self to it. None of this belongs to you or belongs to anyone. It's just a part
  of nature. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course people say &quot;What's the point of this if
  it's just going to end and you're going to go 'poof' and you're gone? I don't want to
  go&quot;. Why don't you want to go? Because you think you're still there. What are you
  hanging on to that you don't want to leave? <em><strong>Nibbana</strong></em>? What have
  you got a vested interest in? What do you think you own? Who is the owner which you're not
  willing to recognise as emptiness? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you can actually understand this and fully recognise
  and penetrate non-self, then you understand what <em><strong>Nibbana</strong></em> means
  and only then, you understand what the Buddha was talking about - about the process, a
  natural process, which leads to the cessation of all of this and basically people say
  &quot;well, that might sound OK but I'm not having anything to do with this! Maybe I don't
  want <strong><em>Nibbana</em></strong>. I just want to have a good time&quot;.
  Unfortunately you've got no say in it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's what I've told quite a few people on the retreat.
  They said &quot;well, I've got maybe a few doubts. I'm not really sure whether I want to
  really sort of carry this meditation all the way to the <strong><em>jhanas</em></strong>
  and, you know, become a monk or become a nun, and sort of let go of everything and get
  into <strong><em>Nibbana</em></strong>&quot;. They're not quite sure of this. I said to
  them &quot;don't worry about it because you've got no choice!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's very much like you're on a bus and once you're on
  that bus you can shout the driver to &quot;let me off at this stop&quot;. But
  unfortunately it's an express bus with only one stop at the end of the journey. It's not
  going to stop half way. There are no little buttons to press to get the driver to stop.
  You're on this until the very end. It has to eventually end up with letting everything go.
  It's abandoning things, giving up things. First of all, you give up what's outside. Then
  you start giving up what's inside. Inside, outside, it's the same. You give up everything
  until there's nothing left. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's so beautiful. That's what we call emptiness, going
  out, disappearing, because you realise there's nothing there, only an illusion. The
  illusion has been seen and everything grinds to a halt, just like that machine which I was
  talking about yesterday. It's turned on. Who had turned it on, I don't know, but this
  whole purpose is to get that hand coming up the front which is called, you know, the
  meditation, and turning itself off and then it's done its function, its business. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So anyway, that's a little talk on <em><strong>anatta</strong></em>
  for this evening. A different way than I've taught before, with some little pointers about
  the practice of <strong><em>anatta</em></strong> in your meditation. So give that a go.
  See what happens when you've completely let go. Only letting go from the imagination of
  there's no-one in here. </font></p>
