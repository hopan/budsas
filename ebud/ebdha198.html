        is very common to any religion. Buddhism is no exception in this regard.
        However, the aim and purpose of chanting is different from one religion
        to another. <strong><i>Buddhism is unique in that it does not consider
        chanting to be prayer.</i></strong></font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha in many ways has shown us to
        have confidence in our own action and its results, and thereby
        encouraged us to depend on no one but ourselves. This in fact is the sum
        and substance of His last message in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta. One of
        the passages in this discourse reads: &quot;Ananda, be dependent on
        yourself, take refuge in yourself and not in others, by this mean be
        dependent on the Dhamma, go for refuge to the Dhamma -- the righteous
        principles&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When a Buddhist does chanting, he is not
        asking some one to save him from evil nor is he hoping to be given a
        place in heaven as a result after he dies. Instead, through chanting he
        may be <i>learning, teaching, philosophising</i> or <i>re-memorising </i>the
        discourse.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Actually, in the Anguttara Nikaya there
        are some discourses dealing with chanting like Dhammavihari Sutta. It
        mentions five categories of people who make use of the discourses.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first one studies it just for the
        sake of study without putting it into practice or explaining it to
        others. He even does not reflect deeply on what he has studied. He is
        known as 'Pariyatti-bahulo' who is keen on studying it alone.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second one preaches or teaches what
        he has learnt from the discourses but does not follow it himself. He is
        'Pannyatti-bahulo' who is keen only on teaching.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third one does chanting. He
        philosophises about the discourses, trying all the time to satisfy his
        philosophical thirst. He forgets to make use of as mode or life. He is
        called 'Vitakka-bahulo' who is eager only to indulge in philosophical
        aspects of the Suttas (Discourses).</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth one is the
        one who chants the discourses to make them last for a long time in his
        memory. He memorises and re-memorises. Nevertheless, he does not go
        further to follow it in daily life. He is 'Sajjhayaka-bahulo' who is
        enthusiastic only in memorising or chanting the teachings of the Buddha,
        He may even expect some magical power from chanting.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The fifth and last one
        is who studies the discourses, teaches them to others, reflects on their
        philosophical points, chants them regularly and above all actually
        practices it in daily life. He is the one the Buddha praises to be
        'Dhammavihari' -- a practitioner of the Dhamma, which he has learnt from
        the discourses.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><em><font face="Times New Roman">Having reflected on
        this Sutta, it is left to us to judge ourselves to which category we
        belong and why we study or chant the discourses.</font></em></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">I would like to dwell a
        bit more on <i>chanting </i>in general. This is, after all, an All-night
        Chanting ceremony. It is nothing but right for us to be fully convinced
        of what we are doing. Initially I did mention that Buddhism is unique
        because it does not consider chanting to be a form of prayer.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#0000FF">Then
        why do we, Buddhists, chant?</font></font></strong></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In the olden days,
        before there were sufficient support materials for study like books,
        translations and computers we had to memorise to learn a discourse.
        After we had learnt it, we still had to chant regularly to protect it
        and hand it down to future generations. If we did not recite it daily we
        might forget it and omit some part of it. The Anguttara Nikaya says that
        <i><strong>if the discourses are poorly maintained this will lead to the
        disappearance of the Sasana</strong><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i>[1]
        It was so important those days to memorise and chant it regularly. This
        must have definitely contributed in developing chanting practice.
        Chanting meant almost for the survival of the Dhamma itself.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Now we have sufficient
        support materials, why we should then be still chanting? Is there any
        more reason to do this?</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">There are some reasons
        sufficient to continue chanting practice. Regular chanting gives us
        confidence, joy and satisfaction, and increases devotion within us. This
        devotion is really a power. It is called the Power of Devotion
        (Saddhabala). It energises our life in general. I do not know about the
        others. For me I often have a joyous feeling when the chanting goes
        right. I become more confident of myself. I see it as a part of
        developing devotion.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhist monastic
        education tradition, chanting and learning by heart still forms a part
        of it. We study some of the Theravada Abhidhamma texts -- <i>the highest
        teachings of the Buddha which deal with the ultimate nature of things </i>--
        in that way in Burma. We are explained the meaning and how the logic
        develops in the Abhidhamma. In the night we try to chant without having
        learnt it by heart. We could do it because of the technique. It is known
        as evening-class (nya-war) over there. It means a certain technique of
        studying the Abhidhamma and some of the Suttas. It is very helpful as it
        helps you to reflect very quickly.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">When we examine the
        nature of the discourses, the reasons for chanting will become clearer
        to us than ever.</font></p>
        <p align="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>THE
        NATURE OF THE DISCOURSES</b></font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">A Sutta (Discourse) like
        <i><font color="#800040">Mangala Sutta </font></i>was an answer to the
        Deva who asked the Lord Buddha about the real progress in social,
        economic and spiritual life. It is the vision of the Buddha on those
        issues as much as his advice to all of us who genuinely want those
        progresses in social and spiritual life. It is some thing that we should
        follow throughout our life starting from childhood to the day we take
        our last breath. Most of the Suttas are of this nature. They are
        descriptions as well as prescriptions for the common diseases like
        Lobha, Dosa and Moha (Greed, Hatred and Delusion).</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Another nature of the
        discourses is protection or healing. <i><font color="#800040">Ratana
        Sutta</font></i> is one of the best-known examples here. It was first
        taught to Venerable Ananda who in turn chanted in Vaisali to ward off
        all the evils and famine the people were then facing. <i><font color="#800040">Angulimala
        Sutta </font></i>also falls into this category as it relieves the pains
        and trouble of a would-be mother. <i><font color="#800040">Mahasamaya
        Sutta</font></i> and<i><font color="#800040"> Atanatiya Sutta </font></i>come
        under the same category because they emphasise much on protection and
        healing. Remember that Venerable Ananda and Venerable Angulimala did
        cultivate love and compassion before they chanted the discourse for this
        particular kind of blessing.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The three<i><font color="#800040">
        Bojjhanga Suttas</font></i> [2] (<i><font color="#800040">Maha
        Kassapa/Moggallana/Cunda</font></i>) [3] have been in common use to help
        relieve the suffering of a patient. This is the third nature of the
        discourses I am trying to understand and reflect. Even the</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha asked Venerable
        Cunda to chant this Bojjhanga Sutta when He was ill. He himself did the
        chanting of the Bojjhanga Sutta when his senior disciples, Venerable
        Maha Kassapa and Venerable Maha Moggallana, were sick. These are the
        kind of Suttas that have both instructions for meditation practice and
        healing power. Karaniyametta Sutta has these same natures: instruction
        for daily practice to develop our spiritual benefit and to ward off the
        evils.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In other words, Buddhist
        chanting serves as a reminder of the practice we need to follow in daily
        life. If we understand and learn how to do it properly, it is another
        type of meditation in itself. It is also at the same time a healing or
        blessing service.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The last benefit we may
        get from chanting discourses is meditative one. When we chant if we try
        to concentrate well on the chanting, our mind becomes contemplative, not
        wandering, not engaging in unwholesome thoughts. The late Venerable Dr.
        H. Saddhatissa Mahanayaka Thero, the founder of SIBC [4], has rightly
        remarked in his work [5] that almost all Buddhist practices are nothing
        else but some form of meditation./.</font></p>
