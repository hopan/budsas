  <hr width="25%">
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Stephen Batchelor's book, &quot;Buddhism Without
  Beliefs&quot; has attracted a lot of attention in Buddhist circles. In many respects, this
  is an important book. It may be seen as a lucid manifesto of a tendency in modern, western
  Buddhism that has been gaining ground in recent years. This is the kernel of a new school
  of modernized, rationalized Buddhism; in essence a Protestant Buddhism. While this
  tendency is seen as a welcome one by many, it is worth examining more closely to
  understand just what is being put forward.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The book, and the whole trend of &quot;new Buddhism&quot;
  that it represents is inspired by the confrontation of the Dharma with the dynamic
  cultural heritage of the West. Buddhism arose in the very different cultural milieu of
  pre-modern Asia and now it is establishing itself in the western world there are
  inevitable tensions between the elements of the two different world-views. It is a valid,
  and an important, undertaking for modern western Buddhists to attempt to resolve these
  tensions and make the Dharma a living tradition here in the West. This is what Mr.
  Batchelor attempts to do.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mr. Batchelor is enthusiastic about many aspects of the
  western tradition and words like democratic, secular, agnostic and scientific occur often,
  with an unexamined positive valuation. These are contrasted to the perceived negative
  values of what he terms &quot;religious Buddhism&quot;, that is the Buddhism as understood
  and practiced by all Buddhists prior to the last few decades. The author is very
  definitely a product of the Enlightenment (in the historic, not the mystical sense), the
  Protestant Reformation and the democratic and scientific revolutions. It is significant
  for understanding his thesis that he takes this complex of values as primary; indeed, in
  every case where there is a perceived conflict between the Buddhist teachings and these
  western values, it is the Buddhist teachings which must be modified or abandoned to force
  a reconciliation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of this complex of values, the chief thrust of the book is
  on that of agnostic skepticism. In particular, it is karma and rebirth that we are urged
  to be skeptical about. Mr. Batchelor argues, in fact, that this outlook is entirely in
  accord with the spirit of the Dharma.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Central to his argument is the text of the Kalama Sutta,
  which he twice quotes as a chapter opening. This is a well known Sutta that the Buddha
  delivered to a group of laymen who were doubtful as to what teachings to believe when so
  many philosophers taught contradictory theories. This is often used as a basis for
  validating a skeptical approach to the Dharma.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is worth considering what this text actually does say
  about accepting and rejecting teachings. The Buddha lists a number of invalid reasons for
  accepting a view. These include being misled by hearsay or tradition or by proficiency in
  the scriptures, but also, please note, by logic and inference. The Buddha then gives some
  valid reasons for accepting a teaching; these are that the teaching when put into practice
  conduces to one's well-being and happiness and, significantly, that the teaching is one
  &quot;praised by the wise.&quot; Further, when one finds such a teaching, then one should
  &quot;undertake and abide in it.&quot; This is hardly a recommendation for a persistent
  agnosticism, nor is it a blanket condemnation of authority.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another thrust of Mr. Batchelor's argument seems to be
  that he sees himself as reducing Buddhism to the essential teachings of the Four Noble
  Truths and cutting out dogmatic accretions unnecessary for salvation. But when we examine
  his specific criticism of the traditional teachings, this appears rather hollow. Consider
  his chapter on the Four Noble Truths. He quite rightly emphasizes how each of the Four has
  an associated method of approach; we are charged by the Buddha to understand suffering,
  abandon craving, realize cessation and cultivate the path. However, he goes on to make the
  rather surprising claim that this teaching has been all but forgotten &quot;relegated to
  the margins of specialist doctrinal knowledge.&quot; This claim is made, it seems to
  bolster an argument that &quot;religious Buddhism&quot; has turned the Four Truths in a
  static set of &quot;propositions to be believed.&quot; This critique applies more to
  superficial popular accounts that to the full-bodied traditional teaching; these four
  tasks have not been forgotten. It seems that here Mr. Batchelor is setting up a straw man
  to attack. Much of his critique of &quot;religious Buddhism&quot; seems to be directed
  against this caricature of his own devising and not against real living traditions.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In regard to his criticism of the rebirth idea, while
  admitting that the Buddha himself was not agnostic on this issue (p.35,) Mr. Batchelor
  maintains that he was &quot;still constrained by the world view of his time.&quot; (p.94)
  There are fundamental assumptions being made here that cannot be shared by most
  traditional Buddhists. One is the implied trivialization of the Buddha's enlightenment.
  Another is that the modern materialist world view is superior to the metaphysical
  understanding of ancient India.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">While these objections may have no force for agnostic
  modernizing Buddhists, they should still address the question as to why the Buddha was
  able to challenge many other crucial aspects of the prevailing paradigm such as the
  existence of an atman or the acceptability of the caste system. It is simply not good
  enough to say that the Buddha accepted rebirth because it was the prevailing view; he
  demonstrated profound abilities to forge new directions with his teaching and would not
  have accepted something so crucial unreflectively.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A central aspect to &quot;Buddhism Without Beliefs&quot;
  is the promotion of agnosticism as a cardinal Buddhist virtue. Mr. Batchelor is careful to
  distinguish this from what he calls skepticism and defines it as an honest admission that
  one doesn't know. This position, so defined, has a certain integrity to it but how
  compatible is it with the Buddha's own teachings? While it is true that the Buddha
  exhorted us not to cling to any views, including those of his teaching, and to investigate
  reality for ourselves, these directives are not by any means the whole of his teaching and
  should be taken in context with that whole. It is a mistake to take one aspect of the
  Dharma and ignore the rest; this provides a one-sided understanding. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One aspect that Mr. Batchelor ignores is the importance
  that the Buddha placed on Right View. In Anguttara XVII the Buddha says that he knows of
  no other thing so conducive to the arising of wholesome states as Right View. In one of
  the frequently occurring formulas of Right View, as for example in Majjhima 41, the Buddha
  defines it as, among other things, a belief in karma and in &quot;this world and the other
  world.&quot; Furthermore, there is much discussion in the suttas of Wrong View, one
  variety of which is precisely that of the materialists. &quot;Since this self is material,
  made up of the four great elements, the product of mother and father, at the breaking up
  of the body it is annihilated and perishes, and does not exist after death.&quot; (Digha
  1)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As an aside, it should be pointed out that advocates of a
  materialist Buddhism often claim that their view is different from this ancient
  annihilationism because it doesn't postulate a self. While it would take us too far afield
  to examine this argument in detail, suffice it to say that from a traditional Buddhist
  understanding, any doctrine of materialism must have an implied self-view. In other words,
  it is incompatible with a true understanding of not-self. This is because of, firstly, an
  identification with the single aggregate of bodily form and secondly, because of the
  belief in annihilation of consciousness at death which presupposes an existent entity to
  be annihilated (even if this is not articulated.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another way in which an agnostic Buddhism violates
  fundamental teachings is the imbalance in the development of the faculties. One of the
  five spiritual faculties is saddha, translated as faith or confidence. This must be
  balanced with its complement and opposite number, panna or discriminative wisdom. Too much
  faith without any wisdom is superstition, too much discrimination without faith leads to
  cunning ( &quot;a disease as hard to cure as one caused by medicine.&quot;) That is, when
  we set our own reason upon a pedestal and denigrate the enlightenment of the Buddha with
  our skepticism, we can create our own false Dharma in service to the desires.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This approach is unwelcome to the rationalizing modernist
  trend of agnostic Buddhism. But it is one that was taught by the Buddha and has served
  millions of devout Buddhists well for twenty-five centuries.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As noted previously, karma and rebirth are among the
  elements of Buddhism that Mr. Batchelor questions. He regards these as not crucial to the
  core teaching.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And yet we have seen that an acceptance of karma is
  central to the very definition of Right View. Mr. Batchelor rightly states that karma is
  intention but he is wrong to draw from this the implied conclusion that it has nothing to
  do with results in the world or in states of rebirth. The Buddha most often spoke about
  ethics entirely in terms of rebirth. Doing such and such a wholesome action will result in
  &quot;a happy rebirth, a good destination, even unto heaven.&quot; Doing such and such an
  unwholesome action will lead to &quot; an unhappy rebirth, a bad destination, even unto
  hell.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mr. Batchelor says &quot;ethical integrity is rooted in
  the sense of who we are and what kind of reality we inhabit.&quot; (p.45) This is true,
  and it is one reason the Buddha emphasized a belief in karma and rebirth, that is to say
  that ethical actions have results. And as a vital corollary, that death is not an ending
  to these results.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On a deeper level, a world-view informed by the reality of
  the terrible wheel of sangsara is absolutely central to a profound approach to practice.
  This has been the existential basis upon which all schools of Buddhism have been built.
  The work needed to realize the Dharma in its depths is not trivial. If one bases her view
  on materialist assumptions of annihilation after death, where is the motivation to wrestle
  with the profoundest issues? If all alike are annihilated, what possible difference could
  Dharma practice make?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is most telling that Mr. Batchelor sees a belief in
  rebirth as a &quot;consolation.&quot; He recognizes the incongruity of this by calling it
  a &quot;curious twist that westerners find [it so]&quot; (p35) Nevertheless he claims that
  &quot;an agnostic Buddhist looks to the Dharma for metaphors of existential confrontation
  rather than consolation.&quot; (p.18)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is only a very superficial understanding of rebirth
  that finds any consolation therein. It is not an escapist fantasy, but an understanding
  that confronts the terrible realities of birth, old-age, sickness and death head on.
  Anyone who has contemplated these ideas in depth begins to have a detachment from the
  world of sensuality and form, How can that which is repeated endlessly and always ends in
  the same sorry way have any appeal? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is more likely the fantasy of annihilation that is the
  consolation. One can pretend to be brave and accept extinction but thereby escape all the
  awful consequences of karma (or so one may imagine.) The picture is not as simple or as
  one-sided as &quot;Buddhism Without Beliefs&quot; would have us believe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">While it is to be seriously questioned whether agnosticism
  (in Mr. Batchelor's sense) is really what the Buddha taught, there is another and more
  profound problem with this book. It seems upon a close reading that Mr. Batchelor is not
  quite so free of beliefs as he would let on. However these are the beliefs of modernism
  and not of Buddhism.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whereas he would have us belief that he is taking the
  position of &quot;I don't know&quot; he betrays a decided bias at every turn for
  materialism. Often this is slipped in almost unawares. a very good example is the
  description of the Buddha's decision to teach the Dharma after his enlightenment.
  &quot;What decided [the Buddha] was the appearance of an idea (in the language of ancient
  India, a 'god' &quot; (p 106) Wouldn't a truly agnostic position at least entertain the
  possibility of a real manifestation of a real entity rather than jump to such an
  unwarranted conclusion? This conclusion can only come from an inherent faith in the
  metaphysics of the modern west. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Telling as this example is, it is not central to the
  argument. However on page 37 we have &quot;All this has nothing to do with the
  compatibility (or otherwise) of Buddhism and modern science. It is odd that a practice
  concerned with anguish and the ending of anguish should be obliged to accept ancient
  Indian metaphysical theories and thus accept as an article of faith that consciousness
  cannot be explained in terms of brain function.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Odder indeed to many traditional Buddhists is the article
  of faith of modernists that it can be. Let's be clear about this. Consciousness has not at
  all been explained &quot;in terms of brain function&quot; by modern science or by anyone
  else. It is entirely a metaphysical assumption that it ever can be, an act of faith of the
  most credulous sort that Mr. Batchelor should be the first to denounce. There is not a
  shred of a proof of this claim anywhere, only a pious belief in some quarters that such a
  proof will shortly be forthcoming.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even odder is that when there is a conflict between two
  metaphysical assumptions, a Buddhist writer should be so ready to give the benefit of the
  doubt to the unbuddhist one.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is most unfortunate about the materialist view as a
  basis for Dharma practice is that it precludes any possibility of enlightenment. We can
  see in &quot;Buddhism Without Beliefs&quot; that Mr. Batchelor has redefined the concept
  (he prefers the term &quot;awakening&quot;) in the direction of making it into something
  mundane and ordinary. We have already commented on his assertion that the Buddha had not
  transcended even the constraints of popular thought. In his chapter on
  &quot;Awakening&quot; Mr. Batchelor goes on to say &quot;The Buddha was not a mystic. His
  awakening was not a shattering insight into transcendent Truth that revealed to him the
  mysteries of God. He did not claim to have had an experience that granted him privileged,
  esoteric knowledge about how the universe works.&quot; (p.5) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we disregard the unnecessary reference to God, the rest
  of this is a denial of what traditionally and scripturally the Buddha's enlightenment
  means. Consider the Buddha's knowledges of past lives, attained on the enlightenment
  night. Consider the Buddha's epithet as &quot;Knower of the Worlds&quot; (plural.)
  Consider the suttas in which the Buddha reveals special knowledge of times past and
  future.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Specific reference can be made to the Mahasihanada Sutta,
  (Majjhima 12) in which the Buddha declares his own powers. These include, amongst others,
  &quot;the Tathagata understands as it actually is the results of actions undertaken, past,
  future and present with possibilities and with causes...the Tathagata understands as it is
  the world with its many and different elements...the Tathagata recollects his manifold
  past lives...&quot; Most damaging to the assertions of Mr. Batchelor is, perhaps, &quot;I
  see no ground on which...anyone...could in accordance with Dhamma, accuse me thus: 'While
  you claim full enllightenment, you are not enlightened in regard to certain things.'
  &quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mr. Batchelor has simply redefined the enlightenment to be
  something else than the Buddha claimed it to be, and generations of Buddhists have
  understood it as. Of course it is necessary to dismiss supernormal attainments if one is
  to preserve the concept of materialism intact.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A little later Mr. Batchelor informs us that &quot;access
  to the process of awakening was relatively straightforward and did not entail any great
  fuss.&quot; (p.12) This is certainly not the way it is described in the
  Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta describing the Buddha's first discourse. (A source which Mr.
  Batchelor draws on for his chapter on the Four Truths.) When the elder Kondanna achieved
  stream-entry the devas of all classes set up a paean of rejoicing and a great light
  enveloped the cosmos. Even if one wants to rationalize this away as a &quot;metaphor&quot;
  it certainly indicates that the compilers of the canon perceived something of very great,
  indeed of cosmic, importance, worthy of &quot;fuss&quot;, had occurred. The trivialization
  of enlightenment is entirely a modernist invention.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Part and parcel with this revaluation of enlightenment
  downwards is a denial of Nirvana (Nibbana ). &quot;Religious interpretations invariably
  reduce complexity to uniformity.&quot; (How so? Isn't materialism the ultimate
  reductionism?) &quot;Over time, increasing emphasis has been placed on a single Absolute
  Truth, such as &quot;the Deathless', 'the Unconditioned,' 'the Void,' 'Nirvana,' 'Buddha
  Nature etc.,,&quot; (p.4)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So says Mr. Batchelor. Compare the words of the Buddha
  (from Samyutta 43 - Ven. Thanissaro's translation)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The unfashioned, the end, the effluent-less, the
  true, the beyond, the subtle, the very-hard-to-see, the ageless, permanence, the
  undecaying, the featureless, the undifferentiated, peace, the deathless, the exquisite,
  bliss, solace, the exhaustion of craving, the wonderful, the marvelous, the secure,
  security, Nibbana, the unafflicted, the passionless, the pure, release, non-attachment,
  the island, shelter, harbour, refuge, the ultimate.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is very sad that many are loosing the prospect of this
  promise of the Buddha in exchange for such paltry fare. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It has already been remarked how Mr. Batchelor seems to
  consistently favour the western tradition over the Buddhist. He tells us that &quot;an
  agnostic Buddhist would not regard the Dharma as a source of answers to questions of where
  we came from, where we are going, what happens after death. He would seek such knowledge
  in the appropriate domains: astrophysics, evolutionary biology, neuroscience etc.&quot;
  (p.18) What could any of these disciplines tell us about what happens after death? It is
  astonishing that a Buddhist writer can so readily dismiss the ancient wisdom tradition and
  so decisively claim the superiority of modern materialist philosophy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is clear too that Mr. Batchelor's biases have been
  shaped by the Protestant Reformation, in that he seems unable, despite his own experience
  as a Vajrayana monk, to appreciate the true social and spiritual import of monasticism.
  (see pp.52-53) Instead, he proposes new models of organization based on democratic and
  secular principles. Models which would encourage &quot;individuation and
  imagination.&quot; While it is unclear what he means by imagination (one hopes not mental
  proliferation and yet more fanciful re-interpretations) the goal of individuation is an
  even more problematic one from a Buddhist perspective. Doesn't this necessitate an
  affirmation and validation of the self-concept?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is disappointing to say the least that in a book which
  purports to meet the challenge of interpreting the Dharma for the modern west, the meeting
  of the two streams is so one-sidedly against the Dharma. Where is the critique of the
  western tradition? Undoubtedly much of value has been accomplished within that tradition
  but it has also been intrinsically bound up with such evils as colonialism, destruction of
  the natural environment and widespread spiritual malaise.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is precisely the ancient wisdom of Buddhism that is
  missing form the western world. The sense of a meaning in life, the intrinsic value of
  human and other beings, the possibility of spiritual transcendence and the knowledge of
  that which is beyond the suffering, samsaric conditioned world accessible to science. It
  is tragically these very elements in the teachings that Mr. Batchelor's approach would
  discard.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The teachings of the Buddha are very old. This means to
  radicals and modernists that they are out-moded. To the traditionalist it means that they
  are tried and true. Millions upon millions of beings throughout history have practiced and
  benefited from the full form of the Dharma, taught complete with rebirth and transcendence
  and a non-physical mind. Many have benefited to the ultimate level of liberation. What is
  this arrogant pride of modern times that makes us think we are so much wiser? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These teachings are very precious. Precious in their
  entirety, in the letter and the meaning. They have been cherished and handed on to us
  intact from our teachers going back to the Buddha. Can we possibly justify hacking and
  tearing at a living tradition to make it fit a cheap suit of modernist cloth?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is an urgent need to interpret and present these
  teachings to the modern west. This &quot;Buddhism Without Beliefs&quot; has sorely failed
  to do. The prescription of this book amounts to an abandonment of the traditional Dharma
  and the transformation of Buddhism into a psychotherapy, which like all psychotherapies,
  has no goal higher than &quot;ordinary misery.&quot; This is a Buddhism without fruition,
  without a Third Noble Truth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Should such teachings prevail then they will still
  validate the tradition in a backhanded way; because they will fulfill the prophecies of
  the degeneration of the Dharma in this age of decline.</font></p>
