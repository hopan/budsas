    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">F</font><font face="Times New Roman">aith in the
    theistic sense is not found in Buddhism because of its emphasis on understanding. Theistic
    faith is a drug for the emotional mind and demands belief in things which cannot be known.
    Knowledge destroys faith and faith destroys itself when a mysterious belief is examined
    under the daylight of reason. Confidence cannot be obtained by faith since it places less
    emphasis on reason, but only by understanding. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Referring to the unintelligible and '<i>blind'</i> nature
    of faith, Voltaire said, 'Faith is to believe in something which your reason tells you
    cannot be true; for if your reason approved of it, there could be no question of blind
    faith.' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Confidence, however, is not the same as faith. For
    confidence is not a mental acceptance of that which cannot be known. Confidence is an
    assured expectation, not of an unknown beyond, but of what can be tested as experienced
    and understood personally. Confidence is like the understanding that a student has in his
    teacher who explains in the class-room the inverse square law of gravitation as stated by
    Newton. He should not adopt an unquestioning belief of his teacher and his textbook. He
    studies the fact, examines the scientific arguments, and makes an assessment of the
    reliability of the information. If he has doubts, he should reserve his judgment until
    such time as when he is able to investigate the accuracy of the information for himself.
    To a Buddhist, confidence is a product of reason, knowledge and experience. When it is
    developed, confidence can never be blind faith. Confidence becomes a power of the mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In his book, What The Buddha Taught Walpola Rahula says: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The question of belief arises when there is no seeing --
    seeing in every sense of the word. The moment you see, the question of belief disappears.
    If I tell you that I have a gem hidden in the folded palm of my hand, the question of
    belief arises because you do not see it yourself. But if I unclench my fist and show you
    the gem, then you see it for yourself, and the question of belief does not arise. So the
    phrase in ancient Buddhist texts reads:' Realizing, as one sees a gem(or a myrobalan
    fruit) in the palm'.' </font></p>
