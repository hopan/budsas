    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Religion without science is crippled, while science
      without religion is blind.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>oday we live in a scientific age in
    which almost every aspect of our lives has been affected by science. Since the scientific
    revolution during the seventeenth century, science has continued to exert tremendous
    influence on what we think and do. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The<i> impact of science </i>has been particularly strong
    on traditional religious beliefs. Many basic religious concepts are crumbling under the
    pressure of modern science and are no longer acceptable to the intellectual and the
    well-informed man. No longer is it possible to assert truth derived merely through
    theological speculations or based on the authority of religious scriptures in isolation to
    scientific consideration. For example, the findings of modern psychologists indicate that
    the human mind, like the physical body, work according to natural, causal laws without the
    presence of an unchanging soul as taught by some religions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some religionists choose to disregard scientific
    discoveries which conflict with their religious dogmas. Such rigid mental habits are
    indeed a hindrance to human progress. Since the modern man refuses to believe anything
    blindly, even though it had been traditionally accepted, such religionists will only
    succeed in increasing the ranks of non-believers with their faulty theories. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, some religionists have found it
    necessary to accommodate popularly accepted scientific theories by giving new
    interpretations to their religious dogmas. A case in point is Darwin's Theory of
    Evolution. Many religionists maintain that man was directly created by God. Darwin, on the
    other hand, claimed that man had evolved from the ape, a theory which upset the doctrines
    of divine creation and the fall of man. Since all enlightened thinkers have accepted
    Darwin's theory, the theologians today have little choice except to give a new
    interpretation to their doctrines to suit this theory which they had opposed for so long. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the light of modern scientific discoveries, it is not
    difficult to understand that many of the views held in many religions regarding the
    universe and life are merely conventional thoughts of that which have long been
    superseded. It is generally true to say that religions have greatly contributed to human
    development and progress. They have laid down values and standards and formulated
    principles to guide human life. But for al the good they have done, religions can no
    longer survive in the modern, scientific age if the followers insist on imprisoning truth
    into set forms and dogmas, on encouraging ceremonies and practices which have been
    depleted of their original meaning. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Buddhism and Science </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Until the beginning of the last century, Buddhism was
    confined to countries untouched by modern science. Nevertheless, from its very beginning,
    the Teachings of the Buddha were always open to scientific thinking. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One reason why the Teaching can easily be embraced by the
    scientific spirit is that the Buddha never encouraged rigid, dogmatic belief. He did not
    claim to base His Teachings on faith, belief, or divine revelation, but allowed great
    flexibility and freedom of thought. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second reason is that the scientific spirit can be
    found in the Buddha's approach to spiritual Truth. The Buddha's method for discovering and
    testing spiritual Truth is very similar to that of the scientist. A scientist observes the
    external world objectively, and would only establish a scientific theory after conducting
    many successful practical experiments. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Using a similar approach 25 centuries ago, the Buddha
    observed the inner world with detachment, and encouraged His disciples not to accept any
    teaching until they had critically investigated and personally verified its truth. Just as
    the scientist today would not claim that his experiment cannot be duplicated by others,
    the Buddha did not claim that His experience of Enlightenment was exclusive to Him. Thus,
    in His approach to Truth, the Buddha was as analytical as the present day scientist. He
    established a practical, scientifically worked-out method for reaching the Ultimate Truth
    and the experience of Enlightenment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While Buddhism is very much in line with the scientific
    spirit, it is <i>not correct to equate </i>Buddhism with science. It is true that the
    practical applications of science have enabled mankind to live more comfortable lives and
    experience wonderful things undreamed of before. Science has made it possible for man to
    swim better than the fishes, fly higher than the birds, and walk on the moon. Yet the
    sphere of knowledge acceptable to conventional, scientific wisdom is confined to empirical
    evidence. And scientific truth is subject to constant change. Science cannot give man
    control over his mind and neither does it offer moral control and guidance. Despite its
    wonders, science has indeed many limitations not shared by Buddhism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Limitations of Science </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Often one hears so much about science and what it can do,
    and so little about what it cannot do. Scientific knowledge is <i>limited</i>to the data
    received through the sense organs. It does not recognize reality which transcends
    sense-data. Scientific truth is built upon logical observations of sense-data which are
    continually changing. Scientific truth is, therefore, relative truth not intended to stand
    the test of time. And a scientist, being aware of this fact, is always willing to discard
    a theory if it can be replaced by a better one. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Science attempts to understand the outer world and has
    barely scratched the surface of man's inner world. Even the science of psychology has not
    really fathomed the underlying cause of man's mental unrest. When a man is frustrated and
    disgusted with life, and his inner world is filled with disturbances and unrest, science
    today is very much unequipped to help him.. The social sciences which cater for man's
    environment may bring him a certain degree of happiness. But unlike an animal man requires
    more than mere physical comfort and needs help to cope with his frustrations and miseries
    arising from his daily experiences. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today so many people are plagued with fear, restlessness,
    and insecurity. Yet science fails to succor them. Science is unable to teach the common
    man to control his mind when he is driven by the animal nature that burns within him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Can science make man better? If it can, why do violent
    acts and immoral practices abound in countries which are so advanced in science? Isn't it
    fair to say that despite all the scientific progress achieved and the advantages conferred
    on man, science leaves the inner man basically unchanged: it has only heightened man's
    feelings of dependence and insufficiency? In addition to its failure to bring security to
    mankind, science has also made everyone feel even more insecure by threatening the world
    with the possibility of wholesale destruction. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Science is unable to provide a meaningful purpose of life.
    It cannot provide man clear reasons for living. In fact, science is thoroughly secular in
    nature and unconcerned with man's spiritual goal. The materialism inherent in scientific
    thought denies the psyche goals higher than material satisfaction. By its selective
    theorizing and relative truths, science disregards some of the most essential issues and
    leaves many questions unanswered. For instance, when asked why great inequalities exist
    among men, no scientific explanation can be given to such questions which are beyond its
    narrow confines. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Learned Ignorance </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The transcendental mind developed by the Buddha is not
    limited to sense-data and goes beyond the logic trapped within the limitation of relative
    perception. The human intellect, on the contrary, operates on the basis of information it
    collects and stores, whether in the field of religion, philosophy, science or art. The
    information for the mind is gathered through our sense organs which are inferior in so
    many ways. The very limited information perceived makes our understanding of the world
    distorted. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people are proud of the fact that they know so much.
    In fact, the less we know, the more certain we are in our explanations; the more we know,
    the more we realize our limitations. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A brilliant scholar once wrote a book which he considered
    as the ultimate work. He felt that the book contained all literary gems and philosophies.
    Being proud of his achievement, he showed his masterpiece to a colleague of his who was
    equally brilliant with the request that the book be reviewed by him. Instead, his
    colleague asked the author to write down on a piece of paper all he knew and all he did
    not know. The author sat down deep in thought, but after a long while failed write down
    anything he knew. Then he turned his mind to the second question, and again he failed to
    write down anything he did not know. Finally, with his ego at the lowest ebb, he gave up,
    realizing that all that he knew was really ignorance. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In this regard, Socrates, the well-known Athenian
    philosopher of the Ancient World, had this to say when asked what he knew: <i>'I know only
    one thing--thatI do not know.'</i></font> </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Beyond Science </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism goes beyond modern science in its acceptance of a
    wider field of knowledge than is allowed by the scientific mind. Buddhism admits knowledge
    arising from the sense organs as well as personal experiences gained through mental
    culture. By training and developing a highly concentrated mind, religious experience can
    be understood and verified. Religious experience is not something which can be understood
    by conducting experiments in a test-tube or examined under a microscope. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The truth discovered by science is relative and subject to
    changes, while that found by the Buddha is final and absolute: the Truth of Dhamma does
    not change according to time and space. Furthermore, in contrast to the selective
    theorizing of science, the Buddha encouraged the wise not to cling to theories, scientific
    or otherwise. Instead of theorizing, the Buddha taught mankind how to live a righteous
    life so as to discover Ultimate Truth. By living a righteous life, by calming the sense,
    and by casting off desires, the Buddha pointed the way through which we can discover
    within ourselves the nature of life. And the real purpose of life can be found. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Practice </i>is important in Buddhism. A person who
    studies much but does not practise is like one who is able to recite recipes from a huge
    cookery-book without trying to prepare a single dish. His hunger cannot be relieved by
    book knowledge alone. Practice is such an important prerequisite of enlightenment that in
    some schools of Buddhism, such as Zen, practice is put even ahead of knowledge. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The scientific method is outwardly directed, and modern
    scientists exploit nature and the elements for their own comfort, often disregarding the
    need to harmonize with the environment and thereby polluting the world. In contrast,
    Buddhism is inwardly directed and is concerned with the inner development of man. On the
    lower level, Buddhism teaches the individual how to adjust and cope with events and
    circumstances of daily life. At the higher level, it represents the human endeavor to grow
    beyond oneself through the practice of mental culture or mind development. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism has a complete system of mental culture concerned
    with gaining insight into the nature of things which leads to complete self-realization of
    the Ultimate Truth--Nibbana. This system is both practical and scientific, it involves
    dispassionate observation of emotional and mental states. More like a scientist than a
    judge, a meditator observes the inner world with mindfulness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Science Without Religion </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Without having moral ideals, science poses a <i>danger</i>to
    all<i> mankind.</i>Science has made the machine which in turn becomes king. The bullet and
    bomb are gifts of science to the few in power on whom the destiny of the world depends.
    Meanwhile the rest of mankind waits in anguish and fear, not knowing when the nuclear
    weapons, the poisonous gases, the deadly arms--all fruits of scientific research designed
    to kill efficiently--will be used on them. Not only is science completely unable to
    provide moral guidance to mankind, it has also fed fuel to the flame of human craving. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Science devoid of morality spells only destruction: it
    becomes the draconian monster man discovered. And unfortunately, this very monster is
    becoming more powerful than man himself. Unless man learns to restrain and govern the
    monster through the practice of religious morality, the monster will soon overpower him.
    Without religious guidance, science threatens the world with destruction. In contrast,
    science when coupled with a religion like Buddhism can transform this world into a haven
    of peace and security and happiness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Never was there a time when the co-operation between
    science and religion is so desperately needed in the best interest and service of mankind.
    Religion without science is crippled, while science without religion is blind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Tribute to Buddhism </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The wisdom of Buddhism founded on compassion has the vital
    role of correcting the dangerous destination modern science is heading for. Buddhism can
    provide the spiritual leadership to guide scientific research and invention in promoting a
    brilliant culture of the future. Buddhism can provide worthy goals for scientific
    advancement which is presently facing a hopeless impasse of being enslaved by its very
    inventions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Albert Einstein paid a tribute to Buddhism when he
    said in his autobiography: '</font><i>If there is any religion that would cope with modern
    scientific needs, it would be Buddhism'<font>.</font></i> Buddhism requires no revision to
    keep it 'up to date' with recent scientific findings.<font> Buddhism need not surrender
    its views to science because it embraces science as well as goes beyond science. Buddhism
    is the bridge between religious and scientific thoughts by stimulating man to discover the
    latent potentialities within himself and his environment. <i>Buddhism is timeless!</i></font>
