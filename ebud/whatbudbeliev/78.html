    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>This is the Path for leading a religious life without
      going to extremes.</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">A</font>n outstanding aspect of the
    Buddha's Teaching is the adoption of the Eightfold Path is the Middle Path. The Buddha
    advised His followers to follow this Path so as to avoid the extremes of sensual pleasures
    and self-mortification. The Middle Path is a righteous way of life which does not advocate
    the acceptance of decrees given by someone outside oneself. A person practises the Middle
    Path, the guide for moral conduct, not out of fear of any supernatural agency, but out of
    the intrinsic value in following such an action. He chooses this self-imposed discipline
    for a definite end in view: self-purification.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Middle Path is a planned course of inward culture and
    progress. A person can make real progress in righteousness and insight by following this
    Path, and not by engaging in external worship and prayers. According to the Buddha, anyone
    who lives in accordance with the Dhamma will be guided and protected by that very Law.
    When a person lives according to Dhamma, he will also be living in harmony with the
    universal law.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every Buddhist is encouraged to mould his life according
    to the Noble Eightfold Path as taught by the Buddha. He who adjusts his life according to
    this noble way of living will be free from miseries and calamities both in this life-time
    and hereafter. He will also be able to develop his mind by restraining from evil and
    observing morality.</font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Eightfold Path can be compared to a road map.
    Just as a traveler will need a map to lead him to his destination, we all need the
    Eightfold Path which shows us how to attain <i>Nibbana</i>, the final goal of human life.
    To attain the final goal, there are three aspects of the Eightfold path to be developed by
    the devotee. He has to develop Sila (Morality), Samadhi (Mental Culture) and Panna
    (Wisdom). While the three must be developed simultaneously, the intensity with which any
    one area is to be practised varies according to a person's own spiritual development. A
    devotee must first develop his morality, that is, his actions should bring good to other
    living beings. He does this by faithfully adhering to the precepts of abstaining from
    killing, slandering, stealing, becoming intoxicated or being lustful. As he develops his
    morality, his mind will become more easily controlled, enabling him to develop his powers
    of concentration. Finally, with the development of concentration, wisdom will arise.</font></font></p>
    <font SIZE="+1"><p></font><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Gradual Development</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With His infinite wisdom, the Buddha knew that not all
    humans have the same ability to reach spiritual maturity at once. So He expounded the
    Noble Eightfold Path for the gradual development of the spiritual way of life in a
    practical way. He knew that not all people can become perfect in one lifetime. He said
    that Sila, Samadhi, and Panna, must and can be developed over many lifetimes with diligent
    effort. This path finally leads to the attainment of ultimate peace where there is no more
    unsatisfactoriness.</font></p>
    <font SIZE="+1"><p></font><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Righteous Life</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Eightfold path consists of the following eight
    factors:</font></p>

      </tr>
    </table>
    </center></div><p><font face="Times New Roman">What is <i>Right Understanding</i>? It is
    explained as having the knowledge of the Four Noble Truths. In other words, it is the
    understanding of things as they really are. Right Understanding also means that one
    understands the nature of what are <em>wholesome kamma</em><i> (</i>merits) and <em>unwholesome
    kamma</em> (demerits), and how they may be performed with the body, speech and mind. By
    understanding <i>kamma,</i> a person will learn to avoid evil and do good, thereby
    creating favorable outcomes in his life. When a person has Right Understanding, he also
    understands the Three Characteristics of Life (that all compounded things are transient,
    subject to suffering, and without a Self) and understands the Law of Dependent
    Origination. A person with complete Right Understanding is one who is free from ignorance,
    and by the nature of that enlightenment removes the roots of evil from his mind and
    becomes liberated. A lofty aim of a practising Buddhist is to cultivate Wisdom and gain
    Right Understanding about himself, life and all phenomena.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When a person has Right Understanding, he or she develops <i>Right
    Thought</i> as well. This factor is sometimes known as <font>'Right Resolution', 'Right
    Aspirations&quot; and 'Right Ideas'. It refers to the mental state which eliminates wrong
    ideas or notions and promotes the other moral factors to be directed to <i>Nibbana</i>.
    This factor serves a double purpose of eliminating evil thoughts and developing pure
    thoughts. Right Thought is important because it is one's thoughts which either purify or
    defile a person.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are three aspects to Right Thought. First, a person
    should maintaining an attitude of detachment from worldly pleasures rather than being
    selfishly attached to them. He should be selfless in his thoughts and think of the welfare
    of others. Second, he should maintain loving-kindness, goodwill and benevolence in his
    mind, which is opposed to hatred, ill-will or aversion. Third, he should act with thoughts
    of harmlessness or compassion to all beings, which is opposed to cruelty and lack of
    consideration for others. As a person progresses along the spiritual path, his thoughts
    will become increasingly benevolent, harmless, selfless, and filled with love and
    compassion.</font></p>
    <font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">Right Understanding and Right Thought, which
    are Wisdom factors, will lead to good, moral conduct. There are three factors under moral
    conduct: <i>Right Speech, </i>Right Action and Right Livelihood. Right Speech involves
    respect for truth and respect for the welfare for others. It means to avoid lying, to
    avoid backbiting or slander, to avoid harsh speech, and to avoid idle talk. We have often
    underestimated the power of speech and tend to use little control over our speech faculty.
    But we have all been hurt by someone's words at some time of our life, and similarly we
    have been encouraged by the words of another. It is said that a harsh word can wound more
    deeply than weapons, where as a gentle word can change the heart and mind of the most
    hardened criminal. So to develop a harmonious society, we should cultivate and use our
    speech positively. We speak words which are truthful, bring harmony, kind and meaningful.
    The Buddha once said <font>'pleasant speech is sweet as honey, truthful speech is
    beautiful like a flower, and wrong speech is unwholesome like filth'.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next factor under good, moral conduct is <i>Right
    Action</i>. Right Action entails respect for life, respect for property, and respect for
    personal relationships. It corresponds to the first three of the Five Precepts to be
    practised by every Buddhist, that is, dear to all, and all tremble at punishment, all fear
    death and value life. Hence, we should abstain from taking a life which we ourselves
    cannot give and we should not harm other sentient beings. Respect for property means that
    we should not take what is not given, by stealing, cheating, or force. Respect for
    personal relationship means that we should not commit adultery and avoid sexual
    misconducts, which is important for maintaining the love and trust of those we love as
    well as making our society a better place to live in.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Right Livelihood </i>is a factor under moral conduct
    which refers to how we earn our living in society. It is an extension of the two other
    factors of Right Speech and Right Action which refer to the respect for truth, life,
    property and personal relationships.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Livelihood means that we should earn a living
    without violating these principles of a moral conduct. Buddhists are discouraged from
    being engaged in the following five kinds of livelihood: trading in human beings, trading
    in weapons, trading in flesh, trading in intoxicating drinks and drugs, and trading in
    poison. Some people may say that they have to do such a business for their living and,
    therefore, it is not wrong for them to do so. But this argument is entirely baseless. If
    it were valid, then thieves, murderers, gangsters, thugs, smugglers and swindlers can also
    just as easily say that they are also doing such unrighteous acts only for their living
    and, therefore, there is nothing wrong with their way of life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people believe that fishing and hunting animals for
    pleasure and slaughtering animals for food are not against the Buddhist precepts. This is
    another misconception that arises owing to a lack of knowledge in Dhamma. All these are
    not decent actions and bring suffering to other beings. But in all these actions, the one
    who is harmed most of all is the one who performs these unwholesome actions. Maintaining a
    life through wrong means is not in accordance with the Buddha's teaching. The Buddha once
    said, 'Though one should live a hundred years immorally and unrestrained, yet it would
    indeed be better to live one day virtuously and meditatively.' (<i>Dhammapada 103</i>) It
    is better to die as a cultured and respected person than to live as a wicked person.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The remaining three factors of the Noble Eightfold Path
    are factors for the development of wisdom through the purification of the mind. They are
    Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration. These factors, when practised,
    enable a person to strengthen and gain control over the mind, thereby ensuring that his
    actions will continue to be good and that his mind is being prepared to realize the Truth,
    which will open the door to Freedom, to Enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Effort means that we cultivate a positive attitude
    and have enthusiasm in the things we do, whether in our career, in our study, or in our
    practice of the Dhamma. With such a sustained enthusiasm and cheerful determination, we
    can succeed in the things we do. There are four aspects of Right Effort, two of which
    refer to evil and the other two to good. First, is the effort to reject evil that has
    already arisen; and second, the effort to prevent the arising of evil. Third, is the
    effort to develop unarisen good, and fourth, the effort to maintain the good which has
    arisen. By applying Right Effort in our lives, we can reduce and eventually eliminate the
    number of unwholesome mental states and increase and firmly establish wholesome thoughts
    as a natural part of our mind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Right Effort</i> is closely associated with <i>Right
    Mindfulness. </i>The practice of mindfulness is important in Buddhism. The Buddha said
    that mindfulness is the one way to achieve the end of suffering. Mindfulness can be
    developed by being constantly aware of four particular aspects. These are the application
    of mindfulness with regard to the body (body postures, breathing so forth), feelings
    (whether pleasant, unpleasant or neutrally); mind(whether the mind is greedy or not,
    angry, dispersed or deluded or not); and mind objects (whether there are mental hindrances
    to concentration, the Four Noble Truths, and so on). Mindfulness is essential even in our
    daily life in which we act in full awareness of our actions, feelings and thoughts as well
    as that of our environment. The mind should always be clear and attentive rather than
    distracted and clouded.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whereas Right Mindfulness is directing our attention to
    our body, feelings, mind, or mental object or being sensitive to others, in other words,
    putting our attention to where we choose to, Right Concentration is the sustained
    application of that attention on the object without the mind being distracted.
    Concentration is the practice of developing one-pointedness of the mind on one single
    object, either physical or mental. The mind is totally absorbed in the object without
    distractions, wavering, anxiety or drowsiness. Through practice under an experienced
    teacher, Right Concentration brings two benefits. Firstly, it leads to mental and physical
    well-being, comfort, joy, calm, tranquillity. Secondly, it turns the mind into an
    instrument capable of seeing things as they truly are, and prepares the mind to attain
    wisdom.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Noble Eightfold Path is the fourth important truth
    taught by the Buddha. As a competent spiritual physician, the Buddha has identified a
    disease that afflicts all forms of life, and this is Dukkha or unsatisfactoriness. He then
    diagnosed the cause of the unsatisfactoriness to be selfish greed and craving. He
    discovered that there is a cure for the disease, <i>Nibbana</i>, the state where all
    unsatisfactoriness ceases. And the prescription is the Noble Eightfold Path. When a
    competent doctor treats a patient for a serious illness, his prescription is not only for
    physical treatment, but it is also psychological. The Noble Eightfold path, the path
    leading to the end of suffering, is an integrated therapy designed to cure the disease of<i>
    Samsara</i> through the cultivation of moral speech and action, the development of the
    mind, and the complete transformation of one's level of understanding and quality of
    thought. It shows the way to gain spiritual maturity and be released completely from
    suffering.</font></p>
