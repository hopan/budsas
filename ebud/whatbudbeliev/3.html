    <p align="center"><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Founder of
    Buddhism </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font><font size="6">G</font>otama Buddha, the founder of
    what came to be known as Buddhism, lived in Northern India in the 6<sup>th</sup> century
    B.C. His personal name was Siddhartha, and family name Gotama. The name 'Buddha' was given
    to Him after He attained Enlightenment and realized the Truth. It means the 'Awakened' or
    the 'Enlightened One'. He generally called Himself the Tathagata, while His followers
    called Him Bhagava, the Blessed One. Others spoke of Him as Gotama or Sakyamuni.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He was born a prince who seemed to have everything. He had
    a luxurious upbringing and His family was of pure descent on both sides. He was the heir
    to the throne, extremely handsome, inspiring trust, stately and gifted with great beauty
    of complexion and fine presence. At sixteen He married His cousin named Yasodhara who bore
    Him a son whom they called Rahula. His wife was majestic, cheerful day and night, and full
    of dignity and grace. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Despite all this, He felt trapped amidst the luxury
    like a bird in a golden cage. During a visit to the city one day, He saw what is known as
    the 'Four Sights', that is , an old man, a sick man, a dead man, and a holy recluse. When
    He saw the sights, one after another, the realization came to Him that, 'it is subject to
    age and death'. He asked, 'Where is the realm of life in which there is neither age nor
    death?' The sight of the recluse, who was calm for having given up the craving for
    material life, gave him the clue that the first step in His search for Truth was
    Renunciation.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Determined to find the way out of these universal
    sufferings, He decided to leave home to find the cure not for Himself only, but for all
    mankind. One night in His twenty-ninth year, He bade His sleeping wife and son a silent
    farewell, saddled His great white horse, and rode off toward the forest. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His renunciation is unprecedented in history. He left at
    the height of youth, from pleasures to difficulties, from certainty of material security
    to uncertainty, from a position of wealth and power to that of a wandering ascetic who
    took shelter in the cave and forest, with His ragged robe as the only protection against
    the blazing sun, rain and winter winds. He renounced His position, wealth, promise of
    prestige and power, and a life filled with love and hope in exchange for the search for
    Truth which no one had found. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For six long years, He labored to find the Truth. He
    studied under the foremost masters of the day, and learned all these religious teachers
    could teach Him. When He could not find what He was looking for, He joined a band of
    ascetics and tortured His body so as to break its power and crush its interference, since
    it was believed that Truth could be found this way. A man of enormous energy and will
    power, He outdid other ascetics in every austerity they proposed. While fasting, He ate so
    little that when He took hold of the skin of His stomach, He actually touched His spine.
    He pushed Himself to the extent that no man had done and yet lived. He, too, would have
    certainly died had He not realized the futility of self-mortification, and decided to
    practise moderation instead. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the full moon night of the month of Vesakha, He sat
    under the Bodhi tree at Gaya, wrapped in deep meditation. It was then that His mind burst
    the bubble of the universe and realized the true nature of all life and all things. At the
    age of 35 years, He was transformed from an earnest truth seeker into the Buddha, the
    Enlightened One. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For nearly half a century, the Buddha walked on the dusty
    paths of India Teaching the Dhamma so that those who heard and practised could be ennobled
    and free. He founded an order of monks and nuns, challenged the caste system, raised the
    status of women, taught religious freedom and free inquiry, opened the gates of
    deliverance to all, in every condition of life, high or low, saint or sinner, and ennobled
    the lives of criminals like Angulimala and courtesans like Ambapali. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He was towering in wisdom and intellect. Every problem was
    analyzed in component parts and then reassembled in logical order with the meaning made
    clear. None could defeat Him in dialogue. An unequaled teacher, He still is the foremost
    analyst of the mind and phenomena even up to the present day. For the first time in
    history, He gave men the power to think for themselves, raised the worth of mankind, and
    showed that man can reach to the highest knowledge and supreme Enlightenment by his own
    efforts. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Despite His peerless wisdom and royal lineage, He was
    never removed from the simple villager. Surface distinctions of class and caste meant
    little to Him. No one was too little or low for Him to help. Often when an outcast, or
    poor and dejected came to Him, his self-respect was restored and he turned from the
    ignoble life to that of a noble being. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was full of compassion(karuna)and
    wisdom(panna), knowing how and what to teach each individual for his own benefit according
    to his level and capabilities. He was known to have walked long distances to help one
    single person. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>He was affectionate and devoted to His disciples,
    always inquiring after their well-being and progress. When staying at the monastery, He
    paid daily visits to the sick wards. His compassion for the sick can be seen from His
    advice, 'He who attends the sick, attends on me.' The Buddha kept order and discipline on
    the basis of mutual respect. King Pasenadi could not understand how the Buddha maintained
    such order and discipline in the community of monks, when he as a king with the power to
    punish, could not maintain it as well in his court.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha did not claim to have 'created' worldly
    conditions, universal phenomena, or the Universal Law which we call the 'Dhamma'. Although
    described as lokavidu or 'knower of the worlds', He was not regarded as the sole custodian
    of the Universal Laws. He freely acknowledge that the Dhamma, together with the working of
    the cosmos, is timeless, it has no creator and is independent in the absolute sense. Every
    conditioned thing that exists in the cosmos is subject to the operation of Dhamma. What
    the Buddha did (like all the other Buddhas before Him) was to rediscover this infallible
    Truth and make it known to mankind. In discovering the Truth, He also found the means
    whereby one could ultimately free oneself from being subjected to the endless cycle of
    conditioning, with its attendant evils of unsatisfactoriness.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After forty-five years of ministry, the Buddha passed away
    at the age of eighty at kusinara, leaving behind thousands of followers, monks and nuns,
    and a vast treasure store of Dhamma Teaching. The impact of His great love and dedication
    is still felt today. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In the<i> Three Greatest Men in History</i>, H.G.
    Wells states, 'In the Buddha you see clearly a man, simple, devout, lonely, battling for
    light, a vivid universal in character. Many of our best modern ideas are in closest
    harmony with it. All the miseries and discontents of life are due, he taught, to
    selfishness. Before a man can become serene he must cease to live for his senses or
    himself. Then he merges into a greater being. Buddhism in a different language called men
    to self-forgetfulness 500 years before Christ. In some ways he was nearer to us and our
    needs. He was more lucid upon our individual importance in service than Christ and less
    ambiguous upon the question of personal immortality.</font> </font></p>
