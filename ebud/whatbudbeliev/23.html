    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The attainment of Buddhahood is the most difficult task
      that a person can pursue in this world.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he Buddhahood is not reserved only
    for chosen people or for supernatural beings. Anyone can become a Buddha. No founder of
    any other religion ever said that his followers can have the opportunity or potentiality
    to attain the same position as the founder. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>However, attaining Buddhahood is the most difficult
    task a person can pursue in this world. One must work hard by sacrificing one's worldly
    pleasures. One has to develop and purify one's mind from all evil thoughts in order to
    obtain this Enlightenment. It will take innumerable births for a person to purify himself
    and to develop his mind in order to become a Buddha. Long periods of great effort are
    necessary in order to complete the high qualification of this self-training. The course of
    this self-training which culminates in Buddhahood, includes self-discipline,
    self-restraint, superhuman effort, firm determination, and willingness to undergo any kind
    of suffering for the sake of other living beings who are suffering in this world.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This clearly shows that the Buddha did not obtain this
    supreme Enlightenment by simply praying, worshipping, or making offerings to some
    supernatural beings. He attained Buddhahood by the purification of His mind and heart. He
    gained Supreme Enlightenment without the influence of any external, supernatural forces
    but by the development of His own insight. Thus only a man who has firm determination and
    courage to overcome all hindrance, weaknesses and selfish desires can attain Buddhahood. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Prince Siddhartha did not attain Buddhahood overnight
    simply by sitting under the Bodhi tree. No supernatural being appeared and revealed
    anything by whispering into His ear while He was in deep meditation under the Bodhi tree.
    Behind His Supreme Enlightenment there was a long history of previous births. Many of the
    Jataka stories tell us how He worked hard by sacrificing His life in many previous births
    to attain His Supreme Buddhahood. No one can attain Buddhahood without devoting many
    lifetimes practising the ten perfections explains why a Supreme Buddha appears only at
    every long intervals of time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Therefore, the Buddha's advice to His followers is
    that in order to find their salvation it is not necessary for each and every person to
    wait until he gains his Buddhahood. Aspirants can also find their salvation by becoming
    Pacceka Buddha (Silent Buddha) or Arahantas - (saints). Pacceka Buddhas appear in this
    world during the period when there is no other Enlightened Buddha. They are also
    Enlightened. Although their degree of perfection is not similar to that of the Supreme
    Buddha, they experience the same Nibbanic bliss. Unlike the Supreme Buddha, they do not
    preach to the masses. They lead a life of solitude.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Arahantas can also experience the same Nibbanic bliss as
    the Buddhas do. There is no discrimination or status in Nibbana. The only difference is
    that Arahantas do not have the Supreme Enlightenment to be able to enlighten others in the
    same way as the Buddhas do. Arahantas have overcome all their desires and other human
    weaknesses. They can appreciate the Dhamma which was discovered and taught by the Buddha.
    They can also show others the correct Buddhist way of life and the Path to salvation. </font></p>
