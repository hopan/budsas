      It does not grant any special favours on request.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Man is not a fallen creature who begs for his needs as he
    awaits mercy. According to Buddhism, man is a potential master of himself. Only because of
    his deep ignorance does man fail to realize his full potential. Since the Buddha has shown
    this hidden power, man must cultivate his mind and try to develop it by realizing his
    innate ability. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism gives full responsibility and dignity to man. It
    makes man his own master. According to Buddhism, no higher being sits in judgment over his
    affairs and destiny. That is to say, our life, our society, our world, is what you and I
    want to make out of it, and not what some other unknown being wants it to be. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Remember that nature is impartial; it cannot be
    flattered by prayers. Nature does not grant any special favours on request. Thus in
    Buddhism, prayer is meditation which has self-change as its object. Prayer in meditation
    is the reconditioning of one's nature. It is the transforming of one's inner nature
    accomplished by the purification of the three faculties?thought, word, and deed. Through
    meditation, we can understand that 'we become what we think', in accordance with the
    discoveries of psychology. When we pray, we experience some relief in our minds; that is,
    the psychological effect that we have created through our faith and devotion. After
    reciting certain verses we also experience the same result. Religious names or symbols are
    important to the extent that they help to develop devotion and confidence.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha Himself has clearly expressed that neither the
    recital of holy scriptures, nor self-torture, nor sleeping on the ground, nor the
    repetition of prayers, penance, hymns, charms, mantras, incantations and invocations can
    bring the real happiness of <i>Nibbana</i>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Regarding the use of prayers for attaining the final goal,
    the Buddha once made an analogy of a man who wants to cross a river. If he sits down and
    prays imploring that the far bank of the river will come to him and carry him across, then
    his prayer will not be answered. If he really wants to cross the river, he must makes some
    effort; he must find some logs and build a raft, or look for a bridge or construct a boat
    or perhaps swim. Somehow he must work to get across the river. Likewise, if he wants to
    cross the river of Samsara, prayers alone are not enough. He must work hard by living a
    religious life, by controlling his passion, calming his mind, and by getting rid of all
    the impurities and defilements in his mind. Only then can he reach the final goal. Prayer
    alone will never take him to the final goal. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If prayer is necessary, it should be to strengthen the
    mind and not to beg for gains. The following prayer of a well-known poet, teaches us how
    to pray, Buddhists will regard this as meditation to cultivate the mind: </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>'Let me not pray to be sheltered from
    danger,</i> <br>
    <i>but to be fearless in facing them.</i> <br>
    <i>Let me not beg for the stilling of my pain,</i> <br>
    <i>but for the heart to conquer it.</i> <br>
    <i>Let me not crave in anxious fear to be saved,</i> <br>
    <i>but for the patience to win my freedom.'</i> </font></p>
