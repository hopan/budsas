    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The Dhamma realized by the Buddha was unheard before.</i>
      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he Buddha said in His first sermon,
    the Dhammacakka Sutta, that the Dhamma which He preached was unheard of before. Knowledge
    of the Dhamma which arose was clear to His vision, to His knowledge, to His wisdom, to His
    penetration, and to His Enlightenment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Some people claim that the Buddha did not preach a
    new doctrine but merely reformed the old teaching which was existing in India. However,
    the Buddha was no mere reformer of Hinduism as some protagonists of this ancient creed
    make Him out to be. The Buddha's way of life and doctrine were substantially different
    from the way of life and the religious beliefs people had in India. The Buddha lived,
    taught and died as a non-Vedic and non-Brahmanic religious Teacher. Nowhere did the Buddha
    acknowledge His indebtedness to the existing religious beliefs and practices. The Buddha
    considered Himself as initiating a rational religious method, as opening a new path. In
    fact He had revolutionized the religious way of life in a dignified manner.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>That was the main reason why many other religious
    groups could not agree with Him. He was condemned, criticized and insulted by the most
    noted teachers and sects of the Vedic-Brahmanic tradition. It was with the intention of
    destroying or absorbing the Buddha and His Teaching, that the Brahmans of the
    pre-Christian era went so far as to accept the Buddha as an <i>Avatara</i> or incarnation
    of their God. Yet some others despised Him as a<i> vasalaka,</i> a <i>mundaka</i>, a <i>samanaka,</i>
    a <i>nastika</i> and <i>sudra.</i> (These words were used in India during the Buddha's
    time to insult a religious man).</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no doubt that the Buddha reformed certain
    customs, religious duties, rites and ethics and ways of living. The greatness of His
    character was like a pin-point that pricked the balloon of false beliefs and practices so
    that they could burst and reveal their emptiness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But as far as the fundamental, philosophical and
    psychological teachings are concerned, it is groundless to say that the Buddha had copied
    ideas from any existing religion at that time. For instance, the idea of the Four Noble
    Truths, the Eightfold Path and Nibbana, were not known before His coming. Although the
    belief in kamma and rebirth was very common, the Buddha gave quite logical and reasonable
    explanations to this belief and introduced it as natural law of cause and effect. Despite
    all these the Buddha did not ridicule any sincere existing religious belief or practice.
    He appreciated the value in many where he found Truth and he even gave a better
    explanation of their beliefs. That is why He once said that the Truth must be respected
    wherever it is. However, He was never afraid to speak out against hypocrisy and falsehood.
