    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Paritta chanting is the recital of some of the Sutras
      uttered by the Buddha in the Pali language for the blessing and protection of the
      devotees.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">P</font>aritta Chanting or Sutra Chanting
    is a well-known Buddhist practice conducted all over the world, especially in Theravada
    Buddhist countries where the Pali language is used for recitals. Many of these are
    important sutras from the basic teachings of the Buddha which were selected by His
    disciples. Originally, these sutras were recorded on <i>ola</i> leaves about two thousand
    years ago. Later, they were compiled into a book known as the 'Paritta Chanting Book'. The
    names of the original books from which these sutras were selected are the <i>Anguttara
    Nikaya, Majjhima Nikaya, Digha Nikaya, Samyutta Nikaya </i>and<i> Kuddaka Nikaya in the
    Sutra Pitaka.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The sutras that Buddhists recite for protection are
    known as Paritta Chanting. Here 'protection' means shielding ourselves from various forms
    of evil spirits, misfortune, sickness and influence of the planetary systems as well as
    instilling confidence in the mind. The vibrant sound of the chanting creates a very
    pleasing atmosphere in the vicinity. The rhythm of the chanting is also important. One
    might have noticed that when monks recite these sutras, different intonations are adopted
    to harmonize with different sutras intended for different quarters. It was found very
    early during man's spiritual development that certain rhythms of the human voice could
    produce significant psychological states of peacefulness and serenity in the minds of
    ardent listeners. Furthermore, intonation at certain levels would appeal to devas, whilst
    certain rhythms would created a good influence over lower beings like animals, snakes, or
    even spirits or ghosts. Therefore, a soothing and correct rhythm is an important aspect of
    Paritta Chanting.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The use of these rhythms is not confined to Buddhism
    alone. In every religion, when the followers recite their prayers by using the holy books,
    they follow certain rhythms. We can observe this when we listen to Quran reading by
    Muslims and the Veda Mantra Chanting by Hindu priests in the Sanskrit language. Some
    lovely chanting is also carried out by certain Christian groups, especially the Roman
    Catholic and Greek orthodox sects. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>When the sutras are chanted, three great and
    powerful forces are activated. These are the forces of the Buddha, Dhamma and the Sangha.
    Buddhism is the combination of these 'Three Jewels' and when invoked together they can
    bring great blessing to mankin</font>d:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font><p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Buddha.</strong> He had cultivated all
      the great virtues, wisdom and enlightenment, developed His spiritual power and gave us His
      noble Teachings. Even though the physical presence of the Teacher is no more with us, His
      Teachings have remained for the benefit of mankind. Similarly, the man who discovered
      electricity is no more with us, yet by using his knowledge, the effect of his wisdom still
      remains. The illumination that we enjoy today is the result of his wisdom. The scientists
      who discovered atomic energy are no longer living, but the knowledge to use it remains
      with us. Likewise the Noble Teachings given us through the Buddha's wisdom and
      enlightenment, are a most effective power for people to draw inspiration from. When you
      remember Him and respect Him, you develop confidence in Him. When you recite or listen to
      the words uttered by Him, you invoke the power of His blessings.</font></font></p>
      <font><p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Dhamma.</strong> It is the power of
      truth, justice and peace discovered by the Buddha which provides spiritual solace for
      devotees to maintain peace and happiness. When you develop your compassion, devotion and
      understanding, this power of the Dhamma protects you and helps you to develop more
      confidence and strength in your mind. Then your mind itself becomes a very powerful force
      for your own protection. When it is known that you uphold the Dhamma, people and other
      beings will respect you. The power of the Dhamma protects you from various kinds of bad
      influence and evil forces. Those who cannot understand the power of the Dhamma and how to
      live in accordance with the Dhamma, invariably surrender themselves to all forms of
      superstitious beliefs and subject themselves to the influence of many kinds of gods,
      spirits and mystical powers which require them to perform odd rites and rituals. By so
      doing, they only develop more fear and suspicion born out of ignorance. Large sums of
      money are spent on such practices and this could be easily avoided if people were to
      develop their confidence in the Dhamma. Dhamma is also described as 'nature' or 'natural
      phenomena' and 'cosmic law'. Those who have learnt the nature of these forces can protect
      themselves through the Dhamma. When the mind is calmed through perfect knowledge
      disturbances cannot create fear in the mind.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Sangha.</strong> It refers to the holy order
      of monks who have renounced their worldly life for their spiritual development. They are
      considered as disciples of the Buddha, who have cultivated great virtues to attain
      sainthood or Arahantahood. We pay respect to the Sangha community as the custodians of the
      Buddha Sasana or those who had protected and introduced the Dhamma to the world over the
      last 2,500 years. The services rendered by the Sangha community has guided mankind to lead
      a righteous and noble life. They are the living link with the Enlightened One who bring
      His message to us through the recital of the words uttered by Him.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">The chanting of sutras for blessing was
    started during the Buddha's time. Later, in certain Buddhist countries such as Sri Lanka,
    Thailand and Burma, this practice was developed further by organizing prolonged chanting
    for one whole night or for several days. With great devotion, devotees participated in the
    chanting sessions by listening attentively and intelligently. There were some occasions
    when the Buddha and His disciples chanted sutras to bring spiritual solace to people
    suffering from epidemics, famines, sickness and other natural disasters. On once occasion,
    when a child was reported to be affected by some evil influence, the Buddha instructed His
    monks to recite sutras to give protection to the child from the evil forces. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The blessing service, by way of chanting, was effective.
    Of course, there were instances when the sutra chanting could not be effective if the
    victims had committed some strong bad kamma. Nevertheless, certain minor bad kammic
    effects can be overcome by the vibrant power combined with the great virtues and
    compassion of those holy people who chant these sutras. Here, the overcoming of a bad
    kammic effect does not mean the complete eradication of the effect, but only a temporary
    suspension of such an effect. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Devotees who were tired fatigued have experienced relief
    and calmness after listening to the chanting of sutras. Such an experience is different
    from that provided by music because music can create excitement in our mind and pander to
    our emotions but does not create spiritual devotion and confidence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>For the last 2,500 years, Buddhist devotees have
    experienced the good effects of sutra chanting. We should try to understand how and why
    the words uttered by the Buddha for blessing purposes could be so effective even after His
    passing away. It is mentioned in the Buddha's teaching that ever since he had the
    aspiration to become a Buddha during His previous births, He had strongly upheld one
    particular principle, namely, to abstain from 'telling lies'. Without abusing or misusing
    His words, He spoke gently without hurting the feelings of others. The power of Truth has
    become a source of strength in the words uttered by the Buddha with great compassion.
    However, the power of the Buddha's word alone is not enough to secure blessing without the
    devotion and understanding of the devotees.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The miraculous effect experienced by many people in
    ridding themselves of their sickness and many other mental disturbances through the medium
    of the Buddhist sutras, enabled them to develop their faith and confidence in this form of
    religious service. </font></p>
