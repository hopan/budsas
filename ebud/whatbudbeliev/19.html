    Through Arahantahood </font></h2>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Attaining Nibbana through Arahantahood
    is not selfish.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">C</font>ertain Buddhists believe to seek
    salvation by becoming an Arahant is a selfish motive; because everyone, they claim, must
    try to become a Buddha in order to save others. This particular belief has absolutely no
    ground in the Teaching of the Buddha. The Buddha never mentioned that He wanted to save
    every living being in this whole universe. He offered His help only to those who were
    spiritually matured and willing to accept His Noble Way of Life. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">'The doors to the deathless are open!<br>
      Let those who will hear leave wrong doctrine<br>
      <font>'</font>Now shall I turn the Wheel of the Great Law,<br>
      For this I go to the Kasian city.<br>
      There shall I beat the drum of deathlessness<br>
      In this world that is groping in the dark.<font>'<br>
      </font>(<i>Ariya pariyesana Sutta - Majjhima Nikaya</i>).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The belief that everyone must strive to become a Buddha in
    order to attain salvation cannot be found in the original Teachings of the Buddha. This
    belief is just like asking every person to become a doctor in order to cure other people
    and himself of diseases. This advice is most impractical. If people want to cure
    themselves of their sicknesses they can get medical advice from a qualified doctor. This
    they can do without waiting until they are all doctors before curing themselves. Nor is
    there any need for each and every person to be a doctor. If everyone becomes a doctor, who
    are going to be their patients? In the same way if everyone is going to become Buddhas,
    who is going to save whom? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, those who wish to become doctors can do so. But
    they must have intelligence, courage and the means to study medicine. Likewise, it is not
    compulsory for everyone to become a Buddha to find his salvation. Those who wish to become
    Buddhas can do so. However, they need the courage and knowledge to sacrifice their
    comforts and practice all kinds of renunciations in order to attain Buddhahood. Others can
    be content to be healthy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To attain Arahantahood, one has to eradicate all greed and
    selfishness. This implies that while relating with others, an Arahant will act with
    compassion and try to inspire others to go on the Path leading to Liberation. He is the
    living proof of the good results that accrue to a person who follows the method taught by
    the Buddha. The attainment of Nibbana is not possible if one acts with a selfish motive.
    Therefore, it is baseless to say that striving to become an Arahant is a selfish act. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhahood is indisputably the best and the noblest of all
    the three ideals (Supreme Buddha, Silent Buddha and Arahant). But not everyone is capable
    of achieving this highest ideal. Surely all scientists cannot be Einsteins and Newtons.
    There must be room for lesser scientists who nevertheless help the world according to
    their capabilities. </font></p>
