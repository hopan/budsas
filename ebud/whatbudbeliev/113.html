    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>It is rather difficult for us to understand how the
      world came into existence without a first cause. But it is very much more difficult to
      understand how that first cause came into existence at the beginning.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font><font size="6">A</font>ccording to the Buddha, it is
    inconceivable to find a first cause for life or anything else. For in common experience,
    the cause becomes the effect and the effect becomes the cause. In the circle of cause and
    effect, a first cause is incomprehensible. With regard to the origin of life, the Buddha
    declares, 'Without cognizable end is this recurrent wandering in Samsara(cycle of birth
    and death). Beings are obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving. A first beginning
    of these beings is not to be perceived. (<i>Anamatagga Samyutta </i>in<i> Samyutta Nikaya)</i>.
    This life-steam flows on <i>ad infinitum</i>, as long as it is fed by the muddy waters of
    ignorance and craving. When these two are cut off, only then does the life-steam cease to
    flow, only then does rebirth come to an end.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is difficult to conceive an end of space. It is
    difficult to conceive an eternal duration of what we call time. But it is more difficult
    for us to understand how this world came into existence with a first cause. And it is more
    difficult to understand how that first cause came into existence at the beginning. For if
    the first cause can exist though uncreated, there is no reason why the other phenomena of
    the universe must not exist without having also been created. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As to the question how all beings came into existence
    without a first cause, the Buddhist<font>'s reply is that there is no answer because the
    question itself is merely a product of man's limited comprehension. If we can understand
    the nature of time and relativity, we must see that there could not have been any
    beginning. It can only be pointed out that all the usual answers to the question are
    fundamentally defective. If it is assumed that for a thing to exist, it must have had a
    creator who existed before it, it follows logically that the creator himself must have had
    a creator, and so on back to infinity. On the other hand, if the creator could exist
    without a prior cause in the form of another creator, the whole argument falls to the
    ground. The theory of a creator does not solve any problems, it only complicates the
    existing ones.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus Buddhism does not pay much attention to theories and
    beliefs about the origin of the world. Whether the world was created by a god or it came
    into existence by itself makes little difference to Buddhist. Whether the world is finite
    or infinite also makes little difference to Buddhists. Instead of following this line of
    theoretical speculations, the Buddha advises people to work hard to find their own
    salvation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Scientists have discovered many causes which are
    responsible for the existence of life, plants, planets, elements and other energies. But
    it is impossible for anyone to find out any particular first cause for their existence. If
    they go on searching for the first cause of any existing life or thing, they point certain
    causes as the main cause but that never becomes the first cause. In the process of
    searching for the first cause one after the other, they will come back to the place where
    they were. This is because, cause becomes the effect and the next moment that effect
    becomes the cause to produce another effect. That is what the Buddha say, 'It is
    incomprehensible and the universe is beginningless.'</font> </font></p>
