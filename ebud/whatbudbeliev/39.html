      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <em><font>'When I am gone, my Teaching shall be your Master and Guide.'</font> </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font><font size="6">T</font>hree months before His
    passing away the Buddha addressed His disciples and said: 'I have delivered sermons to you
    during these forty-five years. You must learn them well and treasure them. You must
    practise them and teach them to others. This will be of great use for the welfare of the
    living and for the welfare of those who come after you'.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'My years are now full ripe; the life span left is
    short. I will soon have to leave you. You must be earnest. O monks, be mindful and of pure
    virtue! Whoever untiringly pursues the Teaching, will go beyond the cycle of birth and
    death and will man an end of Suffering.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>When Ananda asked the Buddha what would become of
    the Order after He pass away, the Buddha replied, 'What does the Order expect of me,
    Ananda? I have preached the Truth without any distinction; for in regard to the Truth,
    there is no clenched hand in the Teachings of the Buddha°&#130;. It may be, Ananda, that
    to some among you, the thought will come 'The Master's words will soon end; soon we will
    no longer have a master.' But do not think like this, Ananda. When I am gone, my Teaching
    and the disciplinary code shall be your Master.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha further explained: 'If there is anyone
    who thinks, 'It is I who will lead the brotherhood', or 'The Order is dependent on me, it
    is I who should give instructions', the Buddha does not think that He should lead the
    order or that the Order is dependent on Him. I have reached the end of my days. Just as a
    worn-out cart can only be made to move with much additional care, so my body can be kept
    going only with much additional care. Therefore, Ananda, be a lamp and refuge unto
    yourselves. Look for no other refuge. Let the Truth be your lamp and your refuge. Seek no
    refuge elsewhere.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the age of eighty, on His birthday, He passed away
    without showing any worldly supernatural powers. He showed the real nature of component
    things even in His own life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>When the Buddha passed away into Nibbana, one of His
    disciples remarked, 'All must depart---all beings that have life must shed their
    compounded forms. Yes, even a Master such as He, a peerless being, powerful in Wisdom and
    Enlightenment, even He must pass away.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The parting words of the Buddha: </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><font>'Appamadena Sampadetha Vaya
    Dhamma Sankhara'.</font> <br>
    <em><font>'Work diligently. Component things are impermanent.'</font> </em></strong></font></p>
