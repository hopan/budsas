    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>In Buddhism, actions are merely termed as unskillful or
      unwholesome, not as sinful.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">B</font><font face="Times New Roman">uddhists do
    not regard man as sinful by nature of 'in rebellion against god'. Every human being is a
    person of great worth who has within himself a vast store of good as well as evil habits.
    The good in a person is always waiting for a suitable opportunity to flower and to ripen.
    Remember the saying, 'There is so much that is good in the worst of us and so much that is
    bad in the best of us.' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Buddhism teaches that everyone is responsible for
    his own good and bad deeds, and that each individual can mould his own destiny. Says the
    Buddha, 'These evil deeds were only done by you, not by your parents, friends, or
    relatives; and you yourself will reap the painful results.' (<i>Dhammapada 165</i>)</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Man<font>'s sorrow is his own making and is not handed
    down by a family curse or an original sin of a mythical primeval ancestor. Buddhists do
    not accept the belief that this world is merely a place of trial and testing. This world
    can be made a place where we can attain the highest perfection. And perfection is
    synonymous with happiness. To the Buddha, man is not an experiment in life created by
    somebody which can be done away with when unwanted. If a sin could be forgiven, people
    might take advantage and commit more and more sins. The Buddhist has no reason to believe
    that the sinner can escape the consequences by the grace of an external power. If a man
    thrusts his hand into a furnace, his hand will be burnt, and all the prayer in the world
    will not remove the scars. The same is with the man who walks into the fires of evil
    action. The Buddha's approach to the problems of suffering is not imaginary, speculative
    or metaphysical, but essentially empirical.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism, there is no such thing as sin as
    explained by other religions. To the Buddhists, sin is unskillful or unwholesome action - <i>Akusala
    Kamma, </i>which creates <i>Papa</i> - the downfall of man. The wicked man is an ignorant
    man. He needs instruction more than he needs punishment and condemnation. He is not
    regarded as violating god's will or as a person who must beg for divine mercy and
    forgiveness. He needs only guidance for his enlightenment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All that is necessary is for someone to help him use his
    reason to realize that he is responsible for his wrong action and that he must pay for the
    consequences. Therefore the belief in confession is foreign to Buddhism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The purpose of the Buddha's appearance in this world is
    not to wash away the sins committed by human beings nor to punish or to destroy the wicked
    people, but to make the people understand how foolish it is to commit evil and to point
    out the reaction of such evil deeds. Consequently there are no commandments in Buddhism,
    since no one can command another for his spiritual upliftment. The Buddha has encouraged
    us to develop and use our understanding. He has shown us the path for our liberation from
    suffering. The precepts that we undertake to observe are not commandments: they are
    observed voluntarily. The Buddha's Teaching is thus: 'Please pay attention; take this
    advice and think it over. If you think it is suitable for you to practise my advice, then
    try to practise it. You can see the results through your own experience.' There is no
    religious value in blindly observing any commandment without proper conviction and
    understanding. However, we should not take advantage of the liberty given by the Buddha to
    do anything we like. It is our duty to behave as cultured, civilized and understanding
    human beings to lead a religious life. If we can understand this, commandments are not
    important. As an enlightened teacher, the Buddha advised us on how to lead a pure life
    without imposing commandments and using the fear of punishment. </font></p>
