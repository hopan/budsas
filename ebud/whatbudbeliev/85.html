    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>What exists is changeable and what is not changeable
      does not exist.</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">L</font>ooking at life, we notice how it
    changes and how it continually moves between extremes and contrasts. We notice rise and
    fall, success and failure, loss and gain; we experience honor and contempt, praise and
    blame; and we feel how our hearts respond to all that happiness and sorrow, delight and
    despair, disappointment and satisfaction, fear and hope. These mighty waves of emotion
    carry us up, fling us down, and no sooner we find some rest, then we are carried by the
    power of a new wave again. How can we expect a footing on the crest of the waves? Where
    shall we erect the building of our life in the midst of this ever-restless ocean of
    existence?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a world where any little joy that is allotted to
    beings is secured only after many disappointments, failures and defeats. This is a world
    where scanty joy grows amidst sickness, desperation and death. This is a world where
    beings who a short while ago were connected with us by sympathetic joy are at the next
    moment in want of our compassion. Such a world as this needs equanimity. This is the
    nature of the world where we live with our intimate friends and the next day they become
    our enemies to harm us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha described the world as an unending flux of
    becoming. All is changeable, continuous transformation, ceaseless mutation, and a moving
    stream. Everything exists from moment to moment. Everything is a recurring rotation of
    coming into being and then passing out of existence. Everything is moving from birth to
    death. The matter or material forms in which life does or does not express itself, are
    also a continuous movement or change towards decay. This teaching of the impermanent
    nature of everything is one of the main pivots of Buddhism. Nothing on earth partakes of
    the character of absolute reality. That there will be no death of what is born is
    impossible. Whatever is subject to origination is subject also to destruction. Change is
    the very constituent of reality.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In accepting the law of impermanence or change, the Buddha
    denies the existence of eternal substance. Matter and spirit are false abstractions that,
    in reality, are only changing factors (<i>Dhamma</i>) which are connected and which arise
    in functional dependence on each other.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today, scientists have accepted the law of change that was
    discovered by the Buddha. Scientists postulate that there is nothing substantial, solid
    and tangible in the world. Everything is a vortex of energy, never remaining the same for
    two consecutive moments. The whole wide world is caught up in this whirl and vortex of
    change. One of the theories postulated by scientists is the prospect of the ultimate
    coldness following upon the death or destruction of the sun. Buddhists are not dismayed by
    this prospect. The Buddha taught that universes or world cycles arise and pass away in
    endless succession, just as the lives of individuals do. Our world will most certainly
    come to an end. It has happened before with previous worlds and it will happen again.</font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">'The world is a passing phenomenon. We all belong to
    the world of time. Every written word, every carved stone, every painted picture, the
    structure of civilization, every generation of man, vanishes away like the leaves and
    flowers of forgotten summers. What exists is changeable and what is not changeable does
    not exist.'</font></font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus all gods and human beings and animals and
    material forms -- everything in this universe -- is subject to the law of impermanence.
    Buddhism teaches us:</font></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">'The body like a lump of foam;<br>
      The feelings like a water bubble;<br>
      Perception like a mirage;<br>
      Volitional activities like a plantain tree;<br>
      And Consciousness like jugglery.<font>' (<i>Samyutta Nikaya</i>)</font></font></p>
