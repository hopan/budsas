    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Buddhists are not idol worshippers but ideal
      worshippers.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">A</font><font face="Times New Roman">lthough it
    is customary amongst Buddhists to keep Buddha images and to pay their respects to the
    Buddha, Buddhists are not idol worshippers. Idolatry generally means erecting images of
    unknown gods and goddesses in various shapes and sizes and to pray directly to these
    images. The prayers are a request to the gods for guidance and protection. The gods and
    goddesses are asked to bestow health, wealth, property and to provide for various needs;
    they are asked to forgive transgressions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The 'worshipping' at the Buddha image is quite a different
    matter. Buddhists revere the image of the Buddha as a gesture to the greatest, wisest,
    most benevolent, compassionate and holy man who has ever lived in this world. It is a
    historical fact that this great man actually lived in this world and has done a great
    service to mankind. The worship of the Buddha really means paying homage, veneration and
    devotion to Him and what He represents, and not to the stone or metal figure. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The image is a visual aid that helps one to recall the
    Buddha in the mind and to remember His great qualities which inspired millions of people
    from generation to generation throughout the civilized world. Buddhists use the statue as
    a symbol and as an object of concentration to gain a peace of mind. When Buddhists look
    upon the image of the Buddha, they put aside thoughts of strife and think only of peace,
    serenity, calmness and tranquillity. The statue enables the mind to recall this great man
    and inspires devotees to follow His example and instructions. In their mind, the devout
    Buddhists feel the living presence of the Master. This feeling makes their act of worship
    become vivid and significant. The serenity of the Buddha image influences and inspires
    them to observe the right path of conduct and thought. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>An understanding Buddhist never asks favours from
    the image nor does he request forgiveness for evil deeds committed. An understanding
    Buddhist tries to control his mind, to follow the Buddha's advice, to get rid of worldly
    miseries and to find his salvation.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Those who criticize Buddhists for practising idol
    worship are really misinterpreting what Buddhists do. If people can keep the photographs
    of their parents and grandparents to cherish in their memory, if people can keep the
    photographs of kings, queens, prime ministers, great heroes, philosophers, and poets,
    there is certainly no reason why Buddhists cannot keep their beloved Master's picture or
    image to remember and respect Him.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What harm is there if people recite some verses praising
    the great qualities of their Master? If people can lay wreaths on the graves of beloved
    ones to express their gratitude, what harm is there is Buddhists too offer some flowers,
    joss-sticks, incense, etc., to their beloved Teacher who devoted His life to help
    suffering humanity? People make statues of certain conquering heroes who were in fact
    murderers and who were responsible for the death of millions of innocent people. For the
    sake of power, these conquerors committed murder with hatred, cruelty and greed. They
    invaded poor countries and created untold suffering by taking away lands and properties of
    others, and causing much destruction. Many of these conquerors are regarded as national
    heroes; memorial services are conducted for them and flowers are offered on their graves
    and tombs. What is wrong then, if Buddhists pay their respects to their world honored
    Teacher who sacrificed His worldly pleasures for the sake of Enlightenment to show others
    the Path of Salvation? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Images are the language of the subconscious.
    Therefore, the image of the Enlightened One is often created within one's mind as the
    embodiment of perfection, the image will deeply penetrate into the subconscious mind and
    (if it is sufficiently strong enough)can act as an </font>automatic brake against
    impulses. The recollection of the Buddha produces joy, invigorate the mind and elevates
    man from states of restlessness, tension and frustration. Thus the worship of the Buddha
    is not a prayer in its usual sense but a meditation. Therefore, it is not idol worship,
    but 'ideal' worship. Thus Buddhists can find fresh strength to build a shrine of their
    lives. They cleanse their hearts until they feel worthy to bear the image in their
    innermost shrine. Buddhists pay respects to the great person who is represented by the
    image. They try to gain inspiration from His Noble personality and emulate Him. Buddhists
    do not see the Buddha image as a dead idol of wood or metal or clay. The image represents
    something vibrant to those who understand and are purified in thought, word and deed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha images are nothing more than symbolic
    representations of His great qualities. It is not unnatural that the deep respect for the
    Buddha should be expressed in some of the finest and most beautiful forms of art and
    sculpture the world has ever known. It is difficult to understand why some people look
    down on those who pay respect to images which represent holy religious teachers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The calm and serene image of the Buddha has been a
    common concept of ideal beauty. The Buddha's image is the most precious, common asset of
    Asian cultures. Without the image of the Buddha, where can we find a serene, radiant and
    spiritually emancipated personality?</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the image of the Buddha is appreciated not only by
    Asian or Buddhists. Anatole France in his autobiography writes, 'On the first of May,
    1890, chance led me to visit the Museum in Paris. There standing in the silence and
    simplicity of the gods of Asia, my eyes fell on the statue of the Buddha who beckoned to
    suffering humanity to develop understanding and compassion. If ever a god walked on this
    earth, I felt here was He. I felt like kneeling down to Him and praying to Him as to a
    God. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Once a general left an image of the Buddha as a
    legacy to Winston Churchill. The general said, 'if ever your mind gets perturbed and
    perplexed, I want you to see this image and be comforted.' What is it that makes the
    message of the Buddha so attractive to people who have cultivated their intellect? Perhaps
    the answer can be seen in the serenity of the image of the Buddha.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not only in color and line did men express their faith in
    the Buddha and the graciousness of His Teaching. Human hands wrought in metal and stone to
    produce the Buddha image that is one of the greatest creations of the human genius.
    Witness the famous image in the<i> Abhayagiri Vihara </i>in Sri Lanka, or the Buddha image
    of Sarnath or the celebrated images of <i>Borobudur</i>. The eyes are full of compassion
    and the hands express fearlessness, or goodwill and blessings, or they unravel some thread
    of thought or call the earth to witness His great search for Truth. Wherever the Dhamma
    went, the image of the great Teacher went with it, not only as an object of worship but
    also as an object of meditation and reverence. 'I known nothing,'says Keyserling,' more
    grand in this world than the figure of the Buddha. It is an absolutely perfect embodiment
    of spirituality in the visible domain.' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>A life so beautiful, a heart so pure and kind, a
    mind so deep and enlightened, a personality so inspiring and selfless -- such a perfect
    life, such a compassionate heart, such a calm mind, such a serene personality is really
    worthy of respect, worthy of honour and worthy of offering. The Buddha is the highest
    perfection of mankind.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha image is the symbol, not of a person, but
    of Buddhahood -- that to which all men can attain though few do. For Buddhahood is not for
    one but for many: 'The Buddhas of the past ages, the Buddhas that are yet to come, the
    Buddha of the present age; humbly I each day adore.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, it is not compulsory for every Buddhist to have a
    Buddha image to practise Buddhism. Those who can control their mind and the senses, can
    certainly do so without an image as an object. If Buddhists truly wish to behold the
    Buddha in all the majestic splendor and beauty of His ideal presence, they must translate
    His Teachings into practice in their daily lives. It is in the practice of His Teachings
    that they can come closer to Him and feel the wonderful radiance of His undying wisdom and
    compassion. Simply respecting the images without following His Sublime Teachings is not
    the way to find salvation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We must also endeavor to understand the spirit of the
    Buddha. His Teaching is the only way to save this troubled world. In spite of the
    tremendous advantages of science and technology, people in the world today are filled with
    fear, anxiety and despair. The answer to our troubled world is found in the Teaching of
    the Buddha. </font></p>
