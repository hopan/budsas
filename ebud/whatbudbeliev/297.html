    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>'There is no reason to suppose that the world had a
      beginning at all. The idea that things must have a beginning is really due to the poverty
      of our thoughts.'(Bertrand Russell)</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>here are three schools of thought
    regarding the origin of the world. The first school of thought claims that this world came
    into existence by nature and that nature is not an intelligent force. However, nature
    works no its own accord and goes on changing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second school of thought says that the world was
    created by an almighty God who is responsible for everything. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third school of thought says that the beginning of
    this world and of life is inconceivable since they have neither beginning nor end.
    Buddhism is in accordance with this third school of thought. Bertrand Russell supports
    this school of thought by saying, 'There is no reason to suppose that the world had a
    beginning at all. The idea that things must have a beginning is really due to the poverty
    of our thoughts.' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Modern science says that some millions of years ago, the
    newly cooled earth was lifeless and that life originated in the ocean. Buddhism never
    claimed that the world, sun, moon, stars, wind, water, days and nights were created by a
    powerful god or by a Buddha. Buddhists believe that the world was not created once upon a
    time, but that the world has been created millions of times every second and will continue
    to do so by itself and will break away by itself. According to Buddhism, world systems
    always appear and disappear in the universe. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>H.G. Wells, in <i>A Short History of the World,</i>
    says 'It is universally recognized that the universe in which we live, has to all
    appearance, existed for an enormous period of time and possibly for endless time. But that
    the universe in which we live, has existed only for six or seven thousand years may be
    regarded as an altogether exploded idea. No life seems to have happened suddenly upon
    earth.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The efforts made by many religions to explain the
    beginning and the end of the universe are indeed ill-conceived. The position of religions
    which propound the view that the universe was created by god in an exactly fixed year, has
    become a difficult one to maintain in the light of modern and scientific knowledge. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today scientists, historians, astronomers, biologists,
    botanists, anthropologists and great thinkers have all contributed vast new knowledge
    about the origin of the world. This latest discovery and knowledge is not at all
    contradictory to the Teachings of the Buddha. Bertrand Russell again says that he respects
    the Buddha for not making false statements like others who committed themselves regarding
    the origin of the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The speculative explanations of the origin of the universe
    that are presented by various religions are not acceptable to the modern scientists and
    intellectuals. Even the commentaries of the Buddhist Scriptures, written by certain
    Buddhist writers, cannot be challenged by scientific thinking in regard to this question.
    The Buddha did not waste His time on this issue. The reason for His silence was that this
    issue has no religious value for gaining spiritual wisdom. The explanation of the origin
    of the universe is not the concern of religion. Such theorizing is not necessary for
    living a righteous way of life and for shaping our future life. However, if one insists on
    studying this subject, then one must investigate the sciences, astronomy, geology, biology
    and anthropology. These sciences can offer more reliable and tested information on this
    subject than can be supplied by any religion. The purpose of a religion is to cultivate
    the life here in this world and hereafter until liberation is gained. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the eyes of the Buddha, the world is nothing but
    Samsara -- the cycle of repeated births and deaths. To Him, the beginning of the world and
    the end of the world is within this Samsara. Since elements and energies are relative and
    inter-dependent, it is meaningless to single out anything as the beginning. Whatever
    speculation we make regarding the origin of the world, there is no absolute truth in our
    notion. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Infinite is the sky, infinite is the number of
      beings,</font> <br>
      Infinite are the worlds in the vast universe, <br>
      Infinite in wisdom the Buddha teaches these, <br>
      <font>Infinite are the virtues of Him who teaches these.'</font> - (Sri Ramachandra) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>One day a man called Malunkyaputta approached the
    Master and demanded that He explain the origin of the Universe to him. He even threatened
    to cease to be His follow if the Buddha's answer was not satisfactory. The Buddha calmly
    retorted that it was of no consequence to Him whether or not Malunkyaputta followed Him,
    because the Truth did not need anyone's support. Then the Buddha said that He would not go
    into a discussion of the origin of the Universe. To Him, gaining knowledge about such
    matters was a waste of time because a man's task was to liberate himself from the present,
    not the past or the future. To illustrate this, the Enlightened One related the parable of
    a man who was shot by a poisoned arrow. This foolish man refused to have the arrow removed
    until he found out all about the person who shot the arrow. By the time his attendants
    discovered these unnecessary details, the man was dead. Similarly, our immediate task is
    to attain Nibbana, not to worry about our beginnings.</font> </font></p>
