    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Tripitaka is the collection of the teachings of the
      Buddha over 45 years in the Pali language, and it consists of Sutta - conventional
      teaching, Vinaya - disciplinary code, and Abhidhamma - moral psychology.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he Tripitaka was compiled and
    arranged in its present form by those Arahants who had immediate contact with the Master
    Himself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha has passed away, but the sublime Dhamma which
    He unreservedly bequeathed to humanity still exists in its pristine purity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the Master has left no written records of His
    Teachings, His distinguished disciples preserved them by committing to memory and
    transmitting them orally from generation to generation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Immediately after the final passing away of the Buddha,
    500 distinguished Arahants held a convention known as the First Buddhist Council to
    rehearse the Doctrine taught by the Buddha. Venerable Ananda, the faithful attendant of
    the Buddha who had the special privilege of hearing all the discourses the Buddha ever
    uttered, recited the Dhamma, whilst the Venerable Upali recited the Vinaya, the rules of
    conduct for the Sangha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One hundred years after the First Buddhist Council, during
    King Kalasoka, some disciples saw the need to change certain minor rules. The orthodox
    monk said that nothing should be changed while the others insisted on modifying some
    disciplinary rules<i> (Vinaya)</i>. Finally, the formation of different schools of
    Buddhism germinated after this council. And in the Second Council, only matters pertaining
    to the Vinaya were discussed and no controversy about the Dhamma was reported. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the 3<sup>rd</sup> Century B.C. during the time of
    Emperor Asoka, the Third Council was held to discuss the differences of opinion held by
    the Sangha community. At this Council the differences were not confined to the Vinaya but
    were also connected with the Dhamma. At the end of this Council, the President of the
    Council, Ven. Moggaliputta Tissa, compiled a book called Kathavatthu refuting the
    heretical, false views and theories held by some disciples. The teaching approved and
    accepted by this Council was known as <i>Theravada.</i> The<i> Abhidhamma</i> <i>Pitaka </i>was
    held in Sri Lanka in 80 B.C. is known as the 4<sup>th</sup> Council under the patronage of
    the pious King Vattagamini Abbaya. It was at this time in Sri Lanka that the <i>Tripitaka </i>was
    first committed to writing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Tripitaka consists of three sections of the
    Buddha's Teachings. They are the Discipline (<i>Vinaya Pitaka</i>), the Discourse (<i>Sutta
    Pitaka</i>), and Ultimate Doctrine (<i>Abhidhamma Pitaka</i>).</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>I. Vinaya Pitaka</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>Vinaya Pitaka</i> mainly deals with the rules and
    regulations of the Order of monks (Bhikkhus) and nuns (Bhikkhunis). It describes in detail
    the gradual development of the <i>Sasana (Dispensation)</i>. It also gives an account of
    the life and ministry of the Buddha. Indirectly it reveals some useful information about
    ancient history, Indian customs, arts, sciences, etc. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For nearly twenty years since His Enlightenment, the
    Buddha did not lay down rules for the control of the Sangha. Later, as the occasion arose,
    the Buddha promulgated rules for the future discipline of the Sangha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This Pitaka consists of the five following books: </font><dir>
      <blockquote ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Parajika Pali </i>(Major Offences)<br>
        <i>Pacittiya Pali </i>(Minor Offences)<br>
        <i>Mahavagga Pali </i>(Greater Section)<br>
        <i>Cullavagga Pali </i>(Smaller Section)<br>
        <i>Parivara Pali </i>(Epitome of the Vinaya) </font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </dir>
    <font SIZE="+1"><p></font><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>II. Sutta Pitaka </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Sutta Pitaka consists chiefly of discourses delivered
    by the Buddha Himself on various occasions. There are also a few discourses delivered by
    some of His distinguished disciples, such as the Venerable Sariputta, Ananda, Moggallana,
    etc., included in it. It is like a book of prescriptions, as the sermons embodied therein
    were expounded to suit the different occasions and the temperaments of various persons.
    There may be seemingly contradictory statements, but they should not be misconstrued as
    they were opportunely uttered by the Buddha to suit a particular purpose. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This <i>Pitaka</i> is divided into five <i>Nikayas</i> or
    collections, viz:-- </font><dir>
      <blockquote ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Digha Nikaya</em> (Collection of Long Discourses)<br>
        <em>Majjhima Nikaya</em> (Collection of Middle-length Discourses)<br>
        <em>Samyutta Nikaya</em> (Collection of Kindred Sayings)<br>
        <em>Anguttara Nikaya</em> (Collection of Discourses arranged in accordance with number)<br>
        <em>Khuddaka Nikaya</em> (Smaller Collection)</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>III. Abhidhamma Pitaka </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The <i>Abhidhamma</i> is, to a deep thinker, the
    most important and interesting, as it contains the profound philosophy of the Buddha's
    teaching in contrast to the illuminating but simpler discourses in the Sutta Pitaka.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Sutta Pitaka one often finds references to
    individual, being, etc., but in the Abhidhamma, instead of such conventional terms, we
    meet with ultimate terms, such as aggregates, mind, matter, etc. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Sutta is found the<i> Vohara Desana</i>
    (Conventional Teaching), whilst in the Abhidhamma is found the <i>Paramattha Desana</i>
    (Ultimate Doctrine). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Abhidhamma everything is analysed and explained in
    detail, and as such it is called <i>analytical doctrine</i> (<i>Vibhajja Vada</i>). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Four ultimate things (<i>Paramattha</i>) are enumerated in
    the Abhidhamma. They are <i>Citta, </i>(Consciousness), <i>Cetasika </i>(Mental
    concomitants), <i>Rupa</i> (Matter) and<i> Nibbana</i>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The so-called being is microscopically analysed and its
    component parts are minutely described. Finally the ultimate goal and the method to
    achieve it is explained with all necessary details. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Abhidhamma Pitaka is composed of the following
    works:-- </font><dir>
      <blockquote >
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Dhamma-Sangani</i> (Enumeration of Phenomena)<br>
        <i>Vibhanga </i>(The Book of the Treatises)<br>
        <i>Katha Vatthu</i> (Point of Controversy)<br>
        <i>Puggala Pannatti</i> (Description of Individuals)<br>
        <i>Dhatu Katha</i> (Discussion with reference to Elements)<br>
