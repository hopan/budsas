    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>This religion can be practised either in society or in
      seclusion.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>here are some who believe that
    Buddhism is so lofty and sublime a system that it cannot be practised by ordinary men and
    women in the workday world. These same people think that one has to retire to a monastery
    or to some quiet place if one desires to be a true Buddhist. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a sad misconception that comes from a lack of
    understanding of the Buddha. People jump to such conclusions after casually reading or
    hearing something about Buddhism. Some people form their impression of Buddhism after
    reading articles or books that give only a partial or lopsided view of Buddhism. The
    authors of such articles and books have only a limited understanding of the Buddha's
    Teaching. His Teaching is not meant only for monks in monasteries. The Teaching is also
    for ordinary men and women living at home with their families. The Noble Eightfold Path is
    the Buddhist way of life that is intended for all people. This way of life is offered to
    all mankind without any distinction. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The vast majority of people in the world cannot become
    monks or retire into caves or forests. However noble and pure Buddhism may be, it would be
    useless to the masses if they could not follow it in their daily life in the modern world.
    But if you understand the spirit of Buddhism correctly, you can surely follow and practise
    it while living the life of an ordinary man. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There may be some who find it easier and more convenient
    to accept Buddhism by living in a remote place; in other words, by cutting themselves off
    from the society of others. Yet , other people may find that this kind of retirement dulls
    and depresses their whole being both physically and mentally, and that it may therefore
    not be conducive to the development of their spiritual and intellectual life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>True renunciation does not mean running away
    physically from the world. Sariputta, the chief disciple of the Buddha, said that one man
    might live in a forest devoting himself to ascetic practices, but might be full of impure
    thoughts and 'defilements'. Another might live in a village or a town, practising no
    ascetic discipline, but his mind might be pure, and free from 'defilements'. 'Of these
    two,' said, Sariputta, 'the one who lives a pure life in the village or town is definitely
    far superior to, and greater than, the one who lives in the forest.' (<i>Majjhima Nikaya</i>)</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The common belief that to follow the Buddha's
    Teaching one has to retire from a normal family life is a misconception. It is really an
    unconscious defense against practising it. There are numerous references in Buddhist
    literature to men and women living ordinary, normal family lives who successfully
    practised what the Buddha taught and realized Nibbana. Vacchagotta the Wanderer, once
    asked the Buddha straightforwardly whether there were laymen and women leading the family
    life who followed His Teaching successfully and attained the high spiritual states. The
    Buddha categorically stated that there were many laymen and women leading the family life
    who had followed His Teaching successfully and attained the high spiritual states.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>It may be agreeable for certain people to live a
    retired life in a quiet place away from noise and disturbances. But it is certainly more
    praiseworthy and courageous to practise Buddhism living among fellow beings, helping them
    and offering service to them. It may perhaps be useful in some cases for a man to live in
    retirement for a time in order to improve his mind and character, as a preliminary to
    moral, spiritual and intellectual training, to be strong enough to come out later and help
    others. But if a man lives all his life in solitude, thinking only of his own happiness
    and salvation, without caring for his fellowmen, this surely is not in keeping with the
    Buddha's Teaching which is based on love compassion and service to others.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>One might now ask, 'If a man can follow Buddhism
    while living the life of an ordinary man, why was the Sangha, the Order of Monks,
    established by the Buddha?' The Order provides opportunity for those who are willing to
    devote their lives not only to their own spiritual and intellectual development, but also
    to the service of others. An ordinary layman with a family cannot be expected to devote
    his whole life to the service of others, whereas a Monk, who has no family
    responsibilities or any other worldly ties, is in a position to devote his life 'for the
    good of the many'.(Dr. Walpola Rahula)</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>And what is this 'good' that many can benefit from?
    The monk cannot give material comfort to a layman, but he can provide spiritual guidance
    to those who are troubled by worldly, family emotional problems and so on. The monk
    devotes his life to the pursuit of knowledge of the Dhamma as taught by the Buddha. He
    explains the Teaching in simplified form to the untutored layman. And if the layman is
    well educated, he is there to discuss the deeper aspects of the teaching so that both can
    gain intellectually from the discussion.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhist countries, monks are largely responsible for
    the education of the young. As a result of their contribution, Buddhist countries have
    populations which are literate and well-versed in spiritual values. Monks also comfort
    those who are bereaved and emotionally upset by explaining how all mankind is subject to
    similar disturbances. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In turn, the layman is expected to look after the material
    well-being of the monk who does not gain income to provide himself with food, shelter,
    medicine and clothing. In common Buddhist practice, it is considered meritorious for a
    layman to contribute to the health of a monk because by so doing he makes it possible for
    the monk to continue to minister to the spiritual needs of the people and for his mental
    purity. </font></p>
