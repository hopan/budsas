    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Paradise is open not only to the followers of a
      particular religion, but it is open to each and every person who leads a righteous and
      noble way of life.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>here is no difficulty at all for
    Buddhists to go to heaven if they really want to. But there are some people who go from
    house to house trying to convert other religionists into their faith and promising them
    the heaven they carry in their bags. They claim that they are the only blessed people who
    can go to heaven; they also claim that they have the exclusive authority to send others to
    the same goal. They introduce their religion like a patent medicine and this has become a
    nuisance to the public today. Many innocent people who lack the knowledge of their own
    religion, have become victims of these paradise sellers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If Buddhists can understand the value of the Noble
    Teachings of the Buddha, they will not be misled by such people. These paradise sellers
    are also trying to mislead the people by saying that this world which is created by god,
    is going to end very soon. Those who want to have a wonderful everlasting life in heaven
    must accept their particular religion before the end of the world comes, otherwise people
    would miss this golden opportunity and would have to suffer in eternal hell. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This threat of the end of the world, had been going on for
    hundreds of years. The wonder of it all is that there are still people today who believe
    in such a treat which is irrational and imaginary. Some people get converted after hearing
    such preaching, without using their common sense. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhism, there is no personal judge either to condemn
    or to reward but only the working of an impersonal moral causation and natural law. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Why wicked people enjoy while good people suffer </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Some people ask, 'If good begets good and bad begets
    bad why should many good people suffer and some wicked people prosper in this world? ' The
    answer to this question, according to the Buddhist point of view, is that although some
    are good by nature, they have not accumulated enough good merits in their previous birth
    to compensate for the bad effects of unwholesome kamma in this present life; somewhere in
    their past there must have been some defect. On the other hand, some are wicked by nature
    and yet are able to enjoy this life for a short period of due to some strong good kamma
    that they accumulated in their previous birth.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>For example, there are certain people who by nature
    have inherited a strong constitution and as a result enjoy perfect health. Their physical
    power of resistance is strong and hence they are not prone to illnesses. Although they do
    not take special precautions to lead a hygienic life, they are able to remain strong and
    healthy. On the other hand, there are others who take various tonics and vitamin?enriched
    foods to fortify themselves, but in spite of their efforts to become strong and healthy,
    their health do not show any improvement.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whatever good and bad deeds people commit within this
    life-time, they will definitely experience the reaction within this life or hereafter. It
    is impossible to escape from their results simply by praying, but by cultivating the mind
    and leading a noble life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists are encouraged to do good deeds not for the sake
    of gaining a place in heaven. They are expected to do good in order to eradicate their
    selfishness and to experience peace and happiness. </font></p>
