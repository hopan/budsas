    Buddha's Service </font></h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The Buddha was born to dispel the darkness of ignorance
      and to show to the world how to be free from suffering.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he Buddha was the embodiment of all
    the virtues that He preached. During His successful and eventful ministry of 45 years, He
    translated all His words into actions. At no time did He ever show any human frailty or
    any base passion. The Buddha's moral code is the most perfect the world has ever known. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For more than 25 centuries, millions of people have found
    inspiration and solace in His Teaching. His greatness still shine today like a sun that
    outshines the glow of lesser lights. His Teachings still beckon the weary pilgrim to the
    security and peace of Nibbana. No other person has sacrificed so much of his worldly
    comfort for the sake of suffering humanity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, was the first religious leader in human
    history to admonish against animal sacrifice for any reason and to appeal to people not to
    harm any living creature. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To the Buddha, religion was not a bargain but a way to
    enlightenment. He did not want followers with blind faith, He wanted followers who could
    think freely and wisely. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The entire human race has been blessed with His presence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>There was never an occasion when the Buddha
    expressed any unfriendliness towards a single person. Not even to His opponents and worst
    enemies did the Buddha express any unfriendliness. There were a few prejudiced minds who
    turned against the Buddha and who tried to kill him, yet the Buddha never treated them as
    enemies. The Buddha once said, 'As an elephant in the battle-field endures the arrows that
    are shot into him, so will I endure the abuse and unfriendly expressions of
    others.(Dhammapada. 320)</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the annals of history, no man is recorded as having so
    consecrated himself to the welfare of all living beings as did the Buddha. From the hour
    of His Enlightenment to the end of His Life, he strove tirelessly to elevate mankind. He
    slept only two hours a day. Though 25 centuries have gone since the passing away of this
    great Teacher, His message of love and wisdom still exists in its pristine purity. This
    message is still decisively influencing the destinies of humanity. He was the most
    Compassionate One who illuminated this world with loving-kindness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After attaining Nibbana, the Buddha left a deathless
    message that is still with us. Today we are confronted by the terrible threat to world
    peace. At no time in the history of the world is His message more needed than it is now. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was born to dispel the darkness of ignorance
    and to show the world how to get rid of suffering and disease, decay and death and all the
    worries and miseries of living beings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to some beliefs, a certain god will appear in
    this world from time to time to destroy wicked people and to protect the good one. Buddha
    did not appear in this world to destroy wicked people but to show them the correct path. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In the history of the world until the Buddha's time,
    did we ever hear of any religious teacher who was so filled with such all-absorbing
    sympathy and love for suffering humanity as was the Buddha? At about the same time as the
    Buddha, we heard of some wise men in Greece: Socrates, Plato and Aristotle and many
    others. But they were only philosophers and thinkers and seekers after truth; they lacked
    any inspiring love for the suffering multitudes.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha's way of saving mankind was to teach them
    how to find salvation. He was not interested in alleviating a few chance cases of physical
    or mental distress. He was more concerned with revealing a Path that all people could
    follow.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Let us take all the great philosophers,
    psychologists, great thinkers, scientists, rationalists, social workers, reformers and
    other religious teachers and compare, with an unbiased mind, their greatness, virtues,
    services and wisdom with the Buddha's virtues, compassion and Enlightenment. One can
    understand where the Buddha stands amongst all those great people.</font> </font></p>
