    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">B</font>uddhism is a beautiful gem of many
    facets, attracting people of diverse personalities. Every facet in this gem has tested
    methods and approaches that can benefit the Truth seekers with their various levels of
    understanding and spiritual maturity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha Dhamma is the fruit resulting from a most
    intensive search conducted over a long period of time by a compassionate noble prince
    whose mission was to help suffering humanity. Despite being surrounded by all the wealth
    and luxuries normally showered on a crown prince, He renounced His luxurious life and
    voluntarily embarked on a tough journey to seek the Truth and to find a panacea to cure
    the sickness of the worldly life with its attendant suffering and unsatisfactoriness. He
    was bent on finding a solution to alleviate all suffering. In His long search, the prince
    did not rely on or resort to divine guidance or traditional beliefs as was fashionable in
    the past. He did an intensive search with a free and open mind, guided solely by His
    sincerity of purpose, noble resolution, inexhaustible patience, and a truly compassionate
    heart with the ardent wish to relieve suffering. After six long years of intensive
    experiment, of trial and error, the noble prince achieved His aim --- He gained
    Enlightenment and gave the world His pristine teachings known as Dhamma or Buddhism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha once said, 'Monks, the lion, king of
    beasts, at eventide comes forth from his lair. He stretches himself. Having done so, he
    surveys the four quarters in all directions. Have done that, he utters thrice his lion's
    roar. Having thrice uttered his lion's roar, he sallies forth in search of prey.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Now, monks, whatever animals hear the sound of the
    roaring of the lion, king of beasts, for the most part, they are afraid; they fall to
    quaking and trembling. Those that dwell in holes seek them; water-dwellers make for the
    water; forest-dwellers enter the forest; birds mount into the air.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Then whatsoever ruler's elephants in village, town
    or palace are tethered with stout leather bonds, they burst out and rend those bonds
    asunder; void their excrements and in panic run to and fro. Thus potent, is the lion, king
    of beasts, over animals. Of such mighty power and majesty is he.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Just so, monks, is it when a Buddha arises in the
    world, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One, perfect in wisdom and in conduct,
    wayfarer, Knower of the worlds, the unsurpassed trainer of those who can be trained,
    teacher of gods and men, a Buddha, an Exalted One. He teaches the Dhamma; &quot;Such is
    the nature of concept of Self; this is the way leading to the ending of such a Self.'</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Whatsoever gods there be, they too, on hearing the
    Dhamma of the <i>Tathagata</i>, for the most part are afraid: they fall to quaking and
    trembling, saying: 'We who thought ourselves permanent are after all impermanent: that we
    who thought ourselves stable are after all unstable: not to last, though lasting we
    thought ourselves. So it seems that we are impermanent, unstable, not to last, compassed
    about with a Self.' Thus potent is a <i>Tathagata </i>over the world of gods and men. <i>(Anguttara
    Nikaya).</i></font> </font></p>
