      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>A fortunate or unfortunate life depends on individual
      merits and demerits.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he performance of good actions
    gives rise to merit (<i>punna</i>), a quality which purifies and cleanses the mind. If the
    mind is unchecked, it has the tendency to be ruled by evil tendencies, leading one to
    perform bad deeds and getting into trouble. Merit purifies the mind of the evil tendencies
    of greed, hatred and delusion. The greedy mind encourages a person to desire, accumulate
    and hoard; the hating mind drags him to dislike and anger; and the deluded mind makes one
    become entangled in greed and hatred, thinking that these evil roots are right and worthy.
    Demeritorious deeds give rise to more suffering and reduce the opportunities for a person
    to know and practise the Dhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Merit is important to help us along our journey through
    life. It is connected with what are good and beneficial to oneself and others, and can
    improve the quality of the mind. While the material wealth a person gathers can be lost by
    theft, flood, fire, confiscation, etc., the benefit of merits follows him from life to
    life and cannot be lost, although it can be exhausted if no attempts are made to perform
    more merits. A person will experience happiness here and now ass well as hereafter through
    the performance of merit. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Merit is a great facilitator: It opens the doors of
    opportunity everywhere. A meritorious person will succeed in whatever venture he puts his
    effort into. If he wishes to do business, he will meet with the right contacts and
    friends. If he wishes to be a scholar, he will be awarded with scholarships and supported
    by academic mentors. If he wishes to progress in meditation, he will meet with a skillful
    meditation teacher who guides him through his spiritual development. His dreams will be
    realized through the grace of his treasury of merit. It is merit which enables a person to
    be reborn in the heavens, and provides him with the right conditions and support for his
    attainment of <i>Nibbana.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are several rich fields of merit (recipients of the
    deed)which give rise to bountiful results to the performer of the good deed. Just as some
    soil can yield a better harvest (say black fertile soil compared to stony soil), a good
    deed performed to some persons can give rise to more merits than to others. The rich
    fields of merits include the Sangha or holy people, mother, father and needy. Good deeds
    performed to these persons will manifest in many ways and be the fountainhead of many
    wondrous results. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught ten meritorious deeds for us to perform
    in order to gain a happy and peaceful life as well as to develop knowledge and
    understanding. The ten meritorious deeds are: </font><dir>

        <blockquote ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">Charity<br>
          Morality<br>
          Mental culture<br>
          Reverence or respect<br>
          Service in helping others<br>
          Sharing merits with others<br>
          Rejoicing in the merits of others<br>

        </blockquote>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">The performance of these ten meritorious
    deeds will not only benefit oneself, but others as well, besides giving benefits to the
    recipients. Moral conduct benefits all beings with whom one comes into contact. Mental
    culture brings peace to others and inspires them to practise the Dhamma. Reverence gives
    rise to harmony in society, while service improves the lives of others. Sharing merits
    with others shows that one is concerned about others' welfare, while rejoicing in others'
    merits encourages others to perform more merits. Teaching and listening to the Dhamma are
    important factors for happiness for both the teacher and listener, while encouraging both
    to live in line with Dhamma. Straightening one's views enables a person to show to others
    the beauty of Dhamma. In the <i>Dhammapada,</i> the Buddha taught:&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><dir>

        He should do it again and again;<br>
        He should find pleasure therein;<br>
        <font>For blissful is the accumulation of good.'<br>
        'Think not lightly of good, saying,<br>
        'It will not come near to me'?<br>
        </font>Even by the falling of drops a water-jar is filled.<br>
        Likewise the wise man, gathering little by little,<br>
        Fills himself with good.' </font></p>

    <font SIZE="+1"><p></font><font face="Times New Roman" SIZE="+1">Ten Evil Deeds</font><font
    face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are ten demeritorious deeds from which Buddhists are
    advised to keep away. These deeds are rooted in greed, hatred and delusion, and will bring
    suffering to others but especially to oneself in this life and later lives. When a person
    understands the Law of Kamma and realizes that bad deeds bring bad results, he will then
    practise Right Understanding and avoid performing these actions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are three bodily actions which are kammically
    unwholesome. They are: (1) Killing of living beings, (2) Stealing, and (3) Unlawful sexual
    intercourse. These bodily deeds correspond to the first three of the Five Precepts for
    people to follow. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The effects of killing to the performer of the deed are
    brevity of life, ill-health, constant grief due to the separation from the loved, and
    living in constant fear. The bad consequences of stealing are poverty, misery,
    disappointment, and a dependent livelihood. The bad consequences of sexual misconduct are
    having many enemies, always being hated, and union with undesirable wives and husbands. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Four verbal actions are kammically unwholesome, and they
    are as follows: (1) Lying, (2) Slander and tale-bearing, (3) Harsh speech, and (4)
    Frivolous and meaningless talk. Except for lying, the other unwholesome deeds performed by
    speech may be viewed as extensions of the Fourth Precept. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The bad consequences of lying to the one who
    performs the deed are being subject to abusive speech and vilification, untrustworthiness,
    and physical unpleasantness. The bad effect of slandering is losing one's friends without
    any sufficient cause. The results of harsh speech are being detested by others and having
    a harsh voice. The inevitable effects of frivolous talk are defective bodily organs and
    speech which no one believes.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The three other demeritorious deeds are performed by the
    mind, and they are as follows: (1) Covetousness, or eagerly desirous especially of things
    belonging to others, (2) Ill-will, and (3) Wrong view. These three deeds correspond to the
    three evil roots of greed, hatred and delusion. The non-observance of the Fifth Precept of
    abstention from intoxicants can not only lead to the performance of these three
    demeritorious mental actions after the mind is intoxicated, but also the other
    demeritorious deeds performed by body and speech. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The undesirable result of covetousness is the
    non-fulfillment of one's wishes. The consequences of ill-ill are ugliness, manifold
    diseases, and having a detestable nature. Finally, the consequences of false view are
    having gross desires, lack of wisdom, being of dull wit, having chronic diseases and
    blameworthy ideas.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A person should always perform good actions and restrain
    himself from doing evil actions. If, however, a person has performed an evil action, it is
    necessary for him to realize where he has done wrong and make an effort not to repeat the
    mistake. This is the true meaning of repentance, and in this way only will a person
    progress along the noble path to salvation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Praying for forgiveness is meaningless if, after the
    prayer is made, a person repeats the veil action again and again. Who is there to <font>'wash
    away a person's sins' except he himself? This has to begin with <i>realization</i>, the
    wonderful cleansing agent. First, he realizes the nature of his deed and the extent of the
    harm incurred. Next, he realizes that this deed is unwholesome, learns from it, and makes
    the resolution not to repeat it. Then, he performs many good deeds to the affected party
    as well as to others, as much as possible. In this way, he overcomes the effect of bad
    deed with a shower of good deeds.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>No wrong does, according to Buddhism, is beyond
    redemption or rehabilitation, especially with realization and Right Effort. To be seduced
    into believing that a person can 'wash away' his bad deeds through some other 'miraculous'
    way is not only a mere superstition, but worse, it is also not useful particularly to the
    spiritual development of the person himself. It will only cause him to continue to remain
    ignorant and morally complacent. This misplaced belief can, in fact, do a person much more
    harm than the effects of the wrong deed he feared so much.</font> </font></p>
