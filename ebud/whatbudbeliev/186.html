      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Is there any truth in man'sclaim that he should be

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">W</font><font face="Times New Roman">hen we
    consider human freedom, it is very difficult to find out whether man is really free to do
    anything according to his own wishes. Man is bound by many conditions both external and
    internal; he is asked to obey the laws that are imposed on him by the government; he is
    bound to follow certain religious principles; he is required to co-operate with the moral
    and social conditions of the society in which he lives; he is compelled to follow certain
    national and family customs and traditions. In modern society, he in inclined to disagree
    with life; he is expected to conform by adapting himself to the modern way of life. he is
    bound to co-operate with natural laws and cosmic energy, because he is also part of the
    same energy. He is subjected to the weather and climatic conditions of the region. Not
    only does he have to pay attention to his life or to physical elements, but he has also to
    make up his mind to control his own emotions. In other words, he has no freedom to think
    freely because he is overwhelmed by new thoughts which may contradict or do away with his
    previous thoughts and convictions. At the same time, he may believe that he has to obey
    and work according to the will of god, and not follow his own free-will. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Taking into consideration all the above changing
    conditions to which man is bound, we can ask 'Is there any truth in man's claim that he
    should be given freedom to do things as he likes?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why does man have his hands tied so firmly? The reason is
    that there are various bad elements within man. These elements are dangerous and harmful
    to all living creatures. For the past few thousand years, all religions have been trying
    to tame this unreliable attitude of man and to teach him how to live a noble life. But it
    is most unfortunate that man is still not ready to be trustworthy, however good he may
    appear to be. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Man still continues to harbor all these evil elements
    within himself. These evil elements are not introduced or influenced by external sources
    but are created by man himself. If these evil forces are man-made, then man himself must
    work hard to get rid of them after realizing their danger. Unfortunately the majority of
    men are cruel, cunning, wicked, ungrateful, unreliable, unscrupulous. If man is allowed to
    live according to his own free-will without moderation and restraint, he would most
    definitely violate the peace and happiness of innocent people. His behavior would probably
    be much worse than that of dangerous living beings. Religion is required to train him to
    lead a respectable life and to gain peace and happiness here and hereafter. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another obstacle confronting religious life and spiritual
    progress is racial arrogance. The Buddha advised His followers not to bring forward any
    racial issue when they come to practise religion. Buddhists are taught to sink their own
    racial origin and caste or class distinction. People of all religions should not
    discriminate against any groups of people by bringing forward their personal traditional
    way of life. They should treat everyone equally, especially in the religious field.
    Unfortunately, followers of different religions create more discriminations and hostility
    towards other religious groups when performing their religious activities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While working others, they should not disturb their
    feelings because of their so-called traditions and customs. They can follow traditions and
    customs that are in keeping with the religious principles and moral codes of their
    religions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Racial arrogance is a great hindrance to religion and
    spiritual progress. The Buddha once used the simile of ocean water to illustrate the
    harmony which can be experienced by people who have learnt to cast aside their racial
    arrogance: Different rivers have different names. The water of the individual rivers all
    flow into the ocean and become ocean water. In a similar manner, all those who have come
    from different communities and different castes, must forget their differences and think
    of themselves only as human beings. </font></p>
