    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Mercy and Killing can never go together.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">A</font>ccording to Buddhism mercy killing
    cannot be justified. Mercy and killing can never go together. Some people kill their pets
    on the grounds that they do not like to see the pets suffer. However, if mercy killing is
    the correct method to be practised on pets and other animals, then why are people so
    reluctant to do the same to their beloved ones? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When some people see their dogs or cats suffer from some
    skin disease, they arrange to kill those poor animals. They call this action, mercy
    killing. Actually it is not that they have mercy towards those animals, but they kill them
    for their own precaution and to get rid of an awful sight. And even if they do have real
    mercy towards a suffering animal, they still have no right to take away its life. No
    matter how sincere one may be, mercy killing, is not the correct approach. The
    consequences of this killing, however, are different from killing with hatred towards the
    animal. Buddhists have no grounds to say that any kind of killing is justified. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people try to justify mercy killing with the
    misconception that if the motive or reason is good, then the act itself is good. They then
    claim that by killing their pet, they have the intention to relieve the unhappy animal
    from its suffering and so the action is good. No doubt their original intention or motive
    is good. But the evil act of killing which occurs through a later thought, will certainly
    bring about unwholesome results. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Keeping away from mercy killing can become a nuisance to
    many. Nevertheless, the Buddhist religion cannot justify mercy killing as completely free
    from bad reaction. However, to kill out of necessity and without any anger or hatred has
    less bad reaction than to kill out of intense anger or jealousy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, a being (man or animal) may suffer
    owing to his bad kamma. If By mercy killing, we prevent the working out of one<font>'s bad
    <i>kamma,</i>the debt will have to be paid in another existence. As Buddhists, all that we
    can do is to help to reduce the pain of suffering in others.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Killing for Self Protection </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha has advised everyone to abstain from
    killing. If everybody accepts this advice, human beings would not kill each other. In the
    case where a person's life is threatened, the Buddha says even then it is not advisable to
    kill out of self-protection. The weapon for self-protection is loving-kindness. One who
    practises this kindness very seldom comes across such misfortune. However, man loves his
    life so much that he is not prepared to surrender himself to others; in actual practice,
    most people would struggle for self-protection. It is natural and every living being
    struggles and kills others for self-protection but kammic effect depends on their mental
    attitude. During the struggle to protect himself, if he happens to kill his opponent
    although he has no intention to kill, then he is not responsible for that action. On the
    other hand, if he kills another person under any circumstances with the intention to kill,
    then he is not free from the kammic reaction; he has to face the consequences. We must
    remember that killing is killing; when we disapprove of it, we call it 'murder'. When we
    punish man for murdering, we call it 'capital punishment'. If our own soldiers are killed
    by an 'enemy' we call it 'slaughter'. However, if we approve a killing, we call it 'war'.
    But if we remove the emotional content from these words, we can understand that killing is
    killing.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In recent years many scientists and some
    religionists have used the expressions like 'humane killing', 'mercy killing', 'gentle
    killing' and 'painless killing' to justify the ending of a life. They argue that if the
    victim feels no pain, if the knife is sharp, killing is justified. Buddhism can never
    accept these arguments because it is not how the killing occurs that is important, but the
    fact that a life of one being is terminated by another. No one has any right to do that
    for whatever reason.</font> </font></p>
