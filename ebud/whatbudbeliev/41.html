    After His Death? </font></h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; <i>The question: 'Does the Buddha exist after His
      death or not', is not a new question. The same question was put to the Buddha during His
      lifetime.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>hen a group of ascetics came and
    asked the same question from certain disciples of the Buddha, they could not get a
    satisfactory answer from them. Anuradha, a disciple, approached the Buddha and reported to
    Him about their conversation. Considering the understanding capacity of the questioners,
    the Buddha usually observed silence at such questions. However in this instance, the
    Buddha explained to Anuradha in the following manner: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'O Anuradha, what do you think, is the form (<i>Rupa</i>)
    permanent or impermanent?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Impermanent, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Is that which is impermanent, painful or pleasant?'</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Painful, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Is it proper to regard that which is impermanent,
    painful and subject to change as: 'This is mine; this is I, this is my soul or permanent
    substance?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'It is not proper, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Is feeling permanent or impermanent?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Impermanent, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Is that which is impermanent, painful or pleasant?'</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Painful, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Is it proper to regard that which is impermanent,
    painful and subject to change as 'This is mine, this is I, this is my soul'?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'It is not proper, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Are perfection, formative tendencies and
    consciousness, permanent or impermanent?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Impermanent, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Is that which is impermanent, painful or pleasant?'</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Painful, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Is it proper to regard that which is impermanent,
    painful and subject to change as: 'This is mine, this is I, this is my soul?'?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'It is not proper, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Therefore whatever form, feeling, perception,
    formative tendencies, consciousness which have been, will be and is now connected with
    oneself, or with others, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near; all forms,
    feelings, perceptions, formative tendencies and consciousness should be considered by
    right knowledge in this way: 'This is not mine; this not I; this is not my soul.' Having
    seen thus, a noble, learned disciple becomes disenchanted with the form, feeling,
    perception, formative tendencies and consciousness. Becoming disenchanted, he controls his
    passion and subsequently discards them.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Being free from passion he becomes emancipated and
    insight arises in him: 'I am emancipated.' He realizes: 'Birth is destroyed, I have lived
    the holy life and done what had to be done. There is no more birth for me.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'What do you think, Anuradha, do you regard the form
    as a Tathagata?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'No, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'O Anuradha, what is your view, do you see a
    Tathagata in the form?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'No, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Do you see a Tathagata apart from form?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'No, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Do you see a Tathagata in feeling, perception,
    formative tendencies, consciousness?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'No, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'O Anuradha, what do you think, do you regard that
    which is without form, feeling, perception, formative tendencies and consciousness as a
    Tathagata?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'No, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Now, Anuradha, since a Tathagata is not to be found
    in this very life, is it proper for you to say: 'This noble and supreme one has pointed
    out and explained these four propositions:</font> </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">A Tathagata exists after death; <br>
      A Tathagata does not exist after death; <br>
      A Tathagata exists and yet does not exist after death; <br>
      <font>A Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death?'</font> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'No, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Well and good, Anuradha. Formerly and now also I
    expound and point out only the truth of Suffering and cessation of Suffering.' (<em>Anuradha
    Sutta - Samyutta Nikaya.</em>)</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above dialogue between the Buddha and Anuradha may not
    be satisfactory to many, since it does not satisfy the inquiring mind of the people. Truth
    is such that it does not give satisfaction to the emotion and intellect. Truth happens to
    be the most difficult thing for man to comprehend. It can only be fully comprehended by
    Insight. Buddhahood is nothing but the embodiment of all the great virtues and supreme
    enlightenment. That is why Buddhas who could enlighten others are very rare in this world.
