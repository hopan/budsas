    <h2 align="center"><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">Man and Religion </font></h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Man is the only living being in this world who has
      discovered religion and performs worship and prayer.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Man developed religion in order to satisfy his desire to
    understand the life within him and the world outside him. The earliest religions had
    animistic origins, and they arose out of man's fear of the unknown and his desire to
    placate the forces which he thought inhabited inanimate objects. Over time these religions
    underwent changes, being shaped by the geographical, historical, socio-economic, political
    and intellectual environment existing at that time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many of these religions have become organized and are
    flourishing to this day, backed by a strong following of devotees. Many people are drawn
    to organized religions because of the pomp and ceremony, while there are some who prefer
    to practice their own personal religion, inwardly venerating their religious teachers and
    applying moral principles in their daily life. Because of the importance of practice,
    every religion claims to be a way of life, not merely a faith. In view of their various
    origins and paths of development which religions undergo, it is hardly surprising that the
    religions of man should differ in their approach, the understanding and interpretation of
    their followers, their goal and how it can be achieved, and their concept of reward and
    punishment for deeds performed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In terms of approach, religious practices may be based on
    faith, fear, rationality or harmlessness: Faith forms the basis of many religious
    practises which were developed to overcome man's fear and to meet his needs. A religion of
    miraculous or mystical powers exploits that fear which arises from ignorance and makes
    promises of material gain based on greed. A religion of devotion is based on emotion and
    the fear of the supernatural which, it is so believed, can be appeased through rites and
    rituals. A religion of faith is based on the desire for gaining confidence in the face of
    the uncertainty of human life and destiny. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some religious practices grew as a result of the
    development of man's knowledge, experience and wisdom. The rational approach to religion
    had been adopted in this case, incorporating the principles of human value and natural or
    universal laws. It is based on humanism and concentrates on the cultivation of humane
    qualities. A religion of cause and effect or kamma is based on the principle of self-help
    and assumes that the individual alone is responsible for his own happiness and suffering
    as well as salvation. A religion of wisdom is based on the application of reason and seeks
    to understand life and the reality of worldly conditions through analytical knowledge. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Harmlessness and goodwill are common elements found in
    religion. A religion of peace is based on the principle of causing no harm to oneself as
    well as others, and its followers are to cultivate a harmonious, liberal and peaceful
    life. A religion of goodwill or loving-kindness is based on the sacrifice and service for
    the welfare and happiness of others. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Religions differ according to the understanding
    capacity of their followers and the interpretation which religious authorities give to the
    religious doctrines and practices. In some religions, codes, while in others they only
    provide advice on the need and the way to follow these codes. Every religion will offer
    reasons to explain the existing human problems and inequalities and the way to remedy the
    situation. By way of explanation, some religions claim that man has to face these problems
    because he is on trial in this world. When such an explanation is given, another may ask,
    'For what purpose? How can a man be judged on the basis of just one life when human beings
    generally differ in their experiences of physical, intellectual, social, economic and
    environmental factors and conditions?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every religion has its own concept of what is regarded to
    be the goal of spiritual life. For some religions, eternal life in heaven or paradise with
    the Lord is the final goal. For some the ultimate aim in life is the union of universal
    consciousness, because it is believed that life is a unit of consciousness and it must
    return to the same original consciousness. Some religions believe that the ending of
    suffering or repeated birth and death is the final goal. For others, even heavenly bliss
    or union with Brahma (creator) is secondary to the uncertainty of existence, no matter,
    whatever form it takes. And there are even some who believe that the present life itself
    is more than enough to experience the aim of life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To attain the desired goal, every religion offers a
    method. Some religions ask their followers to surrender to God or depend on God for
    everything. Others call for stringent asceticism as the means of purging oneself of all
    evil through self mortification. Some others recommend the performance of animal
    sacrifices and many kinds of rites and rituals as well as the recital of mantras for their
    purification to gain the final goal. There is yet another which upholds diverse methods
    and devotions, intellectual realization of truth, and concentration of the mind through
    meditation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each religion has a different concept of punishment for
    evil deeds. According to some religions, man is doomed forever by God for his
    transgressions in this one life. Some others say that action and reaction(cause and
    effect)operate due to natural laws and the effect of a deed will only be experienced for a
    certain period. Some religions maintain that this life is only one of so many, and a
    person will always have chance to reform himself in stages until he finally evolves to
    attain the goal of Supreme Bliss. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Given such a wide variety of approaches, interpretations
    and goals of different religions adopted by mankind, it is useful for people not to hold
    dogmatic views about their religion but to be open to and tolerant of other religious
    views. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said: <font>'</font>One must not accept my
    teachings from reverence, but first try them as gold is tried by fire.' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After emphasizing the importance of maintaining an open
    mind towards religious doctrines, it is useful to remember that a religion should be
    practised for the welfare , freedom and happiness of all living beings. That is, religious
    principles should be used positively to improve the quality of life of all beings. Yet
    today, humankind is corrupted and has gone astray from basic religious principles. Immoral
    and evil practices have become common among many people, and religious-minded people
    experience difficulties trying to maintain certain religious principles in modern life. At
    the same time, the standard of basic religious principles is also lowered to pander to the
    demands of polluted and selfish minds. Man should not violate universal moral codes to
    suit his own greed or indulgence; rather man should try to adjust himself according to
    these codes taught by religion. Religious precepts have been introduced by enlightened
    religious teachers who have realized the noble way of life which leads to peace and
    happiness. Those who violate these precepts transgress the universal laws, which,
    according to Buddhism will bring bad effects through the working of moral causation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This does not mean, on the other hand, that a person
    should slavishly follow what is found in his religion, regardless of its applicability to
    modern times. Religious laws and precepts should enable people to lead a meaningful life,
    and are not to be used to bind them to archaic practices and superstitious rituals and
    beliefs. A person who upholds the basic religious principles should give credit to human
    intelligence and live respectably with human dignity. There must be some changes in our
    religious activities to correspond to our education and the nature of our changing
    society, without at the same time sacrificing the noble universal principles. But it is
    recognized that making changes to any religious practices is always difficult because many
    conservative people are opposed to changes, even if they are for the better. Such
    conservative views are like a stagnant pool of water, while fresh ideas are like the
    waterfall where the water is constantly being renewed and is, therefore, usable. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="+1">Distortion of Religion</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Despite the value of religion in moral upliftment,
    it is also true to say that religion is a fertile soil for the development of
    superstitions and devotional hypocrisy, wrapped under the cloak of religiosity. Many
    people use religion to escape from the realities of life and put on the garb of religion
    and religious symbols. They may even pray very often in places of worship, yet they are
    not sincerely religious minded and have not understood what religion stands for. When a
    religion has been debased by ignorance, greed for power and selfishness, people quickly
    point an accusing finger and say that religion is irrational. But 'Religion'(the
    ritualistic external practice of any teaching)must be distinguished from the teaching
    itself. Before one criticizes, one must study the original teachings of the founder and
    see it there is anything intrinsically wrong with it.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Religion advise people to do good and be good, but they
    are not interested in acting thus. Instead they prefer to cling to the other practices
    which have no real religious values. Had they tried to culture their minds by eradicating
    jealousy, pride, cruelty and selfishness, at least they would have found the correct way
    to practise a religion. Unfortunately, they develop jealousy, pride, cruelty and
    selfishness instead of eradicating them. Many people pretend to be religious, but commit
    the greatest atrocities in the name of religion. They fight, discriminate and create
    unrest for the sake of religion, losing sight of its lofty purpose. From the increase in
    the performance of various so-called religious activities, we may get the impression that
    religion is progressing, but the opposite is really the case since very little mental
    purity and understanding are actually being practised. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Practising a religion is nothing than the
    development of one's inner awareness, goodwill and understanding. Problems would have to
    be faced squarely by relying on one's spiritual strength. Running away from one's problems
    in the name of spiritualism is not courageous, much less to be regarded as spiritual.
    Under today's chaotic conditions, men and women are rapidly sliding downhill to their own
    destruction. They irony is that they imagine they are progressing towards a glorious
    civilization that is yet to be realized.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In the midst of this confusion, imaginary and
    plastic religious concepts are propagated to create more temptation and confusion in man's
    mind. Religion is being misused for personal gain and power. Certain immoral practices,
    such as free sex, have been encouraged by some irresponsible religious groups to introduce
    their religion among youths. By arousing lustful feelings, these groups hope to seduce
    boys and girls into following their religion. Today religion has degenerated into a cheap
    commodity in the religious market giving scant regard to moral values and what they stand
    for. Some missionaries claim that the practice of morals, ethics and precepts are not
    important as long as a person has faith and prays to God, which is believed to be
    sufficient to grant him salvation. Having witnessed how some religious authorities have
    misled and blindfolded their followers in Europe, Karl Marx made a caustic remark:
    'Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the feelings of a heartless world, just
    as it is the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Man needs a religion not for the reason of giving
    him a dream for his next life or providing him with some dogmatic ideas to follow, in such
    a way that he surrenders his human intelligence and becomes a nuisance to his fellow
    beings. A religion should be a reliable and reasonable method for people to live 'here and
    now' as cultured, understanding beings, while setting a good example for others to follow.
    Many religions turn man's thoughts away from himself towards a supreme being, but Buddhism
    directs man's search for peace inward to the potentialities that lie hidden within
    himself. '<i>Dhamma'</i>(meaning, to hold on)is not something a person searches outside
    himself, because in the final analysis, man is <i>Dhamma</i>and <i>Dhamma</i>is man.
    Therefore, true religion, which is <i>Dhamma,</i>is not something outside us that we
    acquire, but the cultivation and realization of wisdom, compassion and purity that we
    develop within ourselves.</font> </font></p>
