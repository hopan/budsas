      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The Buddha is the greatest conqueror the world has ever
      seen. His Teaching illuminates the way for mankind to cross from a world of darkness,
      hatred and suffering to a new world of light, love and happiness.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">G</font><font face="Times New Roman">autama the
    Buddha was not a mythical figure but an actual, historical personality who introduced the
    religion known today as Buddhism. Evidence to prove the existence of this great religious
    Teacher are to be found in the following facts: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The testimonies of those who knew Him personally. These
    testimonies were recorded in the rock-inscriptions, pillars and pagodas made in His
    honour. These testimonies and monuments to His memory were created by kings and others who
    were near enough to His time to be able to verify the story of His life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The discovery of places and the remains of buildings that
    were mentioned in the narrative of His time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Sangha, the holy order which He founded, has had an
    unbroken existence to the present day. The Sangha possessed the facts of His life and
    Teachings which have been transmitted from generation to generation in various parts of
    the world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fact that in the very year of His death, and at
    various times subsequently, conventions and councils of the Sangha were held for the
    verification of the actual Teachings of the Founder. These verified Teachings have been
    passed on from teacher to pupil from His time to the present day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After His passing away, His body was cremated and the
    bodily relics were divided among eight kingdoms in India. Each king built a pagoda to
    contain his portion of the relics. The portion given to King Ajatasatthu was enshrined by
    him in a pagoda at Rajagriha. Less than two centuries later, Emperor Asoka took the relics
    and distributed them throughout his empire. The inscriptions enshrined in this and other
    pagodas confirmed that those were the relics of Gautama the Buddha.</font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">'The Mahavansa', the best and authentic ancient
    history known to us gives detailed particulars of life as well as details of the life of
    Emperor Asoka and all other sovereigns related to Buddhist history. Indian history has
    also given a prominent place to the Buddha's life, activities, Buddhist traditions and
    customs.</font></font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">The records which we can find in the Buddhist
    countries where people received Buddhism a few hundred years after the Buddha's passing
    away such as Sri Lanka, Burma, China, Tibet, Nepal, Korea, Mongolia, Japan, Thailand,
    Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos show unbroken historical, cultural, religious, literary and
    traditional evidence that there was religious Teacher in India known as Gautama the
    Buddha.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Tripitaka, an unbroken record of His 45 years of
    Teaching is more than sufficient to prove that the Buddha really lived in the world.</font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">The accuracy and authenticity of the Buddhist texts
    is supported by the fact that they provide information for historians to write Indian
    history during the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> century B.C. The texts, which
    represent the earliest reliable written records in India, provide a profound insight into
    the socio-economic, cultural and political environment and conditions during the Buddha's
    lifetime as well as into the lives of His contemporaries, such as King Bimbisara.</font></font></p>
