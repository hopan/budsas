    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The Buddha considered economic welfare as a requisite
      for human happiness, but moral and spiritual development for a happy, peaceful and
      contented life.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font><font size="6">A</font> man named Dighajanu once
    visited the Buddha and said, 'Venerable Sir, we are ordinary laymen, leading a family life
    with wife and children. Would the Blessed One teach us some doctrines which will be
    conducive to our happiness in this world and hereafter?</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha told him that there are four things which
    are conducive to a man's happiness in this world. First: he should be skilled, efficient,
    earnest, and energetic in whatever profession he is engaged, and he should know it well (<i>utthana-sampada</i>);
    second: he should protect his income, which he has thus earned righteously, with the sweat
    of his brow (<i>arakkha-sampada</i>); third: he should have good friends (<i>kalyana-mitta</i>)
    who are faithful, learned, virtuous, liberal and intelligent, who will help him along the
    right path away from evil; fourth: he should spend reasonably, in proportion to his
    income, neither too much nor too little, i.e., he should not hoard wealth avariciously nor
    should he be extravagant?in other words he should live within his means <i>(sama-jivikata).</i></font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Then the Buddha expounds the four virtues conducive
    to a layman's happiness hereafter: (1)<i>Saddha:</i> he should have faith and confidence
    in moral, spiritual and intellectual values; (2)<i>Sila:</i> he should abstain from
    destroying and harming life, from stealing and cheating, from adultery, from falsehood,
    and from intoxicating drinks; (3)<i>Caga: </i>he should practise charity, generosity,
    without attachment and craving for his wealth;(4)<i>Panna:</i> he should develop wisdom
    which leads to the complete destruction of suffering, to the realization of <i>Nibbana.</i></font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes the Buddha even went into details about saving
    money and spending it, as, for instance, when he told the young man <i>Sigala</i> that he
    should spend on fourth of his income on his daily expenses, invest half in his business
    and put aside one fourth for any emergency. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once the Buddha told Anathapindika, the great banker, one
    of His most devoted lay disciples who founded for Him the celebrated Jetavana monastery at
    Savatthi, that a layman who leads an ordinary family life has four kinds of happiness. The
    first happiness is to enjoy economic security or sufficient wealth acquired by just and
    righteous means <i>(atthi-sukha</i>); the second is spending that wealth liberally on
    himself, his family, his friends and relatives, and on meritorious deeds (<i>bhogo-sukha)</i>;
    the third to be free from debts <i>(anana-sukha)</i>; the fourth happiness is to live a
    faultless, and a pure life without committing evil in thought, word or deed (<i>anavajja-sukha)</i>.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>It must be noted here that first three are economic
    and material happiness which is 'not worth part' of the spiritual happiness arising out of
    a faultless and good life.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the few examples given above, one can see that the
    Buddha considered economic welfare as a requisite for human happiness, but that He did not
    recognize progress as real and true if it was only material, devoid of a spiritual and
    moral foundation. While encouraging material progress, Buddhism always lays great stress
    on the development of the moral and spiritual character for a happy, peaceful and
    contented society. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many people think that to be a good Buddhist one must have
    absolutely nothing to do with the materialistic life. This is not correct. What the Buddha
    teaches is that while we can enjoy material comforts without going to extremes, we must
    also conscientiously develop the spiritual aspects of our lives. While we can enjoy
    sensual pleasures as laymen, we should never be unduly attached to them to the extent that
    they hinder our spiritual progress. Buddhism emphasizes the need for a man to follow the
    Middle Path. </font></p>
