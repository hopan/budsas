    Power </font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>f a wicked man can become a pure
    religious man, this according to Buddhism, is a practical miracle. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In every religion we hear of miracles being performed by
    either the founders of these religious or by some of their disciples. In the case of the
    Buddha, miracles occurred from the day of His birth until His passing away into <i>Nibbana.</i>
    Many of the psychic powers (so-called miraculous powers in other religions) of the Buddha
    were attained through His long and intense training in meditation. The Buddha meditated
    and passed through all the highest stages of contemplation that culminated in pure
    self-possession and wisdom. Such attainments through meditation are considered nothing
    miraculous but fall within the power of any trained ascetic. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Using meditation on the night of His Enlightenment,
    there arose within the Buddha a vision of His previous births, the many existences with
    all their details, He remembered His previous births and how He had made use of these
    births to gain His Enlightenment. Then the Buddha had a second and wider vision in which
    He saw the whole universe as a system of <i>Kamma </i>and <i>Rebirth</i>. He saw the
    universe made up of beings that were noble and wicked, happy and unhappy. He saw them all
    continually 'passing away according to their deed', leaving one form of existence and
    taking shape in another. Finally, He understood the nature of Suffering, the cessation of
    Suffering and the Path that leads to the cessation of Suffering. Then a third vision arose
    within the Buddha. He realized that He was completely free from all bondages, human or
    divine. He realized that He had done what had to be done. He realized He had no more
    re-birth to go through because He was living with His final body. This knowledge destroyed
    all ignorance, all darkness, and light arose within Him. Such is the psychic power and the
    wisdom that arose within the Buddha as He sat meditating under the Bodhi tree.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha had a natural birth; He lived in a normal
    way. But He was an extraordinary man, as far as His Enlightenment was concerned. Those who
    have not learnt to appreciate His Supreme Wisdom try to explain His greatness by peeping
    into His life and looking for miracles. However, the Buddha's Supreme Enlightenment is
    more than enough for us to understand His greatness. There is no need to show His
    greatness by introducing any miraculous power.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha knew of the power that could be developed
    by training the human mind. He also knew that His disciples could acquire such powers
    through mental development. Thus the Buddha advised them not to exercise such psychic
    power in order to convert less intelligent people. He was referring to the 'miraculous'
    power to walk on water, to exorcise spirits, raise the dead and perform the so-called
    supernormal practices. He was also referring to the 'miracles of prophesy' such as
    thought-reading, soothe-saying, fortune-telling, and so on. When the uneducated believers
    see the performance of such powers, their faith deepens. But the nominal converts who are
    attracted to a religion because of these powers embrace a faith, not because they realize
    the truth, but because they harbor hallucinations. Besides, some people may pass remarks
    that these miracles are due to certain charms. In drawing people to listen to the Dhamma,
    the Buddha appealed to their reasoning power.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The following story illustrates the Buddha's
    attitude towards miraculous powers. One day the Buddha met an ascetic who sat by the bank
    of a river. This ascetic had practised austerities for 25 years. The Buddha asked him what
    he had received for all his labour. The ascetic proudly replied that, now at last, he
    could cross the river by walking on the water. The Buddha pointed out that this gain was
    insignificant for all the years of labour, since he could cross the river using a ferry
    for one penny!</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In certain religions, a man's miraculous performance
    can help him to become a saint. But in Buddhism, miracles can be a hindrance for a person
    to attain sainthood, which is a gradual personal attainment and individual concern. Each
    person himself must work for his sainthood through self-purification and no one else can
    make another person a saint.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha says that a person can gain miraculous power
    without gaining spiritual power. He teaches us that if we first gain spiritual power, then
    we automatically receive the miraculous or psychic powers too. But if we develop
    miraculous powers without spiritual development, then we are in danger. We can misuse this
    power for worldly gain(Pataligama-Udana). There are many who have deviated from the right
    path by using their miraculous powers without having any spiritual development. Many
    people who are supposed to have obtained some miraculous powers succumbed to the vain
    glory of obtaining some worldly gain. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many so-called miracles talked about by people are merely
    imaginations and hallucinations created by their own minds due to a lack of understanding
    of things as they truly are. All these miracles remain as miracles as long as people fail
    to know what these powers really are. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also expressly forbade His disciples to use
    miracles to prove the superiority of His teachings. On one occasion He said that the use
    of miracles to gain converts was like using dancing girls to tempt people to do something.
    Anyone with the proper mental training can perform miracles because they are simply an
    expression of mind over matter. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Buddha, the <i>miracle</i> of <i>realization
    </i>is a real miracle. When a murderer, thief, terrorist, drunkard, or adulterer is made
    to realize that what he had been doing is wrong and gives up his bad, immoral and harmful
    way of life, this change can be regarded as a miracle. The change for the better arising
    from an understanding of Dhamma is the highest miracle that any man can perform. </font></p>
