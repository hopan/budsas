    Buddha's Silence </font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>hen the questioner himself was not
    in a position to understand the real significance of the answer to his question and when
    the questions posed to Him were wrong, the Buddha remained silent. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The scriptures mention a few occasions when the
    Buddha remained silent to questions posed to Him. Some scholars, owing to their
    misunderstanding of the Buddha's silence, came to the hasty conclusion that the Buddha was
    unable to answer to these questions. While it is true that on several occasions the Buddha
    did not respond to these metaphysical and speculative questions, there are reasons why the
    Buddha kept noble silence.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha knew that the questioner was not in a
    position to understand the answer to the question because of its profundity, of if the
    questions themselves were wrongly put in the first place, the Blessed One remained silent.
    Some of the questions to which the Buddha remained silent are as following: </font><dir>
      <blockquote ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Is the universe eternal?<br>
        Is it not eternal?<br>
        Is the universe finite?<br>
        Is it infinite?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Is soul the same as the body?<br>
        Is the soul one thing and the body another?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Does the Tathagata exist after death?<br>
        Does He not exist after death?<br>
        Does He both (at the same time) exist and not exist after death?<br>
        Does He both (at the same time) neither exist nor not exist?</font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </dir>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha who had truly realized the nature of these
    issues observed noble silence. An ordinary person who is still unenlightened might have a
    lot to say, but all of it would be sheer conjecture based on his imagination. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha's silence regarding these questions is
    more meaningful than attempting to deliver thousands of discourses on them. The paucity of
    our human vocabulary which is built upon relative experiences cannot hope to convey the
    depth and dimensions of Reality which a person has not himself experienced through
    Insight. On several occasions, the Buddha had very patiently explained that human language
    was too limited and could not describe the Ultimate Truth. If the Ultimate Truth is
    absolute, then it does not have any point of reference for worldlings with only mundane
    experiences and relative understanding to fully comprehend it. When they try to do so with
    their limited mental conception, they misunderstand the Truth like the seven blind men and
    the elephant. The listener who had not realized the Truth could not fathom the explanation
    given, just like a man who was blind since birth will have no way of truly understanding
    the color of the sky.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha did not attempt to give answers to all the
    questions put to Him. He was under no obligation to respond to meaningless questions which
    reflected gross misunderstanding on the part of spiritual development. He was a practical
    Teacher, full of compassion and wisdom. He always spoke to people fully understanding
    their temperament, capability and capacity to comprehend. When a person asked questions
    not with the intention to learn how to lead a religious life but simply to create an
    opportunity for splitting hairs, the Blessed One did not answer these questions. Questions
    were answered to help a person towards self-realization, not as a way of showing His
    towering wisdom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>According to the Buddha, there are several ways of
    answering various types of questions. The first type of question is one that requires a
    definite answer, such as a 'yes' or 'no'. For example, the question, 'Are all conditioned
    things impermanent?' is answered with a 'Yes'. The second type of question is one
    requiring an analytical answer. Suppose someone says that Angulimala was a murderer before
    he became an &quot;Arahant&quot;. So is it possible for all murderers to become Arahants?
    This question should be analyzed before you can say 'Yes' or 'No'. Otherwise, it will not
    be answered correctly and comprehensively. You need to analyse what conditions make it
    possible for a murderer to become a saint within one lifetime.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The third type of question is one where it is
    necessary to ask a counter question to help the questioner to think through. If you ask,
    &quot;Why is it wrong to kill other living beings?' the counter question is, 'How does it
    feel when others try to kill you?' The fourth kind of question is one that should be
    dropped. It means that you should not answer it. These are the questions which are
    speculative in nature, and any answer to such questions will only create ore confusion. An
    example of such a question is, 'Does the universe have a beginning or not?' People can
    discuss such questions for years without coming to a conclusion. They can only answer such
    questions based on their imagination, not on real understanding.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Some answers which the Buddha gave have close
    parallels to the kind responses which are given in nuclear science. According to Robert
    Oppenheimer, 'If we ask, for instance, whether the position of the electron remains the
    same, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether it is in motion, we must say 'no'. The Buddha
    has given such answers when interrogated as to the conditions of a man's self after his
    death; but they are not familiar answers in accordance with the tradition of seventeenth
    and eighteenth century science.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is important to note however that the Buddha did give
    answers to some of these questions to His most intellectually developed disciples after
    the questioner had left. And in many cases, His explanations are contained in other
    discourses which show us, who live in an age of greater scientific knowledge, why these
    questions were not answered by the Buddha just to satisfy the inquisitive minds of the
    questioners. </font></p>
