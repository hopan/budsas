    Buddha's Attitude Towards Worldly Knowledge </font></h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Worldly knowledge can never help one to lead a pure
      religious life for gaining peace and emancipation. </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font><font size="6">W</font>orldly knowledge is useful
    for worldly ends. With such knowledge, mankind learns how to use the earth's resources to
    improve the standard of living, grow more food, generate power to run factories and to
    light up streets and houses, manage factories and businesses, cure sickness, build flats
    and bridges, cook exotic dishes, and so on. Worldly knowledge can also be used for harmful
    purposes such as building missiles with nuclear warheads, manipulating the stock market,
    cheating 'legally', and inflaming political anxiety and hatred. Despite the rapid
    expansion of worldly knowledge, especially in the twentieth century, mankind has been
    brought no nearer to the solution of his spiritual problems and pervasive
    unsatisfactoriness. In all likelihood, it never will solve mankind's universal problems
    and bring peace and happiness because of the premises on which such knowledge, discoveries
    and inventions are built.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While Buddhism can bring greater understanding on how to
    lead a good, worldly life, its main focus is how to gain spiritual liberation through the
    development of wisdom and mental culture. For ordinary human beings, there is no end to
    the search for worldly knowledge, but in the final analysis it does not really matter. For
    as long as we are ignorant about the Dhamma, we will forever be trapped in Samsara.
    According to the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'For a long time, Brothers, have you suffered the
    death of a mother; for a long time, the death of a father; for a long time, the death of a
    son; for a long time, the death of a daughter; for a long time, the death of brothers and
    sisters; for a long time, have you undergone the loss of your goods; for a long time have
    you been afflicted with disease. And because you have experienced the death of a mother,
    the death of brothers and sisters, the loss of goods, the pangs of disease, company of the
    undesired, you have truly shed more tears upon this long way -- hastening from birth to
    death, from death to birth -- than all the waters that are held in the four great seas.'
    (Anguttara Nikaya)Here the Buddha is describing the Suffering of continuous births and
    deaths in the world. He was interested in one simple thing; to show people the Way out of
    all this Suffering.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Why did the Buddha speak in this manner to His
    disciples? And why did He not make an attempt to solve the problems as to whether the
    world is eternal or not, whether it is finite or not? Such problems might be exciting and
    stimulating to those who have the curiosity. But in no way do these problems help a person
    to overcome Suffering. That is why He swept these problems aside as useless, for the
    knowledge of such things would not tend to one's well-being.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, foresaw that to speak on things which were of
    no practical value, and which were lying beyond the power of comprehension, was a waste of
    time and energy. He foresaw that to advance hypotheses about such things only served to
    divert thoughts from their proper channel, hindering spiritual development. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Worldly knowledge and scientific research should be
    complemented by religious and spiritual values. Otherwise such worldly knowledge does not
    in any way contribute to one's progress in leading a pure, religious life. Man has come to
    the stage where his mind, fed by the instruments and fruits of technological advancements,
    has become obsessed with egoism, craving for power, and greed for material wealth. Without
    religious values, worldly knowledge and technological advancement can lead to man's
    downfall and destruction. They will only inflame man's greed which will take on new and
    terrifying dimensions. On the other hand, when worldly knowledge is harnessed for moral
    ends, it can bring maximum benefit and happiness for mankind.</font> </font></p>
