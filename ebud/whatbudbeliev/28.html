    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <i>Buddha--the flower of mankind, is no more in this world, but the sweet fragrance of His
      peace message remains forever.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font><font size="6">B</font>uddhism is one of the oldest
    religions still being practised in the world today. While the names of many other
    religions which existed in India have been forgotten today, the teachings of the Buddha,
    (better known as the Dhamma) are still relevant to the needs of today's society. This is
    because the Buddha has always considered himself as<i> human </i>religious teacher whose
    message was meant to promote the happiness and well-being of other human beings. The
    Buddha's primary concern was to help His followers to live a normal life without either
    going to the extremes of self-denial or totally surrendering to sensual desires.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The practical nature of the Buddha's teaching is
    revealed in the fact that not everyone is expected to attain exactly the same goal in one
    lifetime, since the mental impurities are deeply rooted. Some people are spiritually more
    advanced than others and they can proceed to greater heights according to their state of
    development. But every single human being has the ultimate potential to attain the supreme
    goal of Buddhahood if he has the determination and will to do so.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Even now does the soft, sweet voice of the Buddha
    ring in our ears. And sometimes we perhaps feel a little ashamed because we do not
    understand Him fully. Often we only praise His Teaching and respect Him, but do not try to
    practise what He preached. The Buddha's Teaching and message have had their effect on all
    people for thousands of years whether they believe in religion or not. His message is for
    all.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Though the Buddha, the flower of mankind, is no longer in
    this world, the sweet fragrance and exquisite aroma of His Teachings have spread far and
    wide. Its balmy, diffusing fragrance has calmed and soothed millions. Its ambrosial
    perfume has heartened and cheered every nation which it has penetrated. The reason that
    His Teachings have captured millions of hearts is because they were spread(not by weapons
    or political power)but by love and compassion for humanity. Not a drop of blood stains its
    pure path. Buddhism wins by the warm touch of love, not by the cold claws of fear. Fear of
    the supernatural and the doctrine of everlasting hell-fire have no place in Buddhism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the last 25 centuries since the appearance of the
    Buddha, many changes have taken place in this world. Kingdoms have risen and fallen;
    nations have prospered and perished. However, the world today has forgotten many of these
    past civilizations. But the name of the Buddha remains alive and fresh in the minds of
    millions of people today. The Kingdom of Righteousness that He built is still strong and
    steady. Although many temples, pagodas, images, libraries and other religious symbols
    erected in His honor were destroyed, His untainted Noble Name and the message He gave
    remain in the minds of cultured people. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha taught man that the greatest of conquests
    was not the subjugation of others but of the self. He taught in the <i>Dhammapada</i>,
    'Even though a man conquers ten thousand men in battle, he who conquers but himself is the
    greatest of conquerors'.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps the best example of how the gentle message of the
    Compassionate One could rehabilitate the most savage of men is the case of the Emperor
    Asoka. About two hundred years after the Buddha, this king waged fierce battles across
    India and caused great anguish and fear. But when he absorbed the Dhamma, he regretted the
    evil that he had done. We remember and honor him today because after his conversion to the
    path of peace, he embarked on another battle: a battle to bring peace to mankind. He
    proved without doubt that the Buddha was right when He asserted that true greatness
    springs from love, not hatred, from humility, not pride; from compassion, not cruelty. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Emperor Asoka's conversion from cruelty to
    kindness was so complete that he forbade even the killing of animals in his kingdom. He
    realized that his subjects stole because of want and he set out to reduce want in his
    kingdom. But above all, he instructed the followers of the Buddha to remember the Master's
    teaching never to force their beliefs on others who were loyal to other religious leaders.
    In other cases we have heard of kings who, upon conversion, diverted their thirst for
    blood by spreading their new religion by the sword! Only Buddhism can take pride in a king
    who has never been equaled in such greatness before or ever since.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha's Teachings were introduced in order that
    societies could be cultured and civilized and live in peace and harmony. All of life's
    most difficult problems can be better understood if we but try to learn and practise His
    teachings. The Buddha's approach to the problems and suffering of mankind is
    straightforward and direct.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was the greatest conqueror the world has ever
    seen. He conquered the world with His infallible weapons of love and truth. His Teaching
    illuminates the Way for mankind to cross from a world of darkness, hatred, and suffering,
    to a new world of light, love and happiness. </font></p>
