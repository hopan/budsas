    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Buddhism is neither pessimistic nor optimistic but a
      realistic religion.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">S</font><font face="Times New Roman">ome critics
    argue that Buddhism is morbid, cynical, hovering on the dark and shadowy side of life, an
    enemy of harmless pleasures, and an unfeeling trampler on the innocent joys of life. They
    see Buddhism as being pessimistic, as fostering an attitude of hopelessness towards life,
    as encouraging a vague, general feeling that pain and evil predominate in human affairs.
    These critics base their views on the First Noble Truth that all conditioned things are in
    a state of suffering. They seem to have forgotten that not only had the Buddha taught the
    cause and end of Suffering, but he had taught the way to <i>end</i> Suffering. In any
    case, is there any religious teacher who praised this worldly life and advised us to cling
    to it? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the founder of this religion, the Buddha, was such a
    pessimist, one would expect His personality to be portrayed on more severe lines than has
    been done. The Buddha image is the personification of Peace, Serenity, Hope and Goodwill.
    The magnetic and radiant smile of the Buddha which is said to be inscrutable and
    enigmatic, is the epitome of His doctrine. To the worried and the frustrated, His smile of
    Enlightenment and hope is an unfailing tonic and soothing balm. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha radiated His love and compassion in all
    directions. Such a person can hardly be a pessimist. And when the sword-happy kings and
    princes listened to Him, they realized that the only true conquest is the conquest of the
    Self and the best way to win the hearts of the people was to teach them to appreciate the
    Dhamma - Truth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha cultivated His sense of humor to such a high
    degree that His bitter opponents were disarmed with the greatest ease. Often they could
    not help laughing at themselves. The Buddha had a wonderful tonic; He cleaned their
    systems of dangerous toxins and they became enthusiastic thereafter to follow in His
    footsteps. In His sermons, dialogues and discussions, He maintained that poise and dignity
    which won for Him the respect and affection of the people. How can such a person be a
    pessimist? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha never expected His followers to be constantly
    brooding over the suffering of life and leading a miserable and unhappy existence. He
    taught the fact of suffering only so that He could show people how to overcome this
    suffering and move in the direction of happiness. To become an Enlightened person, one
    must have joy, one of the factors that the Buddha recommended us to cultivate. Joy is
    hardly pessimistic. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>There are two Buddhists texts called the <i>Theragatha</i>
    and <i>Therigatha</i> which are full of the joyful utterances of the Buddha's disciples,
    both male and female, who found peace and happiness in life through His Teaching. The king
    of Kosala once told the Buddha that unlike many a disciple of other religious systems who
    looked haggard, coarse, pale, emaciated and unprepossessing, His disciples were 'joyful
    and elated, jubilant and exultant, enjoying the spiritual life, serene, peaceful and
    living with a gazelle's mind, light-hearted.' The king added that he believed that this
    healthy disposition was due to the fact that 'these Venerable Ones had certainly realized
    the great and full significance of the Blessed One's Teachings'(<i>Majjhima Nikaya)</i>.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>When asked why His disciples, who lived a simple and
    quiet life with only one meal a day, were so radiant, the Buddha replied: 'They do not
    repent the past, nor do they brood over the future. They live in the present. Therefore
    they are radiant. By brooding over the future and repenting the past, fools dry up like
    green reeds cut down [in the sun]&quot; (<em>Samyutta Nikaya</em>).</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a religion, Buddhism preaches the unsatisfactory nature
    of everything in this world. Yet one cannot simply categorize Buddhism as a pessimistic
    religion, because it also teaches us how to get rid of this unhappiness. According to the
    Buddha, even the worst sinner, after paying for what he has done, can attain salvation.
    Buddhism offers every human being the hope of attaining his salvation one day. Other
    religions, however, take it for granted that some people will be bad forever and have an
    eternal hell waiting for them. In that respect, such religions are more pessimistic.
    Buddhists deny such a belief. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is neither optimistic nor pessimistic. It does
    not encourage man to look at the world through his changing feelings of optimism and
    pessimism. Rather, Buddhism encourages us to be realistic: we must learn to see things as
    they truly are. </font></p>
