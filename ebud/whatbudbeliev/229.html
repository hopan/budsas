    and Politics </font></h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The Buddha had gone beyond all worldly affairs, but
      still gave advice on good government.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font face="Times New Roman">he Buddha
    came from a warrior caste and was naturally brought into association with kings, princes
    and ministers. Despite His origin and association, He never resorted to the influence of
    political power to introduce His teaching, nor allowed His Teaching to be misused for
    gaining political power. But today, many politicians try to drag the Buddha's name into
    politics by introducing Him as a communist, capitalist, or even an imperialist. They have
    forgotten that the new political philosophy as we know it really developed in the West
    long after the Buddha's time. Those who try to make use of the good name of the Buddha for
    their own personal advantage must remember that the Buddha was the Supremely Enlightened
    One who had gone beyond all worldly concerns. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is an inherent problem of trying to intermingle
    religion with politics. The basis of religion is morality, purity and faith, while that
    for politics is power. In the course of history, religion has often been used to give
    legitimacy to those in power and their exercise of that power. Religion was used to
    justify wars and conquests, persecutions, atrocities, rebellions, destruction of works of
    art and culture. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When religion is used to pander to political whims, it has
    to forego its high moral ideals and become debased by worldly political demands. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The thrust of the Buddha Dhamma is not directed to the
    creation of new political institutions and establishing political arrangements. Basically,
    it seeks to approach the problems of society by reforming the individuals constituting
    that society and by suggesting some general principles through which the society can be
    guided towards greater humanism, improved welfare of its members, and more equitable
    sharing of resources. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a limit to the extent to which a political system
    can safeguard the happiness and prosperity of its people. No political system, no matter
    how ideal it may appear to be, can bring about peace and happiness as long as the people
    in the system are dominated by greed, hatred and delusion. In addition, no matter what
    political system is adopted, there are certain universal factors which the members of that
    society will have to experience: the effects of good and bad kamma, the lack of real
    satisfaction or everlasting happiness in the world characterized by <i>dukkha</i>
    (unsatisfactoriness), <i>anicca</i> (impermanence), and <i>anatta</i> (egolessness). To
    the Buddhist, nowhere in Samsara is there <i>real freedom,</i> not even in the heavens or
    the world of <i>Brahama</i>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although a good and just political system which guarantees
    basic human rights and contains checks and balances to the use of power is an important
    condition for a happy in society, people should not fritter away their time by endlessly
    searching for the ultimate political system where men can be completely free, because
    complete freedom cannot be found in any system but only in minds which are free. To be
    free, people will have to look within their own minds and work towards freeing themselves
    from the chains of ignorance and craving. Freedom in the truest sense is only possible
    when a person uses Dhamma to develop his character through good speech and action and to
    train his mind so as to expand his mental potential and achieve his ultimate aim of
    enlightenment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While recognizing the usefulness of separating religion
    from politics and the limitations of political systems in bringing about peace and
    happiness, there are several aspects of the Buddha<font>'s teaching which have close
    correspondence to the political arrangements of the present day. Firstly, the Buddha spoke
    about the equality of all human beings long before Abraham Lincoln, and that classes and
    castes are artificial barriers erected by society. The only classification of human
    beings, according to the Buddha, is based on the quality of their moral conduct. Secondly,
    the Buddha encouraged the spirit of social -co-operation and active participation in
    society. This spirit is actively promoted in the political process of modern societies.
    Thirdly, since no one was appointed as the Buddha's successor, the members of the Order
    were to be guided by the Dhamma and Vinaya, or in short, the Rule of Law. Until today very
    member of the Sangha is to abide by the Rule of Law which governs and guides their
    conduct.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Fourthly, the Buddha encouraged the spirit of
    consultation and the democratic process. This is shown within the community of the Order
    in which all members have the right to decide on matters of general concern. When a
    serious question arose demanding attention, the issues were put before the monks and
    discussed in a manner similar to the democratic parliamentary system used today. This
    self-governing procedure may come as a surprise to many to learn that in the assemblies of
    Buddhists in India 2,500 years and more ago are to be found the rudiments of the
    parliamentary practice of the present day. A special officer similar to 'Mr. Speaker' was
    appointed to preserve the dignity of the Parliamentary Chief Whip, was also appointed to
    see if the quorum was secured. Matters were put forward in the form of a motion which was
    open to discussion. In some cases it was done once, in others three times, thus
    anticipating the practice of Parliament in requiring that a bill be read a third time
    before it becomes law. If the discussion showed a difference of opinion, it was to be
    settled by the vote of the majority through balloting.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddhist approach to political power is the
    moralization and the responsible use of public power. The Buddha preached non-violence and
    peace as a universal message. He did not approve of violence or the destruction of life,
    and declared that there is no such thing as a 'just' war. He taught: 'The victor breeds
    hatred, the defeated lives in misery. He who renounces both victory and defeat is happy
    and peaceful.' Not only did the Buddha teach non-violence and peace, He was perhaps the
    first and only religious teacher who went to the battlefield personally to prevent the
    outbreak of a war. He diffused tension between the Sakyas and the Koliyas who were about
    to wage war over the waters of Rohini. He also dissuaded King Ajatasattu from attacking
    the Kingdom of the <i>Vajjis.</i></font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha discussed the importance and the prerequisites
    of a good government. He showed how the country could become corrupt, degenerate and
    unhappy when the head of the government becomes corrupt and unjust. He spoke against
    corruption and how a government should act based on humanitarian principles. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha once said, 'When the ruler of a country
    is just and good, the ministers become just and good; when the ministers are just and
    good, the higher officials become just and good; when the higher officials are just and
    good, the rank and file become just and good; when the rank and file become just and good,
    the people become just and good.'(<i>Anguttara Nikaya</i>)</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <i>Cakkavatti Sihananda Sutta</i>, the Buddha said
    that immorality and crime, such as theft, falsehood, violence, hatred, cruelty, could
    arise from poverty. Kings and governments may try to suppress crime through punishment,
    but it is futile to eradicate crimes through force. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In the <i>Kutadanta Sutta, </i>the Buddha suggested
    economic development instead of force to reduce crime. The government should use the
    country's resources to improve the economic conditions of the country. It could embark on
    agricultural and rural development, provide financial support to entrepreneurs and
    business, provide adequate wages for workers to maintain a decent life with human dignity.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In the <i>Jataka</i>, the Buddha had given to rules
    for Good Government, known as '<i>Dasa Raja Dharma'.</font> </i>These ten rules can be
    applied even today by any government which wishes to rule the country peacefully. The
    rules are as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) be liberal and avoid selfishness,<br>
      2) maintain a high moral character,<br>
      3) be prepared to sacrifice one<font>'s own pleasure for the well-being of the subjects,<br>
      </font>4) be honest and maintain absolute integrity,<br>
      5) be kind and gentle,<br>
      6) lead a simple life for the subjects to emulate,<br>
      7) be free from hatred of any kind,<br>
      8) exercise non-violence,<br>
      9) practise patience, and<br>
      10) respect public opinion to promote peace and harmony.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Regarding the behavior of rulers, He further advised:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- A good ruler should act impartially and should not be
      biased and discriminate between one particular group of subjects against another.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- A good ruler should not harbor any form of hatred
      against any of his subjects.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- A good ruler should show no fear whatsoever in the
      enforcement of the law, if it is justifiable.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- A good ruler must possess a clear understanding of the
      law to be enforced. It should not be enforced just because the ruler has the authority to
      enforce the law. It must be done in a reasonable manner and with common sense. -- (<em>Cakkavatti
      Sihananda Sutta</em>)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">In the <i>Milinda Panha,</i>it is stated: 'If
    a man, who is unfit, incompetent, immoral, improper, unable and unworthy of kingship, has
    enthroned himself a king or a ruler with great authority, he is subject to be
    tortured&#130; to be subject to a variety of punishment by the people, because, being
    unfit and unworthy, he has placed himself unrighteously in the seat of sovereignty. The
    ruler, like others who violate and transgress moral codes and basic rules of all social
    laws of mankind, is equally subject to punishment; and moreover, to be censured is the
    ruler who conducts himself as a robber of the public.' In a Jataka story, it is mentioned
    that a ruler who punishes innocent people and does not punish the culprit is not suitable
    to rule a country. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The king always improves himself and carefully
    examines his own conduct in deeds, words and thoughts, trying to discover and listen to
    public opinion as to whether or not he had been guilty of any faults and mistakes in
    ruling the kingdom. If it is found that he rules unrighteously, the public will complain
    that they are ruined by the wicked ruler with unjust treatment, punishment, taxation, or
    other oppressions including corruption of any kind, and they will react against him in one
    way or another. On the contrary, if he rules righteously they will bless him: 'Long live
    His Majesty.' <i>(Majjhima Nikaya)</i></font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The Buddha's</i><font>emphasis on the moral duty of a
    ruler to use public power to improve the welfare of the people had inspired Emperor Asoka
    in the Third Century B.C. to do likewise. Emperor Asoka, a sparkling example of this
    principle, resolved to live according to and preach the Dhamma and to serve his subjects
    and all humanity. He declared his non-aggressive intentions to his neighbors, assuring
    them of his goodwill and sending envoys to distant kings bearing his message of peace and
    non-aggression. He promoted the energetic practice of the socio-moral virtues of honesty,
    truthfulness, compassion, benevolence, non-violence, considerate behavior towards all,
    non-extravagance, non-acquisitiveness, and non-injury to animals. He encouraged religious
    freedom and mutual respect for each other's creed. He went on periodic tours preaching the
    Dhamma to the rural people. He undertook works of public utility, such as founding of
    hospitals for men and animals, supplying of medicine, planting of roadside trees and
    groves, digging of wells, and construction of watering sheds and rest houses. He expressly
    forbade cruelty to animals.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes the Buddha is said to be a social reformer.
    Among other things, He condemned the caste system, recognized the equality of people,
    spoke on the need to improve socio-economic conditions, recognized the importance of a
    more equitable distribution of wealth among the rich and the poor, raised the status of
    women, recommended the incorporation of humanism in government and administration, and
    taught that a society should not be run by greed but with consideration and compassion for
    the people. Despite all these, His contribution to mankind is much greater because He took
    off at a point which no other social reformer before or ever since had done, that is, by
    going to the deepest roots of human ill which are found in the human mind. It is only in
    the human mind that true reform can be effected. Reforms imposed by force upon the
    external world have a very short life because they have no roots. But those reforms which
    spring as a result of the transformation of man<font>'s inner consciousness remain rooted.
    While their branches spread outwards, they draw their nourishment from an unfailing source
    -- the subconscious imperatives of the life-stream itself. </font>So reforms come about
    when men<font>'s minds have prepared the way for them, and they live as long as men
    revitalize them out of their own love of truth, justice and their fellow men.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The doctrine preached by the Buddha is not one based on
    'Political Philosophy'. Nor is it a doctrine that encourages men to worldly pleasures. It
    sets out a way to attain Nibbana. In other words, its ultimate aim is to put an end to
    craving (<i>Tanha</i>) that keeps them in bondage to this world. A stanza from the <i>Dhammapada
    </i>best summarizes this statement:<em> 'The path that leads to worldly gain is one, and
    the path that leads to Nibbana(by leading a religious life)is another.'</em> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, this does not mean that Buddhists cannot or
    should not get involved in the political process, which is a social reality. The lives of
    the members of a society are shaped by laws and regulations, economic arrangements allowed
    within a country, institutional arrangements, which are influenced by the political
    arrangements of that society. Nevertheless, if a Buddhist wishes to be involved in
    politics, he should not misuse religion to gain political powers, nor is it advisable for
    those who have renounced the worldly life to lead a pure, religious life to be actively
    involved in politics. </font></p>
