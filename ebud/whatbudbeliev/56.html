    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The Ultimate Truth can be found in the Teaching of the
      Buddhism.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">B</font>uddhism recognizes two kinds of
    Truth. The apparent conventional truth and the real or ultimate Truth. The ultimate Truth
    can be realized only through meditation, and not theorizing or speculating. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha's Teaching is the Ultimate Truth of the
    world. Buddhism, however, is not a revealed or an organized religion. It is the first
    example of the purely scientific approach applied to questions concerning the ultimate
    nature of existence. This timeless Teaching was discovered by the Buddha Himself without
    the help of any divine agency. This same teaching is strong enough to face any challenge
    without changing the basic principles of the doctrine. Any religion that is forced to
    change or adjust its original Teachings to suit the modern world, is a religion that has
    no firm foundation and no ultimate truth in it. Buddhism can maintain the Truth of the
    original Teaching of the Master even under the difficult conditions prevailing in the
    modern world. The Buddha did not introduce certain personal or worldly practices which
    have no connection with morality or religious observances. To the Buddha, such practices
    have no religious value. We must make the distinction between what the Buddha taught and
    what people preach and practise in the name of Buddhism.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every religion consists of not only the teachings of the
    founder of that religion but also the rites and ceremonies which have grown up around the
    basic core of the teachings. These rituals and ceremonies have their origins in the
    cultural practices of the people who accepted the religion. Usually the founders of the
    great religions do not lay down precise rules about the rituals to be observed. But
    religious leaders who come after them formalize the religion and set up exacting codes of
    behavior which the followers are not allowed to deviated from. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Even the religion which we call 'Buddhism' is very
    different in its external practices from what the Buddha and His early followers carried
    out. Centuries of cultural and environmental influence have made Burmese, Thai, Chinese,
    Tibetan, Sri Lankan and Japanese Buddhism different. But these practices are not in
    conflict, because the Buddha taught that while the Truth remains absolute, the physical
    manifestation of this truth can differ according to the way of life of those who profess
    it.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>A few hundred years after His passing away, the
    disciples of the Buddha organized a religion around the Teachings of the Master. While
    organizing the religion, they incorporated, among other concepts and beliefs, various
    types of miracles, mysticism, fortune-telling, charms, talismans, mantras, prayers and
    many rites and rituals that were not found in the original Teaching. When these extraneous
    religious beliefs and practices were introduced, many people neglected to develop the most
    important practices found in the original Teaching; self-discipline, self-restraint,
    cultivation of morality and spiritual development. Instead of practicing the original
    Teaching, they gave more of their attention and effort to self-protection from evil
    spirits and sought after prosperity or good luck. Gradually, people began to lose interest
    in the original Teachings and became more interested in discovering ways and means of
    getting rid of the so-called misfortunes or bad influences of stars, black magic, and
    sickness. In this manner, through time the religious practices and beliefs degenerated,
    being confined to worldly pursuits. Even today, many people believe that they can get rid
    of their difficulties through the influence of external powers. People still cling to this
    belief: hence they neglect to cultivate the strength of their will-power, intelligence,
    understanding and other related human qualities. In other words, people started to abuse
    their human intelligence by following those beliefs and practices in the name of Buddhism.
    They also polluted the purity of the Buddha's message.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the modern religion we see in many countries is the
    product of normal human beings living in a country and adjusting to various social and
    cultural environments. However, Buddhism as a religion did not begin as a superworldly
    system that came down from heaven. Rather it was born and evolved through a long
    historical process. In its process of evolution, many people slowly moved away from the
    original Teachings of the founder and started different new schools or sects. All the
    other existing religions also face the same situation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One should not come to a hasty conclusion either by
    judging the validity of a religion or by condemning the religion simply by observing what
    people perform through their blind faith in the name of that religion. To understand the
    real nature of a religion one must study and investigate the original Teachings of the
    founder of that religion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the face of the profusion of ideas and practices which
    were later developments, it is useful for us to return to the positive and timeless Dhamma
    taught by the Buddha. Whatever people believe and practise in the name of Buddhism the
    basic Teachings of the Buddha still exist in the original Buddhist texts. </font></p>
