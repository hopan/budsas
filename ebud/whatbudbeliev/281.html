      happiness of gods andmen.' (TheBuddha)</i> </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>hen we turn the pages of the
    history of Buddhism, we learn that Buddhist missionaries gave the noble message of the
    Buddha in a peaceful and respectable way. Such a peaceful mission should put to shame
    those who have practised violent methods in propagating their religions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Buddhist missionaries do not compete with other
    religionists in converting people in the market place. No Buddhist missionary or monk
    would ever think of preaching ill-will against the so-called 'unbelievers'. Religious,
    cultural and national intolerance are unbuddhistic in attitude, to people who are imbued
    with the real Buddhist spirit. Aggression never finds approval in the teachings of the
    Buddha. The world has bled and suffered enough from the disease of dogmatism, religious
    fanaticism and intolerance. Whether in religion or politics, people make conscious efforts
    to bring humanity to accept their own way of life. In doing so, they sometimes show their
    hostility towards the followers of other religions.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism had no quarrel with the national traditions and
    customs, art and culture of the people who accepted it as a way of life but allowed them
    to exist with refinement. The Buddha's message of love and compassion opened the hearts of
    men and they willingly accepted the Teachings, thereby helping Buddhism to become a world
    religion. Buddhist missionaries were invited by the independent countries which welcomed
    them with due respect. Buddhism was never introduced to any country through the influence
    of colonial or any other political power. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism was the first spiritual force known to us in
    history which drew closely together large numbers of races which were separated by the
    most difficult barriers of distance, language, culture and morals. Its motive was not the
    acquisition of international commerce, empire-building or migratory impulse to occupy
    fresh territory. Its aim was to show how people could gain more peace and happiness
    through the practice of Dhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A sparkling example of the qualities and approach of a
    Buddhist missionary was Emperor Asoka. It was during Emperor Asoka's time that Buddhism
    spread to many Asian and western countries. Emperor Asoka sent Buddhist missionaries to
    many parts of the world to introduce the Buddha's message of peace. Asoka respected and
    supported every religion at that time. His tolerance towards other religions was
    remarkable. One of his scripts engraved in stone on Asoka Pillars, and still standing
    today in India, says: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'One should not honour only one's own religion and condemn
      the religion of others, but one should honor others' religions for this or that reason. In
      so doing, one helps one's own religion to grow and renders service to the religions of
      others too. In acting otherwise one digs the grave of one's own religion and also does
      harm to other religions. Whosoever honors his own religion and condemns other religions,
      does so indeed through devotion to his own religion, thinking, 'I will glorify my own
      religion.' But on the contrary, in so doing he injures his own religion more gravely, so
      concord is good. Let all listen, and be willing to listen to the doctrines professed by
      others.'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 268 B.C., he made the doctrines of the Buddha a living
    force in India. Hospitals, social service institutions, universities for men and women,
    public wells and recreation centers sprang up with this new movement, and the people
    thereby realized the cruelty of senseless wars. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The golden era in the history of India and the other
    countries of Asia -- the period when art, culture, education and civilization reached
    their zenith -- occurred at the time when Buddhist influence was strongest in these
    countries. Holy wars, crusades, inquisitions and religious discrimination do not mar the
    annals of Buddhist countries. This is a noble history mankind can rightly be proud of. The
    Great Nalanda University of India which flourished from the second to the ninth century
    was a product of Buddhism. It was the first university that we know of and which was
    opened to international students. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the past, Buddhism was able to make itself felt in many
    parts of the East, although communication and transport were difficult and people had to
    cross hills and deserts. Despite these difficult barriers Buddhism spread far and wide.
    Today, this peace message is spreading in the West. Westerners are attracted to Buddhism
    and believe that Buddhism is the only religion that is in harmony with modern science. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist missionaries have no need or desire to convert
    those who already have a proper religion to practise. If people are satisfied with their
    own religion, then, there is no need for Buddhist missionaries to convert them. They give
    their full support to missionaries of other faiths if their idea is to convert the wicked,
    evil, and uncultured people to a religious way of life. Buddhists are happy to see the
    progress of other religions so long as they truly help people to lead a religious way of
    life according to their faith and enjoy peace, harmony and understanding. On the other
    hand, Buddhist missionaries deplore the attitude of certain missionaries who disturb the
    followers of other religions, since there is no reason for them to create an unhealthy
    atmosphere of competition for converts if their aim is only to teach people to lead a
    religious way of life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In introducing Dhamma to others, Buddhist missionaries
    have never tried to use imaginary exaggerations depicting a heavenly life in order to
    attract human desire and arouse their craving. Instead, they have tried to explain the
    real nature of human and heavenly life as taught by the Buddha.</font></p>
