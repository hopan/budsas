    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Hard work is the luckiest star.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">A</font>lthough Buddhism does not refute
    belief in deities, spirits, astrology and fortune-telling, the Buddha's advice was that
    people should not be slaves to any of those forces. A good Buddhist can overcome all his
    difficulties if he knows how to make use of his intelligence and will-power. The above
    mentioned beliefs have no spiritual significance or value. Man must overcome all his
    problems and difficulties by his own efforts and not through the medium of deities,
    spirits, astrology or fortune-telling. In one of the Buddhist Jataka stories, the
    Bodhisatta said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">'The fool may watch for lucky days,<br>
      Yet luck he shall always miss,<br>
      The luck itself is luck<font>'</font>s own star,<br>
      What can mere stars achieve?</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He believed that hard work was the luckiest star and one
    should not waste time by consulting stars and lucky days in order to achieve success. To
    do your best to help yourself is better than to rely solely on the stars or external
    sources. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although some Buddhists practise fortune-telling and
    dispense some forms of charms or amulets under the guise of religion, the Buddha at no
    time encouraged anyone to practise such things. Like fortune-telling, charms come under
    the category of superstition, and have no religious value. Yet there are many people today
    who, because of sickness and misfortunes attribute the cause of their illness and ill-luck
    to the power of charms. When the cause of certain sickness and misfortunes cannot be
    ascertained or traced, many people tend to believe that their problems are due to charms
    or some other external causes. They have forgotten that they are now living in the
    twentieth century. This is the modern age of scientific development and achievement. Our
    leading scientists have thrown aside many superstitious beliefs and they have even placed
    men on the moon! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>All sicknesses owe their origin to either mental or
    physical causes. In Shakespeare, Macbeth asked a doctor if there was any medicine that
    could cure his wife and the doctor replied: 'More needs she the divine than the
    physician.' What he meant was that some diseases could only be cured if the mind was
    purified. Some severe mental disorders manifest themselves in a physical manner--ulcers,
    stomach aches, and so on.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course diseases are purely physical and can be cured by
    a competent doctor. And finally, some inexplicable disorders could be caused by what
    Buddhist call the ripening of the kammic fruit. This means we would have to pay for some
    evil deed that we have committed in a past life. If we can understand this in the case of
    some incurable diseases, we can bear it with greater patience, knowing its real cause. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People who cannot be cured of their sickness are advised
    to consult a medical specialist and obtain specialized attention. If after having gone
    through a medical check-up, a person still feels in need of attention, then he may want to
    seek spiritual guidance from a proper religious teacher. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists are strongly advised against falling into the
    miserable pit of superstitious beliefs and allowing the mind to be troubled by unnecessary
    and unfounded fears. Cultivate a strong will-power by refusing to believe in the influence
    of charms. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A short meditation course may also prove very helpful to
    clear the mind of unwholesome thoughts. Meditation leads to the purification of the mind.
    A purified mind automatically leads to a purified and healthy body. The Buddha-Dhamma is a
    soothing balm to get rid of sickness of this nature. </font></p>
