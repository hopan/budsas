    <i>Depend on conditions all.(Visuddhi Magga)&quot;</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font face="Times New Roman">he Law of
    Dependent Origination is one of the most important teachings of the Buddha, and it is also
    very profound. The Buddha has often expressed His experience of Enlightenment in one of
    two ways, either in terms of having understood the Four Noble Truths, or in terms of
    having understood the nature of the dependent origination. However, more people have heard
    about the Four Noble Truths and can discuss it than the Law of Dependent Origination,
    which is just as important. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the actual insight into dependent origination
    arises with spiritual maturity, it is still possible for us to understand the principle
    involved. The basis of dependent origination is that life or the world is built on a set
    of relations, in which the arising and cessation of factors depend on some other factors
    which condition them. This principle can be given in a short formula of four lines: </font><dir>
      <dir>
        <dir>
          <dir>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>When this is, that is<br>
              This arising, that arises<br>
              When this is not, that is not<br>
              This ceasing, that ceases.</font></i></p>
            </blockquote>
          </dir>
        </dir>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On this principle of interdependence and relativity rests
    the arising, continuity and cessation of existence. This principle is known as the Law of
    Dependent Origination in Pali, Paticca-samuppada. This law emphasizes an important
    principle that all phenomena in this universe are relative, conditioned states and do not
    arise independently of supportive conditions. A phenomenon arises because of a combination
    of conditions which are present to support its arising. And the phenomenon will cease when
    the conditions and components supporting its arising change and no longer sustain it. The
    presence of these supportive conditions, in turn, depend on other factors for their
    arising, sustenance and disappearance. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Law of Dependence Origination is a realistic way
    of understanding the universe and is the Buddhist equivalent of Einstein's Theory of
    Relativity. The fact that everything is nothing more than a set of relations is consistent
    with the modern scientific view of the material world. Since everything is conditioned,
    relative, and interdependent, there is nothing in this world which could be regarded as a
    permanent entity, variously regarded as an ego or an eternal soul, which many people
    believe in.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The phenomenal world is built on a set of relations, but
    is this the way we would normally understand the world to be? We create fictions of its
    permanency in our minds because of our desires. It is almost natural for human beings to
    cling to what they consider as beautiful or desirable, and to reject what is ugly or
    undesirable. Being subjected to the forces of greed and hatred, they are misled by
    delusion, clouded by the illusion of the permanency of the object they cling to or reject.
    Therefore, it is hard for us to realize that the world is like a bubble or mirage, and is
    not the kind of reality we believe it to be. We do not realize that it is unreal in
    actuality. It is like a ball of fire, which when whirled around rapidly, can for a time,
    create the illusion of a circle. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fundamental principle at work in dependent origination
    is that of cause and effect. In dependent origination, what actually takes place in the
    causal process is described in detail. To illustrate the nature of dependent origination
    of the things around us, let us consider an oil lamp. The flame in an oil lamp burns
    dependent upon the oil and the wick. When the oil and the wick are present, the flame in
    an oil lamp burns. If either of these is absent, the flame will cease to burn. This
    example illustrates the principle of dependent origination with respect to a flame in an
    oil lamp. Or in an example of a plant, it is dependent upon the seed, earth, moisture, air
    and sunlight for the plant to grow. All these phenomena arise dependent upon a number of
    causal factors, and not independently. This is the principle of dependent origination. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Dhamma, we are interested to know how the principle
    of dependent origination is applied to the problem of suffering and rebirth. The issue is
    how dependent origination can explain why we are still going round in Samsara, or explain
    the problem of suffering and how we can be free from suffering. It is not meant to be a
    description of the origin or evolution of the universe. Therefore, one must not be
    mistaken into assuming that ignorance, the first factor mentioned in the dependent
    origination, is the first cause. Since everything arises because of some preceding causes,
    there can be no first cause. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Law of Dependent Origination, there are
    twelve factors which account for the continuity of existence birth after birth. The
    factors are as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through ignorance are conditioned volitional actions or
      kamma-formations.<br>
      Through volitional actions is conditioned consciousness.<br>
      Through consciousness are conditioned mental and physical phenomena.<br>
      Through mental and physical phenomena are conditioned the six faculties(i.e., five
      physical sense-organs and mind).<br>
      Through the six faculties is conditioned (sensorial and mental) contact.<br>
      Through (sensorial and mental)contact is conditioned sensation.<br>
      <font>Through sensation is conditioned desire, 'thirst&quot;.<br>
      Through desire ('thirst') is conditioned clinging.<br>
      </font>Through clinging is conditioned the process of becoming.<br>
      Through the process of becoming is conditioned birth.<br>
      Through birth are conditioned decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is how life arises, exists and continues, and how
    suffering arises. These factors may be understood as sequentially spanning over a period
    of three life-times; the past life, the present life, and the future life. In the
    dependent origination, ignorance and mental formation belong to the past life, and
    represent the conditions that are responsible for the occurrence of this life. The
    following factors, namely, consciousness, mental and physical phenomena, the six senses,
    contact, sensation, desire, clinging and becoming, are factors involved in the present
    life. The last two factors, birth and decay and death, belong to the future life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In this law, the first factor of Ignorance gives
    rise to Volitional Activities (or kamma). Ignorance means not knowing or understanding the
    true nature of our existence. Through Ignorance, good or evil deeds are performed which
    will lead a person to be reborn. Rebirth can occur in various planes of existence: the
    human world, the celestial or higher planes, or even suffering planes depending of the
    quality of a person's kamma. When a person dies, his Volitional Activities will condition
    the arising of Consciousness, in this case to mean the re-linking Consciousness which
    arises as the first spark of a new life in the process of re-becoming.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Once the re-linking Consciousness has taken place,
    life starts once again. Dependent on the Consciousness, there arise Mind and Matter, that
    is, a new 'being' is born. Because there are Mind and Matter, there arise the six
    Sense-organs (the sixth sense is the mind itself). With the arising of the Sense-organs,
    there arises Contact. Contact with what? Contact with sights, sounds, smells, tastes,
    tactile objects, and mental objects.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile objects, and
    mental objects can be beautiful, pleasing and enticing. On the other hand, they can be
    ugly and distasteful. Therefore, dependent on Contact arises Sensations: feelings that are
    pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. Because of these feelings, the laws of attraction
    (greed)and repulsion (aversion) are now set in motion. Beings are naturally attracted to
    pleasant objects and repelled by unpleasant objects. As a result of Sensation, Desire
    arises. A person desires and thirsts for forms that are beautiful and enticing; sounds
    that are beautiful and enticing; tastes, smells, touch, and objects which the mind regards
    as beautiful and enticing. From these Desires, he develops very strong Clinging to the
    beautiful object (or strongly rejects the repulsive object). Now because of this Clinging
    and attachment, the next life is conditioned and there arises Becoming. In other words,
    the processes of Becoming are set in motion by Clinging. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next link in this chain of Dependent Origination is
    that Becoming conditions the arising of Birth. And finally, dependence on Birth arise
    Decay and Death, followed by Sorrow, Lamentation, Pain, Grief and Despair. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The process can be ceased if the formula is taken in
    the reverse order: Through the complete cessation of ignorance(through the cultivation of
    Insight), volitional activities or kamma-formations cease; through the cessation of
    volitional activities, consciousness ceases; °&#130; through the cessation of birth, the
    other factors of decay, death, sorrow, etc., cease. Therefore, one can be free from the
    rounds of rebirth through the eradication of ignorance.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To re-iterate what was mentioned earlier, this doctrine of
    Dependent Origination merely explains the processes of Birth and Death, and is not a
    theory of the evolution of the world. It deals with the Cause of re-birth and Suffering,
    but in no way attempts to show the absolute Origin of Life. Ignorance in Dependent
    Origination is the ignorance of the Four Noble Truths. It is very important for us to
    understand the Four Noble Truths because it is the ignorance of these Truths that has
    trapped us all in the endless cycle of birth and death. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Buddha, while He was speaking to Ananda:
    It is by their not being able to comprehend the Dependent Origination, that people are
    entangled like a ball of cotton, and not being able to see the Truth, are always afflicted
    by Sorrow, --born often into conditions that are dismal and dreary, where confusion and
    prolonged suffering prevail. And, they do not know how to disentangle themselves to get
    out. </font></p>
