          <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>If you really want to honor and
          help your departed ones, then do some meritorious deeds in their name
          and transfer the merits to them.</i></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font><font size="6">A</font>ccording to
        Buddhism, good deeds or 'acts of merit' bring happiness to the doer both
        in this world and in the hereafter. Acts of merit are also believed to
        lead towards the final goal of everlasting happiness. The acts of merit
        can be performed through body, speech or mind. Every good deed produces
        'merit' which accumulates to the 'credit' of the doer. Buddhism also
        teaches that the acquired merit can be transferred to others' it can be
        shared vicariously with others. In other words, the merit is
        'reversible' and so can be shared with other persons. The persons who
        receive the merit can be either living or departed ones.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The method for transferring merits
        is quite simple. First some good deeds are performed. The doer of the
        good deeds has merely to wish that the merit he has gained accrues to
        someone in particular, or to 'all beings'. This wish can be purely
        mental or it can accompanied by an expression of words.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>This wish could be made with the
        beneficiary being aware of it. When the beneficiary is aware of the act
        or wish, then a mutual 'rejoicing in' merit takes place. Here the
        beneficiary becomes a participant of the original deed by associating
        himself with the deed done. If the beneficiary identifies himself with
        both the deed and the doer, he can sometimes acquire even greater merit
        than the original doer, either because his elation is greater or because
        his appreciation of the value of the deed is based on his understanding
        of Dhamma and, hence, more meritorious, Buddhist texts contain several
        stories of such instances.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The 'joy of transference of
        merits' can also take place with or without the knowledge of the doer of
        the meritorious act. All that is necessary is for the beneficiary to
        feel gladness in his heart when he becomes aware of the good deed. If he
        wishes, he can express his joy by saying '<i>sadhu'</i> which means
        'well done'. What he is doing is creating a kind of mental or verbal
        applause. In order to share the good deed done by another, what is
        important is that there must be actual approval of the deed and joy
        arising in the beneficiary's heart.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Even if he so desires, the doer of
        a good deed cannot prevent another's 'rejoicing in the merit' because he
        has no power over another's thoughts. </font>According to the Buddha, in
        all actions, thought is what really matters. Transference is primarily
        an act of the mind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To transfer merit does not mean that a
        person is deprived of the merit had originally acquired by his good
        deed. On the contrary, the very act of&nbsp; <font>'transference' is a
        good deed in itself and hence enhances the merit already earned.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Highest Gift to the Departed</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha says that the greatest
        gift one can confer on one's dead ancestors is to perform 'acts of
        merit' and to transfer these merits so acquired. He also says that those
        who give also receive the fruits of their deeds. The Buddha encouraged
        those who did good deeds such as offering alms to holy men, to transfer
        the merits which they received to their departed ones. Alms should be
        given in the name of the departed by recalling to mind such things as,
        'When he was alive, he gave me this wealth; he did this for me; he was
        my relative, my companion, etc. (<i>Tirokuddha Sutta --&nbsp;
        Khuddakapatha</i>). There is no use weeping, feeling sorry, lamenting
        and bewailing; such attitudes are of no consequence to the departed
        ones.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Transferring merits to the
        departed is based on the popular belief that on a person's death, his
        'merits' and 'demerits' are weighed against one another and his destiny
        determined, his actions determined whether he is to be reborn in a
        sphere of happiness or a realm of woe. The belief is that the departed
        one might have gone to the world of the departed spirits. The beings in
        these lower forms of existence cannot generate fresh merits, and have to
        live on with the merits which are earned from this world.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who did not harm others and who
        performed many good deeds during their life time, will certainly have
        the chance to be reborn in a happy place. Such persons do not required
        the help of living relatives. However, those who have no chance to be
        reborn in a happy abode are always waiting to receive merits from their
        living relatives to offset their deficiency and to enable them to be
        born in a happy abode.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who are reborn in an unfortunate
        spirit form could be released from their suffering condition through the
        transferring of merits to them by friends and relatives who do some
        meritorious deeds.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This injunction of the Buddha to
        transfer merits to departed ones is the counterpart of the Hindu custom
        which has come down through the ages. Various ceremonies are performed
        so that the spirits of dead ancestors might live in peace. This custom
        has been a tremendous influence on the social life of certain Buddhist
        countries. The dead are always remembered when any good deed is done,
        and more on occasions connected with their lives, such as their birth or
        death anniversaries. On such occasions, there is a ritual which is
        generally practised. The transferor pours water from a jug or other
        similar vessel into a receptacle, while repeating a Pali formula which
        is translated as follows:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>As river, when full must flow<br>
          and reach and fill the distant main,<br>
          So indeed what is given here will<br>
          reach and bless the spirits there.<br>
          As water poured on mountain top must<br>
          soon descend and fill the plain<br>
          So indeed what is given here will reach<br>
          and bless the spirits there.</i><br>
          <em>(Nidhikanda Sutta in Khuddakapatha)</em></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The origin and the significance of
        transference of merit is open to scholarly debate. Although this ancient
        custom still exists today in many Buddhists countries, very few
        Buddhists who follow this ancient custom have understood the meaning of
        transference of merits and the proper way to do that.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people are simply wasting time and
        money on meaningless ceremonies and performances in memory of departed
        ones. These people do not realize that it is impossible to help the
        departed ones simply by building big graveyards, tombs, paper-houses and
        other paraphernalia Neither is it possible to help the departed by
        burning joss-sticks, joss-paper, etc.; nor is it possible to help the
        departed by slaughtering animals and offering them along with other
        kinds of food. Also one should not waste by burning things used by the
        departed ones on the assumption that the deceased persons would somehow
        benefit by the act, when such articles can in fact be distributed among
        the needy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The only way to help the departed ones
        is to do some meritorious deeds in a religious way in memory of them.
        The meritorious deeds include such acts as giving alms to others,
        building schools, temples, orphanages, libraries, hospitals, printing
        religious books for free distribution and similar charitable deeds.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The followers of the Buddha should act
        wisely and should not follow anything blindly. While others pray to god
        for the departed ones, Buddhists radiate their loving-kindness directly
        to them. By doing meritorious deeds, they can transfer the merits to
        their beloved ones for their well-being. This is the best way of
        remembering and giving real honor to and perpetuating the names of the
        departed ones. In their state of happiness, the departed ones will
        reciprocate their blessings on their living relatives. It is, therefore,
        the duty of relatives to remember their departed ones by transferring
        merits and by radiating loving-kindness directly to them.</font></p>
