    <p align="center"><em><font face="Times New Roman">Belief in an eternal soul is a
    misconception of the human consciousness. </font></em></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">The Soul Theory </font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With regard to the soul theory, there are three kinds of
    teachers in the world: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">- The first teacher teaches the existence of an eternal
    ego-entity that outlasts death: He is the eternalist. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">- The second teacher teaches a temporary ego-entity which
    becomes annihilated at death: He is the materialist. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">- The third teacher teaches neither an eternal nor a
    temporary ego-entity: He is the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha teaches that what we call ego, self, soul,
    personality, etc., are merely conventional terms that do not refer to any real,
    independent entity. According to Buddhism there is no reason to believe that there is an
    eternal soul that comes from heaven or that is created by itself and that will
    transmigrate or proceed straight away either to heaven or hell after death. Buddhists
    cannot accept that there is anything either in this world or any other world that is
    eternal or unchangeable. We only cling to ourselves and hope to find something immortal.
    We are like children who wish to clasp a rainbow. To children, a rainbow is something
    vivid and real; but the grown-ups know that it is merely an illusion caused by certain
    rays of light and drops of water. The light is only a series of waves or undulations that
    have no more reality than the rainbow itself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Man has done well without discovering the soul. He shows
    no signs of fatigue or degeneration for not having encountered any soul. No man has
    produced anything to promote mankind by postulating a soul and its imaginary working.
    Searching for a soul in man is like searching for something in a dark empty room. But the
    poor man will never realize that what he is searching for is not in the room. It is very
    difficult to make such a person understand the futility of his search. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Those who believe in the existence of a soul are not
    in a position to explain what and where it is. The Buddha's advice is not to waste our
    time over this unnecessary speculation and devote our time to strive for our salvation.
    When we have attained perfection then we will be able to realize whether there is a soul
    or not. A wandering ascetic named Vacchagotta asked the Buddha whether there was an <i>Atman</i>
    (self) or not. The story is as follows:</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vacchagotta comes to the Buddha and asks:</font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">'Venerable Gotama, is there an <i>Atman</i>?</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha is silent.</font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">'Then Venerable Gotama, is there no <i>Atman</i>?</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again the Buddha is silent.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vacchagotta gets up and goes away.</font></p>
    <font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">After the ascetic has left, Ananda asks the
    Buddha why He did not answer Vacchagotta's question. The Buddha explains His position: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Ananda, when asked by Vacchagotta, the Wanderer:
    'Is there a Self?, if I had answered: 'There is a Self'. Then, Ananda, that would be
    siding with those recluses and brahmanas who hold the eternalist theory (<i>sassata-vada</i>).'</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'And Ananda, when asked by the Wanderer: 'Is there
    no Self?, if I had answered: 'There is no Self', then that would be siding with those
    recluses and brahmanas who hold the annihilationist theory (<i>uccedavada)</i>'.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Again, Ananda, when asked by Vacchagotta: 'Is there
    a Self? If I had answered: 'There is a Self', would that be in accordance with my
    knowledge that all dhammas are without Self?</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Surely not, Sir.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'And again, Ananda, when asked by the Wanderer: 'Is
    there no Self?', if I had answered: 'There is no Self', then that would have created a
    greater confusion in the already confused Vacchagotta. For he would have thought: Formerly
    indeed I had an <i>Atman</i> (Self), but now I haven't got one.' (Samyutta Nikaya).</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha regarded soul-speculation as useless and
    illusory. He once said, <font>'Only through ignorance and delusion do men indulge in the
    dream that their souls are separate and self-existing entities. Their heart still clings
    to Self. They are anxious about heaven and they seek the pleasure of Self in heaven. Thus
    they cannot see the bliss of righteousness and the immortality of truth.' Selfish ideas
    appear in man's mind due to his conception of Self and craving for existence.</font> </font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Anatta: The Teaching of No-Soul </font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha countered all soul-theory and soul-speculation
    with His <i>Anatta</i> doctrine. <i>Anatta</i> is translated under various labels:
    No-soul, No-self, egolessness, and soullessness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>To understand the <i>Anatta</i> doctrine, one must
    understand that the eternal soul theory _ 'I have a soul' _ and the material theory _ 'I
    have no soul' _are both obstacles to self-realization or salvation. They arise from the
    misconception '<i>I AM</i>'. Hence, to understand the <i>Anatta</i> doctrine, one must not
    cling to any opinion or views on soul-theory; rather, one must try to see things
    objectively as they are and without any mental projections. </font>One must learn to see
    the so-called <font>'I' or Sour or Self for what it really is : merely a combination of
    changing forces. This requires some analytical explanation.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught that what we conceive as something
    eternal within us, is merely a combination of physical and mental aggregates or forces (<i>pancakkhandha</i>),
    made up of body or matter (rupakkhandha), sensation (vedanakkhandha), perception
    (sannakkhandha), mental formations (samkharakkhandha) and consciousness (vinnanakkhandha).
    These forces are working together in a flux of momentary change; they are never the same
    for two consecutive moments. They are the component forces of the psycho-physical life.
    When the Buddha analyzed the psycho-physical life, He found only these five aggregates or
    forces. He did not find any eternal soul. However, many people still have the
    misconception that the soul is the consciousness. The Buddha declared in unequivocal terms
    that consciousness depends on matter, sensation, perception and mental formations and that
    is cannot exist independently of them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said, 'The body, O monks, is not the Self.
    Sensation is not the Self. Perception is not the Self. The mental constructions are not
    the Self. And neither is consciousness the Self. Perceiving this, O monks, the disciple
    sets no value on the body, or on sensation, or on perception, or on mental constructions,
    or on consciousness. Setting no value of them, he becomes free of passions and he is
    liberated. The knowledge of liberation arises there within him. And then he knows that he
    has done what has to be done, that he has lived the holy life, that he is no longer
    becoming this or that, that his rebirth is destroyed.' (<i>Anatta-Lakkhana Sutta</i>). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Anatta doctrine of the Buddha is over 2500 years
    old. Today the thought current of the modern scientific world is flowing towards the
    Buddha's Teaching of Anatta or No-Soul. In the eyes of the modern scientists, man is
    merely a bundle of ever-changing sensations. Modern physicists say that the apparently
    solid universe is not, in reality, composed of solid substance at all, but actually a flux
    of energy. The modern physicist sees the whole universe as a process of transformation of
    various forces of which man is a mere part. The Buddha was the first to realize this.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>A prominent author, W.S. Wily, once said, 'The
    existence of the immortal in man is becoming increasingly discredited under the influence
    of the dominant schools of modern thought.' The belief in the immortality of the soul is a
    dogma that is contradicted by the most solid, empirical truth.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mere belief in an immortal soul, or the conviction
    that something in us survives death, does not make us immortal unless we know what it is
    that survives and that we are capable of identifying ourselves with it. Most human beings
    choose death instead of immortality by identifying themselves with that which is
    perishable and impermanent by clinging stubbornly to the body or the momentary elements of
    the present personality, which they mistake for the soul or the essential form of life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>About those researches of modern scientists who are
    now more inclined to assert that the so-called 'Soul' is no more than a bundle of
    sensations, emotions, sentiments, all relating to the physical experiences, Prof. James
    says that the term 'Soul' is a mere figure of speech to which no reality corresponds.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>It is the same Anatta doctrine of the Buddha that
    was introduced in the Mahayana school of Buddhism as Sunyata or voidness. Although this
    concept was elaborated by a great Mahayana scholar, Nagarjuna, by giving various
    interpretations, there is no extraordinary concept in Sunyata far different from the
    Buddha's original doctrine of Anatta.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The belief in soul or Self and the Creator God, is so
    strongly rooted in the minds of many people that they cannot imagine why the Buddha did
    not accept these two issues which are indispensable to many religions. In fact some people
    got a shock or became nervous and tried to show their emotion when they heard that the
    Buddha rejected these two concepts. That is the main reason why to many unbiased scholars
    and psychologists Buddhism stands unique when compared to all the other religions. At the
    same time, some other scholars who appreciate the various other aspects of Buddhism
    thought that Buddhism would be enriched by deliberately re-interpreting the Buddha word <font>'Atta'
    in order to introduce the concept of Soul and Self into Buddhism. The Buddha was aware of
    this unsatisfactoriness of man and the conceptual upheaval regarding this belief.</font> </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">All conditioned things are impermanent,<br>
      All conditioned things are Dukka -- Suffering,<br>
      All conditioned or unconditioned things<br>
      are soulless or selfless. (<i>Dhammapada 277, 278, 279</i>)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">There is a parable in our Buddhist texts with
    regard to the belief in an eternal soul. A man, who mistook a moving rope for a snake,
    became terrified by that fear in his mind. Upon discovery that it was only a piece of
    rope, his fear subsided and his mind became peaceful. The belief in an eternal soul is
    equated to the rope of that man's imagination. </font></p>
