    </font></h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>In Buddhism, marriage is regarded as entirely a
      personal, individual concern and not as a religious duty.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">M</font>arriage is a social convention, an
    institution created by man for the well-being and happiness of man, to differentiate human
    society from animal life and to maintain order and harmony in the process of procreation.
    Even though the Buddhist texts are silent on the subject of monogamy or polygamy, the
    Buddhist laity is advised to limit themselves to one wife. The Buddha did not lay rules on
    married life but gave necessary advice on how to live a happy married life. There are
    ample inferences in His sermons that it is wise and advisable to be faithful to one wife
    and not to be sensual and to run after other women. The Buddha realized that one of the
    main causes of man's downfall is his involvement with other women (<i>Parabhava Sutta).</i>Man
    must realize the difficulties, the trials and tribulations that he has to undergo just to
    maintain a wife and a family. These would be magnified many times when faced with
    calamities. Knowing the frailties of human nature, the Buddha did, in one of His precepts,
    advise His followers of refrain from committing adultery or sexual misconduct. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist views on marriage are very liberal: in
    Buddhism, marriage is regarded entirely as personal and individual concern, and not as a
    religious duty. There are no religious laws in Buddhism compelling a person to be married,
    to remain as a bachelor or to lead a life of total chastity. It is not laid down anywhere
    that Buddhists must produce children or regulate the number of children that they produce.
    Buddhism allows each individual the freedom to decide for himself all the issues
    pertaining to marriage. It might be asked why Buddhist monks do not marry, since there are
    no laws for or against marriage. The reason is obviously that to be of service to mankind,
    the monks have chosen a way of life which includes celibacy. Those who renounce the
    worldly life keep away from married life voluntarily to avoid various worldly commitments
    in order to maintain peace of mind and to dedicate their lives solely to serve others in
    the attainment of spiritual emancipation. Although Buddhist monks do not solemnize a
    marriage ceremony, they do perform religious services in order to bless the couples. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="+1">Divorce</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Separation or divorce is not prohibited in Buddhism
    though the necessity would scarcely arise if the Buddha's injunctions were strictly
    followed. Men and women must have the liberty to separate if they really cannot agree with
    each other. Separation is preferable to avoid miserable family life for a long period of
    time. The Buddha further advises old men not to have young wives as the old and young are
    unlikely to be compatible, which can create undue problems, disharmony and downfall
    (Parabhava Sutta).</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>A society grows through a network of relationships
    which are mutually inter-twined and inter-dependent. Every relationship is a whole hearted
    commitment to support and to protect others in a group or community. Marriage plays a very
    important part in this strong web of relationships of giving support and protection. A
    good marriage should grow and develop gradually from understanding and not impulse, from
    true loyalty and not just sheer indulgence. The institution of marriage provides a fine
    basis for the development of culture, a delightful association of two individuals to be
    nurtured, and to be free from loneliness, deprivation and fear. In marriage, each partner
    develops a complementary role, giving strength and moral courage to one another, each
    manifesting a supportive and appreciative recognition of the other's skills. There must be
    no thought of either man or woman being superior -- each is complementary to the other, a
    partnership of equality, exuding gentleness, generosity, calm and dedication.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="+1">Birth Control, Abortion and Suicide</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Although man has freedom to plan his family according
    to his own convenience, abortion is not justifiable.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no reason for Buddhists to oppose birth control.
    They are at liberty to use any of the old or modern measures to prevent conception. Those
    who object to birth control by saying that it is against God's law to practise it, must
    realize that their concept regarding this issue is not reasonable. In birth control what
    is done is to <i>prevent</i> the coming into being of an existence. There is no killing
    involved and there is no<i> akusala kamma.</i> But if they take any action to have an
    abortion, this action is wrong because it involves taking away or destroying a visible or
    invisible life. Therefore, abortion is not justifiable. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Teachings of the Buddha, five conditions
    must be present to constitute the evil act of killing. They are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- a living being<br>
      - knowledge or awareness it is a living being<br>
      - intention of killing<br>
      - effort to kill, and<br>
      - consequent death</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">When a female conceives, there is a being in
    her womb and this fulfills the first condition. After a couple of months, she knows that
    there is a new life within her and this satisfies the second condition. Then for some
    reason or other, she wants to do away with this being in her. So she begins to search for
    an abortionist to do the job and in this way, the third condition is fulfilled. When the
    abortionist does his job, the fourth condition is provided for and finally, the being is
    killed because of that action. So all the conditions are present. In this way, there is a
    violation of the First Precept 'not to kill', and this is tantamount to killing a human
    being. According to Buddhism, there is no ground to say that we have the right to take
    away the life of another. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Under certain circumstances, people feel compelled to do
    that for their own convenience. But they should not justify this act of abortion as
    somehow or other they will have to face some sort of bad karmic results. In certain
    countries abortion is legalized, but this is to overcome some problems. Religious
    principles should never be surrendered for the pleasure of man. They stand for the welfare
    of the whole mankind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="+1">Committing Suicide</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Taking one's own life under any circumstances is morally
    and spiritually wrong. Taking one's own life owing to frustration or disappointment only
    causes greater suffering. Suicide is a cowardly way to end one's problems of life. A
    person cannot commit suicide if his mind is pure and tranquil. If one leaves this world
    with a confused and frustrated mind, it is most unlikely that he would be born again in a
    better condition. Suicide is an unwholesome or unskillful act since it is encouraged by a
    mind filled with greed, hatred and delusion. Those who commit suicide have not learnt how
    to face their problems, how to face the facts of life, and how to use their mind in a
    proper manner. Such people have not been able to understand the nature of life and worldly
    conditions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people sacrifice their own lives for what they deem
    as a good and noble cause. They take their own life by such methods as self-immolation,
    bullet-fire, or starvation. Such actions may be classified as brave and courageous.
    However, from the Buddhist point of view, such acts are not to be condoned. The Buddha has
    clearly pointed out that the suicidal states of mind lead to further suffering. </font></p>
