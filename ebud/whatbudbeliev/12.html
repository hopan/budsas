    Buddha an Incarnation of God? </font></h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Never had the Buddha claimed that He was the son or a
      messenger of God.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he Buddha was a unique human being
    who was self-Enlightened. He had no one whom He could regard as His teacher. Through His
    own efforts, He practised to perfection the ten supreme qualities of generosity,
    discipline, renunciation, wisdom, energy, endurance, truthfulness, determination, goodwill
    and equanimity. Through His mental purification, He opened the doors to all knowledge. He
    knew all things to be known, cultivated all things to be cultivated, and destroyed all
    things to be destroyed. Indeed, no other religious teacher was comparable to Him in terms
    of cultivation and attainment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>So special was He and so electrifying His message,
    that many people asked Him 'What(not so much as Who) He was'. Questions on 'Who He was'
    would be with respect to His name, origin, ancestry, etc., while 'What He was' referred to
    the order of beings to which He belonged. So 'godly and inspiring was He that even during
    His time, there were numerous attempts of others to turn Him into a god or a reincarnation
    of god. Never did He agree to be regarded as such. In the <i>Anguttara Nikaya</i>, He
    said: 'I am not indeed a deva, nor a gandharva, nor a yaksa, nor a manusya. Know ye that I
    am the Buddha.' After Enlightenment, the Buddha could no longer be classified even as a
    'manusya' or an ordinary human being. He belonged to the <i>Buddha Wangsa, </i>special
    race or species of enlightened beings, all of whom are Buddhas.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhas appear in this world from time to time. But some
    people have the mistaken idea that it is the same Buddha who is reincarnated or appears in
    the world over and over again. Actually, they are not the same person, otherwise there is
    no scope for others to attain Buddhahood. Buddhists believe that anyone can become a
    Buddha if he develops his qualities to perfection and is able to remove his ignorance
    completely through his own efforts. After Enlightenment, all Buddhas are similar in their
    attainment and experience of Nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In India, the followers of many orthodox religious groups
    tried to condemn the Buddha because of His liberal teaching which revolutionized the
    Indian society. Many regarded Him as an enemy when increasing numbers of intellectuals as
    well as people from all ranks of society took up the religion. When they failed in their
    attempt to destroy Him, they adopted the reverse strategy of introducing Him as a
    reincarnation of one of their gods. This way they could absorb Buddhism into their
    religion. To a certain extent, this strategy worked in India since it had, through the
    centuries, contributed to the decay and the subsequent uprooting of Buddhism from the land
    of its origin. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even today there are certain religionists who try to
    absorb the Buddha into their beliefs as a way of gaining converts among Buddhists. Their
    basis for doing so is by claiming that the Buddha Himself had predicted that another
    Buddha would appear in this world, and that the latest Buddha will become even more
    popular. One group named a religious teacher who lived 600 years after Gautama the Buddha
    as the latest Buddha. Another group said that the next Buddha had already arrived in Japan
    in the 13<sup>th</sup> century. Yet another group believed that their founder came from
    the lineage of great teachers (like Gautama and Jesus) and that founder was the latest
    Buddha. These groups advised Buddhists to give up their old Buddha and follow the
    so-called new Buddha. While it is good to see them giving the Buddha the same status as
    their own religious teachers, we feel that these attempts to absorb Buddhists into another
    faith by misrepresenting the truth are in extreme bad taste. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who claim that the new Buddha had already arrived
    are obviously misrepresenting what the Buddha had said. Although the Buddha predicted the
    coming of the next Buddha, He mentioned some conditions which had to be met before this
    can be possible. It is the nature of Buddhahood that the next Buddha will not appear as
    the dispensation of the current Buddha still exits. He will appear only when the Four
    Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path have been completely forgotten. The people living then
    must be properly guided in order to understand the same Truth taught by the previous
    Buddhas. We are still living within the dispensation of Gautama the Buddha. Although the
    moral conduct of the people has, with very few exceptions, deteriorated, the future Buddha
    would only appear at some incalculable period when the Path to Nibbana is completely lost
    to mankind and when people are ready to receive Him. </font></p>
