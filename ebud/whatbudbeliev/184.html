      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <i>Self confidence plays an important part in every
      aspect of man's life.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Knowing that no external sources, no faith or rituals can
    save him, the Buddhist feels the need to rely on his own efforts. He gains confidence
    through self-reliance. He realizes that the whole responsibility of his present life as
    well as his future life depends completely on himself alone. Each must seek salvation for
    himself. Achieving salvation can be compared to curing a disease: if one is ill, one must
    go to a doctor. The doctor diagnose the ailment and prescribes medicine. The medicine must
    be taken by the person himself. He cannot depute someone else to take the medicine for
    him. No one can be cured by simply admiring the medicine or just praising the doctor for
    his good prescription. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In order to be cured, he himself must faithfully
    follow the instructions given by the doctor with regard to the manner and frequency in
    taking his medicine, his daily diet and other relevant medical restraints. Likewise, a
    person must follow the precepts, instructions or advice given by the Buddha (who gives
    prescriptions for liberation)by controlling or subduing one's greed, hatred and ignorance.
    No one can find salvation by simply singing praises of the Buddha or by making offerings
    to Him. Neither can one find salvation by celebrating certain important occasions in
    honour of the Buddha. Buddhism is not a religion where people can attain salvation by mere
    prayer or begging to be saved. They must strive hard by controlling their selfish desires
    and emotions in order to gain salvation.</font> </font></p>
