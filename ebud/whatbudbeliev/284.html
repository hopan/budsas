    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Man has forgotten that he has a heart. He forgets that
      if he treats the world kindly, the world will treat him kindly in return.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>e are living in a world of really
    amazing contradictions. On the one hand, people are afraid of war; on the other hand, they
    prepare for it with frenzy. They produce in abundance, but they distribute miserly. The
    world becomes more and more crowded, but man becomes increasingly isolated and lonely. Men
    are living close to each other as in a big family, but each individual finds himself more
    than ever before, separated from his neighbor. Mutual understanding and sincerity are
    lacking very badly. One man cannot trust another, however good the latter may be. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the United Nations was formed after the horrors of
    the Second World War, the heads of Nations who gathered to sign the charter agreed that it
    should begin with the following preamble: <font>'<i>Since it is in the minds of men that
    wars begin, it is in the minds of men the ramparts of peace should be erected.'</i>This
    very same sentiment is echoed in the first verse of the <i>Dhammapada</i> which states:
    'All [mental]states have mind as their forerunner, mind is their chief, and they are
    mind-made. If one speaks or acts, with a defiled mind, suffering follows one even as the
    wheel follows the hoof of the draught-ox.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The belief that the only way to fight force is by applying
    more force has led to the arms race between the great powers. And this competition to
    increase the weapons of war has brought mankind to the very brink of total
    self-destruction. If we do nothing about it, the next war will be the end of the world
    where there will be neither victors nor victims<font> -- </font>only dead bodies. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Hatred does not cease by hatred; by love alone does
    it cease.' Such is the Buddha's advice to those who preach the doctrine of antagonism and
    ill-will, and who set men to war and rebellion against one another. Many people say that
    the Buddha's advice to return good for evil is impracticable. Actually, it is the only
    correct method to solve any problem. This method was introduced by the great Teacher from
    His own experience. Because we are proud and egoistic, we are reluctant to return good for
    evil, thinking that the public may treat us as cowardly people. Some people even think
    that kindness and gentleness are effeminate, not 'macho'! But what harm is there if we
    settle our problems and bring peace and happiness by adopting this cultured method and by
    sacrificing our dangerous pride?</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tolerance must be practised if peace is to come to this
    earth. Force and compulsion will only create intolerance. To establish peace and harmony
    among mankind, each and everyone must first learn to practise the ways leading to the
    extinction of hatred, greed and delusion, the roots of all evil forces. If mankind can
    eradicate these evil forces, tolerance and peace will come to this restless world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Today the follows of the most compassionate Buddha
    have a special duty to work for the establishment of peace in the world and to show an
    example to others by following their Master's advice: 'All tremble at punishment, all fear
    death; comparing others with oneself, one should neither kill nor cause to kill.' (<i>Dhammapada
    129</i>)</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Peace is always obtainable. But the way to peace is
    not only through prayers and rituals. Peace is the result of man's harmony with his fellow
    beings and with his environment. The peace that we try to introduce by force is not a
    lasting peace. It is an interval in between the conflict of selfish desire and worldly
    conditions.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Peace cannot exits on this earth without the
    practice of tolerance. To be tolerant, we must not allow anger and jealousy to prevail in
    our mind. The Buddha says,'No enemy can harm one so much as one's own thoughts of craving,
    hate and jealousy.'<i> (Dhammapada 42)</i></font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is a religion of tolerance because it preaches a
    life of self-restraint. Buddhism teaches a life based not on rules but on principles.
    Buddhism has never persecuted or maltreated those whose beliefs are different. The
    Teaching is such that it is not necessary for anyone to label himself as a Buddhist to
    practise the Noble Principles of this religion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The world is like a mirror and if you look at the mirror
    with a smiling face, you can see your own, beautiful smiling face. On the other hand, if
    you look at it with a long face, you will invariably see ugliness. Similarly, if you treat
    the world kindly the worldly will also certainly treat you kindly. Learn to be peaceful
    with yourself and the world will also be peaceful with you. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Man's </i>mind is given to so much self-deceit that he
    does not want to admit his own weakness. He will try to find some excuse to justify his
    action and to create an illusion that he is blameless. If a man really wants to be free,
    he must have the courage to admit his own weakness. The Buddha says: </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>'Easily seen are other's faults; hard
    indeed it is to see one's own faults.'</i> </font></p>
