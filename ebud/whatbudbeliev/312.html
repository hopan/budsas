    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">F</font>rom the very beginning of time man
    has been fascinated by the stars and he has always tried to find some links between them
    and his own destiny. His observation of the stars and their movements gave rise to two
    very important areas of study, namely, Astronomy and Astrology. Astronomy can be
    considered a pure science which is concerned with the measurements of distances, the
    evolution and destruction of stars, their movements, and so on. Of course all these
    calculations are always made in relation to planet earth and how these interplanetary
    movements affect mankind on a physical level. Modern astronomy seeks to find answers to
    the still unanswered questions regarding the origin of man and the final, possible end of
    his existence as a member of the human race. It is a fascinating area of study and our new
    knowledge of the universe and the galaxies has put much pressure on many religions to
    evaluate their age-old postulations regarding the creator and the creation of life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism does not face any dilemma, simply because the
    Buddha did not encourage His followers to speculate on things beyond their comprehension.
    However, He has made many allusions which in the light of our new knowledge gained through
    science, shows us that the Buddha was very much aware of the true nature of the Universe,
    that it was never created in one glorious moment, that the earth is merely a tiny, even
    unimportant speck in all of space, that there is constant creation and destruction, and
    that everything is in constant motion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Astrology, however, is a completely different area of
    study altogether. Ever since early man began to think, he was deeply concerned about his
    relationship with the universe. When human societies became involved in agricultural
    activities man progressed from hunting as a livelihood and began to notice a link between
    the movement of the sun through the years and his own activities of planting, harvesting,
    and similar projects. As he became more sophisticated he was able to predict the movement
    of the sun and he invented time measurement, dividing into years, months, days, hours,
    minutes and seconds. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He associated this knowledge with his existence whereby he
    felt that there was a relationship between his own life cycle and the movement of the
    planets. That gave rise to the Zodiac--A study of these movements in relation to a human
    being's personal life is called a horoscope. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The study of astrology involves a great understanding of
    human nature, an ability to assess planetary movements precisely, together with an insight
    into the seemingly unexplainable phenomena in the universe. There have been many brilliant
    astrologers in the past and some exist even today. Unfortunately there are an even larger
    number of charlatans who give astrology a bad name. They hood-wink people by predicting
    seemingly true events about their future. They make large sums of money by exploiting the
    ignorance and fear of the gullible. As a result, for a long time scientists scoffed at
    astrology and did not depend on it. However their hostile attitude is not really
    justifiable. The main purpose of reading a horoscope should be to give one an insight into
    one's own character, in the same way that an X-ray photograph can show the physical
    make-up of a man. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Statistics have shown that the influence of the sun in the
    signs of the Zodiac accounts for the birth of unusual people during certain months.
    Certain crimes have been found to correspond with zodiac signs in which the sun is moving
    during certain months of the year. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus an understanding of this relationship will help a man
    to plot his life more meaningfully in harmony with his innate tendencies, so that there is
    less friction as he goes through life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A new-born baby is like a seed. It contains within itself
    all the ingredients which will make it a similar, yet completely different individual from
    all its fellow human beings. How its potential is developed depends, like the seed, on the
    kind of nurture it receives. The nature of a man is born within him, but his own free will
    determines whether he will make really good use of his talents and abilities. Whether he
    will overcome his potential for vice or weakness depends on how he is trained in his
    youth. If we recognize our nature--our tendency towards laziness, irritability, worries,
    frustrations, wickedness, cunnings, jealousy--we can take positive steps to overcome them.
    The first step in solving problems is to recognize them for what they are. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Astrological interpretations indicate our inclinations and
    tendencies. Once pointed out, we must take the necessary steps to chart our lives in a
    manner that will make us useful citizens of the world. Even a person with criminal
    tendencies can become a saint, if he recognizes his nature and takes steps to lead a good
    life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>A horoscope is a chart drawn to show the karmic
    force a man carries, calculated from the time of his birth. The force determines the time
    of birth and knowing this time, a skillful astrologer can accurately chart a man's destiny
    within a given life-span.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Everybody knows that the earth takes approximately one
    year to move around the sun. This movement, viewed from the earth, places the sun in
    various zodiacal areas during the year. A person is born (not accidentally, but as a
    result of karmic influence)when the sun is on transit in one of the twelve Zodiacal signs.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through the horoscope you can determined certain times in
    your life when you have to slow down, or push yourself to great levels of creativity, or
    when you have to watch your activities and health. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Buddhist Attitude Towards Astrology </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The question most people ask is whether Buddhism accepts
    or rejects astrology. Strictly speaking, the Buddha did not make any direct pronouncement
    on this subject because as in many other cases, He stated that discussion on matters such
    as these do not pertain to spiritual development. Buddhism, unlike some other religions,
    does not condemn astrology and people are free to used the knowledge they can get from it
    to make their lives more meaningful. However, if we study the Buddha's teaching carefully,
    we will come to accept that a proper and intelligent understanding of astrology can be a
    useful tool. There is a direct link between the life of an individual human being and the
    vast workings of the cosmos. Modern science is in accordance with the teachings of
    Buddhism. We know for example that there is a close link between the movement of the moon
    and our own behavior. This is seen especially among mentally disturbed and abnormally
    violent people. It is also true that certain sicknesses like asthma and bronchitis are
    aggravated when the moon waxes. There is, therefore, sufficient basis for us to believe
    that other planets can also influence our lives. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism accepts that there is an immense cosmic energy
    which pulsates through every living things, including plants. This energy interacts with
    the karmic energy which an individual generates and determines the course that a life will
    take. The birth of an individual is not the first creation of a life but the continuation
    of one that had always existed and will continue to exist so long as the karmic energy is
    not quelled through final liberation in the unconditioned state. Now, for a life to
    manifest itself in a new existence, certain factors, namely seasons, germinal order and
    nature must be fulfilled. These are supported by mental energy and karmic energy and all
    these elements are in constant interaction and interdependent with each other resulting in
    constant changes to a human being's life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According astrologers, the time at which a person is born
    is predetermined by the cosmic energy and the karmic energy. Hence, it can be concluded
    that life is not merely accidental: it is the result of the interaction between an
    individual's karma and the universal energy force. The course of a human life is
    predetermined, caused partly by a being's own actions in the past and the energies that
    activate the cosmos. Once started, a life is controlled by the interaction between these
    two forces even to the moment at which a birth takes place. A skillful astrologer then, as
    one who understands cosmic as well as karmic influence, can chart the course of one's
    life, based on the moment of the person's birth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>While we are in one sense at the mercy of these
    forces, the Buddha has pointed out a way through which we can escape its influence. All
    karmic energies are stored in the subconscious mind formally described as mental purifies
    and impurities. Since karmic forces influence one's destiny, a person can develop his mind
    and negate certain evil influences caused by previous bad kamma. A person can also
    'purify' his mind and rid himself of all karmic energies and thus prevent rebirth. When
    there is no rebirth, there is no potential life and there will consequently be no 'future'
    existence which can be predicated or charted. At such a stage of spiritual and mental
    development , one will have transcended the need to know about his life because most
    imperfections and unsatisfactoriness would have been removed. A highly developed human
    being will have no need for a horoscope.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century,
    psychologists and psychiatrists have come to recognize that there is much more to the
    human mind than the hard core materialists have been ready to accept. There is more to the
    world than can be seen and touched. The famous Swiss psychologist, Carl Jung, used to cast
    the horoscopes of his patients. On one occasion when he made an astrological analysis of
    about 500 marriages, he discovered that the findings of Ptolemy, on which modern Western
    astrology is based, were still valid, that favorable aspects between the sun and the moon
    of the different partners did produce happy marriage. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The well-known French psychologist, Michel Gauguelin, who
    originally held a negative view of astrology, made a survey of about 20,000 horoscopical
    analyses and found to his surprise that the characteristics of the persons studied
    coincided with characterization produced by modern psychological methods. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The planting of certain flowers, trees and vegetables at
    different times of a year will produce differences in strength or appearance of the
    plants. So there is no reason to doubt that people born in certain times of the year will
    have different characteristics from people born at other times. By knowing his weaknesses,
    failures and short-comings, a man can do his best to overcome them and make himself a
    better and more useful person to society. It will also help him a great deal to get rid of
    unhappiness and disappointments. (Going away from the country where a person is born for
    example, can sometimes help one avoid the influence of the stars.). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Shakespeare says: 'The fault is not in our stars but
    in ourselves&quot;. A well known astrologer has said: 'The stars impel; they do not
    compel'. St. Thomas Aquinas says: 'The planets influence the more elemental part of man
    than passions', but through his intellect man can arrange his life in harmony with the
    planets, and also cultivate his inherent talents and manipulate them for his betterment.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Astrology cannot automatically solve all your problems.
    You must do that yourself. Just like a doctor who can diagnose the nature of diseases, an
    astrologer can only show certain aspects of your life and character. After that it is left
    to you to adjust your way of life. Of course, the task will be made easier, knowing what
    it is you are up against. Some people are too dependent on astrology. They run to the
    astrologer everytime something happens or if they have a dream. Remember, even today
    astrology is very much an imperfect science and even the best astrologers can make serious
    mistakes. Use astrology intelligently, just as you would use any tool which would make
    your life more comfortable and more enjoyable. Above all, beware of fake astrologer who
    are out to cheat you by telling you not the truth, but what you want to hear. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Do not expect good luck to come to you or be handed
    to you easily without any effort on your part. If you want to reap the harvest, you must
    sow the seed and it must be the right seed. Remember, 'Opportunity knocks at the door, but
    never break the lock to gain entrance.'</font> </font></p>
