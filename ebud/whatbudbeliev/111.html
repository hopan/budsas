    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; <i>The Buddha rejected both extremes
    of eternalism and nihilism.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>o develop Right View or Perfect
    View, we must first be aware of two views which are considered imperfect or wrong. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The first view is eternalism. This doctrine or
    belief is concerned with eternal life or with eternal things. Before the Buddha's time, it
    was taught that there is an abiding entity which could exist forever, and that man can
    live the eternal life by preserving the eternal soul in order to be in union with Supreme
    Being. In Buddhism, this teaching is called <i>sassata ditthi </i>----the view of
    eternalists. Such views still exist even in the modern world owing to man's craving for
    eternity.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why did the Buddha deny the teaching of eternalism?
    Because when we understand the things of this world as they truly are, we cannot find
    anything which is permanent or which exists forever. Things change and continue to do so
    according to the changing conditions on which they depend. When we analyse things into
    their elements or into reality, we cannot find any abiding entity, any everlasting thing.
    This is why the eternalist view is considered wrong or false. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The second false view is nihilism or the view held
    by the nihilists who claim that there is no life after death. This view belongs to a
    materialistic philosophy which refuses to accept knowledge of mental conditionality. To
    subscribe to a philosophy of materialism is to understand life only partially. Nihilism
    ignores the side of life which is concerned with mental conditionality. If one claims that
    after the passing away or ceasing of a life, it does not come to be again, the continuity
    of mental conditions is denied. To understand life, we must consider all conditions, both
    mental and material. When we understand mental and material conditions, we cannot say that
    there is no life after death and that there is no further becoming after passing away.
    This nihilist view of existence is considered false because it is based on incomplete
    understanding of reality. That is why nihilism was also rejected by the Buddha. The
    teaching of kamma is enough to prove that the Buddha did not teach annihilation after
    death; Buddhism accepts 'survival' not in the sense of an eternal soul, but in the sense
    of a renewed becoming.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Throughout the Buddha'</font>s long period of
    teaching the Dhamma to His followers, He actively discouraged speculative arguments.
    During the 5<sup>th</sup> century B.C. India was a veritable hive of intellectual activity
    where scholars, yogis, philosophers, kings and even ordinary householders were constantly
    engaged in the philosophical arguments pertaining to human existence. Some of these were
    either ridiculously trivial or totally irrelevant. Some people wasted valuable time
    arguing at great length about all manner of subjects. They were far more concerned about
    proving their powers in mental gymnastics than seeking genuine solutions to the problems
    that beset humanity.<font> (In the 18<sup>th</sup> century Jonathan Swift satirized a
    similar pastime in England when he showed the Lilliputians in <i>'Gulliver's Travels</i>'
    waging a war to decide whether an egg should be broken on its sharp end or its broad end).</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also refused to get involved in speculations
    regarding the universe. He stated very clearly that the problem facing mankind is not in
    his past or his future but in the immediate present. Knowledge about Eternalism or
    Nihilism can in no way help man to break the present fetters which bind him to existence
    and which are the source of all his feelings of discontent which arise from his inability
    to completely satisfy his cravings. The Buddha stated that before one can begin to tread
    the path which leads to Nibbana one must have Right View. Only when one knows clearly what
    one is seeking will one be able to attain it.</font></p>
