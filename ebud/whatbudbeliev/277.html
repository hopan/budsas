    face="Times New Roman">Religion of Freedom </font></h2>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>This is a religion of freedom and reason
    for man to lead a noble life.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">B</font>uddhism does not prevent anyone
    from learning the teachings of other religions. In fact, the Buddha encouraged His
    followers to learn about other religions and to compare His Teachings with other
    teachings. The Buddha says that if there are reasonable and rational teachings. The Buddha
    says that if there are reasonable and rational teachings in other religions, His followers
    are free to respect such teachings. It seems that certain religionists try to keep their
    followers in the dark, some of them are not even allowed to touch other religious objects
    or books. They are instructed not to listen to the preachings of other religions. They are
    enjoined not to doubt the teachings of their own religion, however unconvincing their
    teachings may appear to be. The more they keep their followers on a one-track mind, the
    more easily they can keep them under control. If anyone of them exercises freedom of
    thought and realizes that he had been in the dark all the time, then it is alleged that
    the devil has possessed his mind. The poor man is given no opportunity to use his common
    sense, education, of his intelligence. Those who wish to change their views on religion
    are taught to believe that they are not perfect enough to be allowed to use free will in
    judging anything for themselves. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Buddha, religion should be left to one's
    own free choice. Religion is not a law, but a disciplinary code which should be followed
    with understanding. To Buddhists true religious principles are neither a divine law nor a
    human law, but a natural law. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In actual fact, there is no real religious freedom in any
    part of the world today. Man has not the freedom even to think freely. Whenever he
    realizes that he cannot find satisfaction through his own religion to which he belongs,
    which cannot provide him with satisfactory answers to certain questions, he has no liberty
    to give it up and to accept another which appeals to him. The reason is that religious
    authorities, leaders, and family members have taken that freedom away from him. Man should
    be allowed to choose his religion which is in accordance with his own conviction. One has
    no right to force another to accept a particular religion. Some people surrender their
    religion for the sake of love, without a proper understanding of their partner's religion.
    Religion should not be changed to suit man's emotions and human weaknesses. One must think
    very carefully before changing one's religion. Religion is not a subject for bargaining;
    one should not change one's religion for personal, material gains. Religion is to be sued
    for spiritual development and for self-salvation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists never try to influence other religionists to
    come and embrace their religion for material gain. Nor do they try to exploit poverty,
    sickness, illiteracy and ignorance in order to increase the number of Buddhist population.
    The Buddha advised those who indicated their wish to follow Him, not to be hasty in
    accepting His Teachings. He advised them to consider carefully His Teaching and to
    determine for themselves whether it was practical or not for them to follow. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism teaches that mere belief or outward rituals are
    insufficient for attaining wisdom and perfection. In this sense, outward conversion
    becomes meaningless. To promote Buddhism by force would mean pretending to propagate
    justice and love by means of oppression and injustice. It is of no importance to a
    follower of the Buddha whether a person calls himself a Buddhist or not. Buddhists know
    that only through man's understanding and exertion will they come nearer to the goal
    preached by the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Amongst the followers of every religion are some fanatics.
    Religious fanaticism is dangerous. A fanatic is incapable of guiding himself by reason or
    even by the scientific principles of observation and analysis. According to the Buddha, a
    Buddhist must be a free man with an open mind and must not be subservient to anyone for
    his spiritual development. He seeks refuge in the Buddha by accepting Him as a source of
    supreme guidance and inspiration. He seeks refuge in the Buddha, not blindly, but with
    understanding. To Buddhists, the Buddha is not a savior nor is He an anthropomorphic being
    who claims to possess the power of washing away other's sins. Buddhists regard the Buddha
    as a Teacher who shows the Path to salvation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism has always supported the freedom and progress of
    mankind. Buddhism has always stood for the advancement of knowledge and freedom for
    humanity in every sphere of life. There is nothing in the Buddha<font>'s Teaching that has
    to be withdrawn in the face of modern, scientific inventions and knowledge. The more new
    things that scientists discover, the closer they come to the Buddha.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha emancipated man from the thralldom of religion.
    He also released man from the monopoly and the tyranny of the priestcraft. It was the
    Buddha who first advised man to exercise his reason and not to allow himself to be driven
    meekly like dumb cattle, following the dogma of religion. The Buddha stood for
    rationalism, democracy and practical, ethical conduct in religion. He introduced this
    religion for people to practise with human dignity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The followers of the Buddha were advised not to believe
    anything without considering it properly. In the<i> Kalama Sutta,</i>the Buddha gave the
    following guidelines to a group of young people: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Do not accept anything based upon mere reports,</font>
      <br>
      traditions or hearsay, <br>
      Nor upon the authority of religious texts, <br>
      Nor upon mere reasons and arguments, <br>
      Nor upon one's own inference, <br>
      Nor upon anything which appears to be true, <br>
      Nor upon one's own speculative opinion, <br>
      Nor upon another's seeming ability, <br>
      <font>Nor upon the consideration: 'This is our Teacher.'</font> <br>
      <font>'But, when you know for yourselves the certain things are unwholesome and bad:
      tending to harm yourself of others, reject them.</font> <br>
      <font>'And when you know for yourselves that certain things are wholesome and good:
      conducive to the spiritual welfare of yourself as well as others, accept and follow them.'</font>
      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists are advised to accept religious practices only
    after careful observation and analysis, and only after being certain that the method
    agrees with reason and is conducive to the good of one and all. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>A true Buddhist does not depend on external powers
    for his salvation. Nor does he expect to get rid of miseries through the intervention of
    some unknown power. He must try to eradicate all his mental impurities to find eternal
    Happiness. The Buddha says, 'If anyone were to speak ill of me, my teaching and my
    disciples, do not be upset or perturbed, for this kind of reaction will only cause you
    harm. On the other hand, if anyone were to speak well of me, my teaching and my disciples,
    do not be over-joyed, thrilled or elated, for this kind of reaction will only be an
    obstacle in forming a correct judgment. If you are elated, you cannot judge whether the
    qualities praised are real and actually found in us.'</font> -- (<i>Brahma Jala Sutta)</i>.
    Such is the unbiased attitude of a genuine Buddhist. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha had upheld the highest degree of freedom not
    only in its human essence but also in its divine qualities. It is a freedom that does not
    deprive man of his dignity. It is a freedom that releases one from slavery to dogmas and
    dictatorial religious laws or religious punishments. </font></p>
