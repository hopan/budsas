    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never
      mind.&quot;</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">A</font>ccording to Buddhism, life is a
    combination of mind (nama) and matter (rupa). Mind consists of the combination of
    sensations, perceptions, volitional activities and consciousness. Matter consists of the
    combination of the four elements of solidity, fluidity, motion and heat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Life is the co-existence of mind and matter. Decay is the
    lack of co-ordination of mind and matter. Death is the separation of mind and matter.
    Rebirth is the recombination of mind and matter. After the passing away of the physical
    body (matter), the mental forces (mind) recombine and assume a new combination in a
    different material form and condition another existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The relation of mind to matter is like the relation of a
    battery to an engine of a motor car. The battery helps to start the engine. The engine
    helps to charge the battery. The combination helps to run the motor car. In the same
    manner, matter helps the mind to function and the mind helps to set matter in motion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism teaches that life is not the property of matter
    alone, and that the life-process continues or flows as a result of cause and effect. The
    mental and material elements that compose sentient beings from amoebae to elephant and
    also to man, existed previously in other forms.</font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Although some people hold the view that life
    originates in matter alone, the greatest scientists have accepted that mind precedes
    matter in order for life to originate. In Buddhism, this concept is called 'relinking
    consciousness'.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each of us, in the ultimate sense, is mind and matter, a
    compound of mental and material phenomena, and nothing more. Apart from these realities
    that go to form the nama-rupa compound, there is no self, or soul. The mind part of the
    compound is what experiences an object. The matter part does not experience anything. When
    the body is injured, it is not the body that feels the pain, but the mental side. When are
    hungry it is not the stomach that feels the hunger but again the mind and its factors,
    makes the body digest the food. Thus neither the nama nor the rupa has any efficient power
    of its own. One is dependent on the other; one supports the other. Both mind and matter
    arise because of conditions and perish immediately, and this is happening every moment of
    our lives. By studying and experiencing these realities we will get insight into: (1) what
    we truly are; (2) what we find around us; (3) how and why we react to what is within and
    around us; and (4) what we should aspire to reach as a spiritual goal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To gain insight into the nature of the psycho-physical
    life is to realize that life is an illusion, a mirage or a bubble, a mere process of
    becoming and dissolving, or arising and passing away. Whatever exists, arises from causes
    and conditions.</font></p>
