    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Buddhism is strong enough to face any modern views
      which pose a challenge to religion.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">B</font>uddhist ideas have greatly
    contributed to the enrichment of both ancient and modern thought. Its teaching of
    causation and relativism, its doctrine of sense data, its pragmatism, its emphasis on the
    moral, its non-acceptance of a permanent soul, its unconcern about external supernatural
    forces, its denial of unnecessary rites and religious rituals, its appeal to reasoning and
    experience and its compatibility with modern scientific discoveries all tend to establish
    its superior claim to modernity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is able to meet all the requirements of a
    rational religion that suit the needs of the future world. It is so scientific, so
    rational, so progressive that it will be a pride for a man in the modern world to call
    himself a Buddhist. In fact, Buddhism is more scientific in approach than science; it is
    more socialistic than socialism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Among all the great founders of religion, it was the
    Buddha alone who encouraged the spirit of investigation among His followers and who
    advised them not to accept even His Teaching with blind faith. Therefore, it is no
    exaggeration to say that Buddhism can be called a modern religion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is a well-elaborated scheme of how to lead a
    practical life and a carefully thought-out system of self-culture. But more than that, it
    is a scientific method of education. This religion is best able in any crisis to restore
    our peace of mind and to help us to face calmly whatever changes the future may have in
    store. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Without sensual pleasure, would life be endurable? Without
    belief in immortality, can man be moral? Without resorting to divinity, can man advance
    towards righteousness? YES, is the answer given by Buddhism. These ends can be attained by
    knowledge and by the purification of the mind. Knowledge is the key to the higher path.
    Purification is that which brings calmness and peace to life and renders man indifferent
    to and detached from the vagaries of the phenomenal world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is truly a religion suited to the modern,
    scientific world. The light which comes from nature, from science, from history, from
    human experience, from every point of the universe, is radiant with the Noble Teachings of
    the Buddha. </font></p>
