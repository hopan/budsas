    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Buddhism is open to traditions and customs provided
      they are not harmful to the welfare of others.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font face="Times New Roman">he Buddha
    advised us not to believe in anything simply because it is the traditional custom.
    However, we are not advised to suddenly do away with all traditions. 'You must try to
    experiment with them and put them thoroughly to test. If they are reasonable and conducive
    both to your happiness and to the welfare of others, only then should you accept and
    practise these traditions and customs.' (<i>Kalama Sutta</i>) This is certainly one of the
    most liberal declarations ever made by any religious teacher. This tolerance of other's
    traditions and customs is not known to some other religionists. These religionists usually
    advise their new converts to give up all their traditions, customs and culture without
    observing whether they are good or bad. While preaching the Dhamma, Buddhist missionaries
    have never advised the people to give up their traditions as long as they are reasonable.
    But the customs and traditions must be within the framework of religious principles. In
    other words, one should not violate the religious precepts in order to follow one's
    traditions. If people are very keen to follow their own traditions which have no religious
    value at all, they can do so provided that they do not practise these traditions in the
    name of religion. Even then, such practices must be harmless to oneself and to all other
    living creatures.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="+1">Rites and Rituals</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are included within customs and traditions. The
    rites and rituals are an ornamentation or a decoration to beautify a religion in order to
    attract the public. They provide a psychological help to some people. But one can practise
    religion without any rites and rituals. Certain rites and rituals that people consider as
    the most important aspect of their religion for their salvation are not considered as such
    in Buddhism. According to the Buddha, one should not cling to such practices for his
    spiritual development or mental purity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="+1">Festivals</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Genuine and sincere Buddhists do not observe Buddhist
    festivals by enjoying themselves under the influence of liquor and merry-making or holding
    feasts by the slaughtering of animals. The true Buddhists observe festival days in an
    entirely different manner. On the particular festival day, they would devote their time to
    abstaining from all evil. They would practise charity and help others to relieve
    themselves from their suffering. They may entertain friends and relatives in a respectable
    way. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The festivals that have been incorporated with religion
    sometimes could pollute the purity of a religion. On the other hand a religion without
    festivals can become very dull and lifeless to many people. Usually children and youths
    come to religion through religious festivals. To them the attraction of a religion is
    based on its festivals. However, to a mediator, festivals can become a nuisance. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, some people will not be satisfied with
    religious observances only during a festival . They naturally like to have some sort of
    merry-making and outward show. Rites, rituals, ceremonies, processions and festivals are
    organized to quench that thirst for emotional satisfaction through religion. No one can
    say that such practices are wrong, but devotees have to organize those ceremonies in a
    cultured manner, without causing a nuisance to others. </font></p>
