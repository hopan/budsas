    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>What is lacking in the world today is loving-kindness
      or goodwill.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">I</font><font face="Times New Roman">n the world
    today, there is sufficient material wealth. There are very advanced intellectuals,
    brilliant writers, talented speaker, philosophers, psychologists, scientists, religious
    advisors, wonderful poets and powerful world leaders. In spite of these intellectuals,
    there is no real peace and security in the world today. Something must be lacking. What is
    lacking is loving-kindness or goodwill amongst mankind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Material gain in itself can never bring lasting
    happiness and peace. Peace must first be established in man's own heart before he can
    bring peace to others and to the world at large. The real way to achieve peace is to
    follow the advice given by religious teachers.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to practise loving-kindness, one must first
    practise the Noble Principle of non-violence and must always be ready to overcome
    selfishness and to show the correct path to others. The fighting is not to be done with
    the physical body, because the wickedness of man is not in his body but in his mind.
    Non-violence is a more effective weapon to fight against evil than retaliation. The very
    nature of retaliation is to increase wickedness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to practise loving-kindness, one must also be
    free from selfishness. Much of the love in this world of self-centered, only a love of one
    is own self: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Not out of love for the husband loved; but the
    husband is loved for love of self. Children are loved by the parents, not out of love for
    the children, but for love of self. The gods are loved, not out of love for the gods, but
    for love for self. Not out of love is anybody loved, but for love of self are loved.'</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Man should learn how to practise selfless love to
    maintain real peace and his own salvation. Just as suicide kills physically, selfishness
    kills spiritual progress. Loving-kindness in Buddhism is neither emotional or selfish. It
    is loving-kindness that radiates through the purified mind after eradicating hatred,
    jealousy, cruelty, enmity and grudges. According to the Buddha, <i>Metta </i>_
    Loving-kindness is the most effective method to maintain purity of mind and to purify the
    mentally polluted atmosphere.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The word 'love' is used to cover a very wide range
    of emotions human beings experience. Emphasis on the base animal lust of one sex for
    another has much debased the concept of a feeling of amity towards another being.
    According to Buddhism, there are many types of emotions, all of which come under the
    general term 'love' First of all, there is selfish love and there is selfless love. One
    has selfish love when one is concerned only with the satisfaction to be derived for
    oneself without any consideration for the partner's needs or feelings. Jealousy is usually
    a symptom of selfish love. Selfless love, on the other hand, is felt when one person
    surrenders his whole being for the good of another _parents feel such love for their
    children. Usually human beings feel a mixture of both selfless and selfish love in their
    relationships with each other. For example, while parents make enormous sacrifices for
    their children, they usually expect something in return.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another kind of love, but closely related to the above, is
    brotherly love or the love between friends. In a sense, this kind of love can also be
    considered selfish because the love is limited to particular people and does not encompass
    others. In another category we have sexual love, where partners are drawn towards each
    other through physical attraction. It is the kind that is most exploited by modern
    entertainment and it can cover anything from uncomplicated teenage infatuations to the
    most complex of relationships between adults. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>On a scale far higher than these, is Universal Love
    or <i>Metta</i>. This all-embracing love is the great virtue expressed by the Buddha. Lord
    Buddha, for example, renounce His kingdom, family and pleasures so that He could strive to
    find a way to release mankind from an existence of suffering. In order to gain His
    Enlightenment, he had to struggle for many countless lives. A lesser being would have been
    disheartened, but not the Buddha-elect. It is for this He is called 'The Compassionate
    One'. The Buddha's boundless love extended not only to human beings but all living
    creatures. It was not emotional or selfish, but a love without frontiers, without
    discrimination. </font>Unlike the other kinds of love, Universal love can never end in
    disappointment or frustration because it expects no reward. It creates more happiness and
    satisfaction. One who cultivates universal love will also cultivate sympathetic joy and
    equanimity and he will then have attained to the sublime state. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this book, The Buddha<font>'s Ancient Path Ven.
    Piyadassi says:</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Love is an active force. Every act of the loving
    one is done with the stainless mind to help, to succor, to cheer, to make the paths of
    others easier, smoother and more adapted to the conquest of sorrow, the winning of the
    highest bliss.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'The way to develop love is through thinking out the
    evils of hate, and the advantages of non-hate; through thinking out according to
    actuality, according to karma, that really there is none to hate, that hate is a foolish
    way of feeling which breeds more and more darkness, that obstructs right understanding.
    Hate restricts; love release. Hatred strangles; love enfranchises. Hatred brings remorse;
    love brings peace. Hatred agitates; love quietens, stills, calms. Hatred divides; love
    unites. Hatred hardens; love softens. Hatred hinders; love helps. And thus through a
    correct study and appreciation of the effects of hatred and the benefits of love, should
    one develop love.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In <i>Metta Sutta</i>, the Buddha has expounded the
    nature of love in Buddhism. 'Just as a mother would protect her only child even at the
    risk of her own life, even so, let him cultivate a boundless heart towards all beings. Let
    his thoughts of boundless love pervade the whole world, above, below and across without
    any obstruction, without any hatred, without any enmity.'</font> </font></p>
