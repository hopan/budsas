    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Unsatisfied desire for existence and sensual pleasures
      is the cause of rebirth.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font><font size="6">B</font>uddhists regard the doctrine
    of rebirth not as a mere theory but as a verifiable fact. The belief in rebirth forms a
    fundamental tenet of Buddhism. However, the belief in rebirth is not confined to Buddhist;
    it is also found in other countries, in other religions, and even among free thinkers.
    Pythagoras could remember his previous birth. Plato could remember a number of his
    previous lives. According to Plato, man can be reborn only up to ten times. Plato also
    believed in the possibility of rebirth in the animal kingdom. Among the ancient people in
    Egypt and China, a common belief was that only well-known personalities like emperors and
    kings have rebirths. A well-known Christian authority named Origen, who lived in 185-254
    A.D., believed in rebirth. According to him, there is no eternal suffering in a hell.
    Gorana Bruno, who lived in the sixteenth century, believed that the soul of every man and
    animal transmigrates from one being to another. In 1788, a well-known philosopher, Kant,
    criticized eternal punishment. Kant also believed in the possibility of rebirth in other
    celestial bodies. Schopenhauer (1788-1860), another great philosopher, said that where the
    will to live existed there must be of necessity life. The will to live manifests itself
    successively in ever new forms. The Buddha explained this 'will to exist' as the craving
    for existence.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is possible but not very easy for us to actually verify
    our past lives. The nature of mind is such that it does not allow most people the
    recollection of their previous lives. Our minds are overpowered by the five hindrances:
    sensual desire, ill-will, sloth, restlessness and doubt. Because of these hindrances, our
    vision is earth-bound and hence we cannot visualize rebirths. Just as a mirror does not
    reflect an image when it is covered with dirt, so the mind does not allow most people the
    recollection of previous lives. We cannot see the stars during daytime, not because they
    are not there in the sky, but because they are outshone by the sunlight. Similarly, we
    cannot remember our past lives because our mind at present is always over-burdened with
    many thoughts in the present, day-to-day events and mundane circumstances. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A consideration of the shortness of our life-span on earth
    will help us to reflect on rebirth. If we consider life and its ultimate meaning and goal,
    and all the varied experience possible for man, we must conclude that in a single life
    there is not enough time for man to carry out all that is intended by nature, to say
    nothing about what man himself desires to do. The scale of experience is enormous. There
    is a vast range of powers latent in man which we see and can even develop if the
    opportunity is presented to us. This especially true today if special investigation is
    made. We find ourselves with high aspirations but with no time to attain them. Meanwhile,
    the great troop of passions and desires, selfish motives and ambitions, make war within us
    and with others. These forces pursue each other to the time of our death. All these forces
    must be tried, conquered, subdued and used. One life is just not enough for all this. To
    say that we must have but one life here with such possibilities put before us and
    impossible to develop is to make the universe and life a huge and cruel joke. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha doctrine of rebirth should be differentiated
    from the teachings of transmigration and reincarnation of other religions. Buddhism denies
    the existence of a permanent, god-created soul or an unchanging entity that transmigrates
    from one life to another. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as relative identity is made possible by causal
    continuity without a Self or Soul, so death can issue in rebirth without a transmigrating
    Soul. In a single life, each thought-moment flashes in and out of being, giving rise to
    its successor with its perishing. Strictly speaking, this momentary rise and fall of every
    thought is a birth and death. Thus even in a single life we undergo countless births and
    deaths every second. But because the mental process continues with the support of a single
    physical body, we regard the mind-body continuum as constituting a single life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What we ordinarily mean by death is the cessation of the
    body<font>'s vital functions. When the physical body loses its vitality it can no longer
    support the current of consciousness, the mental side of the process. But as long as there
    is a clinging to life, a desire to go on existing, the current of consciousness does not
    come to a stop with the body's loss of life. Rather, when death takes place, when the body
    dies away, the mental current, driven by the thirst for more existence, will spring up
    again with the support of a new physical body, one which has just come into being through
    the meeting of sperm and egg. Thus, rebirth takes place immediately after death. The steam
    of memory may be interrupted and the sense of identity transferred to the new situation,
    but the entire accumulation of experience and disposition has been transmitted to the
    newborn being, and the cycle of becoming begins to revolve for still another term.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For Buddhism, therefore, death does not spell either the
    entrance to eternal life or complete annihilation. It is, rather, the portal to a new
    rebirth which will be followed by more growth, decay, and then till another death. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>At the last moment, no renewed physical functioning
    occurs in a dying man's mind. This is just like a motorist releasing the accelerator
    before stopping, so that no more pulling power is given to the engine. Similarly, no more
    material qualities of Kamma arise.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists do not maintain that the present life is the
    only life between two eternities of misery and happiness; nor do they believe angels will
    carry them to heaven and leave them there for all eternity. They believe that this present
    life is only one of the indefinite numbers of states of being and that this earthly life
    is but one episode among many others. They believe that all beings will be reborn
    somewhere for a limited period of time as long as their good and bad Kamma remains in the
    subconscious mind in the form of mental energy. The interpretation of the subconscious
    mind in the Buddhist context should not be confused with that given by modern
    psychologists since the concepts are not exactly synonymous. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is the cause of rebirth? The Buddha taught that
    ignorance produces desires. Unsatisfied desire is the cause of rebirth. When all
    unsatisfied desire is extinguished, then rebirth ceases. To stop rebirth is to extinguish
    all desires. To extinguish desire, it is necessary to destroy ignorance. When ignorance is
    destroyed, the worthlessness of every such rebirth, is perceived, as well as the paramount
    need to adopt a course of life by which the desire for such repeated births can be
    abolished. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ignorance also begets the illusive and illogical idea that
    there is only one existence for man, and the other illusion that this one life is followed
    by states of eternal pleasure or torment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught that ignorance can be dispelled and
    sorrow removed by realization of the Four Noble Truths, and not through any other source.
    To disperse all ignorance, one must persevere in the practice of an all-embracing altruism
    in conduct, intelligence and wisdom. One must also destroy all desire for the lower,
    personal pleasures and selfish desire. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">How does rebirth take place? When this physical body is no
    more capable of functioning, energies do not die with it, but continue to take some other
    shape or form, which we call another life. The kammic force manifesting itself in the form
    of a human being can also manifest itself in the form of an animal. This can happen if man
    has no chance to develop his positive kammic forces. This force, called craving, desire,
    volition, thirst to live, does not end with the non-functioning of the body but continues
    to manifest itself in another form, producing re-existence which is called rebirth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today, there are people in various countries who have
    spontaneously developed memory of their past births. The experiences of these people have
    been well-documented in newspapers and periodicals. Some of these people never accepted
    that there was such a thing as rebirth until memory fragments of their previous lives came
    to them. Much of the information they revealed about their past lives has been
    investigated and found to be valid. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through hypnotism, some people have managed to reveal
    information of previous lives. Certain hypnotic states that penetrate into the
    subconscious mind make the recalling of past lives possible. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rebirth or becoming again and again is a natural
    occurrence not created by any particular religion or god. Belief in rebirth or disbelief
    does not make any difference to the process of rebirth or avoiding rebirth. Rebirth takes
    place as long as craving for existence and craving for sensual pleasures or attachment
    exist in the mind. Those strong mental forces prevail in each and every living being in
    this universe. Those who hope and pray that they be not born again must understand that
    their wishes will not materialize until they make earnest efforts to eradicate their
    craving and attachment. Having seen and experienced the uncertainty and unsatisfactoriness
    of life under worldly conditions, wise people try to rid themselves of these repeated
    births and deaths by following the correct path. Those who cannot reduce their craving and
    attachment must be prepared to face all unsatisfactory and uncertain situations associated
    with rebirth and becoming again and again. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Is Rebirth Simultaneous? </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another difficult thing to understand about rebirth is
    whether the occurrence of rebirth is simultaneous or not. This is a controversial issue
    even amongst prominent Buddhist Scholars. According to Abhidhamma, rebirth (conception)
    takes place immediately after the death of a being without any intermediate state. At the
    same time, some others believe that a person, after his death, would evolve into a spirit
    form for a certain number of days before rebirth takes place. Another interpretation
    regarding the same belief is that it is not the spirit, but the deceased person's
    consciousness or mental energy remaining in space, supported by his own mental energies of
    craving and attachment. However, sooner or later rebirth must take place. The spirits
    (petas), who are beings born in spirit forms, are unfortunate living beings and their
    lives in the spirit form is not permanent. It is also a form of rebirth which is
    temporary. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another concept that many people cannot understand is that
    in the process of rebirth a man can be reborn as an animal and an animal can be reborn as
    a man. The animal nature of the man's mind and the animal way of life adopted by him can
    condition him to be born as an animal. The condition and behavior of the mind is
    responsible for the next existence. On the other hand, a person who is born in animal
    form, owing to certain mental abuses during a previous birth, could be reborn as a human
    being, if that animal has not committed any serious evil acts. It is a well-known fact
    that some animals are very intelligent and understanding. This is a clear evidence to
    prove that they are tending towards the human life. A person who is born as an animal can
    again be born as a human being when the bad kamma which conditioned his birth as an animal
    is expended and the good kamma which was stored becomes dominant. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Dying Moment </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the dying man's consciousness, there are three types of
    consciousness (<i>Vinnana</i>) functioning at the moment of death :rebirth-linking
    consciousness (<i>patisandhi-citta</i>), the current of passive consciousness or the
    current of life-continuum (bhavanga) and consciousness disconnecting the present life
    (cuti-citta). At the last moment of a man's present life the (patisandhi-citta) or
    rebirth-linking consciousness arises, having the three signs as its objects. The
    patisandhi-citta remains in the course of cognition for five faint thought-moments Javana
    and then sinks down into bhavanga. At the end of bhavanga the cuti-citta arises,
    disconnecting the present life and sinks down into bhavanga. At this very moment comes the
    end of the present life. At the end of that bhavanga another patisandhi-citta rises up in
    the next life and from this very moment the new life begins. This is the process of death
    and rebirth according to Buddhism, and only in Buddhism is the process of these natural
    phenomena found explained in minute detail. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>A Buddhist faces death not as a crisis in life but
    as a normal event, for he knows that whoever is born must suffer, 'decay', and ultimately
    die. Or, as someone so aptly puts it, 'Everyone is born with the certificate of death at
    his birth.' If we could all look at death such an intelligent and rational way, we would
    not cling to life so tenaciously.</font> </font></p>
