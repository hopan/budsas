    <p><font><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">I</font><font face="Times New Roman">n
    place of prayer, Buddhist practise meditation for mental culture and for spiritual
    development. No one can attain Nibbana or salvation without developing the mind through
    meditation. Any amount of meritorious deeds alone will not lead a person to attain the
    final goal without the corresponding mental purification. Naturally, the untrained mind is
    very elusive and persuades people to commit evil and become slaves of the senses.
    Imagination and emotions always mislead man if his mind is not properly trained. One who
    knows how to practise meditation will be able to control one</font>'<font
    face="Times New Roman">s mind when it is misled by the senses.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most of the troubles which we are confronting today are
    due to the untrained and uncultured mind. It is already established that meditation is the
    remedy for many physical and mental sickness. Medical authorities and great psychologists
    the world over say that mental frustration, worries, miseries, anxieties, tension and fear
    are the causes of many diseases, stomach ulcers, gastritis, nervous complaints and mental
    sickness. And even latent sickness will be aggravated through such mental conditions.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font><font face="Times New Roman">When the conscious </font>'<font
    face="Times New Roman">I</font>' <font face="Times New Roman">frets too much, worries too
    much, or grieves too long and too intensely, then troubles develop in the body. Gastric
    ulcers, tuberculosis, coronary diseases and a host of functional disorders are the
    products of mental and emotional imbalance. In the case of children, the decay of the
    teeth and defective eye-sight are frequently related to emotional disorders.</font></font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many of these sicknesses and disorders can be avoided if
    people could spend a few minutes a day to calm their senses through the practice of
    mediation. Many people do not believe this or are too lazy to practise meditation owing to
    lack of understanding. Some people say that mediation is only a waste of time. We must
    remember that every spiritual master in this world attained the highest point of his life
    through the practice of meditation. They are honored today by millions of people because
    they have done tremendous service to mankind with their supreme knowledge and patience
    which they obtained through the practice of meditation.</font> </p>
    <p><font><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation should not be a task to which we force
    ourselves </font>'<font face="Times New Roman">with gritted teeth and clenched fists</font>'<font
    face="Times New Roman">; it should rather be something that draws us, because it fills us
    with joy and inspiration. So long as we have to force ourselves, we are not yet ready for
    meditation. Instead of meditating we are violating our true nature. Instead of relaxing
    and letting go, we are holding on to our ego, to our will power. In this way meditation
    becomes a game of ambition, of personal achievement and aggrandizement. Meditation is like
    love: a spontaneous experience</font> -- <font face="Times New Roman">not something that
    can be forced or acquired by strenuous effort.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore Buddhist mediation has no other purpose than to
    bring the mind back into the present, into the state of fully awakened consciousness, by
    clearing it from all obstacles that have been created by habit or tradition.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha obtained His Enlightenment through the
    development of His mind. He did not seek divine power to help Him. He gained His wisdom
    through self-effort by practising meditation. To have a healthy body and mind and to have
    peace in life, one must learn how to practise meditation.</font> </p>
    <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Times New Roman">Nature of Modern Life</font> </p>
    <p><font><font face="Times New Roman">Today we are living in a world where people have to
    work very hard physically and mentally. Without hard work, there is no place for people in
    the modern society. Very often keen competition is going on everywhere. One is trying to
    beat the other in every sphere of life and man has no rest at all. Mind is the nucleus of
    life. When there is no real peace and rest in the mind, the whole life will collapse.
    People naturally try to overcome their miseries through pleasing the senses: they drink,
    gamble, sing and dance</font>?<font face="Times New Roman">all the time having the
    illusion that they are enjoying he real happiness of life. Sense stimulation is not the
    real way to have relaxation. The more we try to please the senses through sensual
    pleasures, the more will we become slaves to the senses. There will be no end to our
    craving for satisfaction. The real way to relax is to calm the senses by the control of
    mind. If we can control the mind, then we will be able to control everything. When the
    mind is free from mental disturbances it can see many things which others cannot see with
    their naked eyes. Ultimately, we will be able to attain our salvation and find peace and
    happiness.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font><font face="Times New Roman">To practise meditation, one must have strong
    determination, effort and patience. Immediate results cannot be expected. We must remember
    that it takes many years for a person to be qualified as a doctor, lawyer, mathematician,
    philosopher, historian or a scientist. Similarly to be a good meditator, it will take
    sometime for the person to control the elusive mind and to calm the senses. Practising
    meditation is like swimming in a river against the current. Therefore one must not lose
    patience for not being able to obtain rapid results. At the same time the meditator must
    also cultivate his morality. A congenial place for meditation is another important aspect.
    The meditator must have an object for his meditation, for without an object the jumping
    mind is not easy to trap. The object must not create lust, anger, delusion, and emotion in
    the meditator</font>'<font face="Times New Roman">s mind.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font><font face="Times New Roman">When we start to meditate, we switch the mind from
    the old imaginative way of thinking, or habitual thought into a new unimpeded or unusual
    way of thinking. While meditating when we breathe in mindfully, we absorb cosmic energy.
    When we breathe out mindfully with<i> Metta</i></font>?<font face="Times New Roman">loving
    kindness, we purify the atmosphere. Intellect is necessary for the overcoming of
    emotionality and spiritual confusion as intuition is necessary for overcoming intellectual
    limitation and conceptual abstraction.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We spend most of our time on our body: to feed it, to
    clothe it, to cleanse it, to wash it, to beautify it, to relax it, but how much time do we
    spend on our mind for the same purposes?</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people take the Buddha Image as an object and
    concentrate on it. Some concentrate on inhaling and exhaling. Whatever may be the method,
    if anyone tries to practise meditation, he is sure to find relaxation. Meditation will
    help him a great deal to have physical and mental health and to control the mind when it
    is necessary.</font> </p>
    <p><font><font face="Times New Roman">Man can do the highest service to the society by
    simply abstaining from evils. The cultured mind that is developed through meditation
    performs a most useful service to others. Meditation is not simply a waste of man</font>'<font
    face="Times New Roman">s valuable time. The advanced mind of a meditator can solve so many
    human problems and is very useful to enlighten others. Meditation is very useful to help a
    person live peacefully despite various disturbances that are so prevalent in this modern
    world. We cannot be expected to retire to a jungle or forest to live in ivory towers</font>?'<font
    face="Times New Roman">far from the madding crowd</font>'<font face="Times New Roman">. By
    practising right meditation we can have an abode for temporary oblivion. Meditation has
    the purpose of training a person to face, understand and conquer this very world in which
    we live. Meditation teaches us to adjust ourselves to bear with the numerous obstacles to
    life in the modern world.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people practise meditation in order to satisfy their
    material desires; they want to further their material gains. They want to use meditation
    to get better jobs. They want to earn more money or to operate their business more
    efficiently. Perhaps they fail to understand that the aim of meditation is not to increase
    but to decrease desires. Materialistic motives are hardly suitable for proper meditation,
    the goal of which lies beyond worldly affairs. One should meditate to try to attain
    something that even money cannot buy or bring.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you practice meditation, you can learn to behave like a
    gentleman even though you are disturbed by others. Through meditation you can learn how to
    relax the body and to calm the mind; you can learn to be tranquil and happy within.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as an engine gets overheated and damaged when it is
    run for a prolonged period and requires cooling down to overcome this, so also the mind
    gets overtaxed when we subject it to a sustained degree of mental effort and it is only
    through meditation that relaxation or cooling can be achieved. Meditation strengthens the
    mind to control human emotion when it is disturbed by negative thoughts and feelings such
    as jealousy, anger, pride and envy.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you practise meditation, you can learn to make the
    proper decision when you are at a cross-roads in life and are at a loss as to which way to
    turn. These qualities cannot be purchased from anywhere. No amount of money or property
    can buy these qualities, yet you attain them through meditation. And finally the ultimate
    object of Buddhist meditation is to eradicate all defilements from the mind and to attain
    the final goal -- Nibbana.</font> </p>
    <p><font><font face="Times New Roman">Nowadays, however, the practice of meditation has
    been abused by people. They want immediate and quick results, just as they expect quick
    returns for everything they do in daily life. In Buddhism, as is the case with other
    eastern cultures, patience is a most important quality. The mind must be brought under
    control in slow degrees and one should not try to reach for the higher states without
    proper training. We have heard of over-enthusiastic young men and women literally going
    out of their minds because they adopted the wrong attitudes towards meditation. Meditation
    is a gentle way of conquering the defilements which pollute the mind. If people want </font>'<font
    face="Times New Roman">success</font>' <font face="Times New Roman">or </font>'<font
    face="Times New Roman">achievement</font>' <font face="Times New Roman">to boast to others
    that they have attained this or that level of meditation, they are abusing the method of
    mental culture. One must be trained in morality and one must clearly understand that to be
    successful in the discipline of meditation worldly achievement must not be equated with
    spiritual development. Ideally, it is good to work under an experienced teacher who will
    help his student to develop along the right path. </font></font>But above all one must
    never be in a hurry to achieve too much too quickly. </p>
