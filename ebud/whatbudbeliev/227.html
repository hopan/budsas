    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">W</font><font face="Times New Roman">omen's
    position in Buddhism is unique. The Buddha gave women full freedom to participate in a
    religious life. The Buddha was the first religious Teacher who gave this religious freedom
    to women. Before the Buddha, women's duties had been restricted to the kitchen; women were
    not even allowed to enter any temple or to recite any religious scripture. During the
    Buddha's time, women's position in society was very low. The Buddha was criticized by the
    prevailing establishment when He gave this freedom to women. His move to allow women to
    enter the Holy Order was extremely radical for the times. Yet the Buddha allowed women to
    prove themselves and to show that they too had the capacity like men to attain the highest
    position in the religious way of life by attaining Arahantahood. Every woman in the world
    must be grateful to the Buddha for showing them the real religious way of living and for
    giving such freedom to them for the first time in world history. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A good illustration of the prevailing attitude towards
    women during the Buddha's time is found in these words of Mara: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'No woman, with the two-finger wisdom (<i>narrow)</i>
    which is hers, could ever hope to reach those heights which are attained only by the
    sages.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Undoubtedly, the Buddha was vehement in contradicting such
    attitude. The nun (bhikkhuni) to whom Mara addressed these words, gave the following
    reply: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'When one's mind is well concentrated and wisdom
    never fails, does the fact of being a woman make any difference?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Kosala was very disappointed when he heard that his
    Queen had given birth to a baby girl. He had expected a boy. To console the sad King, the
    Buddha said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'A female child, O Lord of men, may prove</font><br>
      Even a better offspring than a male. <br>
      For she may grow up wise and virtuous, <br>
      <font>Her husband's mother reverencing, true wife,</font> <br>
      The boy that she may bear may do great deeds, <br>
      And rule great realms, yes, such a son <br>
      <font>Of noble wife becomes his country's guide,'</font> - <i>(Samyutta Nikaya)</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha has confirmed that man is not always the only
    wise one; woman is also wise. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nowadays many religionists like to claim that their
    religions give women equal rights. We only have to look at the world around us today to
    see the position of women in many societies. It seems that they have no property rights,
    are discriminated in various fields and generally suffer abuse in many subtle forms. Even
    in western countries, women like the Suffragettes had to fight very hard for their rights.
    According to Buddhism, it is not justifiable to regard women as inferior. The Buddha
    Himself was born as a woman on several occasions during His previous births in Samsara and
    even as a women He developed the noble qualities and wisdom until He gained Enlightenment
    or Buddhahood. </font></p>
