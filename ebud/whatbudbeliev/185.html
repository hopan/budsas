      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>When a man has learned how to live as a real human
      being without disturbing others, he can live peacefully without any fear in his heart.</i>
      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">A</font><font face="Times New Roman">ccording to
    the Buddha, man himself is the maker of his own destiny. He has none to blame for his lot
    since he alone is responsible for his own life. He makes his own life for better or for
    worse. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha says: man creates everything. All our griefs,
    perils and misfortunes are of our own creation. We spring from no other source than our
    own imperfection of heart and mind. We are the results of our good and bad actions
    committed in the past under the influence of greed and delusion. And since we ourselves
    brought them into being, it is within our power to overcome bad effects and cultivate good
    natures. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The human mind, like that of an animal, is something
    governed by animal instinct. But unlike the animal mind, the human mind can be trained for
    higher values. If man's mind is not properly cultured, that uncultured mind creates a
    great deal of trouble in this world. Sometimes man's behavior is more harmful and more
    dangerous than animal behavior. Animals have no religious problems, no language problems,
    no political problems, no social and ethical problems, no colour-bar problems. They fight
    only for their food, shelter and sex. But, there are thousand of problems created by
    mankind. Their behavior is such that they would not be able to solve any of these problems
    without creating further problems. Man is reluctant to admit his weaknesses. He is not
    willing to shoulder his responsibilities. His attitude is always to blame others for his
    failure. If we become more responsible in our actions, we can maintain peace and
    happiness.</font> </font></p>
