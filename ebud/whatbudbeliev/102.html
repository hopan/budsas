    face="Times New Roman">Nibbana </font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">N</font>ibbana is the highest bliss, a
    supramundane state of eternal happiness. The happiness of <em>Nibbana</em> cannot be
    experienced by indulging the senses but calming them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Nibbana </em>is the final goal of Buddhism. What is <em>Nibbana</em>
    then? It is not easy to know what <em>Nibbana</em> really is; it is easier to know what <em>Nibbana</em>
    is not. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Nibbana i</em>s not nothingness or extinction. Would
    the Buddha leave his family and kingdom and preach for 45 years, all for nothingness? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Nibbana </em>is not a paradise. Several centuries
    after the Buddha, some of the Buddhist sects began to introduce Nibbana as a paradise.
    Their purpose of equating Nibbana with a heavenly world was to convince the
    less-intellectually-gifted<font> and to attract them to the teachings of the sect.
    Striving for Nibbana came to mean looking for a nice place where everything is beautiful
    and where everyone is eternally happy. This might be a very comfortable folktale, but it
    is not the Nibbana that the Buddha experienced and introduced. During His time the Buddha
    did not deny the idea of paradise as it was presented in the early Indian religions. But
    the Buddha knew that this paradise was within<i> Samsara</i> and the final liberation was
    beyond it. The Buddha could see that the Path to <i>Nibbana</i> led beyond the heavens.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If <i>Nibbana</i> is not a place, where is <i>Nibbana</i>
    then? <i>Nibbana</i> exists just as fire exists. However, there is no storage place for
    fire or for <i>Nibbana</i>. But when you rub pieces of wood together, then the friction
    and heat are the proper conditions for fire to arise. Likewise, when the nature in man's
    mind is such that he is free from all defilements, then Nibbanic bliss will appear. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You can experience <i>Nibbana</i>. Until you experience
    the supreme state of Nibbanic bliss, you can only speculate as to what it really is. For
    those who insist on the theory, the texts offer some help. The texts suggest that <i>Nibbana</i>
    is a supra-mundane state of unalloyed happiness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>By itself, <i>Nibbana</i> is quite unexplainable and
    quite undefinable. As darkness can be explained only by its opposite, light, and as calm
    can only be explained by its opposite, motion, so likewise <i>Nibbana</i>, as a state
    equated to the extinction of all suffering can be explained by its opposite?the suffering
    that is being endured in<i> Samsara</i>. As darkness prevails wherever there is no light,
    as calm prevails wherever there is no motion, so likewise <i>Nibbana</i> is everywhere
    where suffering and change and impurity do not prevail.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A sufferer who scratches his sores can experience a
    temporary relief. This temporary relief will aggravate the wounds and cause the disease to
    be enhanced. The joy of the final cure can hardly be compared to the fleeting relief
    obtained from the scratching. Likewise, satisfying the craving for sense-desires brings
    only temporary gratification or happiness which prolongs the stay in<i> Samsara</i>. The
    cure for the samsaric disease is <i>Nibbana</i>. <i>Nibbana</i> is an end of the cravings
    which cause all the sufferings of birth, old age, disease, death, grief, lamentation and
    despair. The joy of Nibbanic cure can hardly be compared to the temporary Samsaric
    pleasure gained through fulfilling the sense desires. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>It is dangerous to speculate on what <i>Nibbana</i>
    is; it is better to know how to prepare the conditions necessary for <i>Nibbana</i>, how
    to attain the inner peace and clarity of vision that leads to <i>Nibbana</i>. Follow the
    Buddha's advice: put His Teachings into practice. Get rid of all your defilements which
    are rooted in greed, hatred, and delusion. Purify yourself of all desires and realize
    absolute selflessness. Lead a life of right moral conduct and from all selfishness and
    illusion. Then, <i>Nibbana</i> is gained and experienced.</font> </font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Nibbana and Samsara </font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A well-known Mahayana Buddhist scholar, Nagarjuna, says
    that<i> Samsara</i> and <i>Nibbana</i> are one. This interpretation can easily be
    misunderstood by others. However to state that the concept of<i> Samsara</i> and <i>Nibbana</i>
    are the same is to say that there is no difference in voidness of component things and the
    unconditioned state of <i>Nibbana</i>. In accordance with the Pali Tipitaka,<i> Samsara</i>
    is described as the unbroken continuation of the five aggregates, four elements and twelve
    bases or sources of mental processes whereas <i>Nibbana</i> is described as the extinction
    of those relative physical and mental sources. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>However, it is admitted that those who gain Nibbanic
    bliss, can experience it during their existence in<i> Samsara</i>. In any case, after
    their death, the link with those elements will be eliminated, for the simple reason that <i>Nibbana</i>
    is unconditioned, not relative or interdependent. If there is to be anything at all after <i>Nibbana</i>,
    it would have to be 'Absolute Truth'.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You must learn to be detached from all worldly things. If
    there is any attachment to anyone or to anything or if there is any aversion to anyone or
    anything, you will never attain <i>Nibbana</i>, for <i>Nibbana</i> is beyond all opposites
    of attachment and aversion, likes and dislikes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>When that ultimate state is attained, you will fully
    understand this worldly life for which you now crave. This world will cease to be an
    object of your desire. You will realize the sorrow and impermanence and impersonality of
    all that lives and that does not live. By depending on teachers or holy books without
    using your own effort in the right manner, it is difficult to gain realization of <i>Nibbana</i>.
    Your dreams will vanish. No castles will be built in the air. The tempest will be ended.
    Life's struggles will be over. Nature's process will have ceased. All your worries,
    miseries, responsibilities, disturbances, burdens, physical and mental ailments and
    emotions will vanish after attaining this most blissful state of <i>Nibbana</i>.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To say that <i>Nibbana</i> is nothingness simply because
    one cannot perceive it with the five senses, is as illogical as to say that light does not
    exist simply because the blind do not see it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Nibbana</em> is attainable in this present life.
    Buddhism does not state that its ultimate goal could be reached only in life beyond. When
    Nibbana is realized in this life with the body remaining it is called <em>Sopadisesa
    Nibbana</em>. When an Arahant attains <em>Pari-Nibbana</em>, after the dissolution of the
    body, without any reminder of physical existence, it is called <em>Anupadisesa Nibbana</em>.
