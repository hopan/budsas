    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The real followers of the Buddha can practise this
      religion without adhering to any school or sect.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font><font size="6">A</font> few hundred years after the
    Buddha's passing away, there arose eighteen different schools or sects all of which
    claimed to represent the original Teachings of the Buddha. The differences between these
    schools were basically due to various interpretations of the Teachings of the Buddha. Over
    a period of time, these schools gradually merged into two main schools: Theravada and
    Mahayana. Today, a majority of the followers of Buddhism are divided into these two
    schools.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Basically Mahayana Buddhism grew out of the Buddha's
    teaching that each individual carries within himself the potential for Buddhahood.
    Theravadins say that this potential can be realized through individual effort.
    Mahayanists, on the other hand, believe that they can seek salvation through the
    intervention of other superior beings called Bodhisattas. According to them, Bodhisattas
    are future Buddhas who, out of compassion for their fellow human beings, have delayed
    their own attainment of Buddhahood until they have helped others towards liberation. In
    spite of this basic difference, however, it must be stressed that doctrinally there is
    absolutely no disagreement concerning the Dhamma as contained in the sacred Tripitaka
    texts. Because Buddhists have been encouraged by the Master to carefully inquire after the
    truth, they have been free to interpret the scriptures according to their understanding.
    But above all, both Mahayana and Theravada are one in their reverence for the Buddha. <em>(For
    a short, excellent exposition on this topic, read Dr. W. Rahula, 'Theravada and Mahayana
    Buddhism', published by The Buddhist Missionary Society.)</em></font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The areas of agreement between the two schools are as
    follows: </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Both accept Sakyamuni Buddha as the Teacher.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">The Four Noble Truths are exactly the same in both schools.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">The Eightfold Path is exactly the same in both schools.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>Pattica-Samuppada </i>or teaching on<i> Dependent
        Origination</i> is the same in both schools.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Both reject the idea of a supreme being who created and
        governed this world.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Both accept<i> Anicca</i>, <i>Dukkha, Anatta and Sila,
        Samadhi, Panna</i> without any difference.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people are of the view that Theravada is selfish
    because it teaches that people should seek their own salvation. But how can a selfish
    person gain Enlightenment? Both schools accept the three <i>Yana or Bodhi</i> and consider
    the Bodhisatta Ideal as the highest. The Mahayana has created many mystical Bodhisattas,
    while the Theravada believes that a Bodhisatta is a man amongst us who devotes his entire
    life for the attainment of perfection, and ultimately becomes a fully Enlightened Buddha
    for the well-being and happiness of the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The terms Hinayana (Small Vehicle) and Mahayana (Great
    Vehicle) are not known in the Theravada Pali literature. They are not found in the Pali
    Canon (<i>Tripitaka</i>) or in the Commentaries on the <i>Tripitaka</i>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Theravada Buddhists follow orthodox religious traditions
    that had prevailed in India two thousand five hundred years ago. They perform their
    religious services in the Pali language. They also expect to attain the final goal
    (Nibbana) by becoming a Supreme Enlightened Buddha, Pacceka Buddha, or an Arahant (the
    highest stage of sainthood). The Majority of them prefer the Arahantahood. Buddhists in
    Sri Lanka, Burma, and Thailand belong to this school. Mahayanists have changed the old
    religious customs. Their practices are in accordance with the customs and traditions of
    the countries where they live. Mahayanists perform their religious services in their
    mother tongue. They expect to attain the final goal (Nibbana) by becoming Buddhas. Hence,
    they honor both the Buddha and Bodhisatta (one who is destined to be a Buddha) with the
    same respect. Buddhists in China, Japan and Korea belong to this school. Most of those in
    Tibet and Mongolia follow another school of Buddhism which is known as Vajrayana. Buddhist
    scholars believe that this school inclines more towards the Mahayana sect. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is universally accepted by scholars that the terms<i>
    Hinayana</i> and <i>Mahayana </i>are later invention. Historically speaking, the Theravada
    already existed long before these terms came into being. That <i>Theravada,</i> considered
    to be the original teaching of the Buddha, was introduced to Sri Lanka and established
    there in the 3<sup>rd</sup> century B.C., during the time of Emperor Asoka of India. At
    that time there was nothing called <i>Mahayana</i>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mahayana as such appeared much later, about the beginning
    of the Christian era. Buddhism that went to Sri Lanka, with its Tripitaka and
    Commentaries, in the 3<sup>rd</sup> Century B.C., remained there intact as Theravada, and
    did not come into the scene of the Hinayana-Mahayana dispute that developed later in
    India. It seems therefore not legitimate to include Theravada in either of these two
    categories. However, after the inauguration of the World Fellowship of Buddhists in 1950,
    well-informed people, both in the East and in the West, use the term Theravada, and not
    the term Hinayana, with reference to Buddhism prevalent in South-east Asian countries.
    There are still outmoded people who use the term &quot;Hinayana&quot;. In fact, the Samdhi
    Nirmorcana Sutra (a Mahayana Sutra) clearly says that the Sravakayana -- Theravada, and
    the Mahayana constitute one Yana (ekayana) and that they are not two different and
    distinct <font>'vehicles'. Although different schools of Buddhism held different opinions
    on the teaching of the Buddha, they never had any violence or blood shed for more than two
    thousands years. This is the uniqueness of Buddhist tolerance.</font> </font></p>
