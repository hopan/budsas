    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>You perform real charity if you can give freely without
      expecting anything in return.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he essence of true charity is to
    give something without expecting anything in return for the gift. If a person expects some
    material benefit to arise from his gift, he is only performing an act of bartering and not
    charity. A charitable person should not make other people feel indebted to him or use
    charity as a way of exercising control over them. He should not even expect others to be
    grateful, for most people are forgetful though not necessarily ungrateful. The act of true
    charity is wholesome, has no strings attached, and leaves both the giver and the recipient
    free. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The meritorious deed of charity is highly praised by every
    religion. Those who have enough to maintain themselves should think of others and extend
    their generosity deserving cases. Among people who practise charity, there are some who
    give as a means of attracting others into their religion or creed. Such an act of giving
    which is performed with the ulterior motive of conversion cannot really be said to be true
    charity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhism views charity as an act to reduce personal
    greed which is an unwholesome mental state which hinders spiritual progress. A person who
    is on his way to spiritual growth must try to reduce his own selfishness and his strong
    desire for acquiring more and more. He should reduce his strong attachment to possessions
    which, if he is not mindful, can enslave him to greed. What he owns or has should instead
    be used for the benefit and happiness of others: his loved ones as well as those who need
    his help. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When giving, a person should not perform charity as an act
    of his body alone, but with his heart and mind as well. There must be joy in every act of
    giving. A distinction can be made between giving as a normal act of generosity and <i>dana.</i>
    In the normal act of generosity a person gives out of compassion and kindness when he
    realizes that someone else is in need of help, and he is in the position to offer the
    help. When a person performs <i>dana</i>, he gives as a means of cultivating charity as a
    virtue and of reducing his own selfishness and craving. He exercises wisdom when he
    recalls that dana is a very important quality to be practised by every Buddhist, and is
    the first perfection (paramita)practised by the Buddha in many of His previous births in
    search for Enlightenment. A person performs<i> dana</i> in appreciation of the great
    qualities and virtues of the Triple Gem. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many things which a person can give. He can give
    material things: food for the hungry, and money and clothes to the poor. He can also give
    his knowledge, skill, time, energy or effort to projects that can benefit others. He can
    provide a sympathetic ear and good counsel to a friend in trouble. He can restrain himself
    from killing other beings, and by so doing perform a gift of life to the helpless beings
    which would have otherwise been killed. He can also give a part of his body for the sake
    of others, such as donating his blood, eyes, kidney, etc. Some who seek to practise this
    virtue or are moved by great compassion or concern for others may also be prepared to
    sacrifice their own lives. In His previous births, the Bodhisatta had many a time given
    away parts of His body for the sake of others. He had also given up His life so that
    others might live, so great was His generosity and compassion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>But the greatest testimony to the Buddha's great
    compassion is His priceless gift to humanity?the Dhamma which can liberate all beings from
    suffering. To the Buddhist, the highest gift of all is the gift of Dhamma. This gift has
    great powers to change a life. When a person receives Dhamma with a pure mind and
    practices the Truth with earnestness, he cannot fail to change. He will experience greater
    happiness, peace and joy in his heart and mind. If he was once cruel, he becomes
    compassionate. If he was once revengeful, he becomes forgiving. Through Dhamma, the
    hateful becomes more compassionate, the greedy more generous, and the restless more
    serene. When a person has tasted Dhamma, not only will be experience happiness here and
    now, but also happiness in the lives hereafter as he journeys to <i>Nibbana.</i></font> </font></p>
