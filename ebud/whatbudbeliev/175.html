    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="+1">Religious Day</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As practised in many Buddhist countries, a real Buddhist
    funeral is a simple, solemn and dignified ceremony. Unfortunately, some people have
    included many unnecessary, extraneous items and superstitious practices into the funeral
    rites. The extraneous items and practices vary according to the traditions and customs of
    the people. They were introduced in olden days by people who probably could not understand
    the nature of life, nature of death, and what life would be after death. When such ideas
    were incorporated into Buddhist practices, people tended to blame Buddhism for expensive
    funeral rites. If only the Buddhist public would approach proper persons who have studied
    the real Teachings of the Buddha and Buddhist tradition, they could receive advice on how
    to perform Buddhist funeral rites. It is most unfortunate that a bad impression has been
    created that Buddhism encourages people to waste their money and time on unnecessary
    practices. It must be clearly understood that Buddhism has nothing to do with such debased
    practices. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists are not very particular regarding the burial or
    cremation of a dead body. In many Buddhist countries, cremation is customary. For hygienic
    and economic reasons, it is advisable to cremate. Today, the population in the world is
    increasing and if we continue to have dead bodies occupying valuable land, then one day
    all remaining available land will be occupied by the dead and the living will have no
    place to live. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>There are still some people who object to the
    cremation of dead bodies. They say that cremation is against god's law, in the same way
    they have objected to many other things in the past. It will take some time for such
    people to understand that cremation is much more appropriate and effective than burial.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand Buddhists do not believe that one day
    someone will come and awaken the departed persons spirits from their graveyards or the
    ashes from their urns and decide who should go to heaven and who should go to hell. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The consciousness or mental energy of the departed person
    has no connection with the body left behind or his skeleton or his ashes. Many people
    believe that if the deceased is not given a proper burial or if a sanctified tombstone is
    not placed on the grave, then the soul of the deceased will wander to the four corners of
    the world and weep and wail and sometimes even return to disturb the relatives. Such a
    belief cannot be found anywhere in Buddhism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists believe that when a person dies, rebirth will
    take place somewhere else according to his good or bad actions. As long as the person
    possesses the craving for existence, he must experience rebirth. Only the Arahants, who
    have gone beyond all passions will have no more rebirths and so after their death, they
    will attain their final goal <i>Nibbana.</i> </font></p>
