    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">A</font><font face="Times New Roman">s a
    'Compassionate Being', a Bodhisatta is destined to attain Buddhahood, and become a future
    Buddha, through the cultivation of his mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to gain Supreme Enlightenment, he practices
    transcendental virtues (Parami) to perfection. The virtues are generosity, morality,
    renunciation, wisdom, energy, patience, truthfulness, determination, loving-kindness, and
    even mindedness. He cultivates these Parami with compassion and wisdom, without being
    influenced by selfish motives or selfconceit. He works for the welfare and happiness of
    all beings, seeking to lessen the suffering of others throughout the series of his
    countless lives. In his journey to perfection, he is prepared to practice these virtues,
    sometimes even at the expense of his own life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In the Pali scriptures, the designation 'Bodhisatta'
    is given to Prince Siddhartha before His Enlightenment and to His former lives. The Buddha
    Himself used this term when speaking of His life prior to Enlightenment. According to the
    Pali texts there is no mention of Buddha Bodhi being the only way to attain the final goal
    of Nibbanic bliss. It was very rare for a disciple during the Buddha's time to forgo the
    opportunity to attain sainthood and instead declare bodhisattahood as his aspiration.
    However, there are some records that some followers of the Buddha did aspire to become
    Bodhisattas to gain 'Buddhahood'.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Mahayana school of thought, the Bodhisatta cult
    however, plays an important role. The Mahayana ideal regards the Bodhisatta as a being
    who, having brought himself to the brink of Nibbana, voluntarily delays the acquisition of
    his prize so that he may return to the world to make it accessible to others. He
    deliberately chooses to postpone his release from Samsara in order to show the path for
    others to attain Nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although Theravada Buddhists respect Bodhisattas, they do
    not regard them as being in the position to enlighten or save others before their own
    enlightenment. Bodhisattas are, therefore, not regarded as saviors. In order to gain their
    final salvation, all beings must follow the method prescribed by the Buddha and follow the
    example set by Him. They must also personally eradicate their mental defilements and
    develop all the great virtues. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Theravada Buddhists do not subscribe to the belief
    that everyone must strive to become a Buddha in order to gain Nibbana. However, the word '<i>Bodhi</i>'
    is used to refer to the qualities of a Buddha, or Pacceka Buddha and Arahant in
    expressions such as Sammasmbodhi, Pacceka Bodhi and Savaka Bodhi. In addition, many of the
    Buddhas mentioned in the Mahayana school are not historical Buddhas and are therefore not
    given much attention by Theravada Buddhists. The notion that certain Buddha and
    Bodhisattas are waiting in Sukhawati (Pure Abode) for those who pray to them is a notion
    quite foreign to the fundamental Teachings of the Buddha. Certain Bodhisattas are said to
    voluntarily remain in Sukhawati, without gaining enlightenment themselves, until every
    living being is saved. Given the magnitude of the universe and the infinite number of
    beings who are enslaved by ignorance and selfish desire, this is clearly an impossible
    task, since there can be no end to the number of beings.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Must a Bodhisatta always be a Buddhist? We may find among
    Buddhists some self-sacrificing and ever loving Bodhisattas. Sometimes they may not even
    be aware of their lofty aspiration, but they instinctively work hard to serve others and
    cultivate their pristine qualities. Nevertheless, Bodhisattas are not only found among
    Buddhists, but possibly among the other religionists as well. The Jataka stories, which
    relate the previous birth stories of the Buddha, describe the families and forms of
    existence taken by the Bodhisatta. Sometimes He was born as an animal. It is hard to
    believe that He could have been born in a Buddhist family in each and every life. But no
    matter what form He was born as or family he was born into. He invariably strived hard to
    develop certain virtues. His aspiration to gain perfection from life to life until final
    birth when he emerged as a Buddha, is the quality which clearly distinguishes a Bodhisatta
    from other beings. </font></p>
