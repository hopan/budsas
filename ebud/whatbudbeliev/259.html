    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Development of the God-idea </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To trace the origin and development of the God-idea, one
    must go back to the time when civilization was still in its infancy and modern science was
    still unknown. Primitive people, out of fear of and admiration towards natural phenomena,
    had believed in different spirits and gods. They used their belief in spirit and gods to
    form religions of their own. According to their respective circumstances and understanding
    capacity different people worshipped different gods and founded different faiths. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the beginning of the God-idea, people worshipped many
    gods--gods of trees, streams, lightning, storm, winds, the sun and all other terrestrial
    phenomena. These gods were related to each and every act of nature. Then gradually man
    began to attribute to these gods, sex and form as well as the physical and mental
    characteristics of human beings. Human attributes were given to the gods: love, hate,
    jealousy, fear, pride, envy and other emotions found among human beings. From all these
    gods, there slowly grew a realization that the phenomena of the universe were not many but
    were One. This understanding gave rise to the monotheistic god of recent ages. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In the process of development, the God-idea went
    through a variety of changing social and intellectual climates. It was regarded by
    different men in different ways. Some idealized god as the King of Heaven and Earth; they
    had a conception of god as a person. Others thought of god as an abstract principle. Some
    raised the ideal of Supreme deity to the highest heaven, while others brought it down to
    the lowest depths of the earth. Some pictured god in a paradise, while others made an idol
    and worshipped it. Some want so far as to say that there is no salvation without god?no
    matter how much good you do, you will not receive the fruits of your actions unless you
    act out of a faith in god. The Atheists said, 'No' and went on to affirm that god did not
    really exist at all. The Skeptics or Agnostics said, 'We do not or we cannot know.' The
    Positivists say that the God-idea was a meaningless problem since the idea of the term god
    'was not clear'. Thus there grew a variety of ideas and beliefs and names for the
    God-idea: pantheism, idolatry, belief in a formless god, and belief in many gods and
    goddesses.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Even the monotheistic god of recent times has gone
    through a variety of changes as it passed through different nations and people. The Hindu
    god is quite different from gods of other faiths. Thus numerous religions came into
    existence: each one differed greatly from the other in the end, and each one says that
    'God is One'.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The God-idea and Creation </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As each religion came into existence and developed around
    the God-idea, religion developed its own particular explanation of creation. Thus the
    God-idea became associated with various myths. People used the God-idea as a vehicle for
    their explanation of the existence of man and the nature of the universe. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today, intelligent men, who have carefully reviewed all
    the available facts, have come to the conclusion that, like the God-idea, the creation of
    myths must be regarded as an evolution of the human imagination which began with the
    misunderstanding of the phenomena of nature. These misunderstandings were rooted in the
    fear and ignorance of primitive man. Even today, man still retains his primitive
    interpretations of creation. In the light of recent, scientific thinking, the theological
    definition of god is vague and hence has no place in the contemporary creation theories or
    myths. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>If man is created by an external source, then he
    must belong to that source and not to himself. According to Buddhism, man is responsible
    for everything he does. Thus Buddhists have no reason to believe that man came into
    existence in the human form through any external sources. They believe that man is here
    today because of his own action. He is neither punished nor rewarded by anyone but himself
    according to his own good and bad action. In the process of evolution, the human being
    came into existence. However, there are no Buddha-words to support the belief that the
    world was created by anybody. The scientific discovery of gradual development of the
    world-system conforms with the Buddha's Teachings.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Human Weakness and the Concept of God </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Both the concept of God and its associated creation myths
    have been protected and defended by believers who need these ideas to justify their
    existence and usefulness to human society. All the believers claim to have received their
    respective scriptures as Revelation; in other words, they all profess to come directly
    from the one God. Each God-religion claims that it stands for Universal Peace and
    Universal Brotherhood and other such high ideals. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However great the ideals of the religious might be, the
    history of the world shows that the religions up to the present day have also helped in
    spreading superstitions. Some have stood against science and the advancement of knowledge,
    leading to ill-feelings, murders and wars. In this respect, the God-religions have failed
    in their attempt to enlighten mankind. For example, in certain countries when people pray
    for mercy, their hands are stained with the blood of the morbid sacrifices of innocent
    animals and sometimes, even fellow human beings. These poor and helpless creatures were
    slaughtered at the desecrated altars of imaginary and imperceptible gods. It has taken a
    long time for people to understand the futility of such cruel practices in the name of
    religion. The time has come for them to realize that the path of real purification is
    through love and understanding. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Dr. G. Dharmasiri in his book 'Buddhist critique of
    the Christian Concept of God' has mentioned, 'I see that though the notion of God contains
    sublime moral strands, it also has certain implications that are extremely dangerous to
    the humans as well as to the other beings on this planet.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'One major threat to humanity is the blindfold
    called 'authority' imposed on the humans by the concept of God. All theistic religions
    consider authority as ultimate and sacred. It was this danger that the Buddha was pointing
    at in the <i>Kalama Sutta</i>. At the moment, human individuality and freedom are
    seriously threatened by various forms of authorities. Various 'authorities' have been
    trying to make 'you' a follower. On top of all our 'traditional' authorities, a new form
    of authority has emerged in the name of 'science'. And lately, the mushrooming new
    religions and the menace of the Gurus(as typified by Jim Jones), have become live threats
    to the individual's human freedom and dignity. The Buddha's eternal plea is for you to
    become a Buddha, and He showed, in a clearly rational way, that each and every one of us
    has the perfect potentiality and capacity to attain that ideal.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">God-religions offer no salvation without God. Thus a man
    might conceivably have climbed to the highest pinnacle of virtue, and he might have led a
    righteous way of life, and he might even have climbed to the highest level of holiness,
    yet he is to be condemned to eternal hell just because he did not believe in the existence
    of God. On the other hand, a man might have sinned deeply and yet, having made a late
    repentance, he can be forgiven and therefore 'saved'. From the Buddhist point of view,
    there is no justification in this kind of doctrine. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Despite the apparent contradictions of the
    God-religions, it is not deemed advisable to preach a Godless doctrine since the belief in
    god has also done a tremendous service to mankind, especially in places where the god
    concept is desirable. This belief in god has helped mankind to control his animal nature.
    And much help has been granted to others in the name of god. At the same time, man feels
    insecure without the belief in god. He finds protection and inspiration when that belief
    is in his mind. The reality or validity of such a belief is based on man's understanding
    capacity and spiritual maturity.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, religion should also concern our practical life.
    It is to be used as a guide to regulate our conduct in the world. Religion tells us what
    to do and what not to do. If we do not follow a religion sincerely, mere religious labels
    or belief in god do not serve us in our daily life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>On the other hand, if the followers of various
    religions are going to quarrel and to condemn other beliefs and practices -- especially to
    prove or disprove the existence of God -- and if they are going to harbor anger towards
    other religions because of their different religious views, then they are creating
    enormous disharmony amongst the various religious communities. Whatever religious
    difference we have, it is our duty to practise tolerance, patience and understanding. It
    is our duty to respect the other man's religious belief even if we cannot accommodate it;
    tolerance is necessary for the sake of harmonious and peaceful living.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, it does not serve any purpose to introduce this
    concept of god to those who are not ready to appreciate it. To some people this belief is
    not important to lead a righteous life. There are many who lead a noble life without such
    belief while amongst believers there are many who violate the peace and happiness of
    innocent people. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists can also co-operate with those who hold this
    concept of god, if they use this concept for the peace, happiness and welfare of mankind
    but not with those who abuse this concept by threatening people in order to introduce this
    belief just for their own benefit and with ulterior motives. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For more than 2,500 years, all over the world, Buddhists
    have practised and introduced Buddhism very peacefully without the necessity of sustaining
    the concept of a creator of God. And they will continue to sustain this religion in the
    same manner without disturbing the followers of other religions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, with due respect to other religionists, it must
    be mentioned that any attempt to introduce this concept into Buddhism is unnecessary. Let
    Buddhists maintain their belief since it is harmless to others and, let the basic
    Teachings of the Buddha remain. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From time immemorial, Buddhists have led a peaceful
    religious life without incorporating the particular concept of God. They should be capable
    of sustaining their particular religion without the necessity, at this juncture, of
    someone trying to force something down their throats against their will. Having full
    confidence in their Buddha Dhamma, Buddhists should be permitted to work and seek their
    own salvation without any undue interference from other sources. Others can uphold their
    beliefs and concepts, Buddhist will uphold theirs, without any rancor. We do not challenge
    others in regard to their religious persuasions, we expect reciprocal treatment in regard
    to our own beliefs and practices.</font></p>
