    <td width="100%"><h2 align="center"><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman"><ALIGN="CENTER"> What is
    Abhidhamma?</font></h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Abhidhamma is the analytical doctrine of mental
      faculties and elements.</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he<i> Abhidhamma Pitaka</i>
    contains the profound moral psychology and philosophy of the Buddha's teaching, in
    contrast to the simpler discourses in the <i>Sutta Pitaka.</i></font></font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">The knowledge gained from the sutta can certainly
    help us in overcoming our difficulties, as well as in developing our moral conduct and
    training the mind. Having such knowledge will enable one to lead a life which is peaceful,
    respectable, harmless and noble. By listening to the discourses, we develop understanding
    of the Dhamma and can mould our daily lives accordingly. The concepts behind certain words
    and terms used in the Sutta Pitaka are, however, subject to changes and should be
    interpreted within the context of the social environment prevailing at the Buddha's time.
    The concepts used in the sutta are like the conventional words and terms lay people use to
    express scientific subjects. While concepts in the sutta are to be understood in the
    conventional sense, those used in the Abhidhamma must be understood in the ultimate sense.
    The concepts expressed in the Abhidhamma are like the precise scientific words and terms
    used by scientists to prevent misinterpretations.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is only in the Abhidhamma that explanations are given
    on how and at which mental beats a person can create good and bad <i>karmic</i> thoughts,
    according to his desires and other mental states. Clear explanations of the nature of the
    different mental faculties and precise analytical interpretations of the elements can be
    found in this important collection of discourses.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Understanding the<i> Dhamma </i>through the knowledge
    gained from the<i> sutta</i> is like the knowledge acquired from studying the
    prescriptions for different types of sicknesses. Such knowledge when applied can certainly
    help to cure certain types of sicknesses. On the other hand, a qualified physician, with
    his precise knowledge, can diagnose a wider range of sicknesses and discover their causes.
    This specialized knowledge puts him in a better position to prescribe more effective
    remedies. Similarly, a person who has studied the <i>Abhidhamma </i>can better understand
    the nature of the mind and analyse the mental attitudes which cause a human being to
    commit mistakes and develop the will to avoid evil.</font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">The<i> Abhidhamma </i>teaches that the egoistic
    beliefs and other concepts such as 'I'<i>, &quot;you&quot;, 'man</i>' and '<i>the world</i>',
    which we use in daily conversation, do not adequately describe the<i> real </i>nature of
    existence. The conventional concepts do not reflect the fleeting nature of pleasures,
    uncertainties, impermanence of every component thing, and the conflict among the elements
    and energies intrinsic in all animate or inanimate things. The<i> Abhidhamma </i>doctrine
    gives a clear exposition of the ultimate nature of man and brings the analysis of the
    human condition further than other studies known to man.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>Abhidhamma </i>deals with realities existing in the
    ultimate sense, or <i>paramattha</i> <i>dhamma</i> in Pali. There are four such realities:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font><i><p></i><font face="Times New Roman">1- <i>Citta</i>, mind or consciousness,
      defined as 'that which knows or experiences' an object. <i>Citta </i>occurs as distinct
      momentary states of consciousness.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2- <em>Cetasika</em>, the mental factors that arise and
      occur along with the <i>citta</i>.</font></p>
      <i><p></i><font face="Times New Roman">3- <i>Rupa</i>, physical phenomenon or material
      form.</font></p>
      <i><p></i><font face="Times New Roman">4- <i>Nibbana</i>, the unconditioned state of bliss
      which is the final goal.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <i><font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">Citta</i>, the <i>cetasika, </i>and rupa
    are conditioned realities. They arise because of conditions sustaining them cease to
    continue to do so. They are impermanent states. <i>Nibbana</i>, on the other hand, is an
    unconditioned reality. It does not arise and, therefore, does not fall away. These four
    realities can be experienced regardless of the names we may choose to give them. Other
    than these realities, everything -- be it within ourselves or without, whether in the
    past, present or future, whether coarse or subtle, low or lofty, far or near -- is a
    concept and not an ultimate reality. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Citta,</i> <i>cetasika</i>, and <i>Nibbana </i>are also
    called <i>nama. Nibbana </i>is an unconditioned <i>nama. </i>The two conditioned<i> nama, </i>that
    is<i>,</i> cita and cetasika, together with rupa (form), make up psychophysical organisms,
    including human beings. Both mind and matter, or nama-rupa, are analysed in Abhidhamma as
    though under a microscope. Events connected with the process of birth and death are
    explained in detail. The Abhidhamma clarifies intricate points of the Dhamma and enables
    the arising of an understanding of reality, thereby setting forth in clear terms the Path
    of Emancipation. The realization we gain from the Abhidhamma with regard to our lives and
    the world is not in a conventional sense, but absolute reality. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The clear exposition of thought processes in Abhidhamma
    cannot be found in any other psychological treatise either in the east or west.
    Consciousness is defined, while thoughts are analysed and classified mainly from an
    ethical standpoint. The composition of each type of consciousness is set forth in detail.
    The fact that consciousness flows like a steam, a view propounded by psychologists like
    William James, becomes extremely clear to one who understands the <i>Abhidhamma</i>. In
    addition, a student of <i>Abhidhamma</i> can fully comprehend the Anatta (No-soul)
    doctrine, which is important both from a philosophical and ethical standpoint. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>Abhidhamma</i> explains the process of rebirth in
    various planes after the occurrence of death without anything to pass from one life to
    another. This explanation provides support to the doctrine of <i>Kamma</i> and Rebirth. It
    also gives a wealth of details about the mind, as well as the units of mental and material
    forces, properties of matter, sources of matter, relationship of mind and matter. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In the <i>Abhidhamattha Sangaha,</i> a manual of <i>Abhidhamma</i>,
    there is a brief exposition of the 'Law of Dependent Origination&quot;, followed by a
    descriptive account of the Causal Relations which finds no parallel in any other study of
    the human condition anywhere else in the world. Because of its analytics and profound
    expositions, the <i>Abhidhamma</i> is not a subject of fleeting interest designed for the
    superficial reader.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To what extent can we compare modern psychology with the
    analysis provided in the <i>Abhidhamma</i>? Modern psychology, limited as it is, comes
    within the scope of Abhidhamma in so far as it deals with the mind -- with thoughts,
    thought processes, and mental states. The difference lies in the fact that Abhidhamma does
    not accept the concept of a psyche or a soul. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The analysis of the nature of the mind given in the
    Abhidhamma is not available through any other source.. Even modern psychologists are very
    much in the dark with regards to subjects like mental impulses or mental beats (Javana
    Citta) as discussed in the Abhidhamma. Dr. Graham Howe, an eminent Harley Street
    psychologist, wrote in his book, the<i> Invisible Anatomy</i>: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'In the course of their work many psychologists have
    found, as the pioneer work of C.G. Jung has shown, that we are near to [the] Buddha. To
    read a little Buddhism is to realize that the Buddhists knew two thousand five hundred
    years ago far more about our modern problems of psychology than they have yet been given
    credit for. They studied these problems long ago, and found the answers too. We are now
    rediscovering the Ancient Wisdom of the East.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some scholars assert that the Abhidhamma is not the
    teaching of the Buddha, but it grew out of the commentaries on the basic teachings of the
    Buddha. These commentaries are said to be the work of great scholar monks. Tradition,
    however, attributes the nucleus of the Abhidhamma to the Buddha Himself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Commentators state that the Buddha, as a mark of gratitude
    to His mother who was born as a deva in a celestial plane, preached the <i>Abhidhamma</i>
    to His mother together with other devas continuously for three months. The principal
    topics (<i>matika</i>) of the advanced teaching, such as moral states (kusala dhamma) and
    immoral states (akusala dhamma), were then repeated by the Buddha to Venerable Sariputta
    Thera, who subsequently elaborated them and later compiled them into six books. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From ancient times there were controversies as to whether
    the Abhidhamma was really taught by the Buddha. While this discussion may be interesting
    for academic purposes, what is important is for us to experience and understand the
    realities described in the Abhidhamma. One will realize for oneself that such profound and
    consistently verifiable truths can only emanate from a supremely enlightened source <font>--
    </font>from a Buddha. Much of what is contained in the<i> Abhidhamma </i>is also found in
    the <i>Sutta Pitaka</i>. Such a statement, of course, cannot be supported by evidence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Theravada tradition, the essence,
    fundamentals and framework of the Abhidhamma are ascribed to the Buddha, although the
    tabulations and classifications may have been the work of later disciples. What is
    important is the essence. It is this that we would try to experience for ourselves. The
    Buddha Himself clearly took this stand of using the knowledge of the Abhidhamma to clarify
    many existing psychological, metaphysical and philosophical problems. Mere intellectual
    quibbling about whether the Buddha taught the Abhidhamma or not will not help us to
    understand reality. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The question is also raised whether the Abhidhamma is
    essential for Dhamma practice. The answer to this will depend on the individual who
    undertakes the practice. People vary in their levels of understanding, their temperaments
    and spiritual development. Ideally, all the different spiritual faculties should be
    harmonized, but some people are quite contented with devotional practices based on faith,
    while others are keen on developing penetrative insight. The Abhidhamma is most useful to
    those who want to understand the Dhamma in greater depth and detail. It aids the
    development of insight into the three characteristics of existence<font> -- </font>impermanence,
    unsatisfactoriness, and non-self. It is useful not only for the periods devoted to formal
    meditation, but also during the rest of the day when we are engaged in various mundane
    chores. We derive great benefit from the study of the Abhidhamma when we experience
    absolute reality. In addition, a comprehensive knowledge of the Abhidhamma is useful for
    those engaged in teaching and explaining the Dhamma. In fact the real meaning of the most
    important Buddhist terminologies such as <i>Dhamma, Kamma, Samsara, Sankhara, Paticca
    Samuppada </i>and <i>Nibbana</i> cannot be understood without a knowledge of <i>Abhidhamma.</i>
