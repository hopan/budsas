    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>If any religion has the Four Noble Truths and the
      Eightfold Path, then it can be regarded as a proper religion.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">I</font><font face="Times New Roman">t is a very
    difficult for a man to find out why there are so many different religions, and which
    religion is the true one. Followers of every religion are trying to show the superiority
    of their religion. Diversity has created some uniformity, but in matters of religion, men
    took upon each other with jealousy, hatred and disdain. The most respected religious
    practices in one religion are deemed ridiculous to others. To introduce their divine and
    peaceful messages some people have to resorted to weapons and wars. Have they polluted the
    good name of religion? It seems that certain religions are responsible for dividing
    instead of uniting mankind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To find a true and proper religion, we must weigh with an
    unbiased mind what exactly is a false religion. False religion or philosophies include:
    materialism which denies survival after death; amoralism which denies good and evil; any
    religion which asserts that man is miraculously saved or doomed; theistic evolution which
    holds that everything is preordained and everyone is destined to attain eventual salvation
    through mere faith. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is free from unsatisfactory and uncertain
    foundations. Buddhism is realistic and verifiable. Its Truths have been verified by the
    Buddha, verified by His disciples, and always remain open to be verified by anyone who
    wishes to do so. And today, the Teachings of the Buddha, are being verified by the most
    severe methods of scientific investigation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha advises that any form of religion is proper if
    it contains the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path. This clearly shows that
    the Buddha did not want to form a particular religion. What He wanted was to reveal the
    Ultimate Truth of our life and the world. Although the Buddha expounded the Four Noble
    Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path, this method is not the property of Buddhists alone.
    This is universal Truth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most people find it necessary to put forth arguments to <font>'prove'
    the validity of the religion that they are following. Some claim that their religion is
    the oldest and therefore contains the truth. Others claim that their religion is the
    latest or newest and therefore contains the truth. Some claim that their religion has the
    most followers and therefore contains the truth. Yet none of these arguments are valid to
    establish the truth of a religion. One can judge the value of a religion by using only
    common sense and understanding.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some religious traditions require man to be subservient to
    a greater power than himself, a power which controls his creation, his actions and his
    final deliverance. The Buddha did not accept such powers. Rather, He assigned to man that
    very power by asserting that each man is his own creator, responsible for his own
    salvation. That is why it is said that <font>'There is none so godless as the Buddha and
    yet none so godlike'. The religion of the Buddhists gives man a great sense of dignity; at
    the same time it also gives him great responsibility. A Buddhist cannot put the blame on
    an external power when evil befalls him. But he can face misfortune with equanimity
    because he knows that he has the power to extricate himself from all misery.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>One of the reason why Buddhism appeals to
    intellectuals and those with a good education, is that the Buddha expressly discouraged
    His followers from accepting anything they heard(even if it came from Himself)without
    first testing its validity. The teachings of the Buddha have remained and survived
    precisely because many intellectuals have challenged every aspect of the teachings and
    have concluded that the Buddha had always spoken the undeniable Truth. While other
    religionists are trying to 'reassess' their founder's teachings in the light of modern
    knowledge about the Universe, the Buddha's teaching are being verified by scientists.</font>
