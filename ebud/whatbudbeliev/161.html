    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>By observing precepts, not only do you cultivate your
      moral strength, but you also perform the highest service to your fellow beings.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font><font size="6">E</font>very country or society has
    its code of what are considered to be moral actions within its social context. These codes
    are often linked to the society's interest and its code of law. An action is considered
    right so long as it does not break the law and transgress public or individual
    sensitivities. These man-made codes are flexible and amended from time to time to suit
    changing circumstances. Important as they are to society, these man-made standards cannot
    serve as a reliable guide to some principles of morality which can be applied universally.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>By contrast, Buddhist morality is not the invention
    of human minds. Neither is it based on tribal ethics which are gradually being replaced by
    humanistic codes. It is based on the universal law of cause and effect (kamma), and
    considers a 'good' or 'bad' action in terms of the manner it affects oneself and others.
    An action, even if it brings benefit to oneself, cannot be considered a good action if it
    causes physical and mental pain to another being.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Buddhist morality addresses a very common, yet
    crucial question: How can we judge if an action is good or bad? The answer, according to
    Buddhism, is a simple one. The quality of an action hinges on the intention or motivation
    (cetana)from which it originates. If a person performs an action out of greed, hatred, and
    delusion, his action is considered to be unwholesome. On the other hand, if he performs
    and action out of love, charity, and wisdom, his action is a wholesome one. Greed, Hatred
    and Delusion are known as the 'Three Evil Root', while love, charity and wisdom as the
    'Three Good Roots'. The word 'root' refers to the intention from which that action
    originates. Therefore, no matter how a person tries to disguise the nature of his action,
    the truth can be found by examining his thoughts which gave rise to that action. And the
    mind is the source of all our speech and action.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In Buddhism, a person's first duty is to cleanse
    himself of the mental defilements of greed, hatred and ignorance. The reason for doing
    this is not because of fear or desire to please some divine beings. If this is so, a
    person is still lacking in wisdom. He is only acting out of fear like the little child who
    is afraid of being punished for being naughty. </font>A Buddhist should act out of
    understanding and wisdom. He performs wholesome deeds because he realizes that by so doing
    he develops his moral strength which provides the foundation for spiritual growth, leading
    to Liberation. In addition, he realizes that his happiness and suffering are self-created
    through the operation of the Law of Kamma. To minimize the occurrence of troubles and
    problems in his life, he makes the effort to refrain from doing evil. He performs good
    actions because he know that these will bring him peace and happiness. Since everyone
    seeks happiness in life, and since it is possible for him to provide the condition for
    happiness, then there is every reason for him to do good and avoid evil. Furthermore, the
    uprooting of these mental defilements, the source of all anti-social acts, will bring
    great benefits to others in society. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="+1">Five Precepts</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lay Buddhist morality is embodies in the Five Precepts,
    which may be considered at two levels. First, it enables men to live together in civilized
    communities with mutual trust and respect. Second, it is the starting point for the
    spiritual journey towards Liberation. Unlike commandments, which are supposedly divine
    commands imposed on men, precepts are accepted voluntarily by the person himself,
    especially when he realizes the usefulness of adopting some training rules for
    disciplining his body, speech and mind. Understanding, rather than fear of punishment, is
    the reason for following the precepts. A good Buddhist should remind himself to follow the
    Five Precepts daily. They are as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- killing living creatures<br>
      - taking what is not given<br>
      - sexual misconduct<br>
      - false speech<br>
      - taking intoxicating drugs and liquor,</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Besides understanding the Five Precepts merely as a set of
    rules of abstention, a Buddhist should remind himself that through the precepts he
    practices the Five Ennoblers as well. While the Five Precepts tells him what not to do,
    the Five Ennoblers tells him which qualities to cultivate, namely, loving kindness,
    renunciation, contentment, truthfulness, and mindfulness. When a person observes the First
    precept of not killing, he controls his hatred and cultivates loving kindness. In the
    Second Precept, he controls his greed and cultivates his renunciation or non-attachment.
    He controls sensual lust and cultivates his contentment in the Third Precept. In the
    Fourth Precept, he abstains from false speech and cultivates truthfulness, while he
    abstains from unwholesome mental excitement and develop mindfulness through the Fifth
    Precept. Therefore, when a person understands the ennoblers, he will realize that the
    observance of the Five Precepts does not cause him to be withdrawn, self-critical and
    negative, but to be a positive personality filled with love and care as well as other
    qualities accruing to one who leads a moral life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The precepts are the basic practice in Buddhism. The
    purpose is to eliminate crude passions that are expressed through thought, word and deed.
    The precepts are also an indispensable basis for people who wish to cultivate their minds.
    Without some basic moral code, the power of meditation can often be applied for some wrong
    and selfish motive. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="+1">Eight Precepts</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In many Buddhist countries, it is customary among the
    devotees to observe the Eight Precepts on certain days of the month, such as the full moon
    and new moon days. These devotees will come to the temple early in the morning and spend
    twenty-four hours in the temple, observing the precepts. By observing the Eight Precepts,
    they cut themselves off from their daily life which is bombarded with material and sensual
    demands. The purpose of observing the Eight Precepts is to develop relaxation and
    tranquillity, to train the mind, and to develop oneself spiritually. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During this period of observing the precepts, they spend
    their time reading religious books, listening to the Teachings of the Buddha, meditating,
    and also helping with the religious activities of the temple. The following morning, they
    change from Eight Precepts to the Five Precepts intended for daily observance, and return
    home to resume their normal life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Eight Precepts are to abstain from: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Killing;<br>
      - Stealing;<br>
      - Sexual acts;<br>
      - Lying;<br>
      - Liquor<br>
      - Taking food after the sun had crossed the zenith.<br>
      - Dancing, singing, music, unseemly shows, the use of garlands, perfumes, unguents and
      things that tend to beautify and adorn the person, and<br>
      - Using high and luxurious seats.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">Some people find it hard to understand the
    significance of a few of these precepts. They think that Buddhists are against dancing,
    singing, music, the cinema, perfume, ornaments and luxurious things. There is no rule in
    Buddhism that states that every lay Buddhist must abstain from these things. The people
    who choose to abstain from these entertainments are devout Buddhists who observe these
    precepts only for a short period as a way of self discipline. The reason for keeping away
    from these entertainments and ornamentations is to calm down the senses even for a few
    hours and to train the mind so as not to be enslaved to sensual pleasures. These
    entertainments increase the passions of the mind and arouse emotions which hinder a
    person's spiritual development. By occasionally restraining himself from these
    entertainments, a person will make progress towards overcoming his weaknesses and exercise
    greater control over himself. However, Buddhists do not condemn these entertainments. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Observance of precepts (both the Five and Eight precepts)
    when performed with an earnest mind is certainly a meritorious act. It brings great
    benefits to this life and the lives hereafter. Therefore, a person should try his best to
    observe the precepts with understanding and as often as he can. </font></p>
