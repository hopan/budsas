    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Buddhists take refuge in the Buddha not out of fear of
      Him, but to gain inspiration and right understanding for their self-purification.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">B</font>uddhist do not take refuge in the
    Buddha with the belief that He is a god or son of god. The Buddha never claimed any
    divinity. He was the Enlightened One, the most Compassionate, Wise, and Holy One who ever
    lived in this world. Therefore, people take refuge in the Buddha as a Teacher or Master
    who has shown the real path of emancipation. They pay homage to Him to show their
    gratitude and respect, but they do not ask for material favors. Buddhists do not pray to
    the Buddha thinking that He is a god who will reward them or punish or curse them. They
    recite verses or some sutras not in the sense of supplication but as a means of recalling
    His great virtues and good qualities to get more inspiration and guidance for themselves
    and to develop the confidence to follow His Teachings. There are critics who condemn this
    attitude of taking refuge in the Buddha. They do not know the true meaning of the concept
    of taking refuge in and paying homage to a great religious Teacher. They have learned only
    about praying which is the only thing that some people do in the name of religion. When
    Buddhists seek refuge it means they accept the Buddha, Dhamma and the Sangha as the means
    by which they can eradicate all the causes of their fear and other mental disturbances.
    Many people, especially those with animistic beliefs, seek protection in certain objects
    around them which they believe are inhabited by spirits. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha advised against the futility of taking refuge
    in hills, woods, groves, trees and shrines when people are fear-stricken: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">No such refuge is safe, no such refuge is Supreme. Not by
      resorting to such a refuge is one freed from all ill. He who has gone for refuge to the
      Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha sees with right knowledge the Four Noble Truths -Sorrow,
      the cause of Sorrow, the transcending of Sorrow, and the Noble Eightfold Path which leads
      to the cessation of Sorrow. This indeed is secure refuge. By seeking such refuge one is
      released from all Sorrow. -- <i>(Dhammapada 188-192)</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
    In the Dhajagga Sutta, it is mentioned that by taking refuge in Sakra, the king of gods or
    any god, the followers would not be free from all their worldly problems and fears. The
    reason is, such gods are themselves not free from lust, hatred, illusion and fear, but the
    Buddha, Dhamma and the Sangha (i.e. the community who has attained perfection) are free
    from them. Only those who are free from unsatisfactoriness can show the way to lasting
    happiness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Francis Story, a well known Buddhist scholar, gives his
    views on seeking refuge in the Buddha:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'I go for refuge to the Buddha. I seek the presence
    of the Exalted Teacher by whose compassion I may be guided through the torrents of <i>Samsara</i>,
    by whose serene countenance I may be uplifted from the mire of worldly thoughts and
    cravings, seeing there in the very assurance of Nibbanic Peace, which He himself attained.
    In sorrow and pain I turn to Him and in my happiness I seek His tranquil gaze. I lay
    before His Image not only flowers and incense, but also the burning fires of my restless
    heart, that they may be quenched and stilled, I lay down the burden of my pride and my
    selfhood, the heavy burden of my cares and aspirations, the weary load of this incessant
    birth and death.</font>'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sri Rama Chandra Bharati, an Indian poet, gives another
    meaningful explanation for taking refuge in the Buddha:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">'I seek not thy refuge for the sake of gain,<br>
        Not fear of thee, nor for the love of fame,<br>
        Not as thou hailest from the solar race,<br>
        Not for the sake of gaining knowledge vast,<br>
        But drawn by the power of the boundless love,<br>
        And thy all-embracing peerless ken,<br>
        <font>The vast Samsara's sea safe to cross,<br>
        I bend low, O lord, and become thy devotee.'</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people say that since the Buddha was only a man,
    there is no meaning in taking refuge in Him. But they do not know that although the Buddha
    very clearly said that He was a man, he was no ordinary man like any of us. He was an<i>
    extraordinary</i> and <i>incomparably </i>holy person who possessed Supreme Enlightenment
    and great compassion toward every living being. He was a man freed from all human
    weaknesses, defilements and even from ordinary human emotions. <i>Of Him it has been said,
    </i><font>'There is none so godless as the Buddha, and yet none so godlike.' In the Buddha
    is embodied all the great virtues, sacredness, wisdom and enlightenment.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Another question that people very often raise is
    this: 'If the Buddha is not a god, if He is not living in this world today, how can he
    bless people?' According to the Buddha, if people follow His advice by leading a religious
    life, they would certainly receive blessings. Blessing in a Buddhist sense means the joy
    we experience when we develop confidence and satisfaction. The Buddha once said, 'if
    anyone wishes to see me, he should look at my Teachings and practise them.' (<i>Samyutta
    Nikaya</i>) Those who understand His Teachings easily see the real nature of the Buddha
    reflected in themselves. The image of the Buddha they maintain in their minds is more real
    than the image they see on the altar, which is merely a symbolic representation. 'Those
    who live in accordance with the Dhamma (righteous way of life) will be protected by that
    very Dhamma.' (<em>Thera Gatha</em>) One who knows the real nature of existence and the
    fact of life through Dhamma will not have any fear and secure a harmonious way of life.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In other religions, the people worship their god by asking
    for favours to be granted to them. Buddhists do not worship the Buddha by asking for
    worldly favours, but they respect Him for His supreme achievement. When Buddhists respect
    the Buddha, they are indirectly elevating their own minds so that one day they also can
    get the same enlightenment to serve mankind if they aspire to become a Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists respect the Buddha as their Master. However,
    this respect does not imply an attachment to or a dependence on the Teacher. This kind of
    respect is in accordance with His Teaching which is as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Monks, even if a monk should take hold of the edge
      of my outer garment and should walk close behind me, step for step, yet if he should be
      covetous, strongly attracted by pleasures of the senses, malevolent in thought, of corrupt
      mind and purpose, of confused recollection, inattentive and not contemplative,
      scatter-brained, his sense-faculties uncontrolled, then he is far from me and I am far
      from him.'</font> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Monks, if the monk should be staying even a hundred
      miles away, yet he is not covetous, not strongly attracted by the pleasures of the senses,
      not malevolent in thought, not of corrupt mind and purpose, his collection firmly set,
      attentive, contemplative, his thoughts be one-pointed, restrained in his sense-faculties,
      then he is near me and I am near him.' (<i>Samyutta Nikaya)</i></font> </font></p>
