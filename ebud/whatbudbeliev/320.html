    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Consulting mediums is not a Buddhist practice: it is
      just a traditional and psychological belief.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>n many countries, people seek the
    advice and guidance of mediums to overcome their problems in situations which they
    consider as beyond their comprehension. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The medium's help is sought in many ways and for
    various reasons. In time of sickness when medical help is apparently ineffective, some
    people may become desperate and turn anywhere to seek solace. At such times, mediums are
    often consulted. Some people also turn to mediums when they are faced with a complex and
    are unable to find an acceptable solution. Others consult mediums out of greed in order to
    get rich quickly.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people believe that when a medium is in a trance, the
    spirit of a certain god or deity communicate through the medium and offers advice or
    guidance to those seeking help. Others believe that the trance-state is the work of the
    subconscious mind which surfaces and takes over the conscious mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consulting mediums is a fairly common practice amongst the
    public. The Buddhist attitude towards consulting medium is one of neutrality. It is
    difficult to verify whether what the medium conveys is correct or not. The practice of
    consulting medium is not a Buddhist practice; it is just a traditional practice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consulting mediums is for worldly material gain; the
    Teaching of the Buddha is for spiritual development. However, if people believe what the
    medium conveys is true, there is no reason for Buddhists to object to such practices. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If a person really understands and practices the Teaching
    of the Buddha, he can realize the nature of his problems. He can overcome his own problems
    without consulting any medium. </font></p>
