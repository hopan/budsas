    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The difference between a dog fight and a war or between
      two groups of people is only in its organization.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he history of mankind is a
    continuous manifestation of man's greed, hatred, pride, jealousy, selfishness and
    delusion. During the last 3,000 years, men have fought 15,000 major wars. Is it a
    characteristic of man? What is his destiny? How can men bring destruction to one another? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although men have discovered and invented many important
    things, they have also made great advances towards the destruction of their own kind. This
    is how many human civilizations have been completely erased from this earth. Modern man
    has become so sophisticated in his art and techniques of warfare that it is now possible
    for him to turn the whole of mankind into ashes within a few seconds. The world has become
    a storehouse of military hardware as a result of a little game called 'Military
    Superiority.' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We are told that the prototype of a nuclear weapon is more
    powerful than the atomic bomb which was dropped at Hiroshima Japan in August, 1945 is
    being planned. Scientist believe that a few hundred thermonuclear weapons will chart the
    course towards universal destruction. Just see what we are doing to our human race! Think
    what sort of scientific development it is! See how foolish and selfish man is! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Man should not pander to his aggressive instincts. Man
    should uphold the ethical teachings of the religious teachers and display justice with
    morality to enable peace to prevail. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Treaties, pacts and peace formulae have been adopted and
    millions of words have been spoken by countless world leaders throughout the world who
    proclaim that they have found the way to maintain and promote peace on earth. But for all
    their efforts, they have not succeeded in removing the threat to man-kind. The reason is
    that we have all failed to educate our young to truly understand and respect the need for
    selfless service and the danger of selfishness. To guarantee true peace, we must use every
    method available to us to educate our young to practise love, goodwill and tolerance
    towards others. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Buddhist Attitude </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>A Buddhist should not be the aggressor even in
    protecting his religion or anything else. He must try his best to avoid any kind of
    violent act. Sometimes he may be forced to go to war by others who do not respect the
    concept of the brotherhood of man as taught by the Buddha. He may be called upon to defend
    his fellow men from aggression, and as long as he has not renounced the worldly life, he
    is duty-bound to join in the struggle for peace and freedom. Under these circumstances, he
    cannot be blamed for his action in becoming a soldier or being involved in defence.
    However, if everyone were to follow the advice of the Buddha, there would be no reason for
    war to take place in this world. It is the duty of every cultured man to find all possible
    ways and means to settle disputes in a peaceful manner, without declaring war to kill his
    fellow men. The Buddha did not teach His followers to surrender to any form of evil power,
    </font>be it man or supernatural being. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Indeed, with reason and science, man could conquer nature,
    and yet man has not yet even secured his own life. Why is it that life is in danger? While
    devoted to reason and being ruled by science, man has forgotten that he has a heart which
    has been neglected and has been left to wither and be polluted by passion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we cannot secure our own lives, then how can world
    peace be possible? To obtain peace, we must train our minds to face facts. We must be
    objective and humble. We must realize that no one person, nor one nation is always wrong.
    To obtain peace, we must also share the richness of the earth, not necessarily with
    equality but at least with equity. There can never be absolute equality but surely there
    can be a greater degree of equity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>It is simply inconceivable that five percent of the
    world's population should enjoy fifty percent of the its wealth, or that twenty-five
    percent of the world should be fairly well-fed and some overfed, while seventy-five
    percent of the world is always hungry. Peace will only come when nations are willing to
    share and share equitably, the rich to help the poor and the strong to help the weak, thus
    creating international goodwill. Only if and when these conditions are met, can we
    envision a world with no excuse for wars.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The madness of the armaments race must stop! We must try
    to build schools instead of cruisers, hospitals instead of nuclear weapons. The amount of
    money and human lives that various governments waste in the battlefield should be diverted
    to build up the economics to elevate the standard of living. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The world cannot have peace until men and nations
    renounce selfish desires, give up racial arrogance, and eradicate egoistic lust for
    possession and power. Wealth cannot secure happiness. Religion alone can effect the
    necessary change of heart and bring about the only real disarmament?that of the mind.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All religions teach people not to kill; but unfortunately
    this important precept is conveniently ignored. Today, with modern armaments, man can kill
    millions within one second, that is, more than primitive tribes did in a century. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Very unfortunately some people in certain countries bring
    religious labels, slogans and banners into their battlefields. They do not know that they
    are disgracing the good name of religion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Verily, O monk,' said the Buddha, 'due to sensuous
    craving, kings fight with kings, princes with princes, priests with priests, citizens with
    citizens, the mother quarrels with the son, the son quarrels with the father, brother with
    brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, friend with friend.' (<i>Majjhima
    Nikaya</i>)</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>We can happily say that for the last 2,500 years
    there has never been any serious discord or conflict created by Buddhists that led to war
    in the name of this religion. This is a result of the dynamic character of the concept of
    tolerance contained in the Buddha's teaching.</font> </font></p>
