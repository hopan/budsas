      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Buddhists do not deny the existence of various gods or
      deities.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">D</font>evas are more fortunate than human
    beings as far as sensual pleasures are concerned. They also possess certain powers which
    human beings usually lack. However, the powers of these deities are limited because they
    are also transitory beings. They exist in happy abodes and enjoy their life for a longer
    period than human beings do. When they have exhausted all the good kamma, that they have
    gathered during previous birth, these deities pass away and are reborn somewhere else
    according to their good and bad kamma. According to the Buddha, human beings have more
    opportunities to accrue merits to be born in a better condition, and the deities have less
    chances in this respect. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist do not attribute any specific importance to such
    gods. They do not regard the deities as a support for the moral development or as a
    support for the attainment of salvation of Nibbana. Whether they are great or small, both
    human beings and deities are perishable and subject to rebirth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>It is a common belief amongst the Buddhist public
    that such deities can be influenced to grant their favours by transferring merits to them
    whenever meritorious deeds are performed. This belief is based on the Buddha's injunction
    to the deities to protect those human beings who lead a religious way of life. This is the
    reason why Buddhists transfer the merits to such deities or remember them whenever they do
    some meritorious deeds. However, making of offerings to and worshipping such deities are
    not encouraged, although some Buddhist customs center around such activities. When people
    are in great difficulties, they naturally turn to the deities to express their grievances
    in a place of worship. By doing this, they gain some relief and consolation; in their
    hearts, they feel much better. However, to an intellectual who has strong will power,
    sound education and understanding, such beliefs and actions need not be resorted to. There
    is definitely no Teaching in Buddhism to the effect that Buddhists can attain<i> Nibbana </i>by
    praying to any deity. Buddhists believe that 'purity and impurity depend on oneself. No
    one from outside can purify another.' (Dhammapada 165)</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Buddhahood</i> and <i>Nibbana</i>can be attained
    without any help from an external source. Therefore, Buddhists can practise their religion
    with or without the deities. </font></p>
