    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">O</font>n certain occasions, the Buddha has
    commented on the nature and composition of the universe. According to the Buddha, there
    are some other forms of life existing in other parts of the universe. The Buddha has
    mentioned that there are thirty-one planes of existence within the universes. They are: </font><dir>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">4 States of unhappiness or sub human realms: (life in
        hells, animal life, ghost-worlds and demon-worlds)</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">1 Human world.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">6 Develokas or heavenly realms.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">16 Rupalokas or Realms of Fine-Material Forms.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">4 Arupalokas or Formless Realms.</font></li>
    </dir>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The existence of these other-world systems is yet to be
    confirmed by modern science. However, modern scientists are now working with the
    hypothesis that there is a possibility of other forms of life existing on other planets.
    As a result of today's rapid scientific progress, we may soon find some living beings on
    other planets in the remotest parts of the galaxy system. Perhaps, we will find them
    subject to the same laws as ourselves. They might be physically quite different in both
    appearance, elements and chemical composition and exist in different dimensions. They
    might be far superior to us or they might be far inferior. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Why should the planet earth be the only planet to
    contain life forms? Earth is a tiny speck in a huge universe. Sir James Jeans, the
    distinguished astrophysicist, estimates the whole universe to be about one thousand
    million times as big as the area of space that is visible through the telescope. In his
    book, The <i>Mysterious Universe,</i> he states that the total number of universes is
    probably something like the total number of grains of sand on all the sea shores of the
    world. In such a universe, the planet Earth is only from the sun which takes a seventh of
    a second to reach the earth, takes probably something like 100,000 million years to travel
    across the universe! Such is the vastness of the cosmos. When we consider the vastness of
    the many universes making up what is popularly known as 'outer space', the hypothesis that
    other-world systems might exist is scientifically feasible.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In the light of modern scientific discoveries, we
    can appreciate the limitations of the human world. Today, science has demonstrated that
    our human world exists within the limitations of the vibrational frequencies that can be
    received by our sense organs. And science has also shown us that there are other
    vibrational frequencies which are above or below our range of reception. With the
    discovery of radio waves, X-rays, TV waves, and micro waves, we can appreciate the
    extremely limited vision that is imposed on us by our sense organs. We peep out at the
    universe through the 'crack' allowed by our sense organs, just as a little child peeps out
    through the crack in the door. This awareness of our limited perception demonstrates to us
    the possibility that other world systems may exist that are separate from ours or that
    interpenetrate with ours.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As to the nature of the universe, the Buddha said that the
    beginning and ending of the universe is inconceivable. Buddhists do not believe that the
    world will suddenly end in complete and utter destruction. There is no such thing as
    complete destruction of the whole universe at once. When a certain section of the universe
    disappears, another section remains. When the other section disappears, another section
    reappears or evolves out of the dispersed matters of the previous universe. This is formed
    by the accumulation of molecules, basic elements, gas and numerous energies, a combination
    supported by cosmic impulsion and gravity. Then some other new world systems appear and
    exist for sometime. This is the nature of the cosmic energies. This is why the Buddha says
    that the beginning and the end of the universe is inconceivable. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was only on certain, special occasions, that the Buddha
    commented on the nature and composition of the universe. When he spoke, He had to address
    Himself to the understanding capacity of the inquirer. The Buddha was not interested in
    this kind of metaphysical speculation that did not lead to the higher spiritual
    development. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Buddhists do not share the view held by some people
    that the world will be destroyed by a god, when there are more non-believers and more
    corruptions taking place amongst the human beings. With regard to this belief people can
    ask, instead of destroying with his power, why can't this god used the same power to
    influence people to become believers and to wipe out al immoral practices from men's mind?
    Whether the god destroys or not, it is natural that one day there will be an end to
    everything that comes into existence. However, in the language of the Buddha, the world is
    nothing more than the combination, existence, disappearance, and recombination of mind and
    matter(<i>nama-rupa).</i></font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the final analysis, the Teaching of the Buddha goes
    beyond the discoveries of modern science however startling or impressive they may be. In
    science, the knowledge of the universe is to enable man to master it for his material
    comfort and personal safety. But the Buddha teaches that no amount of factual knowledge
    will ultimately free man from the pain of existence. He must strive alone and diligently
    until he arrives at a true understanding of his own nature and of the changeable nature of
    the cosmos. To be truly free a man must seek to tame his min, to destroy his craving for
    sensual pleasure. When a man truly understands that the universe he is trying to conquer
    is impermanent, he will see himself as Don Quixote fighting windmills. With this Right
    View of himself he will spend his time and energy conquering his mind and destroying his
    illusion of self without wasting his effort on unimportant and unnecessary issues. </font></p>
