    Successor to the Buddha <br>
    </font>&nbsp; </font></h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Buddhahood is the highest of all achievements. </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">M</font>any people ask why <font>the Buddha
    did not appoint a successor. But can any one appoint another to take the place of the
    Supreme Enlightened One? Attaining Buddhahood is the highest of all achievements that only
    the wisest man can reach. He is the flower of mankind. To attain this highest position,
    one must have the qualification such as self-training, self-discipline, moral background,
    supreme knowledge, and extra-ordinary compassion towards every living being. Therefore, a
    person himself must take the trouble to qualify himself in order to attain Buddhahood. For
    example, a doctor cannot appoint even his own son as doctor unless the son has qualified
    himself to be a doctor. A lawyer cannot appoint another person as a lawyer unless that
    person obtains the necessary qualifications. A scientist cannot appoint another person as
    a scientist unless that person possesses the knowledge of a scientist.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, the Buddha did not appoint a successor. On the
    other hand, even if He had done that, the person who was to succeed Him would not have the
    real qualities of the Buddha and would certainly misuse the authority and mislead the
    public. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Authority over a religion must be exercised by a person or
    persons possessing a clear mind, proper understanding, perfection and leading a holy life.
    Authority should not be exercised by worldly-minded people who have become slaves to
    sensual pleasures or who crave for worldly material gain or power. Otherwise the
    sacredness, freedom and truth in a religion could be abused. &nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'<i>I am not the first Buddha to come upon this
    earth; nor shall I be the last. Previously, there were many Buddhas who appeared in this
    world. In due time, another Buddha will arise in this world, within this world cycle.'</i></font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>When the Buddha was about to pass away, Ven. Ananda
    and many other disciples wept. The Buddha said, 'Enough, Ananda. Do not allow yourself to
    be troubled. Do not weep. Have I not already told you that it is in the very nature of
    things that they must pass away. We must be separated from all that is near and dear to
    us. The foolish man conceives his idea of Self; the wise man sees there is no ground on
    which to build the Self.</font> <font>Thus the wise man has a right conception of the
    world. He will conclude that all component things will be dissolved again; but the Truth
    will always remain.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha continued: 'Why should I preserve this
    body when the body of the excellent law will endure? I am resolved. I have accomplished my
    purpose and have attended to the work set upon me. Ananda, for a long time you have been
    very near to me in thoughts, words and acts of much love beyond all measure. You have done
    well, Ananda. Be earnest in effort and you too will soon be free from bondages! You will
    be free from sensuality, from delusion, and from ignorance.' Suppressing his tears, Ananda
    said to the Buddha, 'Who shall teach us when You are gone?' And the Buddha advised him to
    regard His Teaching as the Master.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha continued again: 'I am not the first
    Buddha to come upon earth; nor shall I be the last. In due time, another Buddha will arise
    in this world, a Holy One, a Supremely Enlightened One, endowed with wisdom, in conduct
    auspicious, knowing the universe, an incomparable leader of men, a master of devas and
    men. He will reveal to you the same Eternal Truths which I have taught you. He will
    proclaim a religious life, wholly perfect and pure; such as I now proclaim.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'How shall we know him?' asked Ananda. The Buddha
    replied, 'He will be known as <i>Maitreya</i> which means kindness or friendliness.'(In
    Buddhavamsa, 28 names of the previous Buddhas are mentioned, including Gautama the
    Buddha.)</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists believe that those people who at present are
    doing meritorious deeds by leading a religious life will have a chance to be reborn as
    human beings in the time of <i>Maitreya Buddha </i>and will obtain <i>Nibbana</i>
    identical with that of Gautama Buddha. In this way they will find salvation through the
    guidance of His Teaching. His Teaching will become a hope of the remote future for
    everybody. However, according to the Buddha devout religious people can gain this Nibbanic
    bliss at any time if they really work for it irrespective of whether a Buddha appears or
    not. </font></p>
