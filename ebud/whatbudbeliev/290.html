      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>You can be a soldier of Truth, but not the aggressor.</i>
      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>One day, Sinha, the general of the army, went to the
    Buddha and said, 'I am a soldier, O Blessed One. I am appointed by the King to enforce his
    laws and to wage his wars. The Buddha teaches infinite love, kindness and compassion for
    all sufferers: Does the Buddha permit the punishment of the criminal? And also, does the
    Buddha declare that it is wrong to go to war for the protection of our homes, our wives,
    our children and our property? Does the Buddha teach the doctrine of complete
    self-surrender? Should I suffer the evil-doer to do with what he pleases and yield
    submissively to him who threatens to take by violence what is my own? Does the Buddha
    maintain that all strife including warfare waged for a righteous cause should be
    forbidden?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha replied, 'He who deserves punishment must
    be punished. And he who is worthy of favor must be favored. Do not do injury to any living
    being but be just, filled with love and kindness.' These injunctions are not contradictory
    because the person who is punished for his crimes will suffer his injury not through the
    ill-will of the judge but through the evil act itself. His own acts have brought upon him
    the injury that the executors of the law inflict. When a magistrate punishes, he must not
    harbor hatred in his heart. When a murderer is put to death, he should realize that his
    punishment is the result of his own act. With his understanding, he will no longer lament
    his fate but can console his mind. And the Blessed One continued, 'The Buddha teaches that
    all warfare in which man tries to slay his brothers is lamentable. But he does not teach
    that those who are involved in war to maintain peace and order, after having exhausted all
    means to avoid conflict, are blameworthy.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Struggle must exist, for all life is a struggle of some
    kind. But make certain that you do not struggle in the interest of self against truth and
    justice. He who struggles out of self-interest to make himself great or powerful or rich
    or famous, will have no reward. But he who struggles for peace and truth will have great
    reward; even his defeat will be deemed a victory. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'If a person goes to battle even for a righteous cause,
    then Sinha, he must be prepared to be slain by his enemies because death is the destiny of
    warriors. And should his fate overtake him, he has no reason to complain. But if he is
    victorious his success may be deemed great, but no matter how great it is, the wheel of
    fortune may turn again and bring his life down into the dust. However, if he moderates
    himself and extinguishes all hatred in his heart, if he lifts his down-trodden adversary
    up and says to him, 'Come now and make peace and let us be brothers,' then he will gain a
    victory that is not a transient success; for the fruits of that victory will remain
    forever. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Great is a successful general, but he who conquers self
    is the greater victor. This teaching of conquest of self, Sinha, is not taught to destroy
    the lives of others, but to protect them. The person who has conquered himself is more fit
    to live, to be successful and to gain victories than is the person who is the slave of
    self. The person whose mind is free from the illusion of self, will stand and not fall in
    the battle of life. He whose intentions are righteousness and justice, will meet with no
    failure. He will be successful in his enterprise and his success will endure. He who
    harbors love of truth in his heart will live and not suffer, for he has drunk the water of
    immortality. So struggle courageously and wisely. Then you can be a soldier of Truth.' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no justice in war or violence. When we declare
    war, we justify it, when others declare war, we say, it is unjust. Then who can justify
    war? Man should not follow the law of the jungle to overcome human problems. </font></p>
