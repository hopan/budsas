      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The outstanding events in the life of the Buddha took
      place on full moon days.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">M</font><font face="Times New Roman">any people
    would like to know the religious significance of the full moon and new moon days. To
    Buddhists, there is a special religious significance especially on full day because
    certain important and outstanding events connected with the life of Lord Buddha took place
    on full moon days. The Buddha was born on a full moon day. His renunciation took place on
    a full moon day. His Enlightenment, the delivery of His first sermon, His passing away
    into Nibbana and many other important events associated with His life-span of eighty
    years, occurred on full moon days. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists all over the world have a high regard for full
    moon days. They celebrate this day with religious fervor by observing precepts, practising
    meditation and by keeping away from the sensual worldly life. On this day they direct
    their attention to spiritual development. Apart from Buddhists, it is understood that
    other co-religionists also believe that there is some religious significance related to
    the various phases of the moon. They also observe certain religious disciplines such as
    fasting and praying on full moon days. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Ancient belief in India says that the moon is the
    controller of the water, and circulating through the universe, sustaining all living
    creatures, is the counterpart on earth of the liquor heaven, '<i>amrta'</i>the drink of
    the gods. Dew and rain become vegetable sap, sap becomes the milk of cow, and the milk is
    then converted into blood. Amrta water, sap, milk and blood, represent but different
    states of the one elixir. The vessel or cup of this immortal fluid is the moon.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>It is believed that the moon, like the other
    planets, exerts a considerable degree of influence on human beings. It has been observed
    that people suffering from mental ailments invariably have their passions and emotional
    feelings affected during full moon days. The word 'lunatic' derived from the word 'lunar'
    (or moon) is most significant and indicates very clearly the influence of the moon on
    human life. Some people, suffering from various forms of illness invariably find their
    sickness aggravated during such periods. Researchers have found that certain phases of the
    moon not only affect humans and animals, but also influence plant life and other elements.
    Low-tides and high-tides are a direct result of the overpowering influence of the moon.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our human body consists of about seventy percent liquid.
    It is accepted by physicians that our bodily fluids flow more freely at the time of full
    moon. People suffering from asthma, bronchitis and even certain skin diseases, find their
    ailments aggravated under the influence of the moon. More than five thousand years ago,
    people had recognized the influence of the moon on cultivation. Farmers were very
    particular about the effect of the moon on their crops. They knew that certain grains and
    paddy would be affected if blooming took place during a full moon period. Medical science
    had also ascertained the different reactions of certain medicines under different facets
    of the moon, because of the influence of the moon on human beings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In view of the possible influence of the moon, the ancient
    sages advised the people to refrain from various commitments on this particular day and
    take it easy for the day. They are advised to relax their minds on this particular day and
    to devote their time to spiritual pursuits. All those who have developed their minds to a
    certain extent can achieve enlightenment since the brain is in an awakened state. Those
    who have not trained their minds through religious discipline are liable to be subjected
    to the strong influence of the moon. The Buddha attained His Enlightenment on a full moon
    day for He had developing and attuning it correctly for a long period. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In days gone by, full moon and new moon days were declared
    public holidays in many Buddhist countries and people were encouraged to devote their time
    to spiritual development. It was only during the colonial period that holidays were
    switched over to Sundays. In view of this, some Buddhist countries are now trying to
    re-introduce the former lunar system of holidays. It is advisable to observe full moon day
    as a religious day to concentrate on peace and happiness by calming down the senses. Many
    Buddhists observe the eight precepts on full moon days, to be free from family commitments
    and to keep away from worldly pleasures in order to have peace of mind for their spiritual
    development. The effects of the moon on life and earth has been analysed scientifically. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One writer says: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'I have been reading an article in an American
    science magazine recently where the writer brings together the present on the subject of
    the moon to prove how decisively this age old object of the skies influences our lives,
    particularly at each of the four phases it passes through in its 28-day cycle.</font>' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>This research, by the way, was done at the American
    Universities of Yale, Duke and Northwestern and they have 'independently' come up with the
    astonishing evidence that the moon plays a big part in our daily life and indeed, in the
    lives of all living things.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We are assured that there is nothing very occult in this
    phenomenon put that the phases of the moon do in fact stimulate various bodily actions
    like modifying metabolism, electrical charges and blood acidity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the key experiments performed to establish this
    fact was on fiddler crabs, mice and some plants. They were all placed in chambers where
    weather conditions could not affect them, but were subjected to air pressure, humidity,
    light and temperature under controlled conditions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The hundreds of observations made showed a remarkable
    fact, namely that all the animals and plants operated on a 28-day cycle. Metabolism which
    was found to have dropped at the time of the new moon was twenty percent higher at the
    time of the phase of the full moon. This difference is described as a striking variation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once a nurse in Florida told a doctor that she noticed a
    lot more bleeding occurred when the moon is full. Like all doctors who are skeptical about
    such beliefs, he laughed at this statement. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the nurse, undeterred, produced records of surgical
    operations which clearly showed that during full moon, more patients had to be returned to
    the operating theater than at any other time for treatment for excessively bleeding after
    operations. To satisfy himself, this doctor started keeping records on his own and he came
    to a similar conclusion. When we consider all those occurrences, we can understand why our
    ancestors and religious teachers had advised us to change our daily routine and to relax
    physically and mentally on full moon and new moon days. The practise of religion is the
    most appropriate method for people to experience mental peace and physical relaxation. The
    Buddhists are merely observing the wisdom of the past when they devote more time to
    activities of a spiritual nature on New Moon and Full Moon days. </font></p>
