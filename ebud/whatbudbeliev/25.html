    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The three bodies of the Buddha consist of Dharma-kaya
      (Truth body), Sambhoga-kaya (Enjoyment body), and Nirmana-kaya(Manifestation body).</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">I</font><font face="Times New Roman">n the
    Mahayana philosophy, the personality of the Buddha is given an elaborate treatment.
    According to this philosophy, the Buddhas have three bodies (trikaya), or three aspects of
    personality: the Dharmakaya, the Sambhoga-kaya, and the Nirmana-kaya. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>After a Buddha has attained Enlightenment, He is the
    living embodiment of wisdom, compassion, happiness and freedom. At the beginning, there
    was only one Buddha in the Buddhist tradition. He is the historical Sakyamuni the Buddha.
    However, even during His lifetime, He made the distinction between Himself as the
    enlightened, historical individual, on one hand, and Himself as the Embodiment of Truth,
    on the other. The enlightened personality was known as the 'Rupa-kaya' (Form-body) or
    'Nirmana-kaya' (Manifestation-body). This was the physical body of the Buddha who was born
    among men, attained Enlightenment, preached the Dhamma and attained Maha Parinibbana. The
    Manifestation-body or physical body of Buddhas are many and differ from one another.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>On the other hand, the principle of Enlightenment
    which is embodied in Him is known as Dharma-kaya or Truth-body. This is the essence of the
    Buddha and is independent of the person realizing it. 'Dhamma' in this expression means
    'Truth', and does not refer to the verbal teachings which were recorded down in
    scriptures. The teaching of the Buddha also emanates from the 'Essence' or 'Truth'. So the
    real, essential Buddha is Truth or the principle of Enlightenment. This idea is clearly
    stated in the original Pali texts of the Theravada. The Buddha told Vasettha that the
    Tathagata (the Buddha) was Dharma-kaya, the 'Truth-body' or the 'Embodiment of Truth', as
    well as Dharmabhuta, 'Truth-become', that is, 'One who has become Truth' (Digha Nikaya).
    On another occasion, the Buddha told Vakkali: 'He who sees the Dhamma (Truth) sees the
    Tathagata, he who sees the Tathagata sees the Dhamma (Samyutta Nikaya). That is to say,
    the Buddha is equal to Truth, and all Buddhas are one and the same, being no different
    from one another in the Dharma-kaya, because Truth is one.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>In the Buddha's lifetime, both the Nirmana-kaya and
    the Dharma-kaya were united in His. However, after His Parinibbana, the distinction became
    more pronounced, especially in the Mahayana philosophy. His Manifestation-body was dead
    and enshrined in the form of relics in stupas: His Dhamma-body is eternally present.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Later, the Mahayana philosophy developed the
    'Sambhoga-kaya', the Enjoyment-body. The Sambhoga-kaya can be considered as the body or
    aspect through which the Buddha enjoyed Himself in the Dhamma, in teaching the Truth, in
    leading others to the realization of the Truth, and in enjoying the company of good, noble
    people. This is a selfless, pure, spiritual enjoyment, not to be confused with sensual
    pleasure. This 'Enjoyment-body' is not categorically mentioned in Theravada texts although
    it can be appreciated without contradiction if understood in this context. In Mahayana,
    the Enjoyment-body of the Buddha, unlike the impersonal, abstract principle of the
    Dharma-kaya, is also considered as a person, though not a human, historical person.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the terms Sambhoga-kaya and Dharma-kaya found in
    the later Pali works come from Mahayana and semi-Mahayana works, scholars from other
    traditions did not show hostility towards them. Ven Buddhaghosa in his Visuddhi Magga
    referred thus to the bodies of the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'The Buddha is possessed of a beautiful Rupakaya
    adorned with eighty minor and thirty-two major signs of a great man, and possessed of a
    Dharmakaya purified in every way and glorified by Sila, Samadhi°&#130;, full of splendor
    and virtue, incomparable and fully enlightened.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Though Buddhaghosa's conception was realistic, he
    was not immune from the religious bias of attributing superhuman power to the Buddha. In
    the Atthasallini, he said that during the three months' absence of the Buddha, when He was
    engaged in preaching the Abhidamma to His mother in the Tusita heaven, He created some
    Nimmita-buddhas as exact replicas of Himself. These Nimmita-buddhas could not be
    distinguished from the Buddha in voice, words and even the rays of light that issued only
    by the gods of the higher realms of existence and not by ordinary gods or men. From this
    description, it is clear that the early Theravadins conceived Buddha's Rupa-kaya or
    Sambhoga-kaya as that of a human being, and His Dharma-kaya as the collection of His
    Dhamma, that is, doctrines and disciplinary rules, collectively.</font> </font></p>
