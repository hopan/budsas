    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Vinaya is the disciplinary code for self training laid
      down by the Buddha for monks and nuns to observe. Vinaya plays a pivotal role in their
      monastic way of life.</font></i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font FACE="Times New Roman">he Buddha
    did not formulate the code of discipline in a single exercise. However, He instituted
    certain rules as and when the need arose. <i>Vinaya Pitaka </i>and its commentary contain
    many significant stories about how and why certain rules were laid down by the Buddha.
    According to the Buddha the best form of Vinaya was to discipline the mind, words and
    action. The early disciples of the Buddha were highly developed spiritually and they had
    little need for a set of rules to be imposed upon them. However, as the monastic order
    (the Sangha) grew in numbers, it attracted many others, some of whom were not so highly
    developed spiritually. There arose some problems regarding their conduct and way of life
    such as taking part in lay activities for their livelihood and yielding to temptation for
    sense pleasure. Owing to this situation, the Buddha had to lay down guidelines for the
    monks and nuns to follow so that they could distinguish the difference between the life of
    monks and laymen. The holy order of the monks and the nuns was a well-established
    religious order when compared with other existing acetic practices at that time.</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha prescribed all the necessary guidance to
    maintain the holy order in every aspect of life. When the Buddha passed away, these rules
    were collated so that the Order could be organized around them. The code of conduct
    prescribed by the Buddha can be divided into two broad areas. These are Universal Moral
    Codes,<i> Lokavajja</i>, most of which are applicable to all members of the Order and lay
    people alike for leading a religious life. Certain other disciplinary codes or rules which
    can be instituted to meet the existing cultural and social constraints of the country at
    any one time are called <i>Pannatti Vajja.</i> In the first category are the Universal
    Laws which restricted all immoral and harmful evil deeds. The second category of rules
    applied almost directly to the monks and nuns in the observance of manners, traditions,
    duties, customs and etiquette. Breaking of moral codes pertaining to the <i>Lokavajja</i>
    create bad reputation as well as bad kamma, whereas violation of disciplinary codes based
    on social conditions do not necessarily create bad kamma. However, they are subject to
    criticism as violation in any form pollute the purity and dignity of the holy Order. These
    rules were largely based on the socio-cultural situation or way of life prevailing in
    India 25 centuries ago.</font></font></p>
    <p><font><font FACE="Times New Roman">According to the <i>Maha Parinibbana Sutta, </i>the
    Buddha had proclaimed that some </font>'<font FACE="Times New Roman">minor</font>' <font
    FACE="Times New Roman">rules could be altered or amended to accommodate changes due to
    time and environment, provided they do not encourage immoral or harmful behavior. In fact,
    during the Buddha</font>'<font FACE="Times New Roman">s time itself, certain minor rules
    were amended by the monks with His permission. The Buddha also advocated that sick monks
    and nuns be exempted from certain Vinaya rules. However, once the rules had been
    enumerated by the disciples in the First Council, convened three months after the passing
    away of the Buddha, it was decided that all the rules should be maintained in toto because
    no one was certain as to which of the rules should be altered. Finally, the disciples
    decided to uphold all the precepts prescribed by the Buddha. As time went on however, the
    rules became fossilized and some orthodox disciples insisted that the rules should be
    followed strictly to the letter rather than in the spirit. It was precisely to prevent
    rigid adherence to mere rules of this kind that the Buddha did not appoint a successor to
    take over after Him. He had said that the understanding of the Dhamma and upholding of the
    Dhamma as the master should be enough to help one lead a holy life. Another reason why the
    early disciples did not agree to change any of the precepts was that there was no reason
    or occasion for them to do so within such a short period of time after the passing away of
    the Buddha. This was because, at that time, most of those who had renounced their worldly
    life had done so with sincerity and conviction. However, when the social conditions
    started to change and when Buddhism spread to many other parts of India and other
    countries, the decision made by the disciples not to change any precepts in the First
    Council became a very big problem because some of the rules could not be adapted to meet
    the political and economic changes under varying circumstances.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">Development of Sangha Community</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">The Sangha community, in the course of time, evolved
    themselves into several sects, many of whom, while adhering to some major precepts as laid
    down by he Buddha, had, however, tended to ignore some of the minor rules. The Theravada
    sect appeared to be more orthodox, while the Mahayana and some other sects tended to be
    more liberal in their outlook and religious observances. The Theravada sect tried to
    observe the Vinaya to the very letter despite of changing circumstances and environment.
    Minor changes of the precepts had, however, taken place from time to time, but were not
    officially recognized even amongst the members of the Theravada sect. For instance, we can
    look at the rule regarding the partaking of food after the stipulated time of the day. The
    Theravada sect has not openly acknowledged the fact that certain variations could be
    allowed under special circumstances. Whilst members of other schools adapt themselves to
    the wearing of robes with appropriate colour and pattern, the Theravada sect has continued
    to adhere to the use of the original robes that were traditionally prescribed despite the
    changed social and climatic conditions. Many of practices of the monkhood are clearly
    understood only by those who are born into traditional Buddhist cultures.</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">At the other extreme, there are some monks who insist on
    observing the very letter of the Vinaya code rather than in its spirit, even though such
    action would embarrass the people around them. For example, more and more Buddhist monks
    are being invited to western countries where the culture of the people and the climatic
    conditions are so vastly different from that in Asia, but which could be regarded as
    strange and exotic elsewhere. Here again the monk must apply his common sense and try not
    to make a mockery of himself in the eyes of the people. The important rule to be observed
    is that no immoral, cruel, harmful and indecent acts are created and that the
    sensitivities of others are respected. If the monks can lead their lives as hones, kind,
    harmless and understanding human beings by maintaining their human dignity and
    disciplines, then such qualities will be appreciated in any part of the world. Maintaining
    the so-called traditions and customs of their respective countries of origin have little
    to do with the essence of the Dhamma as taught by the Buddha.</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Then, there is another problem. Many people, especially
    those in the West who have accepted the Buddhist way of life, having read the Vinaya rules
    in the texts, think that the monks must follow all the rules in toto in any part of the
    world, in exactly the same manner as they were recorded in the texts. We must remember
    that some of these rules which were practised in Indian society 25 centuries ago are
    irrelevant even in Asia today. It must be clearly borne in mind that the Buddha instituted
    the rules only for the members of the Sangha community who lived in India, in fact in the
    region where He lived. Those monks never had any experience of the way of life in another
    country. Their main concern was with the spiritual development with the minimum of
    disruption and annoyance to the society where they lived. But if they lived today, they
    may experience many other new problems, if they strictly observe all the rules in a
    country where people cannot appreciate or understand them.</font> </p>
    <p><font><font FACE="Times New Roman">The disciplinary code for lay devotees show how a
    layman can live a virtuous and noble life without renouncing the worldly life. The Buddha</font>'<font
    FACE="Times New Roman">s advice to lay people is contained in such discourses as the <i>Mangala,
    Parabhava, Sigalovada, Vasala</i> and <i>Vygghapajja</i> and many other discourses.</font></font>
    </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Many Vinaya rules apply only to those who have renounced
    the worldly life. Of course a layman may follow some of the rules if they help him to
    develop greater spirituality.</font> </p>
    <p><font SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">Changing Society</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">When society changes, monks cannot remain as
    traditionalists without adapting to the changes, although they have renounced the worldly
    life. People who cannot understand this situation criticize the behavior of certain monks
    because of those changes.</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">However, when the monks want to amend even certain minor
    precepts, they would have to do it with the sanction of a recognized Sangha Council.
    Individual monks are not at liberty to change any Vinaya rules according to their whims
    and fancies. Such a Council of Sangha members can also impose certain sanction against
    monks who have committed serious violations of the disciplinary code and whose behavior
    discredits the Sangha. The Buddha instituted the Council to help monks to prevent evil
    deeds and avoid temptation in a worldly life. The rules were guidelines rather than
    inviolable laws handed down by some divine authority.</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">In Asian countries particularly, monks are accorded great
    respect and reverence. Lay people respect them as teachers of the Dhamma and as men who
    have sacrificed the worldly life in order to lead a holy life. Monks devote themselves to
    the study and practice of the Dhamma and do not earn a living. Laymen, therefore, see to
    their material well-being while they in turn look to the monks for their spiritual needs.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">As such, monks are expected to conduct themselves in such
    a way that will earn them the respect and reverence of the public. If, for example, a monk
    is seen in a disreputable place, he will be criticized even if he is not involved in any
    immoral action. Therefore, it is the duty of the monks to avoid certain uncongenial
    surroundings so as to maintain the dignity of the holy Order.</font> </p>
    <p><font><font FACE="Times New Roman">If a monk does not respect the feelings of his lay
    devotees and behaves according to what he alone thinks is right, then the lay devotees are
    not bound to look after his needs. There are many instances recorded in the Buddhist Texts
    that even during the Buddha</font>'<font FACE="Times New Roman">s time, lay devotees had
    refused to look after arrogant, quarrelsome or irresponsible monks. Monks can be
    criticized for doing certain worldly things which only lay people are at liberty to do.</font></font>
    </p>
    <p><font SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">Dhamma and Vinaya</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Many people have not yet realized that the Dhamma, the
    Truth expounded by the Buddha, is not changeable under any circumstances. Certain Vinaya
    rules are also included into the same category and they are not subject to change under
    any circumstances. But some other Vinaya rules are subject to change so as to prevent
    certain undue inconveniences. Dhamma and Vinaya are not the same. Some monks try to
    observe certain traditions rigidly as if they are important religious principles although
    others cannot find any religious significance or implication in their practices. At the
    same time some selfish and cunning persons may even try to maintain certain outward
    manifestations of purity, in order to mislead innocent devotees to regard them as pious
    and sincere monks. Many so-called Buddhist practices in Asian countries that monks and
    others follow are not necessarily religious precepts but traditional practices upheld by
    the people. On the other hand, certain manners introduced for monks to observe as
    disciplines truly maintain the dignity and serenity of the holy Order. Although religious
    traditions and customs can create a congenial atmosphere for spiritual development, some
    Vinaya rules need to be amended according to changing social conditions. If this is not
    done, monks will have to face numerous problems in the course of their survival and in
    their association with the public.</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Some lay people criticize monks for handling money. It is
    difficult to carry out their religious activities and to be active in modern society
    without dealing with money. What a monk must do is to consider himself as unattached to
    the money or property as personal belongings. That is what the Buddha meant. Of course,
    there may be some who deliberately misinterpret the rules to suit their material gain.
    They will have to bear the consequences of their own inability to gain spiritual
    development.</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">However, those who choose to confine themselves to an
    isolated area for meditation for peace of mind, should be able to carry out their
    religious duties without hindrance from worldly things which can become burdensome. But
    they must first ensure that they have enough supporters to attend to their needs. While
    there can be such monks who wish to retire completely from society there must be enough
    monks in society to attend to the numerous religious needs of the general public.
    Otherwise, people may think that Buddhism cannot contribute very much in their day to day
    lives.</font> </p>
    <p><font SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">Characteristic of a Monk</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Among the salient characteristics of a monk are purity,
    voluntary poverty, humility, simplicity, selfless service, self-control, patience,
    compassion and harmlessness. He is expected to observe the four kinds of Higher Morality,
    namely:</font> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>Patimokkha Sila </i>-- The Fundamental Moral Code
      (major offenses related to immoral, cruel, harmful and selfish activities.)</font> </p>
      <p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>Indriyasamvara Sila </i>-- Morality pertaining to
      sense-restraint.</font> </p>
      <p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>Ajivaparisuddhi Sila</i> -- Morality pertaining to
      purity of livelihood.</font> </p>
      <p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>Paccayasannissita Sila</i></font><font> -- </font><font
      FACE="Times New Roman">Morality pertaining to the use of requisites pertaining to life.</font>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">These four kinds of morality are collectively called <i>Sila-Visuddhi
    </i>(Purity of Virtue).</font> </p>
    <p><font><font FACE="Times New Roman">When a person enters the Order and receives his
    ordination he is called a <i>Samanera </i></font>_<font FACE="Times New Roman">Novice
    Monk. He is bound to observe Ten Samanera Precepts with certain disciplinary codes for
    leading a monastic life until he receives his higher ordination</font>?<font
    FACE="Times New Roman">Upasampada </font>_ <font FACE="Times New Roman">to become a
    Bhikkhu or fully fledged monk.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">A bhikkhu or monk is bound to observe the above-mentioned
    four kinds of higher morality which comprise 227 rules apart from several other minor
    ones. The four major ones which deal with celibacy and abstinence from stealing, murder,
    and false claims to higher spirituality must strictly be observed. If he violates any one
    of these, a monk is regarded as a defeated person in the Sangha community. He will be
    deprived of certain religious rights by the Sangha community. In the case of other rules
    which he violates, he has to face many other consequences and make amends according to the
    gravity of the offence.</font> </p>
