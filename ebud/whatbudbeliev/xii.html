    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>ith so many books available on
    Buddhism, one may ask if there is need for yet another text. Although books on Buddhism
    are available on the market, many of them are written for those who have already acquired
    a basic understanding of the Buddha Dhamma. Some are written in an archaic style, based on
    a rigid translation of the original texts. Such a style is not appealing to modern readers
    who might get the impression that Buddhism is a dry subject. There are books by learned
    scholars who present the teachings in a highly academic and abstruse manner. Except for a
    few very well-informed readers, these books could create more confusion than clarify, and
    may even lead the ordinary reader to conclude that Buddhism is too sophisticated for his
    needs. Some books highlight differences between schools of Buddhism, with the result that
    the uninitiated reader may be engrossed in the so-called 'intersectarian rivalry', without
    realizing that there are many more similarities than differences among schools. There are
    also books written by non-Buddhists who, either deliberately or through their ignorance,
    distort and misrepresent the true teachings of the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This book is written with a specific aim in mind: to
    introduce the original teaching clearly and without recourse to exaggeration, cultural
    implications or disparaging of particular schools of Buddhism, so that the reader can
    understand the Buddha Dhamma its modern context. There is a growing interest in Buddhism
    the world over because many informed people have grown rather weary of religious dogmatism
    and superstition, on one hand, and greed and selfishness arising from materialism, on the
    other. Buddhism can teach humanity to walk the Middle Path of moderation and have a better
    understanding on how to lead a richer life of peace and happiness.</font></p>
