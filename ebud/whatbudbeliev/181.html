      effortand self-confidence.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">B</font>uddhism is a gentle religion where
    equality, justice and peace reign supreme. To depend on others for salvation is negative,
    but to depend on oneself is positive. Dependence on others means surrendering one's
    intelligence and efforts. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Everything which has improved and uplifted humanity
    has been done by man himself. Man's improvement must come from hi own knowledge,
    understanding, effort and experience and not from heaven. Man should not be a slave even
    to the great forces of nature because even though he is crushed by them he remains
    superior by virtue of his understanding of them. Buddhism carries the Truth further: it
    shows that by means of understanding, man can also control his environment and
    circumstances. He can cease to be crushed by them and use their power to raise himself to
    great heights of spirituality and nobility.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism gives due credit to man's intelligence and effort
    for his achievements rather than to supernatural beings. True religion means faith in the
    good of man rather than faith in unknown forces. In that respect, Buddhism is not merely a
    religion, but a noble method to gain peace and eternal salvation through living a
    respectable way of life. From the very outset, Buddhism appeals to the cultured and the
    intellectual minds. Every cultured man in the world today respects the Buddha as a
    rational Teacher. The Buddha taught that what man needs for his happiness is not a
    religion with a mass of dogmas and theories but knowledge of the cosmic nature and its
    relationship to the law of cause and effect. Until this principle that life is merely an
    imperfect manifestation of nature is fully understood, no man can be fully emancipated. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha has given a new explanation of the universe. It
    is a new vision of eternal happiness, the achievement of perfection. The winning of the
    human goal in Buddhism is the permanent state beyond impermanency, the attainment of<i>
    Nibbana</i> beyond all the worlds of change, and the final deliverance form the miseries
    of existence. </font></p>
