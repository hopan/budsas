    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">B</font>uddhism has been an admirable
    lighthouse for guiding many a devotee to the salvation of eternal bliss. Buddhism is
    especially needed in the world today which is riddled with racial, economic and
    ideological misunderstandings. These misunderstandings can never be effectively cleared
    until the spirit of benevolent tolerance is extended towards others. This spirit can be
    best cultivated under the guidance of Buddhism which inculcates an ethical moral
    co-operation for universal good. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We know that it is easy to learn vice without a master,
    whereas virtue requires a tutor. There is a very great need for the teaching of virtue by
    precepts and examples. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Without a spiritual background, man has no moral
    responsibility; man without moral responsibility poses danger to society. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Buddha's Teaching, it is said that the spiritual
    development of man is more important than the development of material welfare. History has
    taught us that we cannot expect to gain both worldly happiness and everlasting Happiness
    at the same time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The lives of most people are generally regulated by
    spiritual values and moral principles which only religion can effectively provide. The
    governmental interference in the lives of people is made comparatively unnecessary if men
    and women can be made to realize the value of devotion and can practise the ideals of
    truth, justice and service. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Virtue is necessary to attain salvation, but virtue alone
    is not enough. Virtue must be combined with wisdom. Virtue and wisdom are like the pair of
    wings of a bird. Wisdom can also be compared to the eyes of a man; virtue, to his feet.
    Virtue can be likened to a vehicle that brings man up to the gate of salvation. But wisdom
    is the actually key that opens the gate. Virtue is a part of the technique of skillful and
    noble living. Without any ethical discipline, there cannot be a purification of the
    defilements of sentient existence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is not mere mumbo-jumbo, a myth told to entertain
    the human mind or to satisfy the human emotion, but a liberal and noble method for those
    who sincerely want to understand and experience the reality of life. </font></p>
