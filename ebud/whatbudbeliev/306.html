      the same way as there are visible and invisible lights.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">B</font>uddhism does not deny the existence
    of good and evil spirits. There are visible and invisible beings or spirits in the same
    way as there are visible and invisible lights. We need special instruments to see the
    invisible light and we need a special sense to see the invisible beings. One cannot deny
    the existence of such spirits just because one is unable to see them with one's naked
    eyes. Theses spirits are also subject to birth and death. They are not going to stay
    permanently in the spirit form. They too exist in the same world where we live. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A genuine Buddhist is one who moulds his life according to
    moral causation discovered by the Buddha. He should not be concerned with the worshipping
    of these gods and spirits. However, this kind of worshipping is of some interest and
    fascination to the multitude and has naturally brought some Buddhists into contact with
    these activities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Regarding protection from evil spirits, goodness is a
    shield against evil. Goodness is a wall through which evil cannot penetrate unless a
    person opens the door to an evil influence. Even though a person leads a truly virtuous
    and holy life and has a good shield of moral and noble living that person can still lower
    his shield of protection by believing in the power of evil that would do harm to him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha has never advised His followers to worship such
    spirits and to be frightened of them. The Buddhist attitude towards them is to transfer
    merits and to radiate loving-kindness to them. Buddhists do not harm them. On the other
    hand, if man is religious, virtuous and pure in mind, and if he is also intelligent and
    possesses strong will-power and understanding capacity, then such a person could be deemed
    to be much stronger than spirits. The evil spirits would keep away from him, the good
    spirits would protect him. </font></p>
