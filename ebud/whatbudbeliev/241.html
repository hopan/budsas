    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">I</font><font face="Times New Roman">f Buddhists
    do not believe in the soul created by god, how are they going to account for the increase
    of population in the world today? This is a very common question that is asked by many
    people today. People who ask this question usually assume that there is only one world
    where living beings exist. One must consider that it is quite natural for the population
    to increase in such places where good climatic conditions, medical facilities, food and
    precautions are available to produce and to protect living beings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One must also consider that there is really no ground to
    think that this is the only period in which the population in the world has increased.
    There are no means of comparison with any period of ancient history. Vast civilizations
    existed and have disappeared in Central Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Ancient America.
    No census figures on these civilizations are even remotely available. Population, as
    everything else in the universe, is subject to cycles of rise and fall. In cycles of
    alarming increases of birth rate, one might be consequently tempted to argue against
    rebirth in this or other worlds. For the last few thousand years, there has been no
    evidence to prove that there were more people in some parts of the world than there are
    today. The number of beings existing in the various world systems is truly infinite. If
    human lives can be compared to only one grain of sand, the number of beings in the
    universe is like the grains of sand all the beaches in the world. When conditions are
    right and when supported by their good kamma, a few of these infinite number of beings are
    reborn as human beings. The advancement of medicine especially in the 19<sup>th</sup> and
    20<sup>th</sup> centuries has enabled human beings to live longer and healthier lives. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a factor that contributes to population increase.
    Population can further increase unless sensible people take measures to control it. Hence,
    the credit or responsibility of increasing the population must be given to medical
    facilities and other circumstances available today. This credit or responsibility cannot
    be allotted to any particular religion or any external sources. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a belief among certain people that all
    unfortunate occurrences that destroy human lives are created by god in order to reduce the
    population of the world. Instead of giving so much suffering to his own creatures, why
    cannot he control the population? Why does he create more and more people in thickly
    populated countries where there is no proper food, clothing and other basic and necessary
    requirements? Those who believe that god created everything cannot give a satisfactory
    answer to this question. Poverty, unhappiness, war, hunger, disease, famine are not due to
    the will of god or to the whim of some devil, but to causes which are not so difficult to
    discover. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="+1">Sex and Religion</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>'The lower part of us is still animal.' (Gandhi)</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sex impulse is the most dynamic force in human nature.
    So far-reaching is the sexual force that some measures of self-control is necessary even
    in ordinary existence. In the case of the spiritual aspirant, for whoever wants to bring
    his mind under complete control, a still greater measure of self-discipline is necessary.
    Such a powerful force in human character can be subdued only if the aspirant controls his
    thoughts and practises concentration. The conservation of the sexual force helps to
    develop this strength. For if he controls the sexual force, he will have more control over
    his whole make-up, over his lesser emotions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Celibacy is one of the requirements for those who
    like to develop their spiritual development to perfection. However, it is not compulsory
    for each and every person to observe complete celibacy in order to practise Buddhism. The
    Buddha's advice is that observing celibacy is more congenial for a person who wants to
    cultivate his spiritual achievements. For ordinary Buddhist laymen, the precept is to
    abstain from sexual misconduct. Although perversion of the sexual force is not under this
    same category, the perverted person invariably suffers bad reactions either physically, or
    mentally or both.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>There is a need for Buddhist laymen to exercise some
    degree of control over their sexual force. Man's sexual urge must be controlled properly
    otherwise man will behave worse than an animal when he is intoxicated with lust. Consider
    the sexual behavior of what we call the 'lower animal'. Which really is often 'lower'? The
    animal or the man? Which acts in a normal, regular manner as regards sexual behavior? And
    which runs off into all manner of irregularities and perversities? Often it is the animal
    that is the higher creature and man that is the lower. And why is this? It is simply
    because man who possesses the mental capacity which if rightly used, could make him master
    over his sex impulses, has actually used his mental powers in such deplorable fashion as
    to make himself more a slave to those impulses. Thus man can, at times, be considered
    lower than the animal.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our ancestors played down this sexual impulse; they knew
    that it was strong enough without giving it any extra encouragement. But today we have
    blown it up with a thousand forms of incitation, suggestive advertisements, emphasis and
    display; and we have armed the sexual force with the doctrine that inhibition is dangerous
    and can even cause mental disorders. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yet inhibition the control of impulse is the first
    principle of any civilization. In our modern civilization, we have polluted the sexual
    atmosphere that surrounds us. So great is the mind-body urge for sexual gratification. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a result of this sex exploitation by the hidden
    persuaders of modern society, the youth of today have developed an attitude toward sex
    that is becoming a public nuisance. An innocent girl has no freedom to move anywhere
    without being disturbed. On the other hand, females should be dressed such a manner as not
    to arouse the hidden animal nature of youths. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Man is the only animal that does not have periods of
    natural sexual inactivity during which the body can recover its vitality. Unfortunately,
    commercial exploitation of the erotic nature in man has caused modern man to be exposed to
    a ceaseless barrage of sexual stimulation from every side. Much of the neuroses of
    present-day life is traceable to this unbalanced state of affairs. Men are expected to be
    monogamous, yet women are encouraged in every possible way to 'glamorize' themselves, not
    for the husband alone, but to excite in every man passions that society forbids him to
    indulge in. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many societies try to enforce monogamous relationships.
    Thus a man with many failings can still be a moral man, meaning that he is faithful to the
    one wife that the law allows him to have. The danger here lies in the fact that thoughtful
    people who are intelligent enough to realize that these rules are artificial and not based
    on any transcendental, universally valid principles, are liable to fall into the error of
    thinking the same about all the other ethical laws. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sex should be given its due place in normal human life; it
    should be neither unhealthily repressed nor morbidly exaggerated. And it should always be
    under the control of the will, as it can be if it is regarded sanely and placed in its
    proper perspective. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Sex should not be considered as the most important
    ingredient for one's happiness in a married life. Those who over-indulge can become slaves
    to sex which would ultimately ruin love and humane consideration in marriage. As in
    everything, one must be temperate and rational in one's sexual demands taking into
    consideration one another's intimate feelings and temperament.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Marriage is a bond of partnership for life entered
    into by a man and a woman. Patience, tolerance and understanding are the three principal
    qualities that should be developed and nurtured by the couple. Whilst love should be the
    knot tying the couple together, material necessities for sustaining a happy home should be
    made available by the male partner for the couple to share. The qualification for a good
    partnership in marriage should be 'ours' and not 'yours' or 'mine' . A good couple should
    'open' their hearts to one another and to refrain from entertaining 'secrets'. Keeping
    secrets to oneself could lead to suspicion and suspicion is the element that could destroy
    love in a partnership. Suspicion breeds jealousy, jealousy creates anger, anger develops
    hatred, hatred turns into enmity and enmity could cause untold suffering including
    bloodshed, suicide and even murder.</font>&nbsp; </font></p>
