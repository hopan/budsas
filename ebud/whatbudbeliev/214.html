      over-eating.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">I</font><font face="Times New Roman">n Buddhism,
    fasting is recognized as one of the methods for practising self-control. The Buddha
    advised monks not to take solid food after noon. Lay people who observe the eight Precepts
    on full moon days also abstain from taking any solid food after noon. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Critics sometimes regard these practices as religious
    fads. They are not religious fads but practices based on a moral and psychological
    insight. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhism, fasting is an initial stage of
    self-discipline to acquire self-control. In every religion, there is a system of fasting.
    By fasting and sacrificing a meal once a day or for any period, we can contribute our food
    to those who are starving or who do not have even a proper meal each day. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'A man who eats too much', writes Leo Tolstoy,
    'cannot strive against laziness, while a gluttonous and idle man will never be able to
    contend with sexual lust. Therefore, according to all moral teachings, the effort towards
    self-control commences with a struggle against the lust of gluttony?commences with fasting
    just as the first condition of a good life is self-control, so the first condition of a
    life of self-control is fasting.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sages in various countries who practised self-control
    began with a system of regulated fasting and succeeded in attaining unbelievable heights
    of spirituality. An ascetic was kicked and tortured, and then his hands and feet were
    severed on the orders of a rakish king. But the ascetic, according to the Buddhist story,
    endured the torture with equanimity and without the slightest anger or hatred. Such
    religious people have developed their mental power through restraining from sensual
    indulgence.</font></p>
