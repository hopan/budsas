    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>'If a person foolishly does me wrong, I will return to
      him the protection of my boundless love. The more evil that comes from him the more good
      will go from me. I will always give off only the fragrance of goodness.' (Buddha).</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People today are restless, weary filled with fear and
    discontentment. They are intoxicated with the desire to gain fame, wealth and power. They
    crave for gratification of the senses. People are passing their days in fear, suspicion
    and insecurity. In this time of turmoil and crisis, it becomes difficult for people to
    coexist peacefully with their fellowmen. There is therefore, a great need for tolerance in
    the world today so that peaceful co-existence among the people of the world can be
    possible. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The world has bled and suffered from the disease of
    dogmatism and of intolerance. The land of many countries today are soaked with the blood
    spilled on the altar of various political struggles, as the skies of earlier millennia
    were covered with the smoke of burning martyrs of various faiths. Whether in religion or
    politics people have been conscious of a mission to bring humanity to their way of life
    and have been aggressive towards other ways of life. Indeed, the intolerance of the
    crusading spirit has spoiled the records of religions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Let us look back on this present century of highly
    publicized 'Progress' -- a century of gadgets and inventions. The array of new scientific
    and technical inventions is dazzling - telephones, electric motors, airplanes, radios,
    television, computers, space ships, satellites and electronic devices etc. Yet in this
    same century the children of the earth who have developed all these inventions as the
    ultimate in progress, are the same people who have butchered millions of others by
    bayonets or bullets or gas. Amidst all the great 'progress', where does the spirit of
    tolerance stand?</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today man is interested in exploring outer space. But he
    is totally unable to live as man-to-man in peace and harmony. Man will eventually
    desecrate the moon and other planets. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the sake of material gain, modern man violates nature.
    His mental activities are so preoccupied with his pleasure that he is unable to discover
    the purpose of life. This unnatural behavior of present mankind is the result of his wrong
    conception of human life and its ultimate aim. It is the cause of the frustration, fear,
    insecurity and intolerance of our present time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In fact, today intolerance is still practised in the name
    of religion. People merely talk of religion and promise to provide short cuts to paradise,
    they are not interested in practising it. If Christianity live by the Sermon on the Mount,
    if Buddhists follow the Noble Eightfold path, if Muslims really follow the concept of
    Brotherhood and if the Hindus shape their life in oneness, definitely there will be peace
    and harmony in this world. Inspite of these invaluable Teachings of the great religious
    teachers, people have still not realized the value of tolerance. The intolerance that is
    practised in the name of religion is most disgraceful and deplorable. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha<font>'s advice is 'Let us live happily, not
    hating those who hate us. Among those who hate us, let us live free from hatred. Let us
    live happily and free from ailment. Let us live happily and be free from greed; among
    those who are greedy.'</font>&nbsp; -- (<em>Dhammapada 197-200)</em></font></p>
