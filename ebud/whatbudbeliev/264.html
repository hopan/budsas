    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Merely to believe that there is someone to wash away
      our sins without suppressing our evil state of mind, is not in accordance with the
      Teachings of the Buddha.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Very often we come across cases of people who change
    their religion at the last moment when they are about to die. By embracing another
    religion, some people are under the mistaken belief that they can 'wash away their sins'
    and gain an easy passage to heaven. They also hope to ensure themselves a simple and
    better burial. For people who have been living a whole life-time with a particular
    religion, to suddenly embrace a religion which is totally new and unfamiliar and to expect
    an immediate salvation through their new faith is indeed very far-fetched. This is only a
    dream. Some people are even known to have been converted into another faith when they are
    in a state of unconsciousness and in come cases, even posthumously. Those who are over
    zealous and crazy about converting others into their faith, have misled uneducated people
    into believing that theirs is the one and only faith with an easy method or short-cut to
    heaven. If people are led to believe that there is someone sitting somewhere up there who
    can wash away all the sins committed during a life-time, then this belief will only
    encourage others to commit evil.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Teachings of the Buddha there is no such
    belief that there is someone who can wash away sins. It is only when people sincerely
    realize that what they are doing are wrong and after having realized this, try to mend
    their ways and do good that they can suppress or counter the bad reactions that would
    accrue to them for the evil they had committed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>It has become a common sight in many hospitals to
    see purveyors of some religions hovering around the patients promising them 'life after
    death'. This is exploiting the basic ignorance and psychological fear of the patients. If
    they really want to help, then they must be able to work the 'miracles' they so proudly
    claim lies in their holy books. If they can work miracles, we will not need hospitals.
    Buddhists must never become victims to these people. They must learn the basic teachings
    of their noble religion which tells them that all suffering is the basic lot of mankind.
    The only way to end suffering is by purifying the mind. The individual creates his own
    suffering and it is he alone who can end it. One cannot hope to eradicate the consequences
    of one's evil actions simply by changing one's religious label at the door-step of death.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>A dying man's destiny in his next life depends on
    the last thoughts which appear to him according to the good and bad <i>kamma</i> he had
    accumulated during his current lifetime, irrespective of what type of religious label he
    prefers to do himself at the last moment.</font> </font></p>
