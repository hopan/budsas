      <i>Faith healing -- a psychological approach.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he practice of faith-healing is
    prevalent in many countries. Many people are trying to influence the public through
    emotional persuasion designated as faith-healing. In order to impress on their patients
    the efficacy of their healing powers, some faith-healers use the name of a god or a
    religious object to introduce a religious flavor into their faith healing methods. The
    introduction of religion into faith-healing is actually a guise or a decoy to beguile the
    patient into developing more devotion and enhance the confidence or faith of the patient
    in the faith-healer. This healing act, if performed in public is intended to get converts
    to a particular religious denomination. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In actual fact, in so far as faith-healing is concerned,
    religion is not all that important. There are numerous cases of faith-healers performing
    their faith-healing acts without using religion at all. A case in point is the science of
    hypnotism, the practice of which involves no religious aspects at all. Those who associate
    religion with faith-healing are in a way engaging in a subtle form of illusion trying to
    attract converts to their particular religion by making use of faith healing and
    describing certain cures as miraculous acts. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The methods employed by faith healers are to condition the
    minds of patients into having a certain mental attitude with the result that certain
    favorable psychological and physiological changes invariably take place. This attracts the
    condition of the mind, the heart, the consequent blood circulation and other related
    organic functions of the body, thus creating a feeling of a sense of well-being. If
    sickness is attributed to the condition of the mind, then the mind can certainly be
    properly conditioned to assist in eradicating whatever illness that may occur. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this context, it is to be noted that the constant and
    regular practice of meditation can help to minimize, if not to completely eradicate,
    various forms of illnesses. There are many discourses in the Teaching of the Buddha where
    it was indicated that various forms of sicknesses were eradicated through the conditioning
    of the mind. Thus it is worthwhile to practise meditation in order to attain mental and
    physical well-being. </font></p>
