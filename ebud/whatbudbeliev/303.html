    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he Buddhist concept of heaven and
    hell is entirely different from that in other religions. Buddhists do not accept that
    these places are eternal. It is unreasonable to condemn a man to eternal hell for his
    human weakness but quite reasonable to give him every chance to develop himself. From the
    Buddhist point of view, those who go to hell can work themselves upward by making use of
    the merit that they had acquired previously. There are no locks on the gates of hell. Hell
    is a temporary place and there is no reason for those beings to suffer there forever. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha's Teaching shows us that there are
    heavens and hells not only beyond this world, but in this very world itself. Thus the
    Buddhist conception of heaven and hell is very reasonable. For instance, the Buddha once
    said, 'When the average ignorant person makes an assertion to the effect that there is a
    Hell (patala) under the ocean he is making a statement which is false and without basis.
    The word 'Hell' is a term for painful sensations. 'The idea of one particular ready-made
    place or a place created by god as heaven and hell is not acceptable to the Buddhist
    concept.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fire of hell in this world is hotter than that of the
    hell in the world-beyond. There is no fire equal to anger, lust or greed and ignorance.
    According to the Buddha, we are burning from eleven kinds of physical pain and mental
    agony: lust, hatred, illusion sickness, decay, death, worry, lamentation, pain(physical
    and mental), melancholy and grief. People can burn the entire world with some of these
    fires of mental discord. From a Buddhist point of view, the easiest way to define hell and
    heaven is that where ever there is more suffering, either in this world or any other
    plane, that place is a hell to those who suffer. And where there is more pleasure or
    happiness, either in this world or any other worldly existence, that place is a heaven to
    those who enjoy their worldly life in that particular place. However, as the human realm
    is a mixture of both pain and happiness, human beings experience both pain and happiness
    and will be able to realize the real nature of life. But in many other planes of existence
    inhabitants have less chance for this realization. In certain places there is more
    suffering than pleasure while in some other places there is more pleasure than suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists believe that after death rebirth can take place
    in any one of a number of possible existences. This future existence is conditioned by the
    last thought-moment a person experiences at the point of death. This last thought which
    determines the next existence results from the past actions of a man either in this life
    or before that. Hence, if the predominant thought reflects meritorious action, then he
    will find his future existence in a happy state. But that state is temporary and when it
    is exhausted a new life must begin all over again, determined by another dominating <font>'kammic'
    energy. This repetitious process goes on endlessly unless one arrives at 'Right View' and
    makes a firm resolve to follow the Noble Path which produces the ultimate happiness of <i>Nibbana.</i></font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Heaven is a temporary place where those who have done good
    deeds experience more sensual pleasures for a longer period. Hell is another temporary
    place where those evil doers experience more physical and mental suffering. It is not
    justifiable to believe that such places are permanent. There is no god behind the scene of
    heaven and hell. Each and every person experiences according to his good and bad <i>kamma.</i>
    Buddhist never try to introduce Buddhism by frightening people through hell-fire or
    enticing people by pointing to paradise. Their main idea is character building and mental
    training. Buddhists can practise their religion without aiming at heaven or without
    developing fear of hell. </font></p>
