      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Why are we here? Why are we not happy with our lives?

      and experience eternal peace?</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he Buddha's Teaching is based
    on the Four Noble Truths. To realize these Truths is to realize and penetrate into the
    true nature of existence, including the full knowledge of oneself. When we recognize that
    all phenomenal things are transitory, are subject to suffering and are void of any
    essential reality, we will be convinced that true and enduring happiness cannot be found
    in material possessions and worldly achievement, that true happiness must be sought only
    through mental purity and the cultivation of wisdom.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Four Noble Truths are a very important aspect of the
    teaching of the Buddha. The Buddha has said that it is because we fail to understand the
    Four Noble Truths that we have continued to go round in the cycle of birth and death. In
    the very first sermons of the Buddha, the <i>Dhammachakka Sutta</i>, which He gave to the
    five monks at the Deer park in Sarnath was on the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold
    Path. What are the Four Noble Truths? They are as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Noble Truth of <i>Dukkha<br>
      </i>The Noble Truth of the Cause of <i>Dukkha<br>
      </i>The Noble Truth of the End of <i>Dukkha<br>
      </i>The Noble Truth of the Path leading to the end of <i>Dukkha</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many ways of understanding the Pali word
    'Dukkha'. It has generally been translated as 'suffering' or 'unsatisfactoriness', but
    this term as used in the Four Noble Truths has a deeper and wider meaning. Dukkha contains
    not only the ordinary meaning of suffering, but also includes deeper ideas such as
    imperfection, pain, impermanence, disharmony, discomfort, irritation, or awareness of
    incompleteness and insufficiency. By all means, Dukkha includes physical and mental
    suffering: birth, decay, disease, death, to be united with the unpleasant, to be separated
    from the pleasant, not to get what one desires. However, many people do not realize that
    even during the moments of joy and happiness, there is Dukkha because these moments are
    all impermanent states and will pass away when conditions change. Therefore, the truth of
    Dukkha encompasses the whole of existence, in our happiness and sorrow, in every aspect of
    our lives. As long as we live, we are very profoundly subjected to this truth.</font></font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people may have the impression that viewing
    life in terms of Dukkha is a rather pessimistic way of looking at life. This is not a
    pessimistic but a realistic way of looking at life. If one is suffering from a disease and
    refuses to recognize the fact that one is ill, and as a result of which refuses to seek
    for treatment, we will not consider such a mental attitude as being optimistic, but merely
    as being foolish. Therefore, by being both optimistic or pessimistic, one does not really
    understand the nature of life, and is therefore unable to tackle life's problems in the
    right perspective. The Four Noble Truths begin with the recognition of Dukkha and then
    proceed to analyse its cause and find its cure. Had the Buddha stopped at the Truth of
    Dukkha, then one may say Buddhism has identified the problem but has not given the cure;
    if such is the case, then the human situation is hopeless. However, not only is the Truth
    of Dukkha recognized, the Buddha proceeded to analyze its cause and the way to cure it.
    How can Buddhism be considered to be pessimistic if the cure to the problem is known? In
    fact, it is a teaching which is filled with hope.</font></font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition, even though Dukkha is a noble truth, it
    does not mean that there is no happiness, enjoyment and pleasure in life. There is, and
    the Buddha has taught various methods with which we can gain more happiness in our daily
    life. However, in the final analysis, the fact remains that the pleasure or happiness
    which we experience in life is impermanent. We may enjoy a happy situation, or the good
    company of someone we love, or we enjoy youth and health. Sooner or later, when these
    states change we experience suffering. Therefore, while there is every reason to feel glad
    when one experiences happiness, one should not cling to these happy states or be
    side-tracked and forget about working one's way to complete Liberation.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we wish to cure ourselves from suffering, we must first
    identify its cause. According to the Buddha, craving or desire (<i>tanha or raga</i>) is
    the cause of suffering. This is the Second Noble Truth. People crave for pleasant
    experiences, crave for material things, crave for eternal life, and when disappointed,
    crave for eternal death. They are not only attached to sensual pleasures, wealth and
    power, but also to ideas, views, opinions, concepts, beliefs. And craving is linked to
    ignorance, that is, not seeing things as they really are, or failing to understand the
    reality of experience and life. Under the delusion of Self and not realizing<i> Anatta</i>
    (non-Self), a person clings to things which are impermanent, changeable, perishable. The
    failure to satisfy one<font>'s desires through these things causes disappointments and
    suffering.</font></font></p>
    <font SIZE="+1"><p></font><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Danger of Selfish
    Desire</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Craving is a fire which burns in all beings: every
    activity is motivated by desire. They range from the simple physical desire of animals to
    the complex and often artificially stimulated desires of the civilized man. To satisfy
    desire, animals prey upon one another, and human beings fight, kill, cheat, lie and
    perform various forms of unwholesome deeds. Craving is a powerful mental force present in
    all forms of life, and is the chief cause of the ills in life. It is this craving that
    leads to repeated births in the cycle of existence.</font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Once we have realized the cause of suffering, we are
    in the position to put an end to suffering. So, how do we put an end to suffering?
    Eliminate it at its root by the removal of craving in the mind. This is the Third Noble
    Truth. The state where craving ceases is known as <i>Nibbana</i>. The word <i>Nibbana</i>
    is composed of 'ni' and 'vana', meaning the departure from or end of craving. This is a
    state which is free from suffering and rounds of rebirth. This is a state which is not
    subjected to the laws of birth, decay and death. This state is so sublime that no human
    language can express it. <i>Nibbana</i> is Unborn, Unoriginated, Uncreated, Unformed. If
    there were not this Unborn, this Unoriginated, this Uncreated, this Unformed, then escape
    from the conditioned world is not possible.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Nibbana</i> is beyond logic and reasoning. We may
    engage in highly speculative discussions regarding <i>Nibbana</i> or ultimate reality, but
    this is not the way to really understand it. To understand and realize the truth of <i>Nibbana</i>,
    it is necessary for us to walk the Eightfold Path, and to train and purify ourselves with
    diligence and patience. Through spiritual development and maturity, we will be able to
    realize the Third Noble Truth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Noble Eightfold Path is the Fourth Noble Truth which
    leads to <i>Nibbana</i>. It is a way of life consisting of eight factors. By walking on
    this Path, it will be possible for us to see an end to suffering. Because Buddhism is a
    logical and consistent teaching embracing every aspect of life, this noble Path also
    serves as the finest possible code for leading a happy life. Its practice brings benefits
    to oneself and other, and it is not a Path to be practised by those who call themselves
    Buddhists alone, but by each and every understanding person, irrespective of his religious
    beliefs.</font></p>
