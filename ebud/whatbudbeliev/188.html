    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">O</font><font face="Times New Roman">nce the
    Blessed One told His monks the following story:</font> </p>
    <p><font>'<font face="Times New Roman">There was once a pair of jugglers who did their
    acrobatic feats on a bamboo pole. One day the master said to his apprentice: </font>'<font
    face="Times New Roman">Now get on my shoulders and climb up the bamboo pole.</font>' <font
    face="Times New Roman">When the apprentice had done so, the master said: </font>'<font
    face="Times New Roman">Now protect me well and I shall protect you. By watching each other
    in that way, we shall be able to show our skill, we shall make a good profit and you can
    get down safely from the bamboo pole.</font>' <font face="Times New Roman">But the
    apprentice said: </font>'<font face="Times New Roman">Not so, master. You! O Master,
    should protect yourself, and I too shall protect myself. Thus self-protected and
    self-guarded we shall safely do our feats.&quot;</font></font> </p>
    <p><font>'<font face="Times New Roman">This is the right way,</font>' <font
    face="Times New Roman">said the Blessed One and spoke further as follows:</font></font> </p>
    <p><font>'<font face="Times New Roman">It is just as the apprentice said: </font>'<font
    face="Times New Roman">I shall protect myself,</font>' <font face="Times New Roman">in
    that way the Foundation of Mindfulness should be practised. </font>'<font
    face="Times New Roman">I shall protect others,</font>' <font face="Times New Roman">in
    that way the Foundation of Mindfulness should be practised. Protecting oneself one
    protects others; protecting others one protects oneself.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font>'<font face="Times New Roman">And how does one, in protecting oneself, protect
    others? By the repeated and frequent practice of meditation.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font>'<font face="Times New Roman">And how does one, by protecting others, protect
    oneself? By patience and forbearance, by a non-violent and harmless life, by loving
    kindness and compassion.</font>' <font face="Times New Roman">(<i>Satipatthana, Samyutta,
    No:19)</i></font></font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font>'<font face="Times New Roman">Protecting oneself one protects
    others</font>'</font> <br>
    <font>'<font face="Times New Roman">Protecting others one protects oneself</font>'</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These two sentences supplement each other and should not
    be taken (or quoted) separately.</font> </p>
    <p><font><font face="Times New Roman">Nowadays, when social service is so greatly
    stressed, people may for instance, be tempted to quote, in support of their ideas, only
    the second sentence. But any such one-sided quotation would misrepresent the Buddha</font>'<font
    face="Times New Roman">s statement. It has to be remembered that, in our story the Buddha
    expressly approved the words of the apprentice, which is that one has first to carefully
    watch one</font>'<font face="Times New Roman">s own steps if one wishes to protect others
    from harm. He who is sunk in the mire himself cannot help others out of it. In that sense,
    self-protection is not selfish protection. It is the cultivation of self-control, and
    ethical and spiritual self-development.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font><font face="Times New Roman">Protecting oneself one protects others</font>?<font
    face="Times New Roman">the truth of this statement begins at a very simple and practical
    level. At the material level, this truth is so self-evident that we need not say more than
    a few words about it. It is obvious that the protection of our own health will go far in
    protecting the health of our closer or wider environment, especially where contagious
    diseases are concerned. Caution and circumspection in all our doings and movements will
    protect others from harm that may come to them through our carelessness and negligence. By
    careful driving, abstention from alcohol, by self-restraint in situations that might lead
    to violence</font>?<font face="Times New Roman">in all these and many other ways we shall
    protect others by protecting ourselves.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We come now to the ethical level of that truth. Moral
    self-protection will safeguard others, individual and society, against our own
    unrestrained passions and selfish impulses. If we permit the Three Roots of everything
    evil, Greed, Hate and Delusion, to take a firm hold in our hearts, then that which grows
    from those evil roots will spread around like the jungle creeper which suffocates and
    kills the healthy and noble growth. But if we protect ourselves against these Three Roots
    of Evil, fellow beings too will be safe from our reckless greed for possession and power,
    from our unrestrained lust and sensuality, from our envy and jealousy. They will be safe
    from the disruptive, or even destructive and murderous, consequences of our hate and
    enmity, from the outburst of our anger, from our spreading an atmosphere of antagonism and
    quarrelsomeness which may make life unbearable for those around us. But the harmful
    effects of our greed and hate on others are not limited to cases when they become the
    passive objects or victims of our hate, or their possession the object of our greed. Greed
    and hate have an infectious power, which can multiply the evil effects. If we ourselves
    think of nothing else than to crave and grasp, to acquire and possess, to hold and cling,
    then we may rouse or strengthen these possessive instincts in others too. Our bad example
    may become the standard of behavior of our environment for instance among our own
    children, our colleagues, and so on. Our own conduct may induce others to join us in the
    common satisfaction of rapacious desires; or we may arouse feelings of resentment and
    competitiveness in others who wish to beat us in the race. If we are full of sensuality we
    may kindle the fire of lust in others. Our own hate may cause the hate and vengeance of
    others. It may also happen that we ally ourselves with others or instigate them to common
    acts of hate and enmity.</font> </p>
