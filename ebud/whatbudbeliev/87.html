    face="Times New Roman">What is Kamma?</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">K</font>amma is an impersonal, natural law
    that operates in accordance with our actions. It is a law in itself and does not have any
    lawgiver. Kamma operates in its own field without the intervention of an external,
    independent, ruling agent.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma or karma can be put in the simple language of the
    child: do good and good will come to you, now, and hereafter. Do bad and bad will come to
    you, now, and hereafter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the language of the harvest, kamma can be explained in
    this way: if you sow good seeds, you will reap a good harvest. If you sow bad seeds, you
    will reap a bad harvest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the language of science, kamma is called the law of
    cause and effect: every cause has an effect. Another name for this is the law of moral
    causation. Moral causation works in the moral realm just as the physical law of action and
    reaction works in the physical realm.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Dhammapada, kamma is explained in this manner: the
    mind is the chief (forerunner) of all good and bad states. If you speak or act with a good
    or bad mind, then happiness or unhappiness follows you just as the wheel follows the hoof
    of the ox or like your shadow which never leaves you.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma is simply action. Within animate organisms there is
    a power or force which is given different names such as instinctive tendencies,
    consciousness, etc. This innate propensity forces every conscious being to move. He moves
    mentally or physically. His motion is action. The repetition of actions is habit and habit
    becomes his character. In Buddhism, this process is called kamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In its ultimate sense, kamma means both good and bad,
    mental action or volition. 'Kamma is volition,'<font> says the Buddha. Thus kamma is not
    an entity but a process, action, energy and force. Some interpret this force as
    'action-influence'.&nbsp; It is our own doings reacting on ourselves. The pain and
    happiness man experiences are the result of his own deeds, words and thoughts reacting on
    themselves. Our deeds, words and thoughts produce our prosperity and failure, our
    happiness and misery.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma is an impersonal, natural law that operates strictly
    in accordance with our actions. It is law in itself and does not have any lawgiver. Kamma
    operates in its own field without the intervention of an external, independent ruling
    agency. Since there is no hidden agent directing or administering rewards and punishments,
    Buddhists do not rely on prayer to some supernatural forces to influence karmic results.
    According to the Buddha, kamma is neither predestination nor some sort of determinism
    imposed on us by some mysterious, unknown powers or forces to which we must helplessly
    submit ourselves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists believe that man will reap what he has sown; we
    are the result of what we were, and we will be the result of what we are. In other words,
    man is not one who will absolutely remain to be what he was, and he will not continue to
    remain as what he is. This simply means that kamma is not complete determinism. The Buddha
    pointed out that if everything is determined, then there would be no free will and no
    moral or spiritual life. We would merely be the slaves of our past. On the other hand, if
    everything is undetermined, then there can be no cultivation of moral and spiritual
    growth. Therefore, the Buddha accepted neither strict determinism nor strict
    undeterminism.</font></p>
    <font SIZE="+1"><p></font><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Misconceptions regarding
    Kamma</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The misinterpretation or irrational views on kamma are
    stated in the Anguttara Nikaya which suggests that the wise will investigate and abandon
    the following views:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- the belief that everything is a result of acts in
      previous lives;<br>
      - the belief that all is the result of creation by a Supreme Ruler; and<br>
      - the belief that everything arises without reason or cause.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If a person becomes a murderer, a thief, or an adulterer,
    and, if his actions are due to past actions, or caused by creation of a Supreme Ruler, or
    if that happened by mere chance, then this person would not be held responsible for his
    evil action. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Yet another misconception about kamma is that it
    operates only for certain people according to their faiths. But the fate of a man in his
    next life does not in the least depend on what particular religion he chooses. Whatever
    may be his religion, man's fate depends entirely on his deeds by body, speech and thought.
    It does not matter what religious label he himself holds, he is bound to be happy world in
    his next life so long as he does good deeds and leads an unblemished life. He is bound to
    be born to lead a wretched life if he commits evil and harbors wicked thoughts in his
    mind. Therefore, Buddhists do not proclaim that they are the only blessed people who can
    go to heaven after their death. Whatever the religion he professes, man's kammic thought
    alone determines his own destiny both in this life and in the next. </font>The teaching of
    kamma does not indicate a post-mortem justice. The Buddha did not teach this law of <i>kamma
    </i>to protect the rich and to comfort the poor by promising illusory happiness in an
    after life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism kamma explains the inequalities that
    exist among mankind. These inequalities are due not only to heredity, environment and
    nature but also to kamma or the results of our own actions. Indeed kamma is one of the
    factors which are responsible for the success and the failure of our life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since kamma is an invisible force, we cannot see it
    working with our physical eyes. To understand how kamma works, we can compare it to seeds:
    the results of kamma are stored in the subconscious mind in the same way as the leaves,
    flowers, fruits and trunk of a tree are stored in its seed. Under favorable conditions,
    the fruits of kamma will be produced just as with moisture and light, the leaves and trunk
    of a tree will sprout from its tiny seed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The working of <i>kamma</i> can also be compared to a bank
    account: a person who is virtuous, charitable and benevolent in his present life is like a
    person who is adding to his good <i>kamma</i>. This accrued good <i>kamma</i> can be used
    by him to ensure a trouble-free life. But he must replace what he takes or else one day
    his account will be exhausted and he will be bankrupt. Then whom will he be able to blame
    for his miserable state? He can blame neither others nor fate. He alone is responsible.
    Thus a good Buddhist cannot be an escapist. He has to face life as it is and not run away
    from it. The kammic force cannot be controlled by inactivity. Vigorous activity for good
    is indispensable for one<font>'s own happiness. Escapism is the resort of the weak, and an
    escapist cannot escape the effects of the kammic law.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha says, 'There is no place to hide in order
    to escape from kammic results.' (Dhammapada 127).</font>&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Our Own Experience </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To understand the law of kamma is to realize that we
    ourselves are responsible for our own happiness and our own misery. We are the architects
    of our kamma. Buddhism explains that man has every possibility to mould his own kamma and
    thereby influence the direction of his life. On the other hand, a man is not a complete
    prisoner of his own actions; he is not a slave of his kamma. Nor is man a mere machine
    that automatically release instinctive forces that enslave him. Nor is man a mere product
    of nature. Man has within himself the strength and the ability to change his kamma. His
    mind is mightier than his kamma and so the law of kamma can be made to serve him. Man does
    not have to give up his hope and effort in order to surrender himself to his own kammic
    force. To off-set the reaction of his bad kamma that he has accumulated previously, he has
    to do more meritorious deeds and to purify his mind rather than by praying, worshipping,
    performing rites or torturing his physical body in order to overcome his kammic effects.
    Therefore, man can overcome the effect of his evil deeds if he acts wisely by leading
    noble life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Man must use the material with which he is endowed to
    promote his ideal. The cards in the game of life are within us. We do not select them.
    They are traced to our past kamma; but we can call as we please, do what suits us and as
    we play, we either gain or lose. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma is equated to the action of men. This action also
    creates some karmic results. But each and every action carried out without any purposeful
    intention, cannot become a Kusala-Kamma(skillful action) or Akusala-Kamma(unskillful
    action). That is why the Buddha interprets kamma as volitional activities. That means,
    whatever good and bad deeds we commit ourselves without any purposeful intention, are not
    strong enough to be carried forward to our next life. However, ignorance of the nature of
    the good and bad effect of the kamma is not an excuse to justify or avoid the karmic
    results if they were committed intentionally. A small child or an ignorant man may commit
    many evil deeds. Since they commit such deeds with intention to harm or injure, it is
    difficult to say that they are free from the karmic results. If that child touches a
    burning iron-rod the heat element does not spare the child without burning his fingers.
    The karmic energy also works exactly in the same manner. Karmic energy is unbiased, it is
    like energy of gravity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The radical transformations in the characters of
    Angulimala and Asoka illustrate man's potential to gain control over his kammic force.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Angulimala was a highway robber who murdered more than a
    thousand of his fellow men. Can we judge him by his external actions? For within his
    lifetime, he became an Arahanta and thus redeemed his past misdeeds. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Asoka, the Indian Emperor, killed thousands and
    thousands to fight his wars and to expand his empire. Yet after winning the battle, he
    completely reformed himself and changed his career to such an extent that today, 'Amidst
    the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their
    majesties and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Asoka shines and shines almost
    alone, as a star,' says a well-known world historian H.G. Well.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Other Factors Which Support Kamma </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although Buddhism says that man can eventually control his
    karmic force, it does not state that everything is due to kamma. Buddhism does not ignore
    the role played by other forces of nature. According to Buddhism there are five orders or
    processes of natural laws(niyama) which operate in the physical and mental worlds: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- seasonal laws (utu niyama): physical inorganic order
      e.g., seasonal phenomena of winds and rains, etc.<br>
      - the biological laws (bija niyama): relating to seasonal changes etc.,<br>
      - the kammic law (kamma niyama): relating to moral causation or the order of act and
      result,<br>
      - natural phenomena (dhamma niyama): relating to electrical forces, movement of tides
      etc., and<br>
      - psychological laws (citta niyama): which govern the processes of consciousness.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus kamma is considered only as one of the five natural
    laws that account for the diversity in this world.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Can Kamma Be Changed? </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma is often influenced by circumstances: beneficent and
    malevolent forces act to counter and to support this self-operating law. These other
    forces that either aid or hinder this kamma are birth, time or conditions, appearances,
    and effort. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A favorable birth (<i>gati sampatti</i>) or an unfavorable
    birth (<i>vipatti)</i> can develop or hinder the fruition of kamma. For instance, if a
    person is born to a noble family or in a state of happiness, his fortunate birth will
    provide an easy opportunity for his good kamma to operate. An unintelligent person who, by
    some good kamma, is born in a royal family, will, on account of his noble parentage be
    honored by the people. If the same person were to have a less fortunate birth, he would
    not be similarly treated. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Good appearance (upadhi sampatti) and poor appearance
    (upadhi vipatti)are two other factors that hinder or favor the working of kamma. If by
    some good kamma, a person obtains a good birth, but is born deformed by some bad kamma,
    then he will not be able to fully enjoy the beneficial results of his good kamma. Even a
    legitimate heir to a throne may not perhaps be raised to that high position if he happens
    to be physically or mentally deformed. Beauty, on the other hand, will be an asset to the
    possessor. A good-looking son of poor parents may attract the attention of others and may
    be able to distinguish himself through their influence. Also, we can find cases of people
    from poor, obscure family backgrounds who rise to fame and popularity as film actors or
    actresses or beauty queens. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Time and occasion are other factors that influence the
    working of kamma. In the time of famine or during the time of war, all people without
    exception are forced to suffer the same fate. Here the unfavorable conditions open up
    possibilities for evil kamma to operate. The favorable conditions, on the other hand, will
    prevent the operation of bad kamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Effort or intelligence is perhaps the most important of
    all the factors that affect the working of kamma. Without effort, both worldly and
    spiritual progress is impossible. If a person makes no effort to cure himself of a disease
    or to save himself from his difficulties, or to strive with diligence for his progress,
    then his evil kamma will find a suitable opportunity to produce its due effects. However,
    if he endeavours to surmount his difficulties, his good kamma will come to help him. When
    shipwrecked in a deep sea, the<i> Bodhisatta </i>during one of his previous births, made
    an effort to save himself and his old mother, while the others prayed to the gods and left
    their fate in the hands of these gods. The result was that the Bodhisatta escaped while
    the others were drowned. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the working of kamma is aided or obstructed by birth,
    beauty and ugliness, time and personal effort or intelligence. However, man can overcome
    immediate karmic effects by adopting certain methods. Yet, he is not free from such karmic
    effects if he remains within this<i> Samsara</i><font>?cycle of birth and death. Whenever
    opportunities arise the same karmic effects that he overcame, can affect him again. This
    is the uncertainty of worldly life. Even the Buddha and Arahantas were affected by certain
    kammas, although they were in their final birth.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The time factor is another important aspect of the karmic
    energy for people to experience the good and bad effects. People experience certain karmic
    effects only within this lifetime while certain karmic effects become effective
    immediately hereafter the next birth. And certain other karmic effects follow the doers as
    long as they remain in this wheel of existence until they stop their rebirth after
    attaining <i>Nibbana</i>. The main reason for this difference is owing to mental impulsion
    (Javana Citta) of the people at the time when a thought arises in the mind to do good or
    bad. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Impartial Energy </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who do not believe that there is an energy known as
    kamma should understand that this karmic energy is not a by-product of any particular
    religion although Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism acknowledge and explain the nature of
    this energy. This is an existing universal law which has no religious label. All those who
    violate this law, have to face the consequences irrespective of their religious beliefs,
    and those who live in accordance with this law experience peace and happiness in their
    life. Therefore, this karmic law is unbiased to each and every person, whether they
    believe it or not; whether, they have a religion or not. It is like any other existing
    universal law. Please remember that <i>kamma</i> is not the exclusive property of
    Buddhism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we understand kamma as a force or a form of energy,
    then we can discern no beginning. To ask where is the beginning of kamma is like asking
    where is the beginning of electricity. Kamma like electricity does not begin. It comes
    into being under certain conditions. Conventionally we say that the origin of kamma is
    volition but this is as much conventional as saying that the origin of a river is a
    mountain top. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Like the waves of the ocean that flow into one another ,
    one unit of consciousness flows into another and this merging of one thought consciousness
    into another is called the working of karma. In short, every living being, according to
    Buddhism, is an electricity current of life that operates on the automatic switch of
    kamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma being a form of energy is not found anywhere in this
    fleeting consciousness or body. Just as mangoes are not stored anywhere in the mango tree
    but, dependent on certain conditions, they spring into being, so does kamma. Kamma is like
    wind or fire. It is not stored up anywhere in the Universe but comes into being under
    certain conditions.&nbsp; </font></p>
