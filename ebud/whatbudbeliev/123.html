    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The enlightenment of the Buddha is not a product of
      mere intellect.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">D</font><font face="Times New Roman">uring the
    time of the Buddha there were many learned men in India who pursued knowledge simply for
    its own sake. These people were full of theoretical knowledge. Indeed, some of them went
    from city to city challenging anyone to a debate and their greatest thrill was to defeat
    an opponent in such verbal combats. But the Buddha said that such people were no nearer to
    the realization of the truth because in spite of their cleverness and knowledge they did
    not have true wisdom to overcome greed, hatred and delusion. In fact, these people were
    often proud and arrogant. Their egoistic concepts disturbed the religious atmosphere. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>According to the Buddha, one must first seek to
    understand one's own mind. This was to be done through concentration which gives one a
    profound inner wisdom or realization. And this insight is to be gained not by
    philosophical argument or worldly knowledge but by the silent realization of the illusion
    of the Self.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is a righteous way of life for the peace and
    happiness of every living being. It is a method to get rid of miseries and to find
    liberation. The Teachings of the Buddha are not limited to one nation or race. It is
    neither a creed nor a mere faith. It is a Teaching for the entire universe. It is a
    Teaching for all time. Its objectives are selfless service, good-will, peace, salvation
    and deliverance from suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Salvation in Buddhism is an individual affair. You have to
    save yourself just as you have to eat, drink and sleep by yourself. The advice rendered by
    the Buddha points the Way to liberation; but His advice was never intended to be taken as
    a theory or philosophy. When He was questioned as to what theory He propounded, the Buddha
    replied that He preached no theories and whatever he did preach was a result of His own
    experience. Thus His Teaching does not offer any theory. Theory cannot bring one nearer to
    spiritual perfection. Theories are the very fetters that bind the mind and impede
    spiritual progress. The Buddha said, <font>'Wise men give no credence to passing theories.
    They are past believing everything they see and hear.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Theories are product of the intellect and the Buddha
    understood the limitations of the human intellect. He taught that enlightenment is not a
    product of mere intellect. One cannot achieve emancipation by taking an intellectual
    course. This statement may seem irrational but it is true. Intellectuals tend to spend too
    much of their valuable time in study, critical analysis and debate. They usually have
    little or no time for practice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A great thinker(philosopher, scientist, metaphysician,
    etc.) can also turn out to be an intelligent fool. He may be an intellectual giant endowed
    with the power to perceive ideas quickly and to express thoughts clearly. But if he pays
    no attention to his action and their consequences, and if he is only bent on fulfilling
    his own longings and inclinations at any cost then, according to the Buddha, he is an
    intellectual fool, a man of inferior intelligence. Such a person will indeed hinder his
    won spiritual progress. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Buddha's Teaching contains practical wisdom that
    cannot be limited to theory or to philosophy because philosophy deals mainly with
    knowledge but it is not concerned with translating the knowledge into day-to-day
    practices.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism lays special emphasis on practice and
    realization. The philosopher sees the miseries and disappointments of life but, unlike the
    Buddha, he offers no practical solution to overcome our frustrations which are part of the
    unsatisfactory nature of life. The philosopher merely pushes his thoughts to dead ends.
    Philosophy is useful because it has enriched our intellectual imagination and diminished
    dogmatic assurance which closes the mind to further progress. To that extent, Buddhism
    values philosophy, but it has failed to quench spiritual thirst. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Remember that the chief aim of a Buddhist is to
    attain purity and enlightenment. Enlightenment vanquishes ignorance which is the root of
    birth and death. However, this vanquishing of ignorance cannot be achieved except by the
    exercise of one's confidence. All other attempts, especially mere intellectual attempts
    are not very effective. This is why the Buddha concluded: 'These [metaphysical]questions
    are not calculated to profit; they are not concerned with the Dhamma; they do not lead to
    right conduct, or to detachment, or to purification from lusts, or to quietude, or to a
    calm heart, or to real knowledge, or to higher insight, or to Nibbana.' (<i>Malunkyaputta
    Sutta </i>- <em>Majjhima Nikaya</em>) In place of metaphysical speculation, the Buddha was
    more concerned with teaching a practical understanding of the Four Noble Truths that he
    discovered: what Suffering is: what the origin of Suffering is; what the cessation of
    Suffering is; how to overcome Suffering and realize final Salvation. These Truths are all
    practical matters to be fully understood and realized by anyone who really experiences
    emancipation.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Enlightenment is the dispelling of ignorance; it is the
    ideal of the Buddhist life. We can now clearly see that enlightenment is not an act of the
    intellect. Mere speculation has something alien to it and does not come so intimately into
    contact with life. This is why the Buddha placed great emphasis on personal experience.
    Meditation is a practical scientific system to verify the Truth that comes through
    personal experience. Through meditation, the will tries to transcend the condition it has
    put on itself, and this is the awakening of consciousness. Metaphysics merely ties us down
    in a tangled and matted mass of thoughts and words. </font></p>
