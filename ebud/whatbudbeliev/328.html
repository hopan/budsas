    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>'People ridicule the superstitions of others, while
      cherishing their own.'</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">A</font>ll ailments have cures but not
    superstitions. And if for some reason or other, any superstition crystallizes into a
    religion, it easily becomes an almost incurable malady. In the performance of certain
    religious functions, even educated people of today forget their human dignity to accept
    the most ridiculous, superstitious beliefs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Superstitious beliefs and rituals were adopted to
    decorate a religion in order to attract the multitude. But after sometime, the creeper
    which is planted to decorate the shrine as it were, outgrows and outshines the shrine,
    with the result that religious tenets are relegated to the background and superstitious
    beliefs and rituals become predominant?the creeper eclipsing the shrine.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Like superstition dogmatic belief also chokes the healthy
    growth of religion. Dogmatic belief and intolerance go hand-in-hand. One is reminded of
    the Middle Ages with its pitiless inquisitions, cruel murders, violence, infamy, tortures
    and burning of innocent beings. One is also reminded of the barbaric and ruthless
    crusades. All these events were stimulated by dogmatic beliefs in religious authority and
    the intolerance resulting therefrom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Before the development of scientific knowledge,
    ignorant people had many superstitious beliefs. For example a lot of people believed that
    the eclipse of the sun and moon brought bad luck and pestilence. Today we know that such
    beliefs are not true. Again some unscrupulous religionists encourage people to believe in
    superstitions so that they can make use of their followers for their own 'benefit'. When
    people have truly purified their minds of ignorance, they will see the universe as it
    really is and they will not suffer from superstition and dogmatism. This is the
    'salvation' that Buddhists aspire to.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is extremely difficult for us to break up the emotional
    feeling that is attached to superstition or dogmatic belief. Even the light of scientific
    knowledge is often not strong enough to cause us to give up the misconceptions. For
    example, we have noticed for generations that the earth moves round the sun; but
    experientially we still behold the sun rising, moving across the sky, and setting in the
    evening. We still have to make an intellectual leap to imagine that we are, in fact,
    hurtling at great speed around the sun. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We must understand that the dangers of dogmatism and
    superstition go hand-in-hand with religion. The time has come for wise people to separate
    religion from dogmatism and superstition. Otherwise, the good name of religion will be
    polluted and the number of non-believers will be increased, as they have already. </font></p>
