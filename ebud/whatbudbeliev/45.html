    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>'I am not the first Buddha to come upon this earth; nor
      shall I be the last. Previously, there were many Buddhas who appeared in this world. In
      due time, another Buddha will arise in this world, within this world cycle.'</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>hen the Buddha was about to pass
    away, Ven. Ananda and many other disciples wept. The Buddha said, 'Enough, Ananda. Do not
    allow yourself to be troubled. Do not weep. Have I not already told you that it is in the
    very nature of things that they must pass away. We must be separated from all that is near
    and dear to us. The foolish man conceives his idea of Self; the wise man sees there is no
    ground on which to build the Self. Thus the wise man has a right conception of the world.
    He will conclude that all component things will be dissolved again; but the Truth will
    always remain.' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha continued:' Why should I preserve this body
    when the body of the excellent law will endure? I am resolved. I have accomplished my
    purpose and have attended to the work set upon me. Ananda, for a long time you have been
    very near to me in thoughts, words and acts of much love beyond all measure. You have done
    well, Ananda. Be earnest in effort and you too will soon be free from bondages! You will
    be free from sensuality, from delusion, and from ignorance.' Suppressing his tears, Ananda
    said to the Buddha, 'Who shall teach us when You are gone?' And the Buddha advised him to
    regard His Teaching as the Master. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha continued again:' I am not the first Buddha to
    come upon earth; nor shall I be the last. In due time, another Buddha will arise in this
    world, a Holy One, a Supremely Enlightened One, endowed with wisdom, in conduct
    auspicious, knowing the universe, an incomparable leader of men, a master of devas and
    men. He will reveal to you the same Eternal Truths which I have taught you. He will
    proclaim a religious life, wholly perfect and pure; such as I now proclaim.' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'How shall we know him?' asked Ananda. The Buddha replied,
    'He will be known as <i>Maitreya </i>which means kindness or friendliness.' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists believe that those people who at present are
    doing meritorious deeds by leading a religious life will have a chance to be reborn as
    human beings in the time of Maitreya Buddha and will obtain Nibbana identical with that of
    Gautama Buddha. In this way they will find salvation through the guidance of His Teaching.
    His Teaching will become a hope of the remote future for everybody. However, according to
    the Buddha devout religious people can gain this Nabbanic bliss at any time if they really
    work for it irrespective of whether a Buddha appears or not. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'<em>As long as my disciples lead a pure religious life,
      so long the world will never become empty of Arahantas.'&nbsp; - (Maha Parinibbana Sutta)</em></font></p>
