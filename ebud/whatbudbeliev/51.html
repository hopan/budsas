    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>hat is Buddhism? This question has
    puzzled many people who often inquire if Buddhism is a philosophy, a religion, or a way of
    life. The simple answer is that Buddhism is too vast and too profound to be neatly placed
    in any single category. Of course, Buddhism includes philosophy and religion and a way of
    life. But Buddhism goes beyond these categories. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The categories or labels given to Buddhism are like
    signboards to let the people know what is being presented. If we compare Buddhism to a
    medicine shop, it will be clear that the signboard on the medicine shop will not cure a
    person of his sickness. If the medicine is effective, then you can use it to heal yourself
    without being concerned as to the signboard that merely gives a label for the medicine.
    Likewise, if the Teaching of the Buddha is effective, then use it and do not be concerned
    about the label or signboard. Do not try to slip Buddhism into any single category or
    limit it under any signboard. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Different people live at different times and in different
    places have given different labels and interpretations to Buddhism. To some people,
    Buddhism might appear to be only a mass of superstitious practices. To another group of
    people, Buddhism might be a convenient label to be used for temporal gains. To another
    group, it is old fashioned. To yet another group, Buddhism will have significance as a
    system of thought for intellectuals only. To some others, it is a scientific discovery. To
    the pious and devout Buddhist, Buddhism means his entire life, the fulfillment of all he
    holds near and dear to him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Some intellectuals see Buddhism as a product of its
    Indian environment or as an outgrowth of another kind of Indian religious teaching.
    Buddhism is nothing but the Noble Truth. It is an intellectual approach to reality. The
    Buddha's realization of universal problems did not come through a purely intellectual or
    rational process but through mental development and purification. The intellectual stance
    reminiscent of the scientific attitude, surely makes the Buddha absolutely unique among
    religious teachers of all time. Of course, the high standard of intellectual inquiry and
    ethical endeavor prevailing at the time in India were prime conditions for the
    re-emergence of the light of the Dhamma from the darkness of oblivion. Thousands of years
    of religious and philosophical development had left on the intellectual soil of India a
    rich and fertile deposit of ideas and ideals which formed the best possible environment
    into which the seed of the Dhamma could fall. Greece, China, Egypt and Babylonia, for all
    their loftiness of thought, had not attained the same quality of vision as the forest and
    mountain-dwelling sages of India. The germ of Enlightenment which had been borne, like a
    winged seed from distant fields, from worlds in space and time infinitely remote from ours
    _ this very germ of Enlightenment found growth and development in the north-eastern corner
    of India. This very germ of Enlightenment found its full expression in the experience of
    the man, Gautama Buddha. The fountainhead of all Buddhism is this experience which is
    called 'Enlightenment'. With this experience of Enlightenment, the Buddha began His
    Teaching not with any dogmatic beliefs or mysteries, but with a valid, universal
    experience, which He gave to the world as universal truth. Therefore, the real definition
    of Buddhism is NOBLE TRUTH. Remember that the Buddha did not teach from theories. He
    always taught from a practical standpoint based on His understanding, His Enlightenment,
    and His realization of the Truth.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Buddhism began with the Truth embodied over 2500
    years ago in the person of Gautama, the Buddha. When the Buddha introduced His teachings,
    His intention was not to develop the concept of self in man's mind and create more
    ambition for eternal life and sense pleasure. Rather, His intention was to point out the
    futility of the worldly life and to show the correct, practical Path to salvation that He
    discovered.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The original Teachings of the Buddha disclosed the
    true nature of life and the world. However, a distinction must be made between the
    Buddha's original Teaching (often called the Dhamma or the Buddha Word) and the religion
    that developed based on His Teachings.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The Teachings of the Buddha not only started a
    religion, but inspired the blossoming of a whole civilization. These Teachings became a
    great civilizing force that moved through the history of many a culture and nation.
    Indeed, Buddhism has become one of the greatest civilizations that the world has ever
    known. It has a wonderful history of achievement in the fields of literature, art,
    philosophy, psychology, ethics, architecture and culture. In the course of centuries,
    countless social educational institutions were established in the various nations that
    were dedicated to the Buddha's Teaching. The history of Buddhism was written in golden
    letters of brotherhood and goodwill. The religious beliefs and practices turned into a
    rational, scientific and practical religious way of life for spiritual development from
    the day the Buddha preached His Teaching and realized the real purpose and meaning of a
    life and a religion.</font> </font></p>
