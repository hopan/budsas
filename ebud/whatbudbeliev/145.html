    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Man-made moral laws and customs do not form Buddhist
      Ethics.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he world today is in a state of
    turmoil; valuable ethics are being upturned. The forces of materialistic skepticism have
    turned their dissecting blades on the traditional concepts of what are considered humane
    qualities. Yet, any person who has a concern for culture and civilization will concern
    himself with practical, ethical issues. For ethics has to do with human conduct. It is
    concerned with our relationship with ourselves and with our fellow-men. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The need for ethics arises from the fact that man is not
    perfect by nature; he has to train himself to be good. Thus morality becomes the most
    important aspect of living. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist ethics are not arbitrary standards invented by
    man for his own utilitarian purpose. Nor are they arbitrarily imposed from without.
    Man-made laws and social customs do not form the basis of Buddhist ethics. For example,
    the styles of dress that are suitable for one climate, period or civilization may be
    considered indecent in another; but this is entirely a matter of social custom and does
    not in any way involve ethical considerations. Yet the artificialities of social
    conventions are continually confused with ethical principles that are valid and
    unchanging. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist ethics finds its foundation not on the changing
    social customs but rather on the unchanging laws of nature. Buddhist ethical values are
    intrinsically a part of nature, and the unchanging law of cause and effect (kamma). The
    simple fact that Buddhist ethics are rooted in natural law makes its principles both
    useful and acceptable to the modern world. The fact that the Buddhist ethical code was
    formulated over 2,500 years ago does not detract from its timeless character. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Morality in Buddhism is essentially practical in
    that it is only a means leading to the final goal of ultimate happiness. On the Buddhist
    path to Emancipation, each individual is considered responsible for his own fortunes and
    misfortunes. Each individual is expected to work his own deliverance by his understanding
    and effort. Buddhist salvation is the result of one's own moral development and can
    neither be imposed nor granted to one by some external agent. The Buddha's mission was to
    enlighten men as to the nature of existence and to advise them how best to act for their
    own happiness and for the benefit of others.</font> Consequently, Buddhist ethics are not
    founded on any commandments which men are compelled to follow. The Buddha advised men on
    the conditions which were most wholesome and conducive to long term benefit for self and
    others. Rather than addressing sinners with such words as <font>'shameful', 'wicked',
    'wretched', 'unworthy', and 'blasphemous' He would merely say, 'You are unwise in acting
    in such a way since this will bring sorrow upon yourselves and others.'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The theory of Buddhist ethics finds its practical
    expression in the various precepts. These precepts or disciplines are nothing but general
    guides to show the direction in which the Buddhist ought to turn to on his way to final
    salvation. Although many of these precepts are expressed in a negative form, we must not
    think that Buddhist morality, consists of abstaining from evil without the complement of
    doing good. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The morality found in all the precepts can be
    summarized in three simple principles?'To avoid evil; to do good, to purify the mind.'
    This is the advice given by all the Buddhas. --(<i>Dhammapada, 183</i>)</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhism, the distinction between what is good and what
    is bad is very simple: all actions that have their roots in greed, hatred, and delusion
    that spring from selfishness foster the harmful delusion of selfhood. These action are
    demeritorious or unskillful or bad. They are called <i>Akusala Kamma.</i> All those
    actions which are rooted in the virtues of generosity, love and wisdom, are meritorious --
    &nbsp; <i>Kusala Kamma</i>. The criteria of good and bad apply whether the actions are of
    thought, word or deed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="+1">Buddhist ethics are based on intention or
    volition</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>'Kamma is volition,' says the Buddha. Action
    themselves are considered as neither good nor bad but 'only the intention and thought
    makes them so.' Yet Buddhist ethics does not maintain that a person may commit what are
    conventionally regarded as 'sins' provided that he does so with the best of intentions.
    Had this been its position, Buddhism would have confined itself to questions of psychology
    and left the uninteresting task of drawing up lists of ethical rules and framing codes of
    conducts to less emancipated teachings. The connection between thoughts and deeds, between
    mental and material action is an extension of thought. It is not possible to commit murder
    with a good heart because taking of life is simply the outward expression of a state of
    mind dominated by hate or greed. Deeds are condensations of thoughts just as rain is a
    condensation of vapor. Deeds proclaim from the rooftops of action only what has already
    been committed in the silent and secret chambers of the heart.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A person who commits an immoral act thereby declares that
    he is not free from unwholesome states of mind. Also, a person who has a purified and
    radiant mind, who has a mind empty of all defiled thoughts and feelings, is incapable of
    committing immoral actions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Buddhist ethics also recognizes the objectivity of
    moral value. In other words, the kammic consequences of actions occur in accordance with
    natural kammic law, regardless of the attitude of the individual or regardless of social
    attitudes toward the act. For example, drunkenness has kammic consequences; it is evil
    since it promotes one's own unhappiness as well as the unhappiness of others. The kammic
    effects of drunkenness exist despite what the drunkard or his society may think about the
    habit of drinking. The prevailing opinions and attitudes do not in the least detract from
    the fact that drunkenness is objectively evil. The consequences -- psychological, social,
    and kammic -- make actions moral or immoral, regardless of the mental attitudes of those
    judging the act. Thus while ethical relativism is recognized, it is not considered as
    undermining the objectivity of values.</font> </font></p>
