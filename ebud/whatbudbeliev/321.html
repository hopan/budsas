    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>'Life is nothing but a dream.'</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>One of man's greatest unsolved problems is the
    mystery of dreams. From the very earliest of times man has tried to analyze dreams and has
    tried to explain them in prophetic and psychological terms, but while there has been some
    measure of success recently, we are probably no nearer the answers to the baffling
    question: 'What is a dream?'</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The great English Romantic poet William Wordsworth
    had a startling concept: that this life we live is merely a dream and that we will 'awake'
    to the 'real' reality when we die, when our 'dream' ends.</font> </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">'Our birth is but a sleep and forgetting:<br>
      The Soul, that rises with us, our life's star,<br>
      Hath had elsewhere its setting,<br>
      And cometh from afar.<font>'</font></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A similar concept is expressed in a charming old Buddhist
    tale which tells of a deva who was playing with some other devas. Being tired, he lay down
    to take a short nap and passed away. He was reborn as a girl on earth. There she got
    married, had a few children and lived to be very old. After her death again she was born
    as a deva amongst the same companions who had just finished playing their game. (This
    story also illustrates the world is very different from time in another plane of
    existence). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What has Buddhism to say about dreams? Just as in every
    other culture, Buddhism has had its fair share of people who claimed to be skilled in
    interpreting dreams. Such people earn a lot of money exploiting the ignorance of men and
    women who believe that every dream has a spiritual or prophetic significance. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhist psychology dreams are ideational
    processes which occur as activities of the mind. In considering the occurrence of dreams
    it is relevant to remember that the process of sleeping can be regarded as falling into
    five stages. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- drowsiness,<br>
      - light slumber,<br>
      - deep slumber,<br>
      - light slumber and<br>
      - awakening.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">The significance and the cause of dreams were
    the subject of discussion in the famous book 'Milinda Panha' or 'The Questions of King
    Milinda', in which Ven. Nagasena has stated that there are six causes of dreams, three of
    them being organic, wind, bile and phlegm. The fourth is due to the intervention of
    supernatural forces, fifth, revival of past experience and sixth, the influence of future
    events. It is categorically stated that dreams occur only in light slumber which is said
    to be like the sleep of the monkey. Of the six causes given Ven. Nagasena has stated
    positively that the last, namely prophetic dreams are the only important ones and the
    others are relatively insignificant. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dreams are mind-created phenomena and they are activities
    of the mind. All human beings dream, although some people cannot remember. Buddhism
    teaches that some dreams have psychological significance. The six causes mentioned earlier
    can also be classified in the following manner: </font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Every single thought that is created is stored in
    our subconscious mind and some of them strongly influence the mind according to our
    anxieties. When we sleep, some of these thoughts are activated and appear to us as
    'pictures' moving before us. This happens because during sleep, the five senses which
    constitute our contact with the outside world, are temporarily arrested. The subconscious
    mind then is free to become dominant and to 're-play' thoughts that are stored. These
    dreams may be of value to psychiatry but cannot be classified as prophetic. They are
    merely the reflections of the mind at rest.</font></font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">The second type of dream also has no significance.
    These are caused by internal and external provocations which set off a train of 'visual
    thoughts' which are 'seen' by the mind at rest. Internal factors are those which disturb
    the body (e.g. a heavy meal which does not allow one to have a restful slumber or
    imbalance and friction between elements that constitute the body). External provocation is
    when the mind is disturbed(although the sleeper may be unaware of it) by natural phenomena
    like the weather, wind, cold, rain, leaves rustling, windows rattling etc. The
    subconscious mind reacts to these disturbances and creates pictures to 'explain' them
    away. The mind accommodates the irritation in a seemingly rational way so that the dreamer
    can continue to sleep undisturbed. These dreams too have no importance and need no
    interpretation.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then there are prophetic dreams. These are important. They
    are seldom experienced and only when there is an impending event which is of great
    relevance to the dreamer. Buddhism teaches that besides the tangible world we can
    experience, there are devas who exist on another plane or some spirits who are bound to
    this earth and are invisible to us. They could be our relatives or friends who have passed
    away and who have been reborn. They maintain their former mental relationships and
    attachments to us. When Buddhists transfer merits to devas and departed ones, they
    remember them and invite them to share the happiness accrued in the merit. Thus they
    develop a mental relationship with their departed ones. The devas in turn are pleased and
    they keep a watch over us and indicate something in dreams when we are facing certain big
    problems and they try to protect us from harm.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, when there is something important that is going to
    happen in our lives they activate certain mental energies in our minds which are seen as
    dreams. These dreams can warn of impending danger or even prepare us for sudden
    over-whelming good news. These messages are given in symbolic terms (much like the
    negatives of photographs) and have to be interpreted skillfully and with intelligence.
    Unfortunately too many people confuses the first two kinds of dreams with these and end up
    wasting valuable time and money consulting fake mediums and dream-interpreters. The Buddha
    was aware that this could be exploited for personal gain and He therefore warned the monks
    against practising soothsaying, astrology and interpreting dreams in the name of Buddhism.
    </font></p>
    <font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, our mind is the depository of all kammic
    energies accumulated in the past. Sometimes, when a kamma is about to ripen (that is, when
    the action we did in a previous life or early part of our life, is going to experience its
    reaction) the mind which is at rest during sleep can trigger off a 'picture' of what is
    going to happen. Again the impending action has to be of great importance and must be so
    strongly charged that the mind 'releases' the extra energy in the form of a vivid dream.
    Such dreams occur only very rarely and only to certain people with a special kind of
    mental make up. The sign of the effect of certain kammas also appears in our minds at the
    last moment when we are going to depart from this world.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dreams can occur when two living human beings send strong
    mental telepathic messages to each other. When one person has an intense desire to
    communicate with another, he concentrates strongly on the message and the person with whom
    he wishes to communicate. When the mind is at rest, it is in an ideal state to receive
    these messages which are seen as dreams. Usually these dreams only appear in one intense
    moment because the human mind is not strong enough to sustain such messages over a long
    period of time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All worldlings are dreamers, and they see as permanent,
    what is essentially impermanent. They do not see that youth ends in old age, beauty in
    ugliness, health in sickness, and life itself in death. In this dream-world, what is truly
    without substance is seen as reality. Dreaming during sleep is but another dimension of
    the dream-world. The only ones who are awake are the Buddhas and Arahats as they have seen
    reality. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhas and Arahants never dream. The first three kinds of
    dream cannot occur in their minds, because their minds have been permanently <font>'stilled'
    and cannot be activated to dream. The last kind of dream cannot happen to them because
    they have eradicated all their craving energy completely, and there is no 'residual'
    energy of anxiety or unsatisfied desire to activate the mind to produce dreams. The Buddha
    is also known as the Awakened One because His way of relaxing the physical body is not the
    way we sleep which results in dreams. Great artists and thinkers, like the German Goethe,
    have often said they get some of their best inspiration through dreams. This could be
    because when their minds are cut off from the five senses during sleep, they produce clear
    thoughts which are creative in the highest degree. Wordsworth meant the same thing when he
    said that good poetry results from 'powerful emotions' recollected in tranquillity</font>.
