    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font FACE="Times New Roman">he first
    edition of this book came into being in 1964 as a result of questions posed by devotees to
    the Venerable Author in the course of his delivering a prolonged series of Dhamma talks
    throughout the length and breadth of Malaysia. He felt that a book of this nature should
    serve as a handy reference book for Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike, presenting in
    simplified form the beliefs and concepts of Buddhism, and also Buddhist attitude towards
    other beliefs.</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">It is ironical but true that there are people who profess
    this religion and who even claim to be Buddhist leaders, and yet lack the knowledge of the
    basic principles of Buddhism. Many of them are well-versed with certain rites and rituals
    but they do not understand the essence of the Master's Teaching. Ignoring the noble
    Teachings, they have introduced many baseless beliefs and ill-founded traditions, making a
    mockery of a rational and gentle religion. As a result, many people concerned themselves
    more with the devotional and ritualistic aspects of Buddhism whilst paying scant attention
    to true spiritual development which leads to wisdom and understanding.</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">This is a sad state of affairs brought about by some
    selfish and misguided religious workers. Driven by ignorance and goaded by mercenary ends,
    some people have blemished Buddhism as a religion and given the impression that it
    encourages superstitious beliefs and dependence on charms and omens. Even some monks have
    lowered themselves to the status of charm peddlers.</font> </p>
    <p><font><font FACE="Times New Roman">It is ironic that many people do not even know the
    name of the religion they belong to. There are some who say 'I think I am a Buddhist'</font>
    <font FACE="Times New Roman">This shows the extent to which they have neglected the
    Buddhist way of life. Such ignorance of the sublime teachings has encouraged unscrupulous
    missionaries from other religions to ridicule Buddhism with false accusations and
    misinterpretation. As a result, Buddhists being ignorant of their own Teachings and unable
    to refute the false allegations, fall easy prey to the snares of conversion.</font></font>
    </p>
    <p><font><font FACE="Times New Roman">It is partly with a view to countering such
    ignorance that the book 'What Buddhists Believe'</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">came
    into being. This book is intended mainly for those who have a genuine desire to know
    something about the basic Teachings as well as the more difficult aspects of the religion
    explained in a manner which can be understood in a modern context and without prior
    knowledge of the subject. The popularity of this book has gone beyond our expectations. It
    was revised and expanded in 1973 and again in 1982. The demand for this book continues.
    Chinese, Korean and Indonesian translations of this book are also available.</font></font>
    </p>
    <p><font><font FACE="Times New Roman">This year 1987, being the 25<sup>th</sup>
    Anniversary of the formation of the Buddhist Missionary Society, it was decided that 'What
    Buddhists Believe' should be further revised and enhanced as a 'Special Commemorative
    Issue'</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">to celebrate the Silver Jubilee Year of our
    Society. In this connection, the Venerable Author, with over forty years experience as a
    missionary, has spent much time on extensive research and compiling suitable new chapters
    to make the 1987 Reprint of 'What Buddhists Believe' as the Book for all those who seek
    knowledge about what Buddhism is.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font><font FACE="Times New Roman">In keeping with the original aim of this book, it is
    to be emphasized that the Ven. Author has no intention whatsoever to denigrate or belittle
    the beliefs and practices of other religionists and other Buddhist schools of thought. He
    has repeatedly stressed the Buddha's injunctions in the<i> Kalama Sutta</i> to His
    followers to be open-minded and rational in accepting any teaching. The Buddha in His time
    never ridiculed the practices and beliefs of other religionists then prevailing but He
    expounded the truth. It is also not the aim of this book to seek converts, because such a
    spirit is alien to the spirit of Buddhism. What it does aim at must be reiterated to
    inform and educate Buddhists about the basic tenets of their religion and to demonstrate
    its lofty ideals, making every Buddhist proud to be called a Buddhist. 'What Buddhists
    Believe'</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">aims at enlightening others about the
    pristine Teachings so that with greater and wider understanding they will be good and kind
    enough to refrain from castigating this Noble Religion which is serving and guiding
    millions of people to the Right Path.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha's Teaching is the greatest heritage that man
    has received from the past. The Buddha's message of non-violence and peace, of love and
    compassion, of tolerance and understanding, of truth and wisdom, of respect and regard for
    all life, of freedom from selfishness, hatred and violence, delivered over two thousand
    five hundred years ago, stands good for today and will stand forever as the Truth. It is
    an eternal message.</font> </p>
    <p><font><font FACE="Times New Roman">We are in a world torn by strife. The Buddha taught
    that we must develop the 'Bodhi'</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">heart of wisdom, a
    heart of love, a heart of understanding, to overcome the prevailing vices which have
    plagued man since the beginning of time. 'Overcome anger by non-anger, overcome hatred by
    love'. Are we practising the advice given by Him? </font></font>We are responsible for our
    destiny. We have to cleanse our hearts, scrutinize our own natures and determine to
    practise the Teachings not only in the letter but, more importantly, in the spirit. It is
    to be hoped that this publication of '<font><font FACE="Times New Roman">What Buddhists
    Believe'</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">will help in guiding many of our Buddhist
    friends to tread the true path towards Enlightenment.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">As the President of the Buddhist Missionary Society, it
    has been an honour and a pleasure for me to have been closely associated with Venerable
    Dr. K. Sri Dhammananda, the author, in the production of this book.</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">I wish to express our sincere thanks and appreciation to
    Mr. Victor Wee and Mr. Vijaya Samarawickrama for assisting the author in editing the book
    and for their many useful suggestions which helped to bring the book to its present form.
    I also like to thank Mrs. Chong Hong Choo who had spent endless hours looking after the
    innumerable details in the production of the book, from its inception right to its
    completion. Thanks are also due to Mr. H.A. de Silva, Misses Lily See, Lee Lai Fong, Quah
    Pin Pin, Leong Poh Chwee, Tan Kuee Fong and Low Mei Ying for the typing work involved and
    proof reading, without whose assistance the present book is not possible.</font> <dl>
