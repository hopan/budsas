    life? </font></h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Man is the highest fruit on the tree of evolution. It
      is for man to realize his position in nature and understand the true meaning of his life.</i>
      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>o know the purpose of life, you
    will first have to study the subject through your experience and insight. Then, you will
    discover for yourself the true meaning of life. Guidelines can be given, but you must
    create the necessary conditions for the arising of realization yourself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are several prerequisites to the discovery of the
    purpose of life. First, you must understand the nature of man and the nature of life.
    Next, you keep your mind calm and peaceful through the adoption of a religion. When these
    conditions are met, the answer you seek will come like the gentle rain from the sky. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="+1">Understanding the nature of man</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Man may be clever enough to land on the moon and discover
    wondrous things in the universe, but he has yet to delve into the inner workings of his
    own mind. He has yet to learn how his mind can be developed to its fullest potential so
    that its true nature can be realized. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As yet, man is still wrapped in ignorance. He does not
    known who he really is or what is expected of him. As a result, he misinterprets
    everything and acts on that misinterpretation. Is it not conceivable that our entire
    civilization is built on the misinterpretation? The failure to understand his existence
    leads him to assume a false identity of a bloated, self-seeking egoist, and to pretend to
    be what he is not or is unable to be. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Man must make an effort to overcome ignorance to arrive at
    realization and Enlightenment. All great men are born as human beings from the womb, but
    they worked their way up to greatness. Realization and Enlightenment cannot be poured into
    the human heart like water into a tank. Even the Buddha had to cultivate His mind to
    realize the real nature of man. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Man can be enlightened _a Buddha?if he wakes up from
    the 'dream' that is created by his own ignorant mind, and becomes fully awakened. He must
    realize that what he is today is the result of an untold number of repetitions in thoughts
    and actions. He is not ready-made: he is continually in the process of becoming, always
    changing. And it is in this characteristic of change that his future lies, because it
    means that it is possible for him to mould his character and destiny through the choice of
    his actions, speech and thoughts. Indeed, he becomes the thoughts and actions that he
    chooses to perform. Man is the highest fruit on the tree of evolution. It is for man to
    realize his position in nature and to understand the true meaning of his life.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="+1">Understanding the nature of life</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Most people dislike facing the true facts of life
    and prefer to lull themselves into a false sense of security by sweet dreaming and
    imagining. They mistake the shadow for the substance. They fail to realize that life is
    uncertain, but that death is certain. One way of understanding life is to face and
    understand death which is nothing more than a temporary end to a temporary existence. But
    many people do not like even to hear of the word 'death'. They forget that death will
    come, whether they like it or not. Recollections on death with the right mental attitude
    can give a person courage and calmness as well as an insight into the nature of existence.</font>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Besides understanding death, we need a better
    understanding of our life. We are living a life that does not always proceed as smoothly
    as we would like it to. Very often, we face problems and difficulties. We should not be
    afraid of them because the penetration into the very nature of these problems and
    difficulties can provide us with a deeper insight into life. The worldly happiness in
    wealth, luxury, respectable positions in life which most people seek is an illusion. The
    fact that the sale of sleeping pills and tranquilizers, admissions to mental hospital and
    suicide rates have increased in relation to modern material progress is enough testimony
    that we have to go beyond worldly, material pleasure to seek for real happiness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="+1">The need for a religion</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>To understand the real purpose of life, it is
    advisable for a person to choose and follow an ethical-moral system that restrains a
    person from evil deeds, encourages him to do good, and enables him to purify his mind. For
    simplicity, we shall call this system 'religion'.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Religion is the expression of the striving man: it
    is his greatest power, leading him onwards to self-realization. It has the power to
    transform one with negative characteristics into someone with positive qualities. It turns
    the ignoble, noble; the selfish, unselfish; the proud, humble; the haughty, forbearing;
    the greedy, benevolent; the cruel, kind; the subjective, objective. Every religion,
    represents, however imperfectly, a reaching upwards to a higher level of being. From the
    earliest times, religion has been the source of man's artistic and cultural inspiration.
    Although many forms of religion had come into being in the course of history, only to pass
    away and be forgotten, each one in its time had contributed something towards the sum of
    human progress. Christianity helped to civilize the West, and the weakening of its
    influence has marked a downward trend of the Occidental spirit</font>. Buddhism, which
    civilized the greater part of the East long before, is still a vital force, and in this
    age of scientific knowledge is likely to extend and to strengthen its influence. It does
    not, at any point, come into conflict with modern knowledge, but embraces and transcends
    all of it in a way that no other system of thought has ever done before or is ever likely
    to do. Western man seeks to conquer the universe for material ends. Buddhism and Eastern
    philosophy strive to attain harmony with nature or spiritual satisfaction. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Religion teaches a person how to calm down the senses and
    make the heart and mind peaceful. The secret of calming down the senses is to eliminate
    desire which is the root of our disturbances. It is very important for us to have
    contentment. The more people crave for their property, the more they have to suffer.
    Property does not give happiness to man. Most of the rich people in the world today are
    suffering from numerous physical and mental problems. With all the money they have, they
    cannot buy a solution to their problems. Yet, the poorest men who have learnt to have
    contentment may enjoy their lives far more than the richest people do. As one rhyme goes: </font><dir>
      <dir>
        <dir>
          <blockquote ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
            <font><p></font><font face="Times New Roman">'Some have too much and yet do crave<br>
            I have little and seek no more;<br>
            They are but poor though much more they have<br>
            And I am rich with little store.<br>
            They poor, I rich, they beg, I give;<br>
            <font>They lack, I have; they pine, I live.'</font></font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </dir>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <font SIZE="+1"><p></font><font face="Times New Roman" SIZE="+1">Searching for a purpose
    in life</font><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The aim in life varies among individuals. An artist may
    aim to paint masterpieces that will live long after he is gone. A scientist may want to
    discover some laws, formulate a new theory, or invent a new machine. A politician may wish
    to become a prime minister or a president. A young executive may aim to be a managing
    director of multinational company. However, when you ask the artist, scientist, politician
    and the young executive why they aim such, they will reply that these achievements will
    give them a purpose in life and make them happy. Everyone aims for happiness in life, yet
    experience shows time and again that its attainment is so elusive. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="+1">Realization</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Once we realize the nature of life (characterized by
    unsatisfactoriness, change, and egolessness) as well as the nature of man's greed and the
    means of getting them satisfied, we can then understand the reason why the happiness so
    desperately sought by many people is so elusive like catching a moon beam in their hands.
    They try to gain happiness through accumulation. When they are not successful in
    accumulating wealth, gaining position, power and honour, and deriving pleasure from sense
    satisfaction, they pine and suffer, envying others who are successful in doing so.
    However, even if they are 'successful' in getting these things, they suffer as well
    because they now fear losing what they have gained, or their desires have now increased
    for more wealth, higher position, more power, and greater pleasure. Their desires can
    never seem to be completely satiated. This is why an understanding of life is important so
    that we do not waste too much time doing the impossible.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>It is here that the adoption of a religion becomes
    important, since it encourages contentment and urges a person to look beyond the demands
    of his flesh and ego. In a religion like Buddhism, a person is reminded that he is the
    heir of his karma and the master of his destiny. In order to gain greater happiness, he
    must be prepared to forego sort-term pleasures. If a person does not believe in life after
    death, even then it is enough for him to lead a good, noble life on earth, enjoying a life
    of peace and happiness here and now, as well as performing actions which are for the
    benefit and happiness of others. Leading such a positive and wholesome life on earth and
    creating happiness for oneself and others is much better than a selfish life of trying to
    satisfy one's ego and greed.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If, however, a person believes in life after death, then
    according to the Law of Karma, rebirth will take place according to the quality of his
    deeds. A person who has done many good deeds may be born in favorable conditions where he
    enjoys wealth and success, beauty and strength, good health, and meets good spiritual
    friends and teachers. Wholesome deeds can also lead to rebirth in the heavens and other
    sublime states, while unwholesome deeds lead to rebirth in suffering states. When a person
    understands the Law of Karma, he will then make the effort to refrain from performing bad
    actions, and to try to cultivate the good. By so acting, he gains benefits not only in
    this life, but in many other lives to come. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>When a person understands the nature of man, then
    some important realizations arise. He realizes that unlike a rock or stone, a human being
    possesses the innate potential to grow in wisdom, compassion, and awareness?and be
    transformed by this self-development and growth. He also understands that it is not easy
    to be born as a human being, especially one who has the chance to listen to the Dhamma. In
    addition, he is fully aware that his life is impermanent, and he should, therefore, strive
    to practise the Dhamma while he is still in a position to do so. He realizes that the
    practice of Dhamma is a life-long educative process which enables him to release his true
    potentials trapped within his mind by ignorance and greed..</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Based on these realizations and understanding, he will
    then try to be more aware of what and how he thinks, speaks and acts. He will consider if
    his thoughts, speech and actions are beneficial, done out of compassion and have good
    effects for himself as well as others. He will realize the true value of walking the road
    that leads to complete self transformation, which is known to Buddhists as the Noble
    Eightfold path. This Path can help a person to develop his moral strength (<i>sila</i>)
    through the restraint of negative actions and the cultivation of positive qualities
    conductive for personal, mental and spiritual growth. In addition, it contains many
    techniques which a person can apply to purify his thoughts, expand the possibilities of
    the mind, and bring about a complete change towards a wholesome personality. This practice
    of mental culture (<i>bhavana</i>) can widen and deepen the mind towards all human
    experience, as well as the nature and characteristics of phenomena, life and the universe.
    In short, this leads to the cultivation of wisdom (<i>panna</i>). As his wisdom grows, so
    will his love, compassion, kindness, and joy. He will have greater awareness to all forms
    of life and better understanding of his own thoughts, feelings, and motivations. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the process of self-transformation, a person will no
    longer aspire for a divine birth as his ultimate goal in life. He will then set his goal
    much higher, and model himself after the Buddha who has reached the summit of human
    perfection and attained the ineffable state we call Enlightenment or <i>Nibbana.</i> It is
    here that a man develops a deep confidence in the Triple Gem and adopts the Buddha as his<i>
    spiritual ideal.</i> He will strive to eradicate greed, develop wisdom and compassion, and
    to be completely liberated from the bounds of<i> Samsara</i>. </font></p>
