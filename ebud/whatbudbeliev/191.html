      <i>With oneself well controlled the problem of looking for external savior is solved, --
      (Dhammapada 166)</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font><font size="6">A</font>s the Buddha was about to
    pass away, His disciples came from everywhere to be near Him. While the other disciples
    were constantly at His side and in deep sorrow over the expected loss of their Master, a
    monk named Attadatta went into his cell and practised meditation. The other monks,
    thinking that he was unconcerned about the welfare of the Buddha, were upset and reported
    the matter to Him. The monk, however, addressed the Buddha thus, 'Lord as the Blessed One
    would be passing away soon, I thought the best way to honour the Blessed One would be by
    attaining Arahantship during the lifetime of the Blessed One itself.' The Buddha was
    pleased by his attitude and his conduct and said that one's spiritual welfare should not
    be abandoned for the sake of others.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this story is illustrated one of the most important
    aspects of Buddhism. A person must constantly be on the alert to seek his own deliverance
    from Samsara, and his <font>'salvation' must be brought about by the individual himself.
    He cannot look to any external force or agency to help him to attain Nibbana.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>People who do not understand Buddhism criticize this
    concept and say that Buddhism is a selfish religion which only talks about the concern for
    one's own freedom from pain and sorrow. This is not true at all. The Buddha states clearly
    that one should work ceaselessly for the spiritual and material welfare of all beings,
    while at the same time diligently pursuing one's own goal of attaining Nibbana. Selfless
    service is highly commended by the Buddha.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Again, people who do not understand Buddhism may
    ask, 'It may be all right for the fortunate human beings, in full command of their mental
    powers, to seek Nibbana by their own efforts. But what about those who are mentally and
    physically or even materially handicapped? How can they be self-reliant? Do they not need
    the help of some external force, some god or deva to assist them?</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>The answer to this is that Buddhists do not believe
    that the final release must necessarily take place in one life time. The process can take
    a long time, over the period of many births. One has to apply oneself, to the best of
    one's ability, and slowly develop the powers of self reliance. Therefore, even those who
    are handicapped mentally, spiritually and materially must make an effort, however small,
    to begin the process of deliverance.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once the wheels are set in motion, the individual slowly
    trains himself to improve his powers of self-reliance. The tiny acorn will one day grow
    into a mighty oak, but not overnight. Patience is an essential ingredient in this
    difficult process. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>For example, we know from experience how many
    parents do everything in their power to bring up their children according to the parents'
    hopes and aspirations. And yet when these children grow up, they develop in their own way,
    not necessarily the way the parents wanted them to be. In Buddhism, we believe that while
    others can exert an influence on someone's life, the individual will in the end create his
    own kamma and be responsible for his own actions. No human being or deva can, in the final
    analysis, direct or control an individual's attainment of 'the ultimate salvation'. This
    is the meaning of self-reliance.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>This does not mean that Buddhism teaches one to be
    selfish. In Buddhism, when someone seeks, by his own effort, to attain Nibbana, he is
    determined not to kill, steal, tell lies, lust after others, or lose the control of his
    senses through intoxication. When he controls himself thus he automatically contributes to
    the happiness of others. So is not this so-called 'selfishness' a good thing for the
    general welfare of others?</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>On a more mundane level it has been asked how the
    lower forms of life can extricate themselves from a mere meaningless round of existence.
    Surely in that helpless state some benevolent external force is necessary to pull the
    unfortunate being from the quicksand. To answer this question we must refer to our
    knowledge of the evolution theory. It is clearly stated that life begin in very primitive
    forms?no more than a single cell floating in the water. Over millions of years these basic
    life forms evolved and became more complex, more intelligent. It is at this more
    intelligent level that life forms are capable of organization, independent thought,
    conceptualization and so on.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Buddhists talk about the ability to save oneself,
    they are referring to life forms at this higher level of mental development. In the
    earlier stages of evolution kammic and mental forces remain dormant, but over countless
    rebirths, a being raises itself to the level of independent thought and becomes capable of
    rational rather than instinctive behavior. It is at this state that the being becomes
    aware of the meaninglessness of undergoing endless rebirths with its natural concomitants
    of pain and sorrow. It is then that the being is capable of making its determination to
    end rebirth and seek happiness by gaining enlightenment and Nibbana. With this high level
    of intelligence, the individual is indeed capable of self-improvement and
    self-development. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We all know human beings are born with very varying levels
    of intelligence and powers of reasoning. Some are born as geniuses, while at the other end
    of the spectrum, others are born with very low intelligence. Yet every being has some
    ability to distinguish between choices or options, especially when they concern survival.
    If we extend this fact of survival even to the animal world we can distinguish between
    higher and lower animals, with this same ability (in varying degrees of course) to make
    choices for the sake of survival. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hence, even a lower form of life has the potential to
    create a good kamma, however limited its scope. With the diligent application of this and
    the gradual increase of good kamma a being can raise itself to higher levels of existence
    and understanding. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To look at this problem from another angle, we can
    consider one of the earliest stories that have been told to show how the Buddha-to-be
    first made the initial decision to strive for Enlightenment. A great many rebirths before
    the Buddha was born as Siddharta, he was born as an ordinary man. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day while traveling in a boat with his mother, a great
    storm arose and the boat capsized, throwing the occupants into the angry sea. With no
    thought for his personal safety, the future Buddha carried his mother on his back and
    struggled to swim to dry land. But so great was the expanse of water ahead of him that he
    did not know the best route to safety. When he was in this dilemma, not knowing which way
    to turn, his bravery was noticed by one of the devas. This deva could not physically come
    to his aid, but he was able to make the future Buddha know the best route to take. The
    young man listened to the deva and both he and his mother were saved. There and then he
    made a firm determination not to rest until he had finally gained Enlightenment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This story illustrates the fact that Buddhists can and do
    seek the help of devas in their daily life. A deva is a being who by virtue of having
    acquired great merit (like the king of the devas) is born with the power to help other
    beings. But this power is limited to material and physical things. In our daily existence,
    we can seek help of the devas (when misfortune strikes, when we need to be comforted, when
    we are sick or afraid, and so on). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fact that we seek the aid of these devas means that we
    are still tied to the material world. We must accept the fact that by being born we are
    subject to physical desires and needs. And it is not wrong to satisfy these needs on a
    limited scale. When the Buddha advocated the Middle Path, He said that we should neither
    indulge ourselves in luxury nor completely deny ourselves the basic necessities of life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, we should not stop at that. While we accept the
    conditions of our birth, we must also make every effort, by following the Noble Eightfold
    Path, to reach a level of development where we realize that attachment to the material
    world creates only pain and sorrow. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we develop our understanding over countless births, we
    crave less and less for the pleasures of the senses. It is at the stage that we become
    truly self-reliant. At this stage, the devas cannot help us anymore, because we are not
    seeking to satisfy our material needs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>A Buddhist who really understands the fleeting
    nature of the world practises detachment from material goods. He is not unduly attached to
    worldly goods. Therefore he shares these goods freely with those who are more unfortunate
    than he is -- he practises generosity. In this way again a Buddhist contributes to the
    welfare of others.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>When the Buddha gained Enlightenment as a result of
    His own efforts, He did not selfishly keep this knowledge to Himself. Rather, He spent no
    less than forty five years imparting His knowledge not only to men and women but even to
    the devas. This is Buddhism's supreme example of selflessness and concern for the
    well-being of all living things.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is often said that the Buddha helped devotees who were
    in trouble not through the performance of miracles such as restoring the dead to life and
    so on, but through His acts of wisdom and compassion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In one instance, a woman named Kisa Gotami went to seek
    the help of the Buddha in restoring her dead child to life. Knowing that He could not
    reason with her as she was so distressed and overwhelmed with grief, the Buddha told her
    that she should first obtain a handful of mustard seeds from a person who had never lost a
    dear one through death. The distracted woman ran from house to house and while everyone
    was only too willing to give her the mustard seeds, no one could honestly say that he or
    she had not lost a dear one through death. Slowly, Kisa Gotami came to the realization
    that death is a natural occurrence to be experienced by any being that is born. Filled
    with this realization she returned to the Buddha and thanked Him for showing her the truth
    about death. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font>Now, the point here is that the Buddha was more
    concerned with the woman's understanding about the nature of life than giving her
    temporary relief by restoring her child to life -- the child would have grown old and
    still have died. With her greater realization Kisa Gotami was able not only to come to
    terms with the phenomenon of death but also to learn about the cause of sorrow through
    attachment. She was able to realize that attachment causes sorrow, that when attachment is
    destroyed, then sorrow is also destroyed.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore in Buddhism, a person can seek the help of
    external agencies (like devas) in the pursuit of temporal happiness, but in the later
    stages of development when attachment to the worldly conditions ceases, there begins the
    path towards renunciation and enlightenment for which one must stand alone. When a man
    seeks to gain liberation, to break away from the endless cycle of birth and death, to gain
    realization and enlightenment, he can only do this by his own efforts, by his own
    concentrated will power. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism gives great dignity to man. It is the only
    religion which states that a human being has the power to help and free himself. In the
    later stages of his development, he is not at the mercy of any external force or agency
    which he must constantly please by worshipping or offering sacrifices. </font></p>
