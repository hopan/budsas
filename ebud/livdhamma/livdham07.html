    <td width="100%">&nbsp;<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>here are two ways
    to support Buddhism. One is known as <i>amisapuja,</i> supporting through material
    offerings. These are the four requisites of food, clothing, shelter and medicine. This is
    to support Buddhism by giving material offerings to the <i>Sangha</i> of monks and nuns,
    enabling them to live in reasonable comfort for the practice of Dhamma. This fosters the
    direct realization of the Buddha's teaching, in turn bringing continued prosperity to the
    Buddhist religion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism can be likened to a tree. A tree has roots, a
    trunk, branches, twigs and leaves. all the leaves and branches, including the trunk,
    depend on the roots to absorb nutriment from the soil and send it out to them. In the same
    way as the tree depends on the roots to sustain it, our actions and our speech are like
    &quot;branches&quot; and &quot;leaves,&quot; which depend on the mind, the
    &quot;root,&quot; absorbing nutriment, which it then sends it out to the
    &quot;trunk,&quot; &quot;branches&quot; and &quot;leaves.&quot; These in turn bear fruit
    as our speech and actions. whatever state the mind is in, skillful or unskillful, it
    expresses that quality outwardly through our actions and speech. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore the support of Buddhism through the practical
    application of the teaching is the most important kind of support. For example, in the
    ceremony of determining the precepts on observance days, the Teacher describes those
    unskillful actions which should be avoided. But if you simply go through the ceremony of
    determining the precepts without reflecting on their meaning, progress is difficult. You
    will be unable to find the true practice. The real support of Buddhism must therefore be
    done through <i>patipattipuja,</i> the &quot;offering&quot; of practice, cultivating true
    restraint, concentration and wisdom. Then you will know what Buddhism is all about. If you
    don't understand through practice you still won't know, even if you learn the whole
    Tipitaka. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the time of the Buddha there was a monk known as Tuccho
    Pothila. Tuccho Pothila was very learned, thoroughly versed in the scriptures and texts.
    He was so famous that he was revered by people everywhere and had eighteen monasteries
    under his care. When people heard the name &quot;Tuccho Pothila&quot; they were awe-struck
    and nobody would dare question anything he taught, so much did they revere his command of
    the teachings. Tuccho Pothila was one of the Buddha's most learned disciples. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day he went to pay respects to the Buddha. As he was
    paying his respects, the Buddha said, &quot;Ah, hello, Venerable Empty
    Scripture!&quot;...just like that! They conversed for a while until it was time to go, and
    then, as he was taking leave of the Buddha, the Buddha said, &quot;Oh, leaving now,
    Venerable Empty Scripture?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That was all the Buddha said. On arriving, &quot;Oh,
    hello, Venerable Empty Scripture.&quot; When it was time to go, &quot;Ah, leaving now,
    Venerable Empty Scripture?&quot; The Buddha didn't expand on it, that was all the teaching
    he gave. Tuccho Pothila, the eminent teacher, was puzzled, &quot; Why did the Buddha say
    that? What did he mean?&quot; He thought and thought, turning over everything he had
    learnt, until eventually he realized...&quot;It's true! &quot;Venerable Empty
    Scripture&quot; -- a monk who studies but doesn't practice.&quot; When he looked into his
    heart he saw that really he was no different from laypeople. Whatever they aspired to he
    also aspired to, whatever they enjoyed he also enjoyed. There was no real <i>samana</i> [<a
    name="14" href="#n14">14</a>] within him, no truly profound quality capable of firmly
    establishing him in the Noble Way and providing true peace. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So he decided to practice. But there was nowhere for him
    to go to. all the teachers around were his own students, no-one would dare accept him.
    Usually when people meet their teacher they become timid and deferential, and so no-one
    would dare to become his teacher. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally he went to see a certain young novice, who was
    enlightened, and asked to practice under him. The novice said, &quot;Yes, sure you can
    practice with me, but only if you're sincere. If you're not sincere then I won't accept
    you.&quot; Tuccho Pothila pledged himself as a student of the novice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The novice then told him to put on all his robes. Now
    there happened to be a muddy bog nearby. When Tuccho Pothila had neatly put on all his
    robes, expensive ones they were, too, the novice said, &quot;Okay, now run down into this
    muddy bog. If I don't tell you to stop, don't stop. If I don't tell you to come out, don't
    come out. Okay...run!&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tuccho Pothila, neatly robed, plunged into the bog. The
    novice didn't tell him to stop until he was completely covered in mud. Finally he said,
    &quot;You can stop, now.&quot; ... so he stopped. &quot;Okay, come on up!&quot;... and so
    he came out. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This clearly showed that Tuccho Pothila had given up his
    pride. He was ready to accept the teaching. If he wasn't ready to learn he wouldn't have
    run into the bog like that, being such a famous teacher, but he did it. The young novice,
    seeing this, knew that Tuccho Pothila was sincerely determined to practice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Tuccho Pothila had come out of the bog, the novice
    gave him the teaching. He taught him to observe the sense objects, to know the mind and to
    know the sense objects, using the simile of a man catching a lizard hiding in a termite
    mound. If the mound had six holes in it, How would he catch it? He would have to seal off
    five of the holes and leave just one open. Then he would have to simply watch and wait,
    guarding that one hole. When the lizard ran out he could catch it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Observing the mind is like this. Closing off the eyes,
    ears, nose, tongue and body, we leave only the mind. To &quot;close off&quot; the senses
    means to restrain and compose them, observing only the mind. Meditation is like catching
    the lizard. We use <i>sati</i> to note the breath. <i>Sati</i> is the quality of
    recollection, as in asking yourself, &quot;What am I doing?&quot; <i>Sampajañña</i> is
    the awareness that &quot;now I am doing such and such.&quot; We observe the in and out
    breathing with <i>sati</i> and <i>sampajañña.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This quality of recollection is something that arises from
    practice, it's not something that can be learnt from books. Know the feelings that arise.
    The mind may be fairly inactive for a while and then a feeling arises. <i>Sati</i> works
    in conjunction with these feelings, recollecting them. There is <i>sati,</i> the
    recollection that &quot;I will speak,&quot; &quot;I will go,&quot; &quot;I will sit&quot;
    and so on, and then there is <i>sampajañña,</i> the awareness that &quot;now I am
    walking,&quot; &quot;I am lying down,&quot; &quot;I am experiencing such and such a
    mood&quot; with these two things, <i>sati</i> and <i>sampajañña,</i> we can know our
    minds in the present moment. We will know how the mind reacts to sense impressions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That which is aware of sense objects is called
    &quot;mind.&quot; Sense objects &quot;wander in&quot; to the mind. For instance, there is
    a sound, like the electric planer here. It enters through the ear and travels inwards to
    the mind, which acknowledges that it is the sound of an electric planer. That which
    acknowledges the sound is called &quot;mind.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now this mind which acknowledges the sound is still quite
    basic. It's just the average mind. Perhaps annoyance arises within this one who
    acknowledges. We must further train &quot;the one who acknowledges&quot; to become
    &quot;the one who knows&quot; in accordance with the truth -- known as Buddho. If we don't
    clearly know in accordance with the truth then we get annoyed at sounds of people, cars,
    electric planer and so on. This is just the ordinary, untrained mind acknowledging the
    sound with annoyance. It knows in accordance with its preferences, not in accordance with
    the truth. We must further train it to know with vision and insight, <i>ñanadassana,</i>
    [<a name="15" href="#n15">15</a>]the power of the refined mind, so that it knows the sound
    as simply sound. If we don't cling to sound there is annoyance. The sound arises and we
    simply note it. This is called truly knowing the arising of sense objects. If we develop
    the Buddho, clearly realizing the sound as sound, then it doesn't annoy us. It arises
    according to conditions, it is not a being, an individual, a self, an &quot;us&quot; or
    &quot;them.&quot; It's just sound. The mind lets go. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This knowing is called Buddho, the knowledge that is clear
    and penetrating. With this knowledge we can let the sound be simply sound. It doesn't
    disturb us unless we disturb it by thinking, &quot;I don't want to hear that sound, it's
    annoying.&quot; Suffering arises because of this thinking. Right here is the cause of
    suffering, that we don't know the truth of this matter, we haven't developed the Buddho.
    We are not yet clear, not yet awake, not yet aware. This is the raw, untrained mind. This
    mind is not yet truly useful to us. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore the Buddha taught that this mind must be trained
    and developed. We must develop the mind just like we develop the body, but we do it in
    different way. To develop the body we must exercise it, jogging in the morning and evening
    and so on. This is exercising the body. As a result the body becomes more agile, stronger,
    the respiratory and nervous systems become more efficient. to exercise the mind we don't
    have to move it around, but bring it to a halt, bring it to rest. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For instance, when practicing meditation, we take an
    object, such as the in and out breathing, as our foundation. This becomes the focus of our
    attention and reflection. We note the breathing. To note the breathing means to follow the
    breathing with awareness, noting its rhythm, its coming and going. We put awareness into
    the breath, following the natural in and out breathing and letting go of all else. As a
    result of staying on one object of awareness, our mind becomes refreshed. If we let the
    mind think of this, that and the other there are many objects of awareness, the mind
    doesn't unify, it doesn't come to rest. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To say the mind stops means that it feels as if it's
    stopped, it doesn't go running here and there. It's like having a sharp knife. If we use
    the knife to cut at things indiscriminately, such as stones, bricks and grass, our knife
    will quickly become blunt. We should use it for cutting only the things it was meant for.
    Our mind is the same. If we let the mind wander after thoughts and feelings which have no
    value or use, the mind becomes tired and weak, If the mind has no energy, wisdom will not
    arise, because the mind without energy is the mind without <i>samadhi.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the mind hasn't stopped you can't clearly see the sense
    objects for what they are. The knowledge that the mind is the mind, sense objects are
    merely sense objects, is the root from which Buddhism has grown and developed. This is the
    heart of Buddhism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We must cultivate this mind, develop it, training it in
    calm and insight. We train the mind to have restraint and wisdom by letting the mind stop
    and allowing wisdom to arise, by knowing the mind as it is. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You know, the way we human beings are, the way we do
    things, are just like little children. A child doesn't know anything. To an adult
    observing the behavior of a child, the way it plays and jumps around, its actions don't
    seem to have much purpose. If our mind is untrained it is like a child. We speak without
    awareness and act without wisdom. We may fall to ruin or cause untold harm and not even
    know it. A child is ignorant, it plays as children do. Our ignorant mind is the same. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we should train this mind. The Buddha taught to train
    the mind, to teach the mind. Even if we support Buddhism with the four requisites, our
    support is still superficial, it reaches only the &quot;bark&quot; or &quot;sapwood&quot;
    of the tree. The real support of Buddhism must be done through the practice, nowhere else,
    training our actions, speech and thoughts according to the teachings. This is much more
    fruitful. If we are straight and honest, possessed of restraint and wisdom, our practice
    will bring prosperity. There will be no cause for spite and hostility. This is how our
    religion teaches us. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we determine the precepts simply out of tradition, then
    even though the Master teaches the truth our practice will be deficient. We may be able to
    study the teachings and repeat them, but we have to practice them if we really want to
    understand. If we do not develop the practice, this may well be an obstacle to our
    penetrating to the heart of Buddhism for countless lifetimes to come. We will not
    understand the essence of the Buddhist religion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore the practice is like a key, the key of
    meditation. If we have the right key in our hand, no matter how tightly the lock is
    closed, when we take the key and turn it the lock falls open. If we have no key we can't
    open the lock. We will never know what it is in the trunk. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Actually there are two kinds of knowledge. One who knows
    the Dhamma doesn't simply speak from memory, he speaks the truth. Worldly people usually
    speak with conceit. For example, suppose there were two people who hadn't seen each other
    for a long time, maybe they had gone to live in different provinces or countries for a
    while, and then one day they happened to meet on the train...&quot;Oh! What a surprise. I
    was just thinking of looking you up!&quot;... Actually it's not true. Really they hadn't
    thought of each other at all, but they say so out of excitement. And so it becomes a lie.
    Yes, it's lying out of heedlessness. This is lying without knowing it. It's a subtle form
    of defilement, and it happens very often. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So with regard to the mind, Tuccho Pothila followed the
    instructions of the novice: breathing in, breathing out... mindfully aware of each
    breath...until he saw the liar within him, the lying of his own mind. He saw the
    defilements as they came up, just like the lizard coming out of the termite mound. He saw
    them and perceived their true nature as soon as they arose. He noticed how one minute the
    mind would concoct one thing, the next moment something else. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thinking is a <i>sankhata dhamma,</i> something which is
    created or concocted from supporting conditions. It's not <i>asankhata dhamma,</i> the
    unconditioned. The well-trained mind, one with perfect awareness, does not concoct mental
    states. This kind of mind penetrates to the Noble Truths and transcends any need to depend
    on externals. To know the Noble Truths is to know the truth. The proliferating mind tries
    to avoid this truth, saying, &quot;that's good&quot; or &quot;this is beautiful,&quot; but
    if there is Buddho in the mind it can no longer deceive us, because we know the mind as it
    is. The mind can no longer create deluded mental states, because there is the clear
    awareness that all mental states are unstable, imperfect, and a source of suffering to one
    who clings to them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wherever he went, the one who knows was constantly in
    Tuccho Pothila's mind. He observed the various creations and proliferation of the mind
    with understanding. He saw how the mind lied in so many ways. He grasped the essence of
    the practice, seeing that &quot;This lying mind is the one to watch -- this is the one
    which leads us into extremes of happiness and suffering and causes us to endlessly spin
    around in the cycle of <i>Samsara,</i> with its pleasure and pain, good and evil -- all
    because of this one.&quot; Tuccho Pothila realized the truth, and grasped the essence of
    the practice, just like a man grasping the tail of the lizard. He saw the workings of the
    deluded mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For us it's the same. Only this mind is important. That's
    why they say to train the mind. Now if the mind is the mind, what are we going to train it
    with? By having continuous <i>sati</i> and <i>sampajañña</i> we will be able to know the
    mind. This one who knows is a step beyond the mind, it is that which knows the state of
    the mind. The mind is the mind. That which knows the mind as simply mind is the one who
    knows. It is above the mind. The one who knows is above the mind, and that is how it is
    able to look after the mind, to teach the mind to know what is right and what is wrong. In
    the end everything comes back to this proliferating mind. If the mind is caught up in its
    proliferations there is no awareness and the practice is fruitless. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we must train this mind to hear the Dhamma, to
    cultivate the Buddho, the clear and radiant awareness, that which exists above and beyond
    the ordinary mind and knows all that goes on within it. This is why we meditate on the
    word Buddho, so that we can know the mind beyond the mind. Just observe all the mind's
    movements, whether good or bad, until the one who realizes that the mind is simply mind,
    not a self or a person. This is called <i>cittanupassana,</i> Contemplation of Mind. [<a
    name="16" href="#n16">16</a>] Seeing in this way we will understand that the mind is
    Transient, Imperfect and Ownerless. This mind doesn't belong to us. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can summarize thus: The mind is that which acknowledges
    sense objects; sense objects are sense objects as distinct from the mind; the one who
    knows both the mind and the sense objects for what they are. We must use <i>sati</i> to
    constantly cleanse the mind. Everybody has <i>sati,</i> even a cat has it when it's going
    to catch a mouse. A dog has it when it barks at people. This is a form of <i>sati,</i> but
    it's not <i>sati</i> according to the Dhamma. Everybody has <i>sati,</i> but there are
    different levels of it, just as there are different levels of looking at things. Like when
    I say to contemplate the body, some people say, &quot;What is there to contemplate in the
    body? Anybody can see it. <i>Kesa</i> we can see already, <i>loma</i> we can see
    already...hair, nails, teeth and skin we can see already. So what?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is how people are. They can see the body alright but
    their seeing is faulty, they don't see with the Buddho, the one who knows, the awakened
    one. They only see the body in the ordinary way, they see it visually. Simply to see the
    body is not enough. If we only see the body there is trouble. You must see the body within
    the body, then things become much clearer. Just seeing the body you get fooled by it,
    charmed by its appearance. Not seeing Transience, Imperfection and Ownerlessness, <i>kamachanda</i>
    [<a name="17" href="#n17">17</a>] arises. You become fascinated by forms, sounds, odors,
    flavors and feelings. Seeing in this way is to see with the mundane eye of the flesh,
    causing you to love and hate and discriminate into pleasing and unpleasing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught that this is not enough. You must see
    with the &quot;mind's eye.&quot; See the body within the body. If you really look into the
    body...Ugh! It's so repulsive. There are today's things and yesterday's things all mixed
    up in there, you can't tell what's what. Seeing in this way is much clearer than to see
    with the carnal eye. Contemplate, see with the eye of the mind, with the wisdom eye. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People's understandings differ like this. Some people
    don't know what there is to contemplate in the Five Meditations, head hair, body hair,
    nails, teeth and skin. They say they can see all those things already, but they can only
    see them with the carnal eye, with this &quot;crazy eye&quot; which only looks at the
    things it wants to look at. To see the body in the body you have to look much clearer than
    that. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the practice that can uproot clinging to the Five <i>Khandhas.</i>
    [<a name="18" href="#n18">18</a>] To uproot attachment is to uproot suffering, because
    attaching to the Five <i>Khandhas</i> is the cause of suffering. If suffering arises it is
    here, at the attachment to the Five <i>Khandhas.</i> It's not that the Five <i>Khandhas</i>
    are in themselves suffering, but the clinging to them as being one's own...that's
    suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you clearly see the truth of these things through
    meditation practice, then suffering becomes unwound, like a screw or a bolt. When the bolt
    is unwound, it withdraws. The mind unwinds in the same way, letting go, withdrawing from
    the obsession with good and evil, possessions, praise and status, happiness and suffering.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we don't know the truth of these things it's like
    tightening the screw all the time. It gets tighter and tighter until it's crushing you and
    you suffer over everything. When you know how things are then you unwind the screw. In
    Dhamma language we call this the arising of <i>nibbida,</i> disenchantment. You become
    weary of things and lay down the fascination with them. If you unwind in this way you will
    find peace. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The cause of suffering is to cling to things. So we should
    get rid of the cause, cut off its root and not allow it to cause suffering again. People
    have only one problem -- the problem of clinging. Just because of this one thing people
    will kill each other. All problems, be they individual, family or social, arise from this
    one root. Nobody wins...they kill each other but in the end no-one gets anything. I don't
    know why people keep on killing each other so pointlessly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Power, possessions, status, praise, happiness and
    suffering...these are the worldly dhammas. These worldly dhammas engulf worldly beings.
    Worldly beings are led around by the worldly dhammas: gain and loss, acclaim and slander,
    status and loss of status, happiness and suffering. These dhammas are trouble makers, if
    you don't reflect on their true nature you will suffer. People even commit murder for the
    sake of wealth, status or power. Why? Because they take them too seriously. They get
    appointed to some position and it goes to their heads, like the man who became headman of
    the village. After his appointment he became &quot;power-drunk.&quot; If any of his old
    friends came to see he'd say, &quot;Don't come around so often. Things aren't the same
    anymore.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught to understand the nature of possessions,
    status, praise and happiness. Take these things as they come but let them be. Don't let
    them go to your head. If you don't really understand these things you become fooled by
    your power, your children and relatives...by everything! If you understand them clearly
    you know they're all impermanent conditions. If you cling to them they become defiled. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All of these things arise afterwards. When people are
    first born there are simply <i>nama</i> and <i>rupa,</i> that's all. We add on the
    business of &quot;Mr. Jones,&quot; &quot;Miss Smith&quot; or whatever later on. This is
    done according to convention. Still later there are the appendages of &quot;Colonel,&quot;
    &quot;General&quot; and so on. If we don't really understand these things we think they
    are real and carry them around with us. We carry possessions, status, name and rank
    around. If you have power you can call all the tunes...&quot;Take this one and execute
    him. Take that one and throw him in jail&quot; ... Rank gives power. This word
    &quot;rank&quot; here is where clinging takes hold. As soon as people get rank they start
    giving orders; right or wrong, they just act on their moods. So they go on making the same
    old mistakes, deviating further and further from the true path. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One who understands the Dhamma won't behave like this.
    Good and evil have been in the world since who knows when... if possessions and status
    come your way then let them simply be the possessions and status, don't let them become
    your identity. Just use them to fulfill your obligations and leave it at that. You remain
    unchanged. If we have meditated on these things, no matter what comes our way we will not
    be fooled by it. We will be untroubled, unaffected, constant. Everything is pretty much
    the same, after all. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is how the Buddha wanted us to understand things. No
    matter what you receive, the mind adds nothing on to it. They appoint you a city
    councilor...&quot;Okay, so I'm a city councilor...but I'm not.&quot; They appoint you head
    of the group...&quot;Sure I am, but I'm not.&quot; Whatever they make of you...&quot;Yes I
    am, but I'm not!&quot; In the end what are we anyway? We all just die in the end. No
    matter what they make you, in the end it's all the same. What can you say? If you can see
    things in this way you will have a solid abiding and true contentment. Nothing is changed.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is not to be fooled by things. Whatever comes your
    way, it's just conditions. There's nothing which can entice a mind like this to create or
    proliferate, to seduce it into greed, aversion or delusion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now this is to be a true supporter of Buddhism. Whether
    you are among those who are being supported (i.e. the Sangha) or those who are supporting
    (the laity) please consider this thoroughly. Cultivate the <i>Sila-Dhamma</i> [<a
    name="19" href="#n19">19</a>] within you. This is the surest way to support Buddhism. To
    support Buddhism with the offerings of food, shelter and medicine is good also, but such
    offerings only reach the &quot;sapwood&quot; of Buddhism. Please don't forget this. A tree
    has bark, sapwood and heartwood, and these three parts are interdependent. The heartwood
    must rely on the bark and the sapwood. The sapwood relies on the bark and the heartwood.
    they all exist interdependently, just like the teachings of Moral Discipline,
    Concentration and Wisdom. [<a name="20" href="#n20">20</a>] Moral Discipline is to
    establish your speech and actions in rectitude. Concentration is to firmly fix the mind.
    Wisdom is the thorough understanding of the nature of all conditions. Study this, practice
    this, and you will understand Buddhism in the most profound way. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you don't realize these things you will be fooled by
    possessions, fooled by rank, fooled by anything you come into contact with. simply
    supporting Buddhism in the external way will never put an end to the fighting and
    squabbling, the grudges and animosity, the stabbing and shooting. If these things are to
    cease we must reflect on the nature of possessions, rank, praise, happiness and suffering.
    We must consider our lives and bring them in line with the Teaching. We should reflect
    that all beings in the world are part of one whole. We are like them, they are like us.
    They have happiness and suffering just like we do. It's all much the same. If we reflect
    in this way, peace and understanding will arise. This is the foundation of Buddhism. </font></p>
