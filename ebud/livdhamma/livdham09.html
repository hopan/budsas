    <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font
    size="6">T</font>oday is the day on which we Buddhists come together to observe the
    Uposatha [<a name="22" href="#n22">22</a>] precepts and listen to the Dhamma, as is our
    custom. The point of listening to the Dhamma is firstly to create some understanding of
    the things we don't yet understand, to clarify them, and secondly, to improve our grasp of
    the things we understand already. We must rely on Dhamma talks to improve our
    understanding, and listening is the crucial factor. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For today's talk please pay special attention, first of
    all straightening up your posture to make it suitable for listening. Don't be too tense.
    Now, all that remains is to establish your minds, making your minds firm in <i>samadhi.</i>
    The mind is the important ingredient. The mind is that which perceives good and evil,
    right and wrong. If we are lacking in <i>sati</i> for even one minute, we are crazy for
    that minute; if we are lacking in <i>sati</i> for half an hour we will be crazy for half
    an hour. However much our mind is lacking in <i>sati,</i> that's how crazy we are. That's
    why it's especially important to pay attention when listening to the Dhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All creatures in this world are plagued by nothing other
    than suffering. There is only suffering disturbing the mind. Studying the Dhamma is for
    the purpose of utterly destroying this suffering. If suffering arises it's because we
    don't really know it. No matter how much we try to control it through will power, or
    through wealth and possessions, it is impossible. If we don't thoroughly understand
    suffering and its cause, no matter how much we try to &quot;trade it off&quot; with our
    deeds, thoughts or worldly riches, there's no way we can do so. Only through clear
    knowledge and awareness, through knowing the truth of it, can suffering disappear. And
    this applies not only to homeless ones, the monks and novices, but also to householders:
    for anybody who knows the truth of things, suffering automatically ceases. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now the states of good and evil are constant truths.
    Dhamma means that which is constant, which maintains itself. Turmoil maintains its
    turmoil, serenity maintains its serenity. Good and evil maintain their respective
    conditions -- like hot water: it maintains its hotness, it doesn't change for anybody.
    Whether a young person or an old person drink it, it's hot. It's hot for every nationality
    of people. So Dhamma is defined as that which maintains its condition. In our practice we
    must know heat and coolness, right and wrong, good and evil. Knowing evil, for example, we
    will not create the causes for evil, and evil will not arise. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhamma practicers should know the source of the various <i>dhammas.</i>
    By quelling the cause of heat, heat cannot arise. The same with evil: it arises from a
    cause. If we practice the Dhamma till we know the Dhamma, we will know the source of
    things, their causes. If we extinguish the cause of evil, evil is also extinguished, we
    don't have to go running after evil to put it out. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the practice of Dhamma. But many are those who
    study the Dhamma, learn it, even practice it, but who are not yet with the Dhamma, and who
    have not yet quenched the cause of evil and turmoil within their own hearts. As long as
    the cause of heat is still present, we can't possibly prevent heat from being there. In
    the same way, as long as the cause of confusion is within our minds, we cannot possibly
    prevent confusion from being there, because it arises from this source. As long as the
    source is not quenched, confusion will arise again. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whenever we create good actions goodness arises in the
    mind. It arises from its cause. This is called <i>kusala.</i> [<a name="23" href="#n23">23</a>]
    If we understand causes in this way, we can create those causes and the results will
    naturally follow. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But people don't usually create the right causes. They
    want goodness so much, and yet they don't work to bring it about. All they get are bad
    results, embroiling the mind in suffering. All people want these days is money. They think
    that is they just get enough money everything will be alright; so they spend all their
    time looking for money, they don't look for goodness. This is like wanting meat, but not
    wanting salt to preserve it: you just leave the meat around the house to rot. Those who
    want money should know not only how to find it, but also how to look after it. If you want
    meat, you can't expect to buy it and then just leave it laying around in the house. It'll
    just go rotten. This kind of thinking is wrong. The result of wrong thinking is turmoil
    and confusion. The Buddha taught the Dhamma so that people would put it into practice, in
    order to know it and see it, and to be one with it, to make the mind Dhamma. When the mind
    is Dhamma it will attain happiness and contentment. The restlessness of <i>samsara</i> is
    in this world, and the cessation of suffering is also in this world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The practice of Dhamma is therefore for leading the mind
    to the transcendence of suffering. The body can't transcend suffering -- having been born
    it must experience pain and sickness, aging and death. Only the mind can transcend
    clinging and grasping. All the teachings of the Buddha, which we call <i>pariyatti,</i> [<a
    name="24" href="#n24">24</a>] are a skillful means to this end. For instance, the Buddha
    taught about <i>upadinnakasankhara</i> and <i>anupadinnakasankhara</i> -- mind-attended
    conditions and non-mind- attended conditions. Non-mind-attended conditions are usually
    defined as such things as trees, mountains, rivers and so on -- inanimate things.
    Mind-attended conditions are defined as animate things -- animals, human beings and so on.
    Most students of Dhamma take this definition for granted, but if you consider the matter
    deeply, how the human mind gets so caught up in sights, sounds, smells, tastes, feelings,
    and mental states, you might see that really there isn't anything which is not
    mind-attended. As long as there is craving in the mind everything becomes mind-attended. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Studying the Dhamma without practicing it, we will be
    unaware of its deeper meanings. For instance, we might think that the pillars of this
    meeting hall, the tables, benches and all inanimate things are &quot;not
    mind-attended.&quot; We only look at one side of things. But just try getting a hammer and
    smashing some of these things and you'll see whether they're mind-attended or not! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's our own mind, clinging to the tables, chairs and all
    of our possessions, which attends these things. Even when one little cup breaks it hurts,
    because our mind is &quot;attending&quot; that cup. Be they trees, mountains or whatever,
    whatever we feel to be ours, they have a mind attending them -- if not their own then
    someone else's. These are all &quot;mind-attended conditions,&quot; not
    &quot;non-mind-attended.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's the same for our body. Normally we would say that the
    body is mind-attended. The &quot;mind&quot; which attends the body is none other than <i>upadana,</i>
    clinging, latching onto the body and clinging to it as being &quot;me&quot; and
    &quot;mine.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as a blind man cannot conceive of colors -- no matter
    where he looks, no colors can be seen -- just so for the mind blocked by craving and
    delusion, all objects of consciousness become mind-attended. For the mind tainted with
    craving and obstructed by delusion, everything becomes mind-attended... tables, chairs,
    animals and everything else. If we understand that there is an intrinsic self, the mind
    attaches to everything. All of nature becomes mind-attended, there is always clinging and
    attachment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha talked about <i>sankhata dhammas</i> and <i>asankhata
    dhammas</i> -- conditioned and unconditioned things. Conditioned things are innumerable --
    material or immaterial, big or small -- if our mind is under the influence of delusion, it
    will proliferate about these things, dividing them up into good and bad, short and long,
    coarse and refined. Why does the mind proliferate like this? Because it doesn't know
    determined reality, [<a name="25" href="#n25">25</a>] it doesn't see the Dhamma. Not
    seeing the Dhamma, the mind is full of clinging. As long as the mind is held down by
    clinging there can be no escape, there is confusion, birth, old age, sickness and death,
    even in the thinking processes. This kind of mind is called the <i>sankhata dhamma</i>
    (conditioned mind). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Asankhata dhamma,</i> the unconditioned, refers to the
    mind which has seen the Dhamma, the truth, of the Five <i>Khandhas</i> as they are -- as
    Transient, Imperfect and Ownerless. All ideas of &quot;me&quot; and &quot;them,&quot;
    &quot;mine&quot; and &quot;theirs,&quot; belong to the determined reality. Really they are
    all conditions. When we know the truth of conditions, as neither ourselves nor belonging
    to us, we let go of conditions and the determined. When we let go of conditions we attain
    the Dhamma, we enter into and realize the Dhamma. When we attain the Dhamma we know
    clearly. What do we know? We know that there are only conditions and determinations, no
    being, no self, no &quot;us&quot; nor &quot;them.&quot; This is knowledge of the way
    things are. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing in this way the mind transcends things. The body
    may grow old, get sick and die, but the mind transcends this state. When the mind
    transcends conditions, it knows the unconditioned. the mind becomes the unconditioned, the
    state which no longer contains conditioning factors. The mind is no longer conditioned by
    the concerns of the world, conditions no longer contaminate the mind. Pleasure and pain no
    longer affect it. Nothing can affect the mind or change it, the mind is assured, it has
    escaped all constructions. Seeing the true nature of conditions and the determined, the
    mind becomes free. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This freed mind is called the Unconditioned, that which is
    beyond the power of constructing influences. If the mind doesn't really know conditions
    and determinations, it is moved by them. Encountering good, bad, pleasure, or pain, it
    proliferates about them. Why does it proliferate? Because there is still a cause. What is
    the cause? The cause is the understanding that the body is one's self or belongs to the
    self; that feelings are self or belonging to self; that perception is self or belonging to
    self; that conceptual thought is self or belonging to self; that consciousness is self or
    belonging to self. The tendency to conceive things in terms of self is the source of
    happiness, suffering, birth, old age, sickness and death. This is the worldly mind,
    spinning around and changing at the directives of worldly conditions. This is the
    conditioned mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we receive some windfall our mind is conditioned by it.
    That object influences our mind into a feeling of pleasure, but when it disappears, our
    mind is conditioned by it into suffering. The mind becomes a slave of conditions, a slave
    of desire. No matter what the world presents to it, the mind is moved accordingly. This
    mind has no refuge, it is not yet assured of itself, not yet free. It is still lacking a
    firm base. This mind doesn't yet know the truth of conditions. Such is the conditioned
    mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All of you listening to the Dhamma here, reflect for a
    while...even a child can make you get angry, isn't that so? Even a child can trick you. He
    could trick you into crying, laughing -- he could trick you into all sorts of things. Even
    old people get duped by these things. For a deluded person who doesn't know the truth of
    conditions, they are always shaping the mind into countless reactions, such as love, hate,
    pleasure and pain. They shape our minds like this because we are enslaved by them. We are
    slaves of <i>tanha,</i> craving. Craving gives all the orders, and we simply obey. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I hear people complaining...&quot;Oh, I'm so miserable.
    Night and day I have to go to the fields, I have no time at home. In the middle of the day
    I have to work in the hot sun with no shade. No matter how cold it is I can't stay at
    home, I have to go to work. I'm so oppressed.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If I ask them, &quot;Why don't you just leave home and
    become a monk?&quot;, they say, &quot;I can't leave, I have responsibilities.&quot; <i>Tanha</i>
    pulls them back. Sometimes when you're doing the plowing you might be bursting to urinate
    so much you just have to do it while you're plowing, like the buffaloes! This is how much
    craving enslaves them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When I ask, &quot;How are you going? Haven't you got time
    to come to the monastery?&quot;, they say, &quot;Oh, I'm really in deep.&quot; I don't
    know what it is they're stuck in so deeply! These are just conditions, concoctions. The
    Buddha taught to see appearances as such, to see conditions as they are. This is seeing
    the Dhamma, seeing things as they really are. If you really see these two things then you
    must throw them out, let them go. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">No matter what you may receive it has no real substance.
    At first it may seem good, but it will eventually go bad. It will make you love and make
    you hate, make you laugh and cry, make you go whichever way it pulls you. Why is this?
    Because the mind is undeveloped. Conditions become conditioning factors of the mind,
    making it big and small, happy and sad. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the time of our forefathers, when a person died they
    would invite the monks to go and recite the recollections on impermanence: <i>Anicca vata
    sankhara / Uppadavaya dhammino / Uppajjitva nirujjhan'ti / Tesam vupasamo sukho</i> [<a
    name="26" href="#n26">26</a>] -- All conditions are impermanent. The body and the mind are
    both impermanent. They are impermanent because they do not remain fixed and unchanging.
    All things that are born must necessarily change, they are transient -- especially our
    body. What is there that doesn't change within this body? Hair, nails, teeth, skin... are
    they still the same as they used to be? The condition of the body is constantly changing,
    so it is impermanent. Is the body stable? Is the mind stable? Think about it. How many
    times is there arising and ceasing even in one day? Both body and mind are constantly
    arising and ceasing, conditions are in a state of constant turmoil. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The reason you can't see these things in line with the
    truth is because you keep believing the untrue. It's like being guided by a blind man. How
    can you travel in safety? A blind man will only lead you into forests and thickets. How
    could he lead you to safety when he can't see? In the same way our mind is deluded by
    conditions, creating suffering in the search for happiness, creating difficulty in the
    search for ease. Such a mind only makes for difficulty and suffering. Really we want to
    get rid of suffering and difficulty, but instead we create those very things. All we can
    do is complain. We create bad causes, and the reason we do is because we don't know the
    truth of appearances and conditions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Conditions are impermanent, both the mind-attended ones
    and the non-mind-attended. In practice, the non-mind-attended conditions are non-existent.
    What is there that is not mind- attended? Even your own toilet, which you would think
    would be non-mind-attended...try letting someone smash it with a sledge hammer! He would
    probably have to contend with the &quot;authorities.&quot; The mind attends everything,
    even feces and urine. Except for the person who sees clearly the way things are, there are
    no such things as non-mind-attended conditions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Appearances are determined into existence. Why must we
    determine them? Because they don't intrinsically exist. For example, suppose somebody
    wanted to make a marker. He would take a piece of wood or a rock and place it on the
    ground, and then call it a marker. Actually it's not a marker. There isn't any marker,
    that's why you must determine it into existence. In the same way we &quot;determine&quot;
    cities, people, cattle -- everything! Why must we determine these things? Because
    originally they do not exist. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Concepts such as &quot;monk&quot; and
    &quot;layperson&quot; are also &quot;determinations.&quot; We determine these things into
    existence because intrinsically they aren't here. It's like having an empty dish -- you
    can put anything you like into it because it's empty. This is the nature of determined
    reality. Men and women are simply determined concepts, as are all the things around us. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we know the truth of determinations clearly, we will
    know that there are no beings, because &quot;beings&quot; are determined things.
    Understanding that these things are simply determinations, you can be at peace. But if you
    believe that the person, being, the &quot;mine,&quot; the &quot;theirs,&quot; and so on
    are intrinsic qualities, then you must laugh and cry over them. These are the
    proliferation of conditioning factors. If we take such things to be ours there will always
    be suffering. This is <i>micchaditthi,</i> Wrong View. Names are not intrinsic realities,
    they are provisional truths. Only after we are born do we obtain names, isn't that so? Or
    did you have your name already when you were born? The name comes afterwards, right? Why
    must we determine these names? Because intrinsically they aren't there. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We should clearly understand these determinations. Good,
    evil, high, low, black and white are all determinations. We are all lost in
    determinations. This is why at the funeral ceremonies the monks chant, <i>Anicca vata
    sankhara...</i> Conditions are impermanent, they arise and pass way. That's the truth.
    What is there that, having arisen, doesn't cease? Good moods arise and then cease. Have
    you ever seen anybody cry for three or four years? At the most, you may see people crying
    a whole night, and then the tears dry up. Having arisen, they cease... </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Tesam vupasamo sukho...</i> [<a name="27" href="#n27">27</a>]
    If we understand <i>sankharas,</i> proliferations, and thereby subdue them, this is the
    greatest happiness. This is true merit, to be calmed of proliferations, calmed of
    &quot;being,&quot; calmed of individuality, of the burden of self. Transcending these
    things one sees the Unconditioned. This means that no matter what happens, the mind
    doesn't proliferate around it. There's nothing that can throw the mind off its natural
    balance. What else could you want? This is the end, the finish. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught the way things are. Our making offerings
    and listening to Dhamma talks and so on is in order to search for and realize this. If we
    realize this, we don't have to go and study <i>vipassana</i> (insight meditation), it will
    happen of itself. Both <i>samatha</i> (calm) and <i>vipassana</i> are determined into
    being, just like other determinations. The mind which knows, which is beyond such things,
    is the culmination of the practice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our practice, our inquiry, is in order to transcend
    suffering. When clinging is finished with, states of being are finished with. When states
    of being are finished with, there is no more birth or death. When things are going badly,
    the mind does not rejoice, and when things are going badly, the mind does not grieve. The
    mind is not dragged all over the place by the tribulations of the world, and so the
    practice is finished. This is the basic principle for which the Buddha gave the teaching. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught the Dhamma for use in our lives. Even
    when we die there is the teaching <i>Tesam vupasamo sukho...</i>but we don't subdue these
    conditions, we only carry them around, as if the monks were telling us to do so. We carry
    them around and cry over them. This is getting lost in conditions. Heaven, Hell and <i>nibbana</i>
    are all to be found at this point. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Practicing the Dhamma is in order to transcend suffering
    in the mind. If we know the truth of things as I've explained here we will automatically
    know the Four Noble Truths -- Suffering, the Cause of Suffering, the Cessation of
    Suffering and the Way leading to the Cessation of Suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People are generally ignorant when it comes to
    determinations, they think they all exist of themselves. When the books tell us that
    trees, mountains and rivers are non-mind-attended conditions, this is simplifying things.
    This is just the superficial teaching, there's no reference to suffering, as if there was
    no suffering in the world. This is just the shell of Dhamma. If we were to explain things
    in terms of ultimate truth, we would see that it's people who go and tie all these things
    down with their attachments. How can you say that things have no power to shape events,
    that they are not mind-attended, when people will beat their children even over one tiny
    needle? One single plate or cup, a plank of wood... the mind attends all these things.
    Just watch what happens if someone goes and smashes one of them up and you'll find out.
    Everything is capable of influencing us in this way. Knowing these things fully is our
    practice, examining those things which are conditioned, unconditioned, mind-attended, and
    non-mind-attended. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is part of the &quot;external teaching,&quot; as the
    Buddha once referred to them. At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest. Taking a
    handful of leaves, He asked the bhikkhus, &quot;Bhikkhus, which is the greater number, the
    leaves I hold in my hand or the leaves scattered over the forest floor?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhus answered, &quot;The leaves in the Blessed
    One's hand are few, the leaves scattered around the forest floor are by far the greater
    number.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In the same way, bhikkhus, the whole of the Buddha's
    teaching is vast, but these are not the essence of things, they are not directly related
    to the way out of suffering. There are so many aspects to the Teaching, but what the
    Tathagata really wants you to do is to transcend suffering, to inquire into things and
    abandon clinging and attachment to form, feeling, perception, volition and
    consciousness.&quot; [<a name="28" href="#n28">28</a>] Stop clinging to these things and
    you will transcend suffering. These teachings are like the leaves in the Buddha's hand.
    You don't need so much, just a little is enough. As for the rest of the Teaching, you
    needn't worry yourselves over it. It is just like the vast earth, abundant with grasses,
    soil, mountains, forests. There's no shortage of rocks and pebbles, but all those rocks
    are not as valuable as one single jewel. The Dhamma of the Buddha is like this, you don't
    need a lot. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So whether you are talking about the Dhamma or listening
    to it, you should know the Dhamma. You needn't wonder where the Dhamma is, it's right
    here. No matter where you go to study the Dhamma, it is really in the mind. The mind is
    the one who clings, the mind is the one who speculates, the mind is the one who
    transcends, who lets go. All this external study is really about the mind. No matter if
    you study the Tipitaka, [<a name="29" href="#n29">29</a>] the Abhidhamma [<a name="30"
    href="#n30">30</a>] or whatever, don't forget where it came from. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When it comes to the practice, the only things you really
    need to make a start are honesty and integrity, you don't need to make a lot of trouble
    for yourself. None of you laypeople have studied the Tipitaka, but you are still capable
    of greed, anger and delusion, aren't you? Where did you learn about these things from? Did
    you have to read the Tipitaka or the Abhidhamma to have greed, hatred and delusion? Those
    things are already there in your mind, you don't have to study books to have them. But the
    Teachings are for inquiring into and abandoning these things. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let the knowing spread from within you and you will be
    practicing rightly. If you want to see a train, just go the central station, you don't
    have to go traveling all the way up the Northern line, the Southern Line, the Eastern Line
    and the Western Line to see all the trains. If you want to see trains, every single one of
    them, you'd be better off waiting at Grand Central Station, that's where they all
    terminate. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now some people tell me, &quot;I want to practice but I
    don't know how. I'm not up to studying the scriptures, I'm getting old now, my memory's
    not good...&quot; Just look right here, at &quot;Central Station.&quot; Greed arises here,
    anger arises here, delusion arises here. Just sit here and you can watch as all these
    things arise. Practice right here, because right here is where you're stuck. Right here is
    where the determined arises, where conventions arise, and right here is where the Dhamma
    will arise. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore the practice of Dhamma doesn't distinguish
    between class or race, all it asks is that we look into, see and understand. At first, we
    train the body and speech to be free of taints, which is <i>sila.</i> Some people think
    that to have <i>sila</i> you must memorize Pali phrases and chant all day and all night,
    but really all you have to do is make your body and speech blameless, and that's <i>sila.</i>
    It's not so difficult to understand, just like cooking food... put in a little bit of this
    and a little bit of that, till it's just right...and it's delicious! You don't have to add
    anything else to make it delicious, it's delicious already, if only you add the right
    ingredients. In the same way, taking care that our actions and speech are proper will give
    us <i>sila.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhamma practice can be done anywhere. In the past I
    traveled all over looking for a teacher because I didn't know how to practice. I was
    always afraid that I was practicing wrongly. I'd be constantly going from one mountain to
    another, from one place to another, until I stopped and reflected on it. Now I understand.
    In the past I must have been quite stupid, I went all over the place looking for places to
    practice meditation -- I didn't realize it was already there, in my heart. All the
    meditation you want is right there inside you. There is birth, old age, sickness, death
    right here within you. that's why the Buddha said <i>Paccatam veditabbo viññuhi:</i> The
    wise must know for themselves. I'd said the words before but I still didn't know their
    meaning. I traveled all over looking for it until I was ready to drop dead from exhaustion
    -- only then, when I stopped, did I find what I was looking for, inside of me. So now I
    can tell you about it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So in your practice of <i>sila,</i> just practice as I've
    explained here. Don't doubt the practice. Even though some people may say you can't
    practice at home, that there are too many obstacles...if that's the case then even eating
    and drinking are going to be obstacles. If these things are obstacles to practice then
    don't eat! If you stand on a thorn, is that good? Isn't not standing on a thorn better?
    Dhamma practice brings benefit to all people, irrespective of class. However much you
    practice, that's how much you will know the truth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people say they can't practice as a lay person, the
    environment is too crowded. If you live in a crowded place, then look into crowdedness,
    make it open and wide. The mind has been deluded by crowdedness, train it to know the
    truth of crowdedness. The more you neglect the practice, the more you neglect going to the
    monastery and listening to the teaching, the more your mind will sink down into the bog,
    like a frog going into a hole. Someone comes along with a hook and the frog's done for, he
    doesn't have a chance. All he can do is stretch out his neck and offer it to them. So
    watch out you don't work yourself into a tiny corner -- someone may just come along with a
    hook and scoop you up. At home, being pestered by your children and grandchildren, you are
    even worse off than the frog! You don't know how to detach from these things. When old
    age, sickness and death come along, what will you do? This is the hook that's going to get
    you. Which way will you turn? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the predicament our minds are in. Engrossed in the
    children, the relatives, the possessions...and you don't know how to let them go. Without
    morality or understanding to free things up there is no way out for you. When feeling,
    perception, volition and consciousness produce suffering you always get caught up in it.
    Why is there this suffering? If you don't investigate you won't know. If happiness arises
    you simply get caught up in happiness, delighting in it. You don't ask yourself,
    &quot;where does this happiness come from?' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So change your understanding. You can practice anywhere
    because the mind is with you everywhere. If you think good thoughts while sitting, you can
    be aware of them; if you think bad thoughts you can be aware of them also. These things
    are with you. While lying down, if you think good thoughts or bad thoughts, you can know
    them also, because the place to practice is in the mind. Some people think you have to go
    to the monastery every single day. That's not necessary, just look at your own mind. If
    you know where the practice is you'll be assured. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's teaching tells us to watch ourselves, not to
    run after fads and superstitious. That's why he said, <i>Silena sugatim yanti, Silena
    bhogasampada, Silena nibbutim yanti, Tasma silam visodhaye:</i> [<a name="31" href="#n31">31</a>]
    <i>Sila</i> refers to our actions. Good actions bring good results, bad actions bring bad
    results. Don't expect the gods to do things for you, or the angels and guardian deities to
    protect you, or the auspicious days to help you. These things aren't true, don't believe
    in them. If you believe in them you will suffer. You'll always be waiting for the right
    day, the right month, the right year, the angels and guardian deities...you'll suffer that
    way. Look into your own actions and speech, into your own <i>kamma.</i> Doing good you
    inherit goodness, doing bad you inherit badness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you understand that good and bad, right and wrong all
    lie within you, then you won't have to go looking for those things somewhere else. Just
    look for these things where they arise. If you lose something here, you must look for it
    here. Even if you don't find it at first, keep looking where you dropped it. But usually,
    we lose it here then go looking over there. When will you ever find it? Good and bad
    actions lie within you. One day you're bound to see it, just keep looking right there. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All beings fare according to their <i>kamma.</i> What is <i>kamma?</i>
    People are too gullible. If you do bad actions, they say Yama, the King of the Underworld,
    will write it all down in a book. When you go there he takes out his accounts and looks
    you up...You're all afraid of the Yama in the after-life, but you don't know the Yama
    within your own minds. If you do bad actions, even if you sneak off and do it by yourself,
    this Yama will write it all down. Among you people sitting here and there are probably
    many who have secretly done bad things, not letting anyone else see. But you see it don't
    you? This Yama sees it all. Can you see it for yourself? All of you, think for a while...
    Yama has written it all down, hasn't he? There's no way you can escape it. Whether you do
    it alone or in a group, in a field or wherever... </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Is there anybody here who has ever stolen something? There
    are probably a few of us who are ex-thieves. Even if you don't steal other people's things
    you still may steal your own. I myself have that tendency, that's why I reckon some of you
    may be the same. Maybe you have secretly done bad things in the past, not letting anyone
    else know about it. But even if you don't tell anyone else about it, you must know about
    it. This is the Yama who watches over you and writes it all down. Wherever you go he
    writes it all down in his account book. We know our own intention. When you do bad actions
    badness is there, if you do good actions, goodness is there. There's nowhere you can go to
    hide. Even if others don't see you, you must see yourself. Even if you go into a deep hole
    you'll still find yourself. Even if you go into a deep hole you'll still find yourself
    there. There's no way you can commit bad actions and get away with it. In the same way,
    why shouldn't you see your own purity? You see it all -- the peaceful, the agitated, the
    liberation or the bondage -- we see all these for ourselves. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this Buddhist religion you must be aware of all your
    actions. We don't act like the Brahmins, who go into your house and say, &quot;May you be
    well and strong, may you live long.&quot; The Buddha doesn't talk like that. How will the
    disease go away with just talk? The Buddha's way of treating the sick was to say,
    &quot;Before you were sick what happened? What led up to your sickness?&quot; Then you
    tell him how it came about. &quot;Oh, it's like that, is it? Take this medicine and try it
    out.&quot; If it's not the right medicine he tries another one. If it's right for the
    illness, then that's the right one. This way is scientifically sound. As for the Brahmins,
    they just tie a string around your wrist and say, &quot;Okay, be well, be strong, when I
    leave this place you just get right on up and eat a hearty meal and be well.&quot; No
    matter how much you pay them, your illness won't go away, because their way has no
    scientific basis. But this is what people like to believe. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha didn't want us to put too much store in these
    things, he wanted us to practice with reason. Buddhism has been around for thousands of
    years now, and most people have continued to practice as their teachers have taught them,
    regardless of whether it's right or wrong. That's stupid. They simply follow the example
    of their forebears. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha didn't encourage this sort of thing. He wanted
    us to do things with reason. For example, at one time when he was teaching the monks, he
    asked Venerable Sariputta, &quot;Sariputta, do you believe this teaching? Venerable
    Sariputta replied, &quot;I don't yet believe it.&quot; The Buddha praised his answer:
    &quot;Very good, Sariputta. A wise person doesn't believe too readily. He looks into
    things, into their causes and conditions, and sees their true nature before believing or
    disbelieving.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But most teachers these days would say, &quot;What?!!! You
    don't believe me? Get out of here!&quot; Most people are afraid of their teachers.
    Whatever their teachers do they just blindly follow. The Buddha taught to adhere to the
    truth. Listen to the teaching and then consider it intelligently, inquire into it. It's
    the same with my dhamma talks -- go and consider it. Is what I say right? Really look into
    it, look within yourself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it is said to guard your mind. Whoever guards his mind
    will free himself from the shackles of Mara. It's just this mind which goes and grabs onto
    things, know things, sees things, experiences happiness and suffering... just this very
    mind. When we fully know the truth of determinations and conditions we will naturally
    throw off suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All things are just as they are. They don't cause
    suffering in themselves, just like a thorn, a really sharp thorn. Does it make you suffer?
    No, it's just a thorn, it doesn't bother anybody. But if you go and stand on it, then
    you'll suffer. Why is there this suffering? Because you stepped on the thorn. The thorn is
    just minding its own business, it doesn't harm anybody. Only if you step on the thorn will
    you suffer over it. It's because of we ourselves that there's pain. Form, feeling,
    perception, volition, consciousness... all things in this world are simply there as they
    are. It's we who pick fights with them. And if we hit them they're going to hit us back.
    If they're left on their own they won't bother anybody, only the swaggering drunkard gives
    them trouble. All conditions fare according to their nature. That's why the Buddha said, <i>Tesam
    vupasamo sukho:</i> If we subdue conditions, seeing determinations and conditions as they
    really are, as neither &quot;me&quot; nor &quot;mine,&quot; &quot;us&quot; nor
    &quot;them,&quot; when we see that these beliefs are simply <i>sakkayaditthi,</i> the
    conditions are freed of the self-delusion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you think &quot;I'm good,&quot; &quot;I'm bad,&quot;
    &quot;I'm great,&quot; &quot;I'm the best,&quot; then you are thinking wrongly. If you see
    all these thoughts as merely determinations and conditions, then when others say,
    &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; you can leave it be with them. As long as you still
    see it as &quot;me&quot; and &quot;you&quot; it's like having three hornets nests -- as
    soon as you say something the hornets come buzzing out to sting you. The three hornets
    nests are <i>sakkayaditthi,</i> <i>viccikiccha,</i> and <i>silabbataparamasa.</i> [<a
    name="32" href="#n32">32</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once you look into the true nature of determinations and
    conditions, pride cannot prevail. Other people's fathers are just like our father, their
    mothers are just like ours, their children are just like ours. We see the happiness and
    suffering of other beings as just like ours. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we see in this way we can come face to face with the
    future Buddha, it's not so difficult. Everyone is in the same boat. Then the world will be
    as smooth as a drumskin. If you want to wait around to meet <i>Phra Sri Ariya Mettiya,</i>
    the future Buddha, then just don't practice... you'll probably be around long enough to
    see him. But He's not crazy that he'd take people like that for disciples! Most people
    just doubt. If you no longer doubt about the self, then no matter what people may say
    about you, you aren't concerned, because your mind has let go, it is at peace. Conditions
    become subdued. Grasping after the forms of practice... that teacher is bad, that place is
    no good, this is right, that's wrong ... No. There's none of these things. All this kind
    of thinking is all smoothed over. You come face to face with the future Buddha. Those who
    only hold up their hands and pray will never get there. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So here is the practice. If I talked any more it would
    just be more of the same. Another talk would just be the same as this. I've brought you
    this far, now you think about it. I've brought you to the path, whoever's going to go,
    it's there for you. Those who aren't going can stay. The Buddha only sees you to the
    beginning of the path. <i>Akkhataro Tathagata</i> -- the Tathagata only points the way.
    For my practice he only taught this much. The rest was up to me. Now I teach you, I can
    tell you just this much. I can bring you only to the beginning of the path, whoever wants
    to go back can go back, whoever wants to travel on can travel on. It's up to you, now. </font></p>
