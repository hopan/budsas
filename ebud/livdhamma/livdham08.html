    <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font
    size="6">N</font>ow please pay attention, not allowing your mind to wander off after other
    things. Create the feeling that right now you are sitting on a mountain or in a forest
    somewhere, all by yourself. What do you have sitting here right now? There are body and
    mind, that's all, only these two things. All that is contained within this frame sitting
    here now is called &quot;body.&quot; The &quot;mind&quot; is that which is aware and is
    thinking at this very moment. These two things are also called <i>&quot;nama&quot;</i> and
    <i>&quot;rupa.&quot;</i> <i>&quot;Nama&quot;</i> refers to that which has no <i>&quot;rupa,&quot;</i>
    or form. All thoughts and feelings, or the four mental <i>khandhas</i> of feeling,
    perception, volition and consciousness, are <i>nama,</i> they are all formless. When the
    eye sees form, that form is called <i>rupa,</i> while the awareness is called <i>nama.</i>
    Together they are called <i>nama</i> and <i>rupa,</i> or simply body and mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Understand that sitting here in this present moment are
    only body and mind. But we get these two things confused with each other. If you want
    peace you must know the truth of them. The mind in its present state is still untrained;
    it's dirty, not clear. It is not yet the pure mind. We must further train this mind
    through the practice of meditation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people think that meditation means to sit in some
    special way, but in actual fact standing, sitting, walking and reclining are all vehicles
    for meditation practice. You can practice at all times. <i>Samadhi</i> literally means
    &quot;the firmly established mind.&quot; To develop <i>samadhi</i> you don't have to go
    bottling the mind up. Some people try to get peaceful by sitting quietly and having
    nothing disturb them at all, but that's just like being dead. The practice of <i>samadhi</i>
    is for developing wisdom and understanding. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Samadhi</i> is the firm mind, the one-pointed mind. On
    which point is it fixed? It's fixed onto the point of balance. That's its point. But
    people practice meditation by trying to silence their minds. They say, &quot;I try to sit
    in meditation but my mind won't be still for a minute. One instant it flies off one place,
    the next instant it flies off somewhere else...How can I make it stop still?&quot; You
    don't have to make it stop, that's not the point. Where there is movement is where
    understanding can arise. People complain, &quot;It runs off and I pull it back again; then
    it goes off again and I pull it back once more...&quot; So they just sit there pulling
    back and forth like this. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">They think their minds are running all over the place, but
    actually it only seems like the mind is running around. For example, look at this hall
    here...&quot;Oh, it's so big!,&quot; you say ... actually it's not big at all. Whether or
    not it seems big depends on your perception of it. In fact this hall is just the size it
    is, neither big nor small, but people run around after their feelings all the time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meditating to find peace...You must understand what peace
    is. If you don't understand it you won't be able to find it. For example, suppose today
    you brought a very expensive pen with you to the monastery. Now suppose that, on your way
    here, you put the pen in your front pocket, but at a later time you took it out and put it
    somewhere else, such as the back pocket. Now when you search your front pocket...It's not
    there! You get a fright. You get a fright because of your misunderstanding, you don't see
    the truth of the matter. Suffering is the result. Whether standing, walking, coming and
    going, you can't stop worrying about your lost pen. Your wrong understanding causes you to
    suffer. Understanding wrongly causes suffering...&quot;Such a shame! I'd only bought that
    pen a few days ago and now it's lost.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But then you remember, &quot;Oh, of course! When I went to
    bathe I put the pen in my back pocket.&quot; As soon as you remember this you feel better
    already, even without seeing your pen. You see that? You're happy already, you can stop
    worrying about your pen. You're sure about it now. As you're walking along you run your
    hand over your back pocket and there it is. Your mind was deceiving you all along. The
    worry comes from your ignorance. Now, seeing the pen, you are beyond doubt, your worries
    are calmed. This sort of peace comes from seeing the cause of the problem, <i>samudaya,</i>
    the cause of suffering. As soon as you remember that the pen is in your back pocket there
    is <i>nirodha,</i> the cessation of suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So you must contemplate in order to find peace. What
    people usually refer to as peace is simply the calming of the mind, not the calming of the
    defilements. The defilements are simply being temporarily subdued, just like grass covered
    by a rock. In three or four days you take the rock off the grass and in no long time it
    grows up again. The grass hadn't really died, it was simply being suppressed. It's the
    same when sitting in meditation: the mind is calmed but the defilements are not really
    calmed. Therefore, <i>samadhi</i> is not a sure thing. To find real peace you must develop
    wisdom. <i>Samadhi</i> is one kind of peace, like the rock covering the grass...in a few
    days you take the rock away and the grass grows up again. This is only a temporary peace.
    The peace of wisdom is like putting the rock down and not lifting it up, just leaving it
    where it is. The grass can't possibly grow again. This is real peace, the calming of the
    defilements, the sure peace which results from wisdom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We speak of wisdom <i>(pañña)</i> and <i>samadhi</i> as
    separate things, but in essence they are one and the same. Wisdom is the dynamic function
    of <i>samadhi;</i> <i>samadhi</i> is the passive aspect of wisdom. They arise from the
    same place but take different directions, different functions, like this mango here. A
    small green mango eventually grows larger and larger until it is ripe. It is all the same
    mango, the larger one and the ripe one are all the same mango, but its condition changes.
    In Dhamma practice, one condition is called <i>samadhi,</i> the later condition is called <i>pañña,</i>
    but in actuality <i>sila,</i> <i>samadhi,</i> and <i>pañña</i> are all the same thing,
    just like the mango. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In any case, in our practice, no matter what aspect you
    refer to, you must always begin from the mind. Do you know what this mind is? What is the
    mind like? What is it? Where is it?... Nobody knows. All we know is that we want to go
    over here or over there, we want this and we want that, we feel good or we feel bad... but
    the mind itself seems impossible to know. What is the mind? The mind hasn't any form. that
    which receives impressions, both good and bad, we call &quot;mind.&quot; It's like the
    owner of a house. The owner stays put at home while visitors come to see him. He is the
    one who receives the visitors. Who receives sense impressions? What is it that perceives?
    Who lets go of sense impressions? That is what we call &quot;mind.&quot; But people can't
    see it, they think themselves around in circles...&quot;What is the mind, what is the
    brain?&quot; ... Don't confuse the issue like this. What is it that receives impressions?
    Some impressions it likes and some it doesn't like... Who is that? Is there one who likes
    and dislikes? Sure there is, but you can't see it. That is what we call &quot;mind.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In our practice it isn't necessary to talk of <i>samatha</i>
    (concentration) or <i>vipassana</i> (insight), just call it the practice of Dhamma, that's
    enough. And conduct this practice from your own mind. What is the mind? The mind is that
    which receives, or is aware of, sense impressions. With some sense impressions there is a
    reaction of like, with others the reaction is dislike. That receiver of impressions leads
    us into happiness and suffering, right and wrong. But it doesn't have any form. We assume
    it to be a self, but it's really only <i>namadhamma.</i> Does &quot;goodness&quot; have
    any form? Does evil? Do happiness and suffering have any form? You can't find them. Are
    they round or are they square, short or long? Can you see them. These things are <i>namadhamma,</i>
    they can't be compared to material things, they are formless...but we know that they do
    exist. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore it is said to begin the practice by calming the
    mind. Put awareness into the mind. If the mind is aware it will be at peace. Some people
    don't go for awareness, they just want to have peace, a kind of blanking out. So they
    never learn anything. If we don't have this &quot;one who knows&quot; what is there to
    base our practice on? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If there is no long, there is no short, if there is no
    right there can be no wrong. People these days study away, looking for good and evil. But
    that which is beyond good and evil they know nothing of. All they know is the right and
    the wrong -- &quot;I'm going to take only what is right. I don't want to know about the
    wrong. Why should I?&quot; If you try to take only what is right in a short time it will
    go wrong again. Right leads to wrong. People keep searching among the right and wrong,
    they don't try to find that which is neither right nor wrong. They study about good and
    evil, they search for virtue, but they know nothing of that which is beyond good and evil.
    They study the long and the short, but that which is neither long nor short they know
    nothing of. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This knife has a blade, a rim and a handle. Can you lift
    only the blade? Can you lift only the rim of the blade, or the handle? The handle, the rim
    and the blade are all parts of the same knife: when you pick up the knife you get all
    three parts together. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the same way, if you pick up that which is good, the
    bad must follow. People search for goodness and try to throw away evil, but they don't
    study that which is neither good nor evil. If you don't study this there can be no
    completion. If you pick up goodness, badness follows. If you pick up happiness, suffering
    follows. The practice of clinging to goodness and rejecting evil is the Dhamma of
    children, it's like a toy. Sure, it's alright, you can take just this much, but if you
    grab onto goodness, evil will follow. The end of this path is confused, it's not so good. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Take a simple example. You have children -- now suppose
    you want to only love them and never experience hatred. This is the thinking of one who
    doesn't know human nature. If you hold onto love, hatred will follow. In the same way,
    people decide to study the Dhamma to develop wisdom, studying good and evil as closely as
    possible. Now, having known good and evil, what do they do? They try to cling to the good,
    and evil follows. They didn't study that which is beyond good and evil. This is what you
    should study. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I'm going to be like this,&quot; &quot;I'm going to
    be like that,&quot;... but they never say &quot;I'm not going to be anything because there
    really isn't any 'I'&quot;...This they don't study. All they want is goodness. If they
    attain goodness, they lose themselves in it. If things get too good they'll start to go
    bad, and so people end up just swinging back and forth like this. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to calm the mind and become aware of the
    perceiver of sense impressions, we must observe it. Follow the &quot;one who knows.&quot;
    Train the mind until it is pure. How pure should you make it? If it's really pure the mind
    should be above both good and evil, above even purity. It's finished. That's when the
    practice is finished. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What people call sitting in meditation is merely a
    temporary kind of peace. But even in such a peace there are experiences. If an experience
    arises there must be someone who knows it, who looks into it, queries it and examines it.
    If the mind is simply blank then that's not so useful. You may see some people who look
    very restrained and think they are peaceful, but the real peace is not simply the peaceful
    mind. It's not the peace which says, &quot;May I be happy and never experience any
    suffering.&quot; With this kind of peace, eventually even the attainment of happiness
    becomes unsatisfying. Suffering results. Only when you can make your mind beyond both
    happiness and suffering will you find true peace. That's the true peace. This is the
    subject most people never study, they never really see this one. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The right way to train the mind is to make it bright, to
    develop wisdom. Don't think that training the mind it simply sitting quietly. That's the
    rock covering the grass. People get drunk over it. They think that <i>samadhi</i> is
    sitting. That's just one of the words for <i>samadhi,</i> but really, if the mind has <i>samadhi</i>
    in the sitting posture, in the walking posture, in the standing and reclining postures.
    It's all practice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people complain, &quot;I can't meditate, I'm too
    restless. Whenever I sit down I think of this and that... I can't do it. I've got too much
    bad <i>kamma.</i> I should use up my bad <i>kamma</i> first and then come back and try
    meditating.&quot; Sure, just try it. Try using up your bad <i>kamma...</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is how people think. Why do they think like this?
    These so called hindrances are the things we must study. Whenever we sit, the mind
    immediately goes running off. We follow it and try to bring it back and observe it once
    more...then it goes off again. This is what you're supposed to be studying. Most people
    refuse to learn their lessons from nature...like a naughty schoolboy who refuses to do his
    homework. They don't want to see the mind changing. How are you going to develop wisdom?
    We have to live with change like this. When we know that the mind is just this way,
    constantly changing...when we know that this is its nature, we will understand it. We have
    to know when the mind is thinking good and bad, changing all the time, we have to know
    these things. If we understand this point, then even while we are thinking we can be at
    peace. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, suppose at home you have a pet monkey.
    Monkeys don't stay still for long, they like to jump around and grab onto things. That's
    how monkeys are. Now you come to the monastery and see the monkey here. This monkey
    doesn't stay still either, it jumps around just the same. But it doesn't bother you, does
    it? Why doesn't it bother you? Because you've raised a monkey before, you know what
    they're like. If you know just one monkey, no matter how many provinces you go to, no
    matter how many monkeys you see, you won't be bothered by them, will you? This is one who
    understands monkeys. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we understand monkeys then we won't become a monkey. If
    you don't understand monkeys you may become a monkey yourself! Do you understand? When you
    see it reaching for this and that, you shout, &quot;Hey!&quot; You get angry...&quot;That
    damned monkey!&quot; This is one who doesn't know monkeys. One who knows monkeys sees that
    the monkey at home and the monkey in the monastery are just the same. Why should you get
    annoyed by them? When you see what monkeys are like that's enough, you can be at peace. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Peace is like this. We must know sensations. Some
    sensations are pleasant, some are unpleasant, but that's not important. That's just their
    business. Just like the monkey. all monkeys are the same. We understand sensations as
    sometimes agreeable, sometimes not -- that's just their nature. We should understand them
    and know how to let them go. Sensations are uncertain. They are Transient, Imperfect and
    Ownerless. Everything that we perceive is like this. When eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body
    and mind receive sensations, we know them, just like knowing the monkey. Then we can be at
    peace. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When sensations arise, know them. Why do you run after
    them? Sensations are uncertain. One minute they are one way, the next minute another. They
    exist dependent on change. And all of us here exist dependent on change. The breath goes
    out then it must come in. It must have this change. Try only breathing in, can you do
    that? Or try just breathing out without taking in another breath ... can you do it? If
    there was no change like this how long could you live for? There must be both the in
    breath and the out breath. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sensations are the same. There must be these things. If
    there were sensations you could develop no wisdom. If there is no wrong there can be no
    right. You must be right first before you can see what is wrong, and you must understand
    the wrong first to be right. This is how things are. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the really earnest student, the more sensations the
    better. But many meditators shrink away from sensations, they don't want to deal with
    them. This is like the naughty schoolboy who won't go to school, won't listen to the
    teacher. These sensations are teaching us. When we know sensations then we are practicing
    Dhamma. The peace within sensations is just like understanding the monkey here. When you
    understand what monkeys are like you are no longer troubled by them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The practice of Dhamma is like this. It's not that the
    Dhamma is very far away, it's right with us. The Dhamma isn't about the angels on high or
    anything like that. It's simply about us, about what we are doing right now. Observe
    yourself. Sometimes there is happiness, sometimes suffering, sometimes comfort, sometimes
    pain, sometimes love, sometimes hate...this is Dhamma. Do you see it? You should know this
    Dhamma, you have to read your experiences. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You must know sensations before you can let them go. When
    you see that sensations are impermanent you will be untroubled by them. As soon as a
    sensation arises, just say to yourself, &quot;Hmmm...this is not a sure thing.&quot; When
    your mood changes...&quot;Hmmm, not sure.&quot; You can be at peace with these things,
    just like seeing the monkey and not being bothered by it. If you know the truth of
    sensations, that is knowing the Dhamma. You let go of sensations, seeing that they are all
    invariably uncertain. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What we call uncertainty here is the Buddha. The Buddha is
    the Dhamma. The Dhamma is the characteristic of uncertainty. Whoever sees the uncertainty
    of things sees the unchanging reality of them. That's what the Dhamma is like. And that is
    the Buddha. If you see the Dhamma you see the Buddha, seeing the Buddha, you see the
    Dhamma. If you know <i>aniccam,</i> uncertainty, you will let go of things and not grasp
    onto them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You say, &quot;Don't break my glass!&quot; Can you prevent
    something that's breakable from breaking? If it doesn't break now it will break later on.
    If you don't break it, someone else will. If someone else doesn't break it, one of the
    chickens will! The Buddha says to accept this. He penetrated the truth of these things,
    seeing that this glass is already broken. Whenever you use this glass you should reflect
    that it's already broken. Do you understand this? The Buddha's understanding was like
    this. He saw the broken glass within the unbroken one. Whenever its time is up it will
    break. Develop this kind of understanding. Use the glass, look after it, until when, one
    day, it slips out of your hand... &quot;Smash!&quot; ... no problem. Why is there no
    problem? Because you saw its brokenness before it broke! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But usually people say, &quot;I love this glass so much,
    may it never break.&quot; Later on the dog breaks it...&quot;I'll kill that damn
    dog!&quot; You hate the dog for breaking your glass. If one of your children breaks it
    you'll hate them too. Why is this? Because you've dammed yourself up, the water can't
    flow. You've made a dam without a spillway. The only thing the dam can do is burst, right?
    When you make a dam you must make a spillway also. When the water rises up too high, the
    water can flow off safely. When it's full to the brim you open your spillway. You have to
    have a safety valve like this. Impermanence is the safety valve of the Noble Ones. If you
    have this &quot;safety valve&quot; you will be at peace. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Standing, walking, sitting, lying down, practice
    constantly, using <i>sati</i> to watch over and protect the mind. This is <i>samadhi</i>
    and wisdom. They are both the same thing, but they have different aspects. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we really see uncertainty clearly, we will see that
    which is certain. The certainty is that things must inevitably be this way, they cannot be
    otherwise. Do you understand? Knowing just this much you can know the Buddha, you can
    rightly do reverence to him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As long as you don't throw out the Buddha you won't
    suffer. As soon as you throw out the Buddha you will experience suffering. As soon as you
    throw out the reflections on Transience, Imperfection and Ownerlessness you'll have
    suffering. If you can practice just this much it's enough; suffering won't arise, or if it
    does arise you can settle it easily, and it will be a cause for suffering not arising in
    the future. This is the end of our practice, at the point where suffering doesn't arise.
    And why doesn't suffering arise? because we have sorted out the cause of suffering, <i>samudaya.</i>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For instance, if this glass were to break, normally you
    would experience suffering. We know that this glass will be a cause for suffering, so we
    get rid of the cause. All <i>dhammas</i> arise because of a cause. They must also cease
    because of a cause. Now if there is suffering on account of this glass here, we should let
    go of this cause. If we reflect beforehand that this glass is already broken, even when it
    hasn't, the cause ceases. When there is no longer any cause, that suffering is no longer
    able to exist, it ceases. This is cessation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You don't have to go beyond this point, just this much is
    enough. Contemplate this in your own mind. Basically you should all have the Five Precepts
    [<a name="21" href="#n21">21</a>] as a foundation for behavior. It's not necessary to go
    and study the Tipitaka, just concentrate on the Five Precepts first. At first you'll make
    mistakes. When you realize it, stop, come back and establish your precepts again. Maybe
    you'll go astray and make another mistake. When you realize it, re-establish yourself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Practicing like this, your sati will improve and become
    more consistent, just like the drops of water falling from a kettle. If we tilt the kettle
    just a little, the drops fall out slowly ...plop!...plop!...plop!...If we tilt the kettle
    up a little bit more, the drops become more rapid ... plop, plop, plop!!... If we tilt the
    kettle up even further the &quot;plops&quot; go away and the water flows into a steady
    stream. Where do the &quot;plops&quot; go to? They don't go anywhere, they change into a
    steady stream of water. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have to talk about the Dhamma like this, using similes,
    because the Dhamma has no form. Is it square or is it round? You can't say. The only way
    to talk about it is through similes like this. Don't think that the Dhamma is far away
    from you. It lies right with you, all around. Take a look ... one minute happy, the next
    sad, the next angry ... it's all Dhamma. Look at it and understand. Whatever it is that
    causes suffering you should remedy. If suffering is still there, take another look, you
    don't yet see clearly. If you could see clearly you wouldn't suffer, because the cause
    would no longer be there. If suffering is still there, if you're still having to endure,
    then you're not yet on the right track. Wherever you get stuck, whenever you're suffering
    too much, right there you're wrong. whenever you're so happy you're floating in the
    clouds...there...wrong again! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you practice like this you will have <i>sati</i> at all
    times, in all postures. With <i>sati,</i> recollection, and <i>sampajañña,</i> self
    awareness, you will know right and wrong, happiness and suffering. Knowing these things,
    you will know how to deal with them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I teach meditation like this. When it's time to sit in
    meditation then sit, that's not wrong. You should practice this also. But meditation is
    not only sitting. You must allow your mind to fully experience things, allow them to flow
    and consider their nature. How should you consider them? See them as Transient, Imperfect
    and Ownerless. It's all uncertain. &quot;This is so beautiful, I really must have
    it.&quot; That's not a sure thing. &quot;I don't like this at all&quot; ... tell yourself
    right there, &quot;Not sure!&quot; Is this true? Absolutely, no mistake. But just try
    taking things for real...&quot;I'm going to get this thing for sure&quot; ... You've gone
    off the track already. Don't do this. No matter how much you like something, you should
    reflect that it's uncertain. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some kinds of food seem so delicious, but still you should
    reflect that it's not a sure thing. It may seem so sure, it's so delicious, but still you
    must tell yourself, &quot;not sure!&quot; If you want to test out whether it's sure or
    not, try eating your favorite food every day. Every single day, mind you. Eventually
    you'll complain, &quot;This doesn't taste so good anymore.&quot; Eventually you'll think,
    &quot;Actually I prefer that kind of food.&quot; That's not a sure thing either! You must
    allow things to flow, just like the in and out breaths. There has to be both the in breath
    and the out breath, the breathing depends on change. Everything depends on change like
    this. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These things lie with us, nowhere else. If we no longer
    doubt whether sitting, standing, walking, or reclining, we will be at peace. <i>Samadhi</i>
    isn't just sitting. some people sit until they fall into a stupor. They might as well be
    dead, they can't tell north from south. Don't take it to such an extreme. If you feel
    sleepy then walk, change your posture. Develop wisdom. If you are really tired then have a
    rest. As soon as you wake up then continue the practice, don't let yourself drift into a
    stupor. You must practice like this. Have reason, wisdom, circumspection. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Start the practice for your own mind and body, seeing them
    as impermanent. Everything else is the same. Keep this in mind when you think the food is
    so delicious...you must tell yourself...&quot;Not a sure thing!&quot; You have to slug it
    first. But usually it just slugs you every time, doesn't it? If you don't like anything
    you just suffer over it. This is how things slug us. &quot;If she likes me, I like
    her,&quot; they slug us again. You never get a punch in! You must see it like this.
    Whenever you like anything just say to yourself, &quot;This is not a sure thing!&quot; You
    have to go against the grain somewhat in order to really see the Dhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Practice in all postures. Sitting, standing, walking,
    lying...you can experience anger in any posture, right? You can be angry while walking,
    while sitting, while lying down. You can experience desire in any posture. So our practice
    must extend to all postures; standing, walking, sitting and lying down. It must be
    consistent. Don't just put on a show, really do it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While sitting in meditation, some incident might arise.
    Before that one is settled another one comes racing in. Whenever these things come up,
    just tell yourself, &quot;not sure, not sure.&quot; Just slug it before it gets a chance
    to slug you. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now this is the important point. If you know that all
    things are impermanent, all your thinking will gradually unwind. When you reflect on the
    uncertainty of everything that passes, you'll see that all things go the same way.
    Whenever anything arises, all you need to say is, &quot;Oh, another one!&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Have you ever seen flowing water?...have you ever seen
    still water?...If your mind is peaceful it will be just like still, flowing water. Have
    you ever seen still, flowing water? There! You've only ever seen flowing water and still
    water, haven't you? But you've never seen still, flowing water. Right there, right where
    your thinking cannot take you, even though it's peaceful you can develop wisdom. Your mind
    will be like flowing water, and yet it's still. It's almost as if it were still, and yet
    it's flowing. So I call it &quot;still, flowing water.&quot; Wisdom can arise here. </font></p>
