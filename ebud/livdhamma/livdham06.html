    size="6">M</font>ost people still don't know the essence of meditation practice. They
    think that walking meditation, sitting meditation and listening to Dhamma talks are the
    practice. That's true too, but these are only the outer forms of practice. The real
    practice takes place when the mind encounters a sense object. That's the place to
    practice, where sense contact occurs. When people say things we don't like there is
    resentment, if they say things we like we experience pleasure. Now this is the place to
    practice. How are we going to practice with these things? This is the crucial point. If we
    just run around chasing after happiness and away from suffering all the time we can
    practice until the day we die and never see the Dhamma. This is useless. When pleasure and
    pain arise how are we going to use the Dhamma to be free of them? This is the point of
    practice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Usually when people encounter something disagreeable to
    them they don't open up to it. Such as when people are criticized: &quot;Don't bother me!
    Why blame me?&quot; This is someone who's closed himself off. Right there is the place to
    practice. When people criticize us we should listen. Are they speaking the truth? We
    should be open and consider what they say. Maybe there is a point to what they say,
    perhaps there is something blame-worthy within us. They may be right and yet we
    immediately take offense. If people point out our faults we should strive to be rid of
    them and improve ourselves. This is how intelligent people will practice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Where there is confusion is where peace can arise. When
    confusion is penetrated with understanding what remains is peace. Some people can't accept
    criticism, they're arrogant. Instead they turn around and argue. This is especially so
    when adults deal with children. Actually children may say some intelligent things
    sometimes but if you happen to be their mother, for instance, you can't give in to them.
    If you are a teacher your students may sometimes tell you something you didn't know, but
    because you are the teacher you can't listen. This is not right thinking. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Buddha's time there was one disciple who was very
    astute. At one time, as the Buddha was expounding the Dhamma, he turned to this monk and
    asked, &quot;Sariputta, do you believe this?&quot; Venerable Sariputta replied, &quot;No,
    I don't yet believe it.&quot; The Buddha praised his answer. &quot;That's very good,
    Sariputta, you are one who us endowed with wisdom. One who is wise doesn't readily
    believe, he listens with an open mind and then weighs up the truth of that matter before
    believing or disbelieving.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now the Buddha here has set a fine example for a teacher.
    What Venerable Sariputta said was true, he simply spoke his true feelings. Some people
    would think that to say you didn't believe that teaching would be like questioning the
    teacher's authority, they'd be afraid to say such a thing. They'd just go ahead and agree.
    This is how the worldly way goes. But the Buddha didn't take offense. He said that you
    needn't be ashamed of those things which aren't wrong or bad. It's not wrong to say that
    you don't believe if you don't believe. That's why Venerable Sariputta said, &quot;I don't
    yet believe it.&quot; The Buddha praised him. &quot;This monk has much wisdom. He
    carefully considers before believing anything.&quot; The Buddha's actions here are a good
    example for one who is a teacher of others. Sometimes you can learn things even from small
    children; don't cling blindly to positions of authority. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whether you are standing, sitting, or walking around in
    various places, you can always study the things around you. We study in the natural way,
    receptive to all things, be they sights, sounds, smells, tastes, feelings or thoughts. The
    wise person considers them all. In the real practice, we come to the point where there are
    no longer any concerns weighing on the mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we still don't know like and dislike as they arise,
    there is still some concern in our minds. If we know the truth of these things, we
    reflect, &quot;Oh, there is nothing to this feeling of liking here. It's just a feeling
    that arises and passes away. Dislike is nothing more, just a feeling that arises and
    passes away. Why make anything out of them?&quot; If we think that pleasure and pain are
    personal possessions, then we're in for trouble, we never get beyond the point of having
    some concern or other in an endless chain. This is how things are for most people. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But these days they don't often talk about the mind when
    teaching the Dhamma, they don't talk about the truth. If you talk the truth people even
    take exception. They say things like, &quot;He doesn't know time and place, he doesn't
    know how to speak nicely.&quot; But people should listen to the truth. A true teacher
    doesn't just talk from memory, he speaks the truth. People in society usually speak from
    memory, he speaks the truth. People in the society usually speak from memory, and what's
    more they usually speak in such a way as to exalt themselves. The true monk doesn't talk
    like that, he talks the truth, the way things are. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">No matter how much he explains the truth it's difficult
    for people to understand. It's hard to understand the Dhamma. If you understand the Dhamma
    you should practice accordingly. It may not be necessary to become a monk, although the
    monk's life is the ideal form for practice. To really practice, you have to forsake the
    confusion of the world, give up family and possessions, and take to the forests. These are
    the ideal places to practice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But if we still have family and responsibilities how are
    we to practice? Some people say it's impossible to practice Dhamma as a layperson.
    Consider, which group is larger, monks or laypeople? There are far more laypeople. Now if
    only the monks practice and laypeople don't, then that means there's going to be a lot of
    confusion. This is wrong understanding. &quot;I can't become a monk...&quot; Becoming a
    monk isn't the point! Being a monk doesn't mean anything if you don't practice. If you
    really understand the practice of dhamma then no matter what position or profession you
    hold in life, be it a teacher, doctor, civil servant or whatever, you can practice the
    Dhamma every minute of the day. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To think you can't practice as a layman is to lose track
    of the path completely. Why is it people can find the incentive to do other things? If
    they feel they are lacking something they make an effort to obtain it. If there is
    sufficient desire people can do anything. some say, &quot;I haven't got time to practice
    the Dhamma.&quot; I say, &quot;Then how come you've got time to breathe?&quot; Breathing
    is vital to people's lives. If they saw Dhamma practice as vital to their lives they would
    see it as important as their breathing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The practice of dhamma isn't something you have to go
    running around for or exhaust yourself over. Just look at the feelings which arise in your
    mind. When the eye sees form, ear hears sounds, nose smells odors and so on, they all come
    to this one mind, &quot;the one who knows.&quot; Now when the mind perceives these things
    what happens? If we like that object we experience pleasure, if we dislike it we
    experience displeasure. That's all there is to it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So where are you going to find happiness in this world? Do
    you expect everybody to say only pleasant things to you all your life? Is that possible?
    No, it's not. If it's not possible then where are you going to go? The world is simply
    like this, we must know the world -- <i>Lokavidu</i> -- know the truth of this world. The
    world is something we should clearly understand. The Buddha lived in this world, he didn't
    live anywhere else. He experienced family life, but he saw its limitations and detached
    himself from them. Now how are you as laypeople going to practice? If you want to practice
    you must make an effort to follow the path. If you persevere with the practice you too
    will see the limitations of this world and be able to let go. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People who drink alcohol sometimes say, &quot;I just can't
    give it up.&quot; Why can't they give it up? Because they don't yet see the liability in
    it. If they clearly saw the liability of it they wouldn't have to wait to be told to give
    it up. If you don't see the liability of something that means you also can't see the
    benefit of giving it up. Your practice becomes fruitless, you are just playing at
    practice. If you clearly see the liability and the benefit of something you won't have to
    wait for others to tell you about it. Consider the story of the fisherman who finds
    something in his fish-trap. He knows something is in there, he can hear it flapping about
    inside. Thinking it's a fish, he reaches his hand into the trap, only to find a different
    kind of animal. He can't yet see it, so he's in two minds about it. On one hand it could
    be an eel, [<a name="13" href="#n13">13</a>] but then again it could be a snake. If he
    throws it away he may regret it...it could be an eel. On the other hand, if he keeps
    holding on to it and it turns out to be a snake it may bite him. He's caught in a state of
    doubt. His desire is so strong he holds on, just in case it's an eel, but the minute he
    brings it and sees the striped skin he throws it down straight away. He doesn't have to
    wait for someone to call out, &quot;It's a snake, it's a snake, let go!&quot; The sight of
    the snake tells him what to do much more clearly than words could do. Why? Because he sees
    the danger -- snakes can bite! Who has to tell him about it? In the same way, if we
    practice till we see things as they are we won't meddle with things that are harmful. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People don't usually practice in this way, they usually
    practice for other things. They don't contemplate things, they don't reflect on old age,
    sickness and death. They only talk about non-aging and non-death, so they never develop
    the right feeling for Dhamma practice. They go and listen to Dhamma talks but they don't
    really listen. Sometimes I get invited to give talks at important functions, but it's a
    nuisance for me to go. Why so? Because when I look at the people gathered there I can see
    that they haven't come to listen to the Dhamma. Some are smelling of alcohol, some are
    smoking cigarettes, some are chatting... they don't look at all like people who have come
    out of faith in the Dhamma. Giving talks at such places is of little fruit. People who are
    sunk in heedlessness tend to think things like, &quot;When he's ever going to stop
    talking? ... Can't do this, can't do that ...&quot; and their minds just wander all over
    the place. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes they even invite me to give a talk just for the
    sake of formality: &quot;Please give us just a small Dhamma talk, Venerable Sir.&quot;
    They don't want me to talk too much, it might annoy them! As soon as I hear people say
    this I know what they're about. These people don't like listening to Dhamma. It annoys
    them. If I just give a small talk they won't understand. If you take only a little food,
    is it enough? Of course not. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes I'm giving a talk, just warming up to the
    subject, and some drunkard will call out, &quot;Okay, make way, make way for the Venerable
    Sir, he's coming out now!&quot; -- trying to drive me away! If I meet this kind of person
    I get a lot of food for reflection, I get an insight into human nature. It's like a person
    having a bottle full of water and then asking for more. There's nowhere to put it. It
    isn't worth the time and energy to teach them, because their minds are already full. Pour
    any more in and it just overflows uselessly. If their bottle was empty there would be
    somewhere to put the water, and both the giver and the receiver would benefit. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this way, when people are really interested in Dhamma
    and sit quietly, listening carefully, I feel more inspired to teach. If people don't pay
    attention it's just like the man with the bottle full of water... there's no room to put
    anymore. It's hardly worth my while talking to them. In situations like this I just don't
    get any energy arising to teach. You can't put much energy into giving when no-one's
    putting much energy into receiving. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These days giving talks tends to be like this, and it's
    getting worse all the time. People don't search for truth, they study simply to find the
    necessary knowledge to make a living, raise families and look after themselves. They study
    for a livelihood. There may be some study of Dhamma, but not much. Students nowadays have
    much more knowledge than students of previous times. They have all the requisites at their
    disposal, everything is more convenient. But they also have a lot more confusion and
    suffering than before. Why is this? Because they only look for the kind of knowledge used
    to make a living. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even the monks are like this. Sometimes I hear them say,
    &quot;I didn't become a monk to practice the Dhamma, I only ordained to study.&quot; These
    are the words of someone who has completely cut off the path of practice. There's no way
    ahead, it's a dead end. When these monks teach it's only from memory. They may teach one
    thing but their minds are in completely different place. Such teachings aren't true. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is how the world is. If you try to live simply,
    practicing the Dhamma and living peacefully, they say you are weird and anti-social. They
    say you're obstructing progress in society. They even intimidate you. Eventually you might
    even start to believe them and revert to the worldly ways, sinking deeper and deeper into
    the world until it's impossible to get out. Some people say, &quot;I can't get out now,
    I've gone in to deeply.&quot; This is how society tends to be. It doesn't appreciate the
    value of Dhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The value of Dhamma isn't to be found in books. those are
    just the external appearances of Dhamma, they're not the realization of Dhamma as a
    personal experience. If you realize the Dhamma you realize your own mind, you see the
    truth there. When the truth becomes apparent it cuts off the stream of delusion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The teaching of the Buddha is the unchanging truth,
    whether in the present or in any other time. The Buddha revealed this truth 2,500 years
    ago and it's been the truth ever since. This teaching should not be added to or taken away
    from. The Buddha said, &quot;What the <i>Tathagata</i> has laid down should not be
    discarded, what has not been laid down by the <i>Tathagata</i> should not be added on to
    the teachings.&quot; He &quot;sealed off&quot; the Teachings. Why did the Buddha seal them
    off? Because these Teachings are the words of one who has no defilements. No matter how
    the world may change these Teachings are unaffected, they don't change with it. If
    something is wrong, even if people say it's right doesn't make it any the less wrong. If
    something is right, it doesn't change any just because people say it's not. Generation
    after generation may come and go but these things don't change, because these Teachings
    are the truth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now who created this truth? The truth itself created the
    truth! Did the Buddha create it? No, he didn't. The Buddha only <i>discovered</i> the
    truth, the way things are, and then he set out to declare it. The truth is constantly
    true, whether a Buddha arises in the world or not. The Buddha only &quot;owns&quot; the
    Dhamma in this sense, he didn't actually create it. It's been here all the time. However,
    previously no-one had searched for and found the Deathless, then taught it as the Dhamma.
    He didn't invent it, it was already there. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At some point in time the truth is illuminated and the
    practice of Dhamma flourishes. As time goes on and generations pass away the practice
    degenerates until the Teaching fades away completely. After a time the Teaching is
    re-founded and flourishes once more. As time goes on the adherents of the Dhamma multiply,
    prosperity sets in, and once more the Teaching begins to follow the darkness of the world.
    And so once more it degenerates until such a time as it can no longer hold ground.
    Confusion reigns once more. Then it is time to re-establish the truth. In fact the truth
    doesn't go anywhere. When Buddhas pass away the Dhamma doesn't disappear with them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The world revolves like this. It's something like a mango
    tree. The tree matures, blossoms, and fruits appear and grow to ripeness. They become
    rotten and the seed goes back into the ground to become a new mango tree. The cycle starts
    once more. Eventually there are more ripe fruits which proceed to fall, rot, sink into the
    ground as seeds and grow once more into trees. This is how the world is. It doesn't go
    very far, it just revolves around the same old things. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our lives these days are the same. Today we are simply
    doing the same old things we've always done. People think too much. There are so many
    things for them to get interested in, but none of them leads to completion. There are the
    sciences like mathematics, physics, psychology and so on. You can delve into any number of
    them but you can only finalize things with the truth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose there was a cart being pulled by an ox. The wheels
    aren't long, but the tracks are. As long as the ox pulls the cart the tracks will follow.
    The wheels are round yet the tracks are long; the tracks are long yet the wheels are
    merely circles. Just looking at a stationary cart you can't see anything long about it,
    but once the ox starts moving you see the tracks stretching out behind you. As long as the
    ox pulls, the wheels keep on turning...but there comes a day when the ox tires and throws
    off its harness. The ox walks off and leaves the empty cart sitting there. The wheels no
    longer turn. In time the cart falls apart, its components go back into the four elements
    -- earth, water, wind and fire. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Searching for peace within the world you stretch the cart
    wheel tracks endlessly behind you. As long as you follow the world there is no stopping,
    no rest. If you simply stop following it, the cart comes to rest, the wheels no longer
    turn. Following the world turns the wheels ceaselessly. Creating bad <i>kamma</i> is like
    this. As long as you follow the old ways there is no stopping. If you stop there is
    stopping. This is how we practice the Dhamma. </font></p>
