  <h2 align="center"><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">The myth of Hinayana</font></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman"><em>Kare A. Lie</em></font></h3>
  <hr width="25%" align="center">
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>n the centuries around the birth of
  Christ there was a radical development going on in Buddhism. A new school was born, and
  its adherents called it <strong>Mahayana</strong>. How this new school differed from the
  earlier schools, can be found in any history of Buddhism. Here we will concentrate on one
  of the results of this schism: the term <strong>Hinayana</strong>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The adherents of the older schools criticized the
  Mahayanists, especially for creating new sutras, forging the word of the Buddha. The
  Mahayanists on the other side reacted to that critique by accusing their opponents of not
  understanding the teaching of the Buddha at all and for beeing narrowminded egoists. The
  debate got heated, and accusations flowed from both sides. Then some brilliant person at
  the Mahayana side of the debate created the word pair Mahayana/Hinayana, and it stuck.
  They called their opponents Hinayana, and this word worked excellently as an insult &#150;
  with a simplicity and a parallellity to Mahayana that any fool could grasp.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hinayana, or, more correctly,<em> hiinayaana</em>, is a
  highly derogatory term. It does not simply mean &quot;Lesser vehicle&quot; as one often
  can see stated. The second element of <em>hiina-yaana</em> &#150; that is <em>yaana</em>
  &#150; means vehicle. But hiina very seldom has the simple meaning of &quot;lesser&quot;
  or &quot;small&quot;. If that had been the case, the Pali (or Sanskrit) texts would have
  used it in other connections as an opposite of <em>mahaa</em> &#150; big. But they don't.
  The opposite of <em>mahaa</em> is <em>cuu.la</em>, so this is the normal word for
  &quot;small&quot;. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The term Hinayana is an echo of a debate long dead &#150;
  or rather a debate where the one party is dead and the other one is shouting to the winds.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Who were the opponents who were labeled Hinayana?
  Theravada? Probably not. At the time when Mahayana was born, Theravada had mainly
  &quot;emigrated&quot; to Sri Lanka, and could hardly be counted among the dominating
  schools on the Indian mainland &#150; where the Mahayana/Hinayana debate took place. The
  most influential of the old schools at that time, was Sarvastivada, so they were the most
  probable &#150; but hardly the only &#150; targets for the
  &quot;Hinayana&quot;-invectives. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now the Sarvastivada and the other early schools of India
  at that time are long dead, except Theravada, but the debate and the arguments found their
  way into the Mahayana sutras, as for instance is apparent from the anti-Hinayana
  propaganda in the Lotus sutra &#150; and keep echoing in the Mahayana and Vajrayana
  teaching. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today there is confusion, for the Mahayanists/Vajrayanists
  use the term Hinayana in three different ways:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">1) In the historical sense: Pre-Mahayanist
    schools are called Hinayana.<br>
    2) Modern Theravada is confused with Hinayana.<br>
    3) The term Hinayana is used for an internal part of the Mahayana/Vajrayana teaching.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's have a closer look on these three usages.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) Some assert that the word Hinayana as a term for the
  earlier schools is a usage that belongs to the distant past only. This is not correct. It
  can be found in several modern reference works, and in more specialist literature it can
  for instance be found in H.V. Guenther, <i>Buddhist Philosophy In Theory and Practice</i>,
  citing Tibetan works from the 18th and the 20th century.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">2) As an example of confusing Hinayana with Theravada, I
  will quote from the Bibliography of Jane Hope (Jane Hope studied with Chogyam Trungpa
  Rinpoche.), <i>Buddha for beginners</i>, printed in 1995 (I only have the Norwegian
  version available, so I hope my retranslation back into English will not be too
  inaccurate): &quot;Hinayana Buddhism. A good introduction to the traditional Hinayana
  Buddhism is <i>What the Buddha Taught</i>, Walpola Rahula ... From a present point of view
  and written by two Westerners trained in the Theravada tradition, is ... <i>Seeking the
  Heart of Wisdom</i>, by Joseph Goldstein &amp; Jack Kornfield ...&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">3) Now for a persistent confusion that has its basis in
  Tibetan Buddhism. Some say that Hinayana and Mahayana from very early on are two terms
  used to describe two different spiritual attitudes, and quote from the 7th chapter
  (&quot;Loving Kindness and Compassion&quot;) of the Tibetan classic<i> The Jewel Ornament
  of Liberation</i> written in the 10th century, where the author, Jé Gampopa refers to
  Hinayana as &quot;lower capacity&quot; (<em>&quot;theg pa dman pa&quot;</em>). The
  paragraph reads as follows: &quot;&#145;Clinging to the well-being of mere peace (1)'
  signifies the lower capacity attitude (2) wherein the longing to transcend suffering is
  focused on oneself alone. This precludes the cherishing of others and hence there is
  little development of altruism. [...] When loving kindness and compassion become part of
  one, there is so much care for other conscious beings that one could not bear to liberate
  oneself alone. [...] Master <em>Manjushriikiirti </em>has said: &#145;A <em>Mahaayaana</em>
  follower should not be without loving kindness and compassion for even a single moment',
  and &#145;It is not anger and hatred but loving kindness and compassion that vouchsafe the
  welfare of others'.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The footnotes to this passage read as follows: (1) The
  Tibetan <em>zhi.ba</em> means &quot;peace&quot;. It is translated as &quot;mere
  peace&quot; in this section of the book, since it is used by Gampopa to denote the
  relatively compassionless peace that results from developing only concentration
  meditation. (2) Hinayana: &quot;lesser capacity&quot; often translated as &quot;lesser
  vehicle&quot;. The term implies the ability to carry a burden. In this case the burden is
  oneself since one's commitment is to bring oneself to liberation, not everyone (as is the
  case in the Mahayana, the &quot;greater capacity&quot;).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The problem and confusion here is of course that this
  analysis does not refer directly to the Pali/Sanskrit word <em>hiinayaana</em>, but to its
  Tibetan translation <em>&quot;theg pa dman pa&quot;</em>. This is a key issue, as will be
  shown below.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The word Hinayana is not Tibetan, it is not Chinese,
  English or Bantu. It is Pali and Sanskrit. Therefore, the only sensible approach for
  finding the meaning of the word, is to study how the word hiinayaana is used in the Pali
  and Sanskrit texts. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second element, <em>-yaana</em>, means vehicle. There
  is no dissent about this.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">How then is &quot;<em>hiina</em>&quot; used in the
  canonical Pali texts?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every Buddhist knows the first recorded sermon of the
  Buddha, the Dhammacakkappavattanasutta spoken to the five ascets who became the first five
  bhikkhus. There the Buddha says: &quot;These two extremes, monks, are not to be practised
  by one who has gone forth from the world. What are the two? That conjoined with the
  passions and luxury, low (<em>hiina</em>), coarse, vulgar, ignoble and harmful ...&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Knowing that the sutta style often use strings of synonyms
  this way, so that they strengthen and define each other, one can regard &quot;coarse,
  vulgar, ignoble and harmful&quot; as auxiliary definitions of &quot;<em>hiina</em>&quot;
  in this case.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here the Buddha clearly denotes the path not to be
  practised, as <em>hiina</em>. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In other Pali texts and commentaries hiina often occurs in
  the combination <em>hiina-majjhima-pa.niita,</em> that is: bad - medium - good. In the
  context of <em>hiina - majjhima - pa.niita</em> (or sometimes only <em>hiina - pa.niita</em>)
  the word <em>hiina</em> is always used as a term for undesirable qualities, like for
  instance hatred, greed and ignorance. It obviously means &quot;low, undesirable,
  despicable&quot; &#150; and not &quot;small&quot; or &quot;lesser&quot;.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The commentary <i>Mahaniddesa-atthakatha</i>, one of the
  texts where this triad occurs, defines the word thus: <em>hiinattike hiinaati laamakaa</em>
  (In the <em>hiina</em>-triad <em>&quot;hiina&quot;</em> is <em>&quot;laamakaa&quot;</em>).
  Now <em>laamaka</em> is defined by the PTS Dictionary in this way: &quot;insignificant,
  poor, inferior, bad, sinful. The usual synonym is <em>paapa</em>&quot;. And paapa means
  &quot;bad, evil&quot;. So it seems the definitions go from bad to worse here. The
  commentary then gives examples, and explains that desires that cause rebirth in <em>niraya</em>
  (hell, purgatory) are hiina.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now for Sanskrit texts. In <i>Lalitavistara</i> we find a
  version of the<em> Dhammacakkappavattanasutta</em>, where the word <em>&quot;hiina&quot;</em>
  is used exactly as in the above citation from the Pali-version of that sutta. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In <i>Mahayanasutralankara</i> by Asanga, which is a very
  representativ Mahayana text, we find something of interest for our quest. Asanga says:
  &quot;There are three groups of people: <em>hiina-madhyama-vishishta</em> ...(bad &#150;
  medium &#150; excellent).&quot; This expression is parallell to the Pali: <em>hiina-majjhima-pa.niita</em>,
  and goes to show that the Mahayanists who coined the therm &quot;<em>hiinayaana</em>&quot;,
  regarded &quot;<em>hiina</em>&quot; as a derogatory term, with the same meaning as in the
  Pali texts.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A very interesting text is an edition of the <i>Catushparishatsutra</i>
  where the text is presented in four parallell columns: Sanskrit, Pali (Mahavagga), Tibetan
  and a German translation from a Chinese version. Here, again, we find the
  Dhammacakkappavattanasutta. We have already looked into the Sanskrit and Pali. The German
  version from the Chinese says: <em>&quot;Erstens: Gefallen zu finden an und anzunehmen die
  niedrigen und üblen Sitten der gewöhnliche Personen ...&quot;</em> It is a little
  unclear wether it here is <em>&quot;niedrigen&quot;</em> (despicable) or <em>&quot;üblen&quot;</em>
  (evil, bad) that corresponds to <em>&quot;hiina&quot;</em>. But it at least is clear that
  the strongly negative connotation of <em>&quot;hiina&quot;</em> was carried over into the
  Chinese translation. So far nothing had changed from the Pali and Sanskrit meanings.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the the Tibetan column, we find that the Tibetan word <em>&quot;dman-pa&quot;</em>
  takes the place corresponding to the Sanskrit <em>&quot;hiina&quot;</em>, matching the
  above quote from Jé Gampopa. And here we have the cause of later confusions and
  misunderstandings of the term <em>hiinayaana</em>. Let us see what Tibetan-English
  dictionaries say about <em>&quot;dman-pa&quot;:</em> Sarat Chandra Das' Dictionary says:
  &quot;<em>dman-pa</em>: low, in reference to quantity or quality, little&quot;. Jäschke's
  Dictionary is even more enlightening: &quot;<em>dman-pa</em>: 1. low, in reference to
  quantity, little. 2. in reference to quality: indifferent, inferior (Ssk: <em>hiina</em>).&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It thus seems that the Sanskrit word <em>hiina</em>, which
  without any reasonable doubt means &quot;of low quality&quot;, came to be translated by
  the Tibetan word <em>dman-pa</em>, which has the double meaning &quot;low quality&quot;
  and &quot;low quantity&quot;. And the above quote from Jé Gampopa seems to indicate that
  many Tibetans henceforth read only the latter of those two meanings into it, as
  &quot;lesser capacity&quot;, &quot;lower capacity&quot;, so that the meaning was distorted
  from &quot;low quality&quot; to &quot;low quantity&quot;.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus we see that the confusion arose from the fact that <em>dman-pa</em>
  has two meanings in Tibetan. Hinayana &#150; originally meaning &quot;vehicle of
  despicable quality&quot; &#150; thus acquired the new meaning &quot;vehicle of lower
  capacity&quot;. But this is a result of a wrong method. It is of course wrong to project
  the new Tibetan meaning back onto the Sanskrit/Pali word, and say that &quot;this is the
  meaning of Hinayana, because this is how the Tibetan masters explain it.&quot; What the
  Tibetan masters explain, is the Tibetan word <em>dman-pa</em>, not the Sanskrit word <em>hiina</em>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore it is clear that one can not assert that
  Hinayana has the &quot;mild&quot; meaning that the Tibetan tradition has given it, via the
  Tibetan word <em>dman-pa</em>. Hinayana is not Tibetan, it is Sanskrit/Pali, and its
  harsh, derogatory meaning is unchanged by any attempts of mitigation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What then, is Hinayana? Is it Theravada buddhism? No, that
  is both insulting and historically wrong. Is it a spiritual attitude inside the Mahayana
  and Vajrayana system? No, that is the Tibetan &quot;<em>theg pa dman pa&quot;</em>, the
  lower capacity attitude, and not the Sanskrit Hinayana, &quot;the inferior vehicle&quot;.
  Therefore, there is no Hinayana. <strong>Hinayana is nothing but a myth</strong>, although
  a confused and disruptive one, and wise Buddhists ought to lay that word at rest on the
  shelves of the Museum of Schisms, where it rightly belongs, and find other words to denote
  those spiritual attitudes that they wish to define.</font></p>
