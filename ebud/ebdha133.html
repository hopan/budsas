  <h2 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">The Brief History of the
  Great Councils</font></h2>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>(From the
  &quot;Teachings of the Buddha&quot;, Ministry of Religious Affairs, Myanmar, 1997)</i></strong></font></p>
  <hr width="25%">
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he Buddha attained
  Enlightenment in 589 B.C. At that time, he was thirty-five years old. Since then,
  throughout forty-five years he preached many discourses and disciplines diligently for
  welfare of all beings without regarding cold, heat, tiredness, weariness, and ailment.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha left his last words thus:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em>&quot;Ananda, the discourses and
    the disciplines I have taught and laid down to all of you will be your teacher when I am
    gone.&quot; </em></strong></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore it is clearly noted that the Buddha
  will remain alive so long as the discourses and the disciplines are in existence. Of
  course, the discourses and the disciplines are called <i><font COLOR="#800040">Sasana</font></i>,
  the Teachings of the Buddha. The permanency of Sasana relies on the existence of these
  discourses and disciplines. And vice versa, if they disappear the Buddha and his teachings
  will also disappear. When this happens, the whole world will be overwhelmed by the
  darkness of ignorance.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore the bhikkhus, the Buddha's
  disciples, have been successively striving for the preservation of the discourses and the
  disciplines so that they are not stained by mistakes and they do not disappear. But there
  had arisen many obstacles endangering the Buddha's Teachings through the ages. The
  bhikkhus have never neglected those obstacles and they tried to overcome them. Then they
  also held the Great Councils to promote and propagate the Buddha's Teachings. The
  successive kings, governments and the people contributed to the accomplishment of the
  Great Councils.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha attained Mahaparinibbana in 544
  B.C. That year was counted as the first year of the Buddhist Era. Now, two thousand and
  five hundred years have passed since the demise of the Buddha. During this time,
  altogether six great councils of Theravada Buddhism have been held. In these councils,
  many hundreds of Bhikkhus gathered together and recited the Buddha's discourses and
  disciplines in unity to approve the teachings of the Buddha. The discourses and the
  disciplines are recited in originality without any change, addition or modification.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The First Great
  Council</strong></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Three months after the demise of the Buddha
  the First Great Council was held in Sattapanni Cave Pavilion at Mount Vebhara near the
  city of Rajagaha. Subhadda, who became a bhikkhu in his old age, disparaged the Buddha's
  Teachings on the seventh day after the Buddha had passed away. On hearing those insulting
  words. Venerable Mahakassapa decided to hold the First Great Council. Five hundred
  arahats, including Venerable Upali and Venerable Ananda, took part in that council. It
  started on the fifth waning day of Wagaung (August) and lasted seven months.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Second Great
  Council</strong></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Second Council was held at Valukarama
  monastery, near the city of Vesali in 100 B.E. (443 B.C). It was held because the bhikkhus
  of the Vajji clan from Vesali preached and practised ten unlawful modifications in the
  Rules of the Order. The seven hundred arahats led by Venerable Yasa. Venerable Sabbakami
  and Venerable Revata took part in that council while King Kalasoka of Vesali and the
  people gave necessary supports to that council, it lasted eight months.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Third Great
  Council</strong></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Third Council was held at Asokarama
  Monastery in the city of Pataliputta in 235 B.E (308 B.C). Sixty thousand ascetics
  infiltrated into the Sangha Order, polluted the Sasana by their corrupt lives and
  heretical views. That is the main reason why the Third Council was held by one thousand
  arahats in order to protect the Sasana.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Venerable Mahamoggaliputta Tissa presided
  over the council. King Siridhammasoka of Pataliputta gave the necessary support to the
  council. It lasted nine months. After the Third Council, nine missions were sent to nine
  different places to propagate the Sasana. The mission of five arahats to Suvannabhumi,
  Myanmar, was led by Venerable Sona Thera and Venerable Uttara Thera.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Fourth Great
  Council</strong></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Fourth Council was held at Cave Aloka in
  Malaya district, Sri Lanka, in 450 B.E (94 B.C).</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The people of Sri Lanka were hard hit by
  rebels, hunger and starvation for twelve years. So the Bhikkhus had to make strong efforts
  to maintain the Buddha's Teachings. The elder bhikkhus foresaw that if there would appear
  such danger in future, the bhikkhus would not be able to memorize the discourses and the
  disciplines by heart because of the declination of their power of mindfulness,
  concentration and wisdom. Therefore, they held the Fourth Great Council.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It was during the reign of King Vattagamani
  that five hundred bhikkhus, led by Venerable Mahadhammarakkhita, inscribed the entire
  words of the Buddha's Teachings on palm leaves.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The heads and elders as well as the people of
  Malaya district gave all-round sup port to the council.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Fourth Great Council continued for one
  year.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Fifth Great
  Council</strong></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Fifth Council was convened at Mandalay in
  Myanmar on the first waning day of Tazaungmone, 1232 Myanmar Era, 2415 B.E (November,
  1871). The scriptures inscribed on palm-leaves could not last for a long time. Besides
  there might be many variations in rewriting the scriptures from copy to copy. Therefore,
  the scriptures were inscribed on marble slabs in order to dispel these disadvantages.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Two thousand and four hundred bhikkhus led by
  Venerable Jagarabhivamsa Thera (Tipitakadhara Mahadhammarajadhirajaguru) of Dakkhinarama
  Monastery, Mandalay, convened, to recite and approve the scriptures. King Mindon initiated
  and supported the Fifth Great Council to the end. The scriptures were first inscribed on
  seven hundred and twenty-nine marble slabs ) in the precinct of Lokamarajina Pagoda at the
  foot of Mandalay Hill. It took seven years, six months and fourteen days to finish this
  work. Then the bhikkhus recited to approve the inscriptions for five months and three
  days.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">After the Fifth Great Council. the Pali Texts
  were translated into Myanmar language, and the Doctrinal Order was promulgated to the
  whole country for purpose of purification and propagation of the Buddha's Teachings. </font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Sixth Great
  Council</strong></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">On the full-moon day of Kason, 1316, M.E.
  2498 B.E (May, 1954), the Sixth Great Council was held in the Mahapasana Great Cave,
  Kaba-Aye, Yangon, Myanmar.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The country of Myanmar had been one of the
  British Colonies for one hundred years and during this period the Buddha Sasana had
  deteriorated to some extent. So the Sixth Great Council was held aiming at the
  purification and promotion of the Buddha Sasana. Two thousand and five hundred bhikkhus
  from the five countries of Theravada Buddhism participated in that council. Nyaung Yan
  Sayadaw, Venerable Revata (Abhidhajamaharatthaguru), presided over it; the Mahasi Sayadaw,
  Venerable Sobhana (Aggamahapandita), and the Mingun Sayadaw, Venerable Vicittasarabhivamsa
  (Tipitakadhara Dhamma-bhandhagarika) took the leading roles in that council.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The doctrinal questions asked by the people
  of five Theravada Buddhist countries: Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia were
  solved magnanimously. Twenty- five other countries also gave much help to that council.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">At that Council, not only the canonical Pali
  Texts of the Buddha but also the commentaries and sub-commentaries were reexamined.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In this way, Venerable Mahakassapa and the
  custodians of the Dhamma held the great councils up to six times and approved the words of
  the Buddha without any change and modification. The Teaching of the Buddha thus approved
  is called Theravada Buddhism.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">On the full moon day of Nayon, 1342 M.E (June
  1980). the State Samgha Mahanayaka Committee comprising all sects was initiated in order
  to purify, perpetuate and propagate the Theravada Buddhism. Since then, the religious
  affairs have been carried out by the Samgha and the lay devotees of Myanmar hand in hand.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Under the patronage of the State Samgha
  Mahanayaka Committee, various measures have been taken for perpetuation and promotion of
  the Buddha Sasana and the moral development of the entire nation. The <i>Pali </i>Texts
  were translated into English; two State Pariyatti Sasana Universities were founded in
  Yangon and Mandalay with the contributions of the people. The lawful and the unlawful
  doctrines were discriminated and the unlawful ones were crushed down. Missions were sent
  not only to the states and divisions of the country but also to foreign countries for the
  propagation of Sasana.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This is the brief history of religious work
  carried out by successive Buddhist generations.</font></p>
