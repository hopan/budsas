        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>[The instructions
        given here are for those who want to practice meditation
        for an hour or so. So detailed instructions are given
        only for sitting meditation and walking meditation.] </strong></em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To practice meditation, you have to
    look first for a suitable place. A suitable place is a place
    which offers you the necessary seclusion for your meditation.
    You may find secluded places in nature. However, when you are
    meditating inside a house, you have to look for the place
    which is most suitable for meditation and you will then use
    this place for meditation each time. You may want to put up a
    statue or a picture of the Buddha, some flowers, a candle or
    some incense to assist your meditation, but these items are
    not so important as is the necessity for a secluded place
    where you will always practice your meditation in the future.
    </font></p>
    <p><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><b>SITTING
    MEDITATION: POSTURES</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To begin your meditation, please be
    seated in a comfortable posture, preferably in cross-legged
    position, and keep the upper portion of your body erect, but
    not stiff or tense. One of the two kinds of cross-legged
    position is recommended, namely, the half lotus position or
    the easy posture, which some teachers call &quot;Burmese
    posture&quot;. In the half lotus position one leg is put on
    top of the other, but in the easy posture one leg is put in
    front of the other, thus the pressure on either leg is
    minimized. If the any of the cross-legged position is still
    too difficult for you, you may take any sitting posture which
    is most comfortable for you. Because some comfort is
    necessary to continue the practice of meditation, you may
    even sit on a cushion, a chair or a bench. Though the
    cross-legged position is the ideal position for meditation,
    you have to decide for yourself in which position you can
    maintain your meditation best. Important in all sitting
    positions is that you keep the upper portion of your body
    erect. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><b>FORGIVENESS AND
    LOVING-KINDNESS</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Teachers of meditation suggested
    that we ask forgiveness from those whom we may have offended
    by deed, speech or thought; forgiving others and ourselves
    also clears our minds of ill-will. The practice of
    loving-kindness is also beneficial in that it calms our minds
    down so that we can go into <i>Vipassana</i> meditation
    smoothly. So, before we practice <i>Vipassana</i> meditation,
    we will practice forgiveness (which consists of asking
    forgiveness from others, forgiving others and forgiving
    ourselves), and loving-kindness meditation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We practice forgiveness to remove
    any guilt feelings. Sometimes you did something wrong to
    somebody by body, speech or in mind and then you have this
    feeling of guilt. Especially, when you are meditating, you
    want to keep your mind pure but these thoughts come to you
    again and again and spoil your meditation. Like cleaning the
    slate, you first ask forgiveness from others. This is one
    aspect. The other aspect is to forgive others. There may be
    somebody who has done something wrong to you and you have
    some anger or grudge against that person. You have to get rid
    of this anger or grudge, too. In order to practice loving
    kindness fully, you must be able to send thoughts of
    loving-kindness to all beings without exception. But if you
    cannot forgive some people (including yourself), you will not
    be able to practice loving-kindness meditation fully. So,
    loving-kindness and forgiveness go together. And thirdly, you
    forgive yourself. Sometimes, you find it more difficult to
    forgive yourself than to forgive others. If you cannot
    forgive yourself, you will not be able to practice
    loving-kindness to yourself; and if you cannot practice
    loving-kindness to yourself, it is very unlikely that you can
    practice it to other beings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, before entering <i>Vipassana</i>
    meditation, you have to practice forgiveness; after that you
    practice loving-kindness meditation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Loving-kindness is a kind of love,
    i.e., love without attachment, craving or lust. It is a
    wholesome and genuine desire for the well-being of all beings
    including ourselves. So when you practice loving-kindness and
    wish for your own happiness, saying, &quot;May I be well,
    happy and peaceful&quot;, thisshould not be interpreted as
    selfishness because, in order to send out thoughts of
    loving-kindness to others, we have to generate these thoughts
    first in ourselves. Also, when you send thoughts to yourself,
    you can take yourself as an example. That means, when you
    say, &quot;May I be well, happy, and peaceful,&quot; you
    think, &quot;Just as I want to be well, happy and peaceful,
    so do all other beings. So may they also be well, happy and
    peaceful.&quot; To be able to practice loving-kindness
    towards other beings, you first have to practice loving
    kindness towards yourself. Then you send your thoughts to
    other beings. You can send these thoughts in different ways.
    You can send thoughts to all beings by location. You can send
    loving-kindness to all beings in this house. By &quot;all
    beings&quot; we mean not only human beings, but also animals,
    insects, etc. Then you send loving-kindness to all beings in
    this area, in this city, in this county, in this state, in
    this country, in this world, in this universe, and last, to
    all beings in general. When you say the sentences to
    yourself, please, mean them and try to see and visualize the
    beings you mention as really well, happy, and peaceful, and
    your thoughts of loving-kindness reaching them, touching
    them, embracing them and making them really well, happy, and
    peaceful. It will take about fifteen minutes. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When practicing
        forgiveness, fold your hands up, and say:<br>
        <em>&quot;If by deed, speech or thought, Foolishly I have
        done wrong, May all forgive me honored ones, Who are in
        wisdom and compassion strong. &nbsp; I freely forgive
        anyone who may have hurt or injured me. I freely forgive
        myself. </em>&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now you can practice <strong>loving-kindness
    meditation</strong>. When practicing loving-kindness
    meditation, repeat the following sentences silently to
    yourself, about ten times each. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>May I be well,
        happy, and peaceful. <br>
        May all beings in this house be well, happy, and
        peaceful. <br>
        May all beings in this area be well, happy, and peaceful.
        <br>
        May all beings in this city be well, happy, and peaceful.
        <br>
        May all beings in this county be well, happy, and
        peaceful. <br>
        May all beings in this state be well, happy, and
        peaceful. <br>
        May all beings in this country be well, happy, and
        peaceful. <br>
        May all beings in this world be well, happy, and
        peaceful. <br>
        May all beings in this universe be well, happy, and
        peaceful. <br>
        May all beings be well, happy, and peaceful. </em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>May suffering
        ones be suffering free and the fear-struck fearless be.
        May the grieving shed all grief, and all beings find
        relief. </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Loving-kindness can also be
    practiced by way of persons, as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>May I be well,
        happy, and peaceful. <br>
        May my teachers be well, happy, and peaceful. <br>
        May my parents be well, happy, and peaceful. <br>
        May my relatives be well, happy, and peaceful. <br>
        May my friends be well, happy, and peaceful. <br>
        May the indifferent persons be well, happy, and peaceful.
        <br>
        May the unfriendly persons be well, happy, and peaceful. <br>
        May all meditators be well, happy, and peaceful. <br>
        May all beings be well, happy, and peaceful. </em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>May suffering
        ones be suffering free and the fear-struck fearless be.
        May the grieving shed all grief, and all beings find
        relief. </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After you have sent thoughts of
    loving-kindness to the whole world and all beings, you
    practice <i>Vipassana</i> meditation. </font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><b>SITTING
    MEDITATION: VIPASSANA</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Breaths as Main Object</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now focus your attention on the
    breaths; keep your mind at the tip of the nose, or at the
    entrance of the nostrils. When you breathe in, be mindful of
    the in-breath for the whole duration, or from the beginning
    to the end. And when you breath out, be mindful of the
    out-breath for the whole duration, or from the beginning to
    the end. In-breath and out-breath each last about four or
    five seconds. Be really mindful of the breaths. You may feel
    a sensation of the air at the tip of your nose or in your
    nose. Be mindful of it. And concentrate on the nature of
    breath, the moving nature or the supporting nature of breath,
    rather than the shape or form of the breath. Try to see the
    in-breath and out-breath as two separate things, not just one
    and the same breath going in and coming out. Do not let your
    mind follow the breath into your body or outside the body.
    Your mind is like a gatekeeper standing at the gate, taking
    note of people going in and coming out. Do not force or
    strain yourself. Just calmly be mindful and watch the
    breaths. You may make a mental note when you breathe in and
    when you breathe out, as &quot;in&quot;, &quot;out,&quot;
    &quot;in&quot;, &quot;out.&quot; Making mental notes, or
    labeling, is just to help you keep your mind on the object;
    if it interferes with your meditation, you don&#146;t have to
    do it, but just be mindful of the object. What is important
    in this meditation is mindfulness of the object at the
    moment, and not the notes you make. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If your mind can be on the breaths
    only, that is very good. However, mind has a tendency to
    wander quite often. So, if, in the course of keeping your
    mind on the breaths, your mind wanders or goes out and you
    are aware of it, do not feel guilty, or be upset; just be
    mindful of its going out. Or you may say to yourself,
    &quot;going out, going out, going out,&quot; two or three
    times and then go back to the breaths. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you see something or someone in
    your thoughts, be mindful of seeing, or say to yourself,
    &quot;seeing, seeing, seeing,&quot; until that object
    disappears from your mind; then go back to the breaths. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you hear somebody talking in
    your thoughts, be mindful of hearing or say to yourself,
    &quot;hearing, hearing, hearing,&quot; and then go back to
    the breath. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you talk to someone in your
    thoughts, or if you talk to yourself, be mindful of talking,
    or say to yourself, &quot;talking, talking, talking,&quot;
    and then go back to the breaths. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you speculate about something,
    be mindful of speculating; if you analyze something, be
    mindful of analyzing; if you make judgments, be mindful of
    making judgments. In <i>Vipassana</i> meditation, you pay
    just bare attention to the object, without any additions of
    you own, as &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;ugly&quot;,
    &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, etc. Or, in other words,
    you take the object as it is, without subjective additions of
    your own. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you remember something in the
    past, be mindful of the remembering, or say to yourself,
    &quot;remembering, remembering, remembering&quot; or
    &quot;thinking, thinking, thinking,&quot; and then go back to
    the breaths. If you think of the future and make plans, be
    mindful of it, or say to yourself, &quot;thinking of future,
    thinking of future, thinking of future,&quot;, or
    &quot;planning, planning, planning,&quot; and then go back to
    the breath. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you become lazy, be mindful of
    your laziness, or say, &quot;lazy, lazy, lazy.&quot; The
    laziness will go away after some moments, then go back to the
    breaths. If you feel bored, be mindful of boredom, or say to
    yourself, &quot;bored, bored, bored,&quot; until boredom goes
    away, then go back to the breaths. If you have resistance, be
    mindful of it, or say to yourself, &quot;resisting,
    resisting, resisting.&quot; When resistance disappears, go
    back to the breaths. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you have thoughts of attachment
    or greed or lust, again do not feel guilty, but be mindful of
    these thoughts, or say to yourself, &quot;attachment,
    attachment, attachment,&quot; or &quot;greed, greed,
    greed,&quot; or &quot;lust, lust, lust,&quot; until they
    disappear and then go back to the breaths. If you are upset
    or angry for any reason, just be mindful of that anger, or in
    other words, make that anger the object of meditation.
    Concentrate on your anger, or you may say to yourself,
    &quot;anger, anger, anger&quot; or &quot;angry, angry,
    angry&quot; or &quot;upset, upset, upset.&quot; After some
    moments, the anger will disappear and when it has
    disappeared, go back to the breaths. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you want to swallow your saliva,
    first be mindful of the intention or desire to swallow,
    saying to yourself, &quot;intention, intention,
    intention,&quot; or &quot;desire, desire, desire.&quot; And
    when you have gathered the saliva in your mouth, be mindful
    of the gathering, or say to yourself, &quot;gathering,
    gathering, gathering.&quot; When you swallow it down, be
    mindful of swallowing, or say to yourself, &quot;swallowing,
    swallowing, swallowing,&quot; then go back to the breaths. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you have an itching sensation,
    do not scratch it right away. Concentrate on the place of
    that itching and be mindful of it, saying to yourself,
    &quot;itching, itching, itching.&quot; In most cases, itching
    will go away after some time. When it goes away, return to
    the breaths. Sometimes, the itching will not go away, but
    will even become more intense. In that case try to be with
    it, taking note of it and be aware of it, as long as you can.
    If you think you cannot bear it any longer, you may scratch.
    But before scratching, be mindful of the intention or desire
    to scratch; and when you move your hand to the place where
    you experience the itch, be mindful of moving. Move your hand
    slowly, following the movement with mindfulness. When your
    fingers touch the place, say &quot;touching, touching,
    touching.&quot; When you scratch, say &quot;scratching,
    scratching, scratching.&quot; When you take the hand back,
    say &quot;taking, taking, taking&quot; or &quot;moving,
    moving, moving.&quot; When your hand touches your lap, the
    knee or the other hand again, be mindful of touching, or say
    to yourself, &quot;touching, touching, touching.&quot; Then
    go back to the breaths. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you have painful or unpleasant
    feelings in the body -- numbness, stiffness, or heat -- focus
    your mind on the place of these feelings and be mindful of
    them. If you have pain somewhere in the body, focus on the
    place of that pain, and be mindful of that pain, or say to
    yourself, &quot;pain, pain, pain.&quot; You will have to be
    very patient with painful feelings. Pain will not easily go
    away. You have to be patient and be mindful of it. It may go
    away or it may become more acute. Stay with it as long as you
    can. Actually pain is a very good object for meditation. It
    is a strong object. Your mind is pulled towards the place
    where there is pain. So be mindful of it and try to see it
    just as a sensation, an unpleasant sensation. And it is
    important that you do not identify pain with yourself, so do
    not say to yourself, &quot;it is <i>my</i> pain&quot; or
    &quot;<i>I</i> feel pain.&quot; There is just the pain, just
    the sensation. If the pain becomes so intense that you think
    you cannot bear it any longer, you may ignore pain altogether
    and go back to the breaths, or you may make movements or
    change posture to ease pain. But when you make movements or
    change posture, first note the intention to change, or be
    mindful of the intention to change and then make movements
    slowly, one at a time, following each movement with
    mindfulness. And when you have made the changes, go back to
    the breaths. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the breaths are the home object
    of your meditation. Whenever there are no other objects to be
    mindful of, you just continue with being mindful of the
    breaths. If there are more prominent objects, then you take
    note of them, be aware of them, or be mindful of them, and
    then go back to the breaths. Do not use force, do not strain
    yourself, just calmly watch the objects, take note of them,
    or be mindful of them. Do not try to forcefully push
    distractions or emotions or feelings in the body away, just
    watch them and let them go by themselves. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Movements of the Abdomen as Main
    Object</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For some people, it is difficult to
    concentrate on the breath at the tip of the nose. Such people
    can keep their mind on the abdomen and be mindful of the
    rising and falling movements of the abdomen. When you inhale,
    the abdomen extends or rises and when you exhale, it
    contracts or falls. These movements -- rising and falling of
    the abdomen -- can be the main object of meditation instead
    of the breaths. Keep your mind on the abdomen and be really
    mindful of the rising movement from the beginning to the end,
    and also of the falling movement from the beginning to the
    end. Your mind is like a jockey riding a horse, your mind and
    your abdomen are both moving. You may even put your hand on
    the abdomen to feel the rising and falling movements. After
    some time, you may be able to follow the rising and falling
    movements without your hand on the abdomen. Here also, you
    may make mental notes as &quot;rising, falling&quot;,
    &quot;rising, falling&quot;, &quot;rising, falling&quot;. The
    rest is the same as for taking the breaths as main object.
    The only difference is to substitute &#145;breaths&#146; with
    &#145;movements of the abdomen&#146;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Common for Both Methods</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let your mindfulness be precise,
    i.e., going concurrently with the objects. Take only one
    object at a time; take the one which is most prominent and be
    mindful of it. If you cannot decide which is most prominent,
    choose just one and be mindful of it. What is important in
    this meditation is to be mindful of the object at the present
    moment; so whether you are mindful of the main object or the
    secondary object, so long as you are mindful, you are doing
    the right thing. Do not have any expectations, do not expect
    to experience something strange or to see visions or to get
    results or even to get concentration. Expectations are good
    because they motivate us to practice, but when we are right
    in the practice, they become obstacles to concentration. That
    is because they are a mild form of greed or attachment which
    is a hindrance to concentration. So if expectations come up
    in spite of yourself, do not be irritated by them, but just
    be mindful of them, or say to yourself, &quot;expecting,
    expecting, expecting.&quot; Then go back to the breaths or
    the movements of the abdomen. When you practice mindfulness
    you make effort, mental effort; the effort you make thus must
    be neither too much nor too little; if you make too much
    effort, you will become agitated and you cannot concentrate;
    and if you make too little effort, you will become sleepy and
    again cannot concentrate. The effort you make must,
    therefore, be well balanced. If you miss to be mindful and
    then remember, then be mindful of that missing, or say to
    yourself, &quot;missing, missing, missing&quot;, or
    &quot;forgetting, forgetting, forgetting.&quot; Above all, do
    not be tight or tense in your mind; be relaxed, and calmly
    watch, or be mindful, or make mental notes. </font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><b>WALKING
    MEDITATION</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having meditated for about thirty
    minutes or more, you may practice walking meditation. When
    you practice <i>Vipassana</i> meditation, it is important to
    keep mindfulness with you always. So, when you change from
    sitting to standing, keep mindfulness with you. Before
    standing up, therefore, be mindful of the intention to stand
    up or to get up. You may say to yourself &quot;intention,
    intention, intention,&quot; or &quot;desire, desire,
    desire.&quot; Then get up slowly, keeping your mind on the
    whole of your body, or saying to yourself, &quot;getting up,
    getting up, getting up.&quot; And when you are standing, be
    mindful of the standing position, or say to yourself,
    &quot;standing, standing, standing.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you walk, it is better to
    choose a walking path and stay on it. Walk on it back and
    forth. When you walk, you walk slowly, keeping you mind on
    the foot or rather the movements of the foot, being aware of
    at least four stages of each step. And keep your eyes down
    always. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to make a step, you first
    raise your foot. Keep your mind on the foot and be mindful of
    the raising or lifting, saying, &quot;lifting.&quot; Then you
    push your foot forward, or you move your foot forward. Be
    mindful of that moving, saying to yourself,
    &quot;moving.&quot; When you put your foot down on the floor,
    be mindful of the putting down, or just say,
    &quot;putting.&quot; Then you shift weight to make the other
    step. Keep your mind on the whole body and say,
    &quot;shifting.&quot; Then make the next step, being mindful
    of lifting, moving, putting down, and shifting, making
    movements slowly. Keep your eyes open and look at the floor
    about three or four feet in front of you. Do not close your
    eyes. You may fall if you close your eyes. Keep them a little
    open and look at the floor, or look down. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you reach the end of the
    walking space, you stop and be mindful of stopping, or say to
    yourself, &quot;stopping, stopping, stopping.&quot; When you
    want to turn around, be mindful of the desire or intention to
    turn around, or say to yourself, &quot;intention, intention,
    intention,&quot; or &quot;desire, desire, desire,&quot; and
    then you turn slowly. Be mindful of the turning movement, or
    say to yourself, &quot;turning, turning, turning.&quot; Then
    walk again, taking note of the different stages in each step,
    lifting, moving, putting down, shifting, and so on, until you
    reach the other end of the walking space. Stop there and be
    mindful of stopping. When you turn around, be mindful of
    turning around and then walk again. Also, when you walk, you
    may keep your hands in front or in the back or on the sides.
    So, you walk back and forth until the end of the walking
    period. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">[Walking meditation is designed
        to give exercise to the body. When you are practicing for
        half an hour or an hour, walking may not be necessary.
        But when you are on a retreat and practice the whole day,
        your body needs some kind of movement. Hence the walking
        meditation. At the end of the walking period, the sitting
        period begins again. So you go back to the sitting place,
        walking slowly, making notes, being aware of the
        different stages and steps. Before lowering yourself
        down, be mindful of the desire to sit down. Then lower
        yourself down slowly, keeping your mind on the whole
        body. When the body touches the floor, say
        &quot;touching, touching, touching.&quot; When you
        arrange your legs and hands, say &quot;arranging,
        arranging, arranging.&quot; And then, go back to the
        breaths and be mindful of the in-breaths and out-breaths.
        This way, you alternate sitting and walking and maintain
        your mindfulness, trying not to lose it at any moment
        during the retreat. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">During retreats, eating is also
        done with meditation, for everything has to be done with
        mindfulness. Even the activities in the bathroom should
        not escape your mindfulness. </font></p>

    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After meditation, we share merit.
    It is a good practice to share merit with all beings whenever
    we have done some meritorious deeds. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sharing of merit means letting
    other beings get chance to get merit themselves by having
    them rejoice at our merit. By rejoicing at our merit, they
    themselves get merit, and that merit of theirs is what gives
    them happy results. Our merit does not decrease when we share
    it; in fact, it increases, because sharing of merit is itself
    an act of merit which is <i>dana</i> or giving. Therefore,
    sharing of merit is beneficial to both the sharer and the
    recipient. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Please share merit as follows and
    say, &quot;Sadhu! Sadhu! Sadhu!&quot; at the end: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>May all beings
        share this merit which we have thus acquired. For the
        acquisition of all kinds of happiness. &nbsp; May beings
        inhabiting space and earth, Deities and others of mighty
        power, Share this merit of ours! May they long protect
        the teachings. </em></font></p>
