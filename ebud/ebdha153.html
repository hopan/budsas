      discusses virtue (//sila//) in great detail in the first chapter of //The Path of
      Purification// (//Visuddhimagga//). He discusses in particular the virtue of the Sangha.
      The Sangha is of great importance as it will keep the Teachings of the Buddha alive. On
      one level, by Sangha is meant the Community of Bhikkhus that maintains the purity of the
      Dhamma in the sense of preserving the texts containing the Buddha's discourses (the
      Suttas), the rules for the bhikkhus (the Vinaya), and the analysis of mind and matter that
      is the highest expression of the Teachings in the most accurate language (the Abhidhamma);
      and in the sense of putting into practice those Teachings. On another level, the word
      &quot;Sangha&quot; refers to all those who have attained one of the four levels of
      enlightenment: Sotapanna, Sakadagami, Anagami, Arahat. In this sense, laymen are included.</font><p><font
      face="Times New Roman">Ashin Maha-Buddhaghosa refers specifically to the Bhikkhu-Sangha in
      most of his discussion. This is because on the human level the Bhikkhu- Sangha is very
      important in keeping the Buddha's Teachings alive. When he goes into detail on how the
      rules for the Community of Bhikkhus are to be respected, this does not concern laymen
      except in so far as they will be more helpful in supporting the Bhikkhu-Sangha if they
      know the rules. But when Ashin Buddhaghosa discusses how the bhikkhus are to develop in
      virtue, these instructions can be very beneficial to laymen also.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ashin Buddhaghosa, for example, cites a discourse given by
      the Buddha on the dangers of immoral actions. In the discourse the Buddha is addressing
      the bhikkhus but the same dangers exist for laymen as well.[1] </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha described in seven vivid images the dangers of
      a bhikkhu breaking his virtue and, as an unvirtuous man accepting and using the requisites
      given by laymen. The unvirtuous man, he said, is evil-natured, of unclear or suspect
      habits, secretive about his actions, claims to be an ascetic but is not, claims to lead a
      life of purity but does not, is rotten within, lecherous and full of corruption.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) It would be better for a bhikkhu to embrace a burning
        fire that might burn him to death and cause great suffering but not lead to rebirth in a
        state of woe than to sit down or lie down with a woman, which results in the indulgence of
        the five cords of sense-desires.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) It would be better for an unvirtuous bhikkhu to have a
        strong horse-hair rope twisted so tightly around his legs that it cut through to the
        marrow of the bone than to consent to letting laymen pay homage to him.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) It would be better for an unvirtuous bhikkhu to be
        wounded in the breast by a sharp spear tempered in oil than to consent to the reverential
        salutation of laymen.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">(4) It would be better for an unvirtuous bhikkhu to be
        wrapped in a red-hot iron sheet than to accept robes given in faith by laymen.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">(5) It would be better for an unvirtuous bhikkhu to have
        his mouth prized open with red-hot iron tongs and that a red-hot ball be put in his mouth
        and burn through his lips, mouth, tongue, throat, belly and pass out below carrying with
        it his bowels and entrails than to use almsfood given in faith by laymen.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">(6) It would be better for an unvirtuous bhikkhu to be
        seated or laid on a red-hot iron bed or iron chair than to use a bed or chair given in
        faith by laymen.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">(7) It would be better for an unvirtuous bhikkhu to be
        plunged upside down into a red-hot cauldron than to use a dwelling given in faith by
        laymen.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ashin Buddhaghosa ends his chapter on virtue in //The Path
      of Purification// with a list of the advantages of maintaining virtue. The bhikkhu with
      immaculate virtue gives pleasure and inspires trust in wearing his robes and carrying his
      bowl. He need never fear self-reproach. He shines like the sun and moon. The colour of his
      body is pleasing to the Devas -- and even more so the perfume of his virtue, for the
      perfume of virtue is greater than all other perfumes as it spreads unchecked in all
      directions. Deeds, no matter how small, done for a virtuous man bear great fruit. None of
      the intoxicants can plague him here and now, and he digs out the root of suffering in
      future lives. If he wishes perfection among men or Devas, it is not difficult for him to
      attain it. But once his virtue is perfected, he seeks only the perfection of Nibbana.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The mind of one who understands thus,&quot; Ashin
      Buddhaghosa says, &quot;shudders at failure in virtue and reaches out towards the
      perfecting of virtue. So virtue should be cleansed with all care, seeing this danger of
      failure in virtue and this benefit of the perfection of virtue.[2]</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">We will see through first-hand experience that if we are
      not firm in our resolution to avoid situations that lead to breaking //sila//, then we
      will encounter situations that overpower us. As the English saying goes, &quot;He who
      hesitates is lost.&quot; Even though, at times, we may be able to force ourselves to do
      the right thing, many times we could have avoided the situation entirely. If we associate
      with people who are going to tempt us, prod us to do things such as killing, stealing,
      lying, drinking, committing adultery, etc., we will be less likely to be able to avoid
      such actions. If we frequent places where such people are found, we are more likely to
      come under their influence. It is useless to pretend we can save such people or that we
      are there with them so that our good influence will guide them. There are already many
      difficult situations that cannot be avoided. As the results of actions done in past lives
      mature in this life, we will find ourselves unavoidably thrown into situations where there
      will be strong temptations. It is sufficient to confront these situations and use all our
      energy and determination to do the right thing then. We do not need to put ourselves in
      such situations on purpose.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is why, on the one hand, the Buddha said associating
      with the Noble Friend is the whole of the life of the Dhamma, but, on the other hand, he
      laid much emphasis on the advantages of the life of solitude. A Noble Friend who will help
      us grow in the Dhamma is not always available. If we cannot be with such persons, we are
      better off alone. Even alone, if we practise the Buddha's teachings, we will not feel
      lonely, for at such times we are close to the Buddha, the best of all friends.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are three levels of effort to make: effort with
      regard to physical actions, with regard to verbal actions, and with regard to mental
      actions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here are some examples of making an effort with regard to
      physical actions. Let us take //not killing// as an example. If our self-control is not
      very highly developed, we may not even notice our anger until we are on the point of
      killing. We may be sitting very still, meditating, when a mosquito lands on our hand and
      starts to bite. We feel the pain and our reaction is so fast, our level of awareness so
      dull, we do not notice we are about to do a wrong action till our hand is raised, ready to
      kill the insect. If we //do// become aware at that moment of what we are about to do, we
      can restrain ourselves.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">But there are better ways of dealing with such situations.
      If we reflect before we begin to meditate and realise that there are mosquitoes around and
      that if we do not take precautions we will probably be bitten by one, then we can look for
      a place that is protected; inside a mosquito net, perhaps. Or we can look for something to
      protect us; we can cover up the exposed parts of our body. Or, if this is not possible, we
      can prepare ourselves for the moment the mosquito will come and resolve that we will not
      kill it. It can help to review what we have learned of the Buddha's Teachings; that we
      have gone through countless lives in which we have killed and have suffered for killing.
      If we are to escape from this vicious circle, we must put an end to killing. No amount of
      physical discomfort in this life can equal one moment of the suffering that will result in
      future lives if we do not stop killing now.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, during our teacher's time, the Venerable Abhidhaja
      Maharattha Guru Masoyein Sayadaw, Senior Abbot of Burma and President of the Chattha
      Sangayana, the Sixth Buddhist Synod, visited the shrine room of the Accountant General's
      Office, Yangon, on the occasion of a //swoon-kway// (inviting for a meal) hosted by
      Sayagyi U Ba Khin and his disciples. The //swoon-kway// was, in fact, the //dana// from
      two Indian students, Messrs. Venkataraman and Natarajan, who became Buddhists after
      meditating under Sayagyi. On this occasion, the Venerable Sayadaw was accompanied by an
      attendant who happened to notice Mr. Venkataraman in a state of deep meditation with rigid
      body and tight limbs, and who asked whether the latter would move if someone were to prick
      his body with a pin. To which Sayagyi replied, &quot;Sir, we wouldn't attempt it, being
      afraid of Ariyarupa- antaraya if he is an Ariya.[3] But one thing I'm very sure of, that
      he could sit without moving in this hall at night with no covers on the body, just as he
      sits during the day. He can enter into this state at will for a predetermined period of
      time. Here, at the back of this building, there is a Hindu hotel which is very filthy.
      Workers throw all the rubbish and dirty water out the back where thousands of mosquitoes
      thrive and come up at night when students are sitting in the hall. It is a real hardship
      for the students, but Mr. Venkataraman can enter into states at will and can remain in one
      posture for three hours without moving.&quot;[4] </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In later years, Sayagyi liked to recount this event, and
      he added some other details to the story. He told us that Mr. Venkataraman's father-in-law
      died in India in the late 1950s and he and his wife had to travel by boat to Calcutta. As
      he suffered from high blood pressure, Mr. Venkataraman had to be careful of his health and
      he usually got seasick on such journeys. So Sayagyi explained to him how he could overcome
      sea- sickness by going into deep meditation for three hours. Three times in succession,
      after a full and hearty meal and with the knowledge of his wife, he did this and the
      method worked.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Sayagyi met Venerable Webu Sayadaw in 1941, while
      visiting the Sayadaw at his centre in Kyaukse, he reported that the venerable monk came
      out of the door of his hut followed by a swarm of mosquitoes. Sayagyi's attendant, a
      railway assistant station manager, wondered how the Sayadaw could meditate inside his room
      with all the mosquitoes. At least meditation could help one to forbear such
      disturbances.[5]</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now let us look at an example of wrong speech. Perhaps out
      of ignorance, when talking to other people, we speak in favour of killing mosquitoes. We
      may say something like, &quot;I can't stand being bitten by mosquitoes. Just the sound of
      them buzzing around is enough to drive me crazy.&quot; In speaking in this way we are
      admitting our lack of control, implying that we will not try to learn how to control
      ourselves, and we will be encouraging the taking of life. What we say may be used by the
      other person to feel justified in killing mosquitoes himself. And the more we speak in
      this manner, the less inclined we will be to make the right effort ourselves.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right effort for thoughts is the hardest of all. We must
      have the highest level of concentration for this. But if we train ourselves to recognize
      as soon as possible the wrong thoughts that precede killing the better we will be able to
      avoid such actions. Whenever we begin to think of mosquitoes, we will tend to have
      negative thoughts if there is no control. But if we can recognize this as it happens, then
      we can begin to train ourselves to come back to the breath below the nostrils and the
      touch of the air coming in and out. Or, if this doesn't work, we can remind ourselves of
      the Buddha's Teachings, as we mentioned before.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The greatest aid in our daily lives will be learning to
      control the senses. This means exercising as much control as possible over the things we
      pay attention to. The more we control what we see, hear, smell, taste, touch, and think,
      the better we will be able to lead moral lives. This in turn will help us to concentrate
      better and appreciate //anicca// more fully. It will mean that our lives will be happier.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">We should do our best to control our senses the way those
      who have attained at least the first stage of enlightenment do. In the Burmese commentary
      on the //paramis//, the importance of being mindful is pointed out.[6] Killing, stealing,
      sexual misconduct, taking intoxicants and lying are all actions which lead to the lower
      planes of existence. Those who are Ariyas, who have reached at least the state of
      Stream-winner, never do such acts. Even if their lives are threatened they will not do
      such acts for they have eliminated the root of the tendency (//anusaya//) to do immoral
      acts. Observing the five precepts, which means abstaining from such acts, is necessary for
      all those who become Buddhists.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">A layperson such as Mother Visakha, who was a
      Stream-winner, may have lawful sexual relations, eat after noon, dance and sing, etc., and
      use high and lofty seats and beds. But we should not take this to mean it is possible to
      indulge in such behaviour indiscriminately. To do so would mean that we would do so more
      and more and cultivate wrong view (//miccha- ditthi//). Ariyas do not use material things
      soliciting sense desire (//vatthu-kama//) in the same way an ordinary person does. In the
      commentary to the //Anguttara-nikaya// (The Book of the Gradual Sayings), it is said that
      the Ariyan disciple approaches agreeable formations (//sankhara//) like a clean brahman
      who seeks safety in a dung heap from an elephant in rut. For the Ariya, the burning fever
      (of desire) is subdued, calmed. Ordinary people, on the other hand, generally enjoy
      sensual pleasures with wrong view.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The quicker we are able to turn away from things which
      provoke unwholesome reactions and actions, the better off we will be. In the world today,
      we are constantly surrounded by sights and sounds, etc., which encourage us to react in an
      unwholesome manner. Advertising can serve as a good example. On the most direct level, we
      may be encouraged by advertisements to kill. This would include ads which tell us to buy a
      certain insect spray in order to kill insects or a poison to put on plants in the garden.
      In more subtle ways, ads which romanticize hunting and fishing or being a soldier are an
      encouragement to killing higher forms of life, including human beings. Even when people
      think they are acting out of compassion for other people's suffering by advocating
      euthanasia, they are encouraging killing. The Buddha pointed out that trying to predict
      where a person who dies or is killed will be reborn is like trying to predict exactly
      where a stick that we throw up in the air will land. We cannot say that we have reduced
      anyone's suffering through ending his life.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The more we give attention to such advertisements the more
      our thoughts will be filled with the idea of killing. We will not be able to lead a normal
      life as laypeople and avoid all contact with such ads. But we can give them as little
      attention as possible. We can turn away from them whenever possible.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">We are less likely to find encouragement to steal in
      advertisements in magazines, on the radio or on television. But more and more novels and
      movies today represent the heroes as being able to steal and get away with it. This may be
      justified in the film by depicting the hero as a sort of Robin Hood who steals from the
      rich and gives to the poor, but even that is not often the case. The hero steals to make
      himself rich. We can usually get a general idea in advance of the subject matter of a book
      or movie before we read it or go to see it. So, it should be easy to avoid exposure to
      such immoral propaganda.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the major themes of advertising is sexual
      indulgence. This powerful force is used by businesses to sell almost any product: cars,
      newspapers, cigarettes, alcohol, perfumes, jewelry, etc. Almost any product can be
      directly or indirectly associated with physical attractiveness. Our eyes will be
      constantly coming into contact with images which will arouse our sexual desires. The songs
      we hear will rarely have any other theme than sensual love with all the attachment,
      craving and suffering that it involves.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Advertisements will also set us a very bad example when it
      comes to right speech. Exaggeration is the rule rather than the exception. Implications
      which are not directly stated, and so can be excused as not being direct lies, get across
      the message the seller wants us to believe. If we use a certain product, we will be
      beautiful, stay young, etc.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Among the biggest advertisers are the makers of alcohol.
      Even though doctors tell us that alcoholism is one of the leading diseases of mankind,
      very little is done to combat this disease when compared with the efforts made to
      encourage taking intoxicants. Even if we think that we are immune to temptation, exposing
      ourselves unnecessarily to the attractive image presented of taking alcohol will subtly
      break down our resolve or at the very least create tensions in us.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">All these examples appeal to the six senses. Even when we
      are not in contact with such advertisements, we will find our thoughts turning to them.
      The better our ability to be conscious of the fact that the mind is indulging in
      unwholesome thoughts, the better we will be able to detach ourselves from them. We will be
      able to dismiss such thoughts and come back to the in-breath, the out-breath and the touch
      of the air below the nose.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">We must make a conscious effort to minimize our exposure
      to all the encouragement around us to lead immoral lives. We can be more selective in the
      sorts of newspapers and magazines we read, in the books we read, the television programmes
      we watch and the movies we go to. We can avoid going to places where such temptations are
      found and we can avoid being with people who encourage us to break any of the precepts.
      This does not mean becoming sanctimonious or &quot;holier than thou.&quot; We have friends
      and family for whom we are responsible. For them we can make every effort to be a good
      friend -- one who sets a good example and who encourages others to do good. But in
      situations where we are not responsible for other people, it is best to remember that in
      the ultimate sense each individual is responsible for his own actions. It is better to go
      our own way than to interfere and provoke ill will and agitation in ourselves and in
      others. On the other hand, we may find ourselves confronted with a situation we cannot
      avoid when we would be compromising the Dhamma if we did not speak out clearly and firmly.
      In such cases, we must stand steadfast.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">We will sometimes find ourselves in situations where it
      seems impossible to avoid breaking one of the precepts. Even a Bodhisatta may decide to do
      such actions as going to war to protect the citizens of his country. Such decisions are
      very difficult to make, and we must be very clear and able to think correctly if we are to
      make a wise decision. Whatever we do we must never excuse ourselves, thinking that a good
      action can cancel out an immoral action. No matter how justified an immoral action may
      seem, it will result in future suffering. The Buddha said that even if we are being
      tortured to death, if we feel ill will towards those who are torturing us, we will suffer
      for it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Studying the teachings of the Buddha can help us to avoid
      finding excuses for ourselves and help us to take responsibility for all our actions. The
      better we understand the Dhamma, the better we will be able to learn from our mistakes. We
      will stop blaming other people or circumstances for our wrong actions.</font></p>

      several times. When he visited in 1960, he saw the many letters of appreciation written by
      Western students regarding the practice of the Buddha-Dhamma and the fruits gained by
      coming to the centre, and he told Sayagyi that when these appreciations and experiences
      described by the students were published in the Maynmar language (Burmese) he would write
      an introduction, which he subsequently did. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">[5] Webu Sayadaw was reputed to be an Arahat. He learned
      the scriptures under the above mentioned Sayadaw in Mandalay and then retired to the
      forest to practise meditation. He was given up for lost and his family was not able to
      trace him until he was seen in a forest near Kyaukse, forty miles south of Mandalay at a
      place popularly known as Webula Hill. He then took up residence at that place after the
      lay disciples in the vicinity built him meditation huts. Later on, they built him a
      meditation centre with many monasteries. He became known as Webu Sayadaw. Later his father
      came to visit him and asked him to return to his birth place, Ingyinbin village, where he
      afterwards founded another meditation centre.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In his earlier years, after he had learned the scriptures,
      he resided for a time in Shwebo, where another story of some interest occurred. The
      presiding monk in this place was older than Webu Sayadaw and for some time had been
      occupying himself with the question of who would be the best monk to take his place as the
      presiding abbot of his monastery. This monk, who also practised meditation, was impressed
      with Webu Sayadaw's behaviour and his scrupulous observance of the Vinaya rules. The old
      monk decided to hand over the monastery to Webu Sayadaw and retire into the forest to
      practise meditation more effectively. But the day after he made that decision the abbot
      was approached by Webu Sayadaw early in the morning and the latter requested permission to
      leave the monastery and retire into the forest himself. &quot;Well, monk
      (//avuso//),&quot; the abbot replied, &quot;you are quicker than I to decide to retire
      into the forest. What can I say? Please help yourself. May you gain the Deathless.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">After he founded the centres at Kyaukse and
      Ingyinbin-tawya, Webu Sayadaw was approached by the lay disciples of Shwebo, sixty miles
      north of Mandalay, who asked him to honour them by taking up residence in their city, as
      he had spent his early days there. The Sayadaw agreed and founded a third large meditation
      centre at Aung Mye Yeikthar in Shwebo. He customarily spent four months at each of the
      three places mentioned, but he always spent the rainy retreats at Kyaukse. After
      Mahapavarana, the full moon day of Thadingyut, his period of residence at Kyaukse ended
      and he would leave for Shwebo to reside and teach meditation there for the next four
      months. Then he would go to his birthplace, Ingyinbin-tawya village, another twenty-five
      miles north of Shwebo, where he spent the last quarter of the year teaching lay disciples
      and monks who came from all over the country.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1953, he was invited by Sayagyi U Ba Khin to give
      blessings and preach the Dhamma at IMC, 3la Inya Myaing Road, and he came with some monks
      and some of his relatives, both nuns and laymen to reside for seven days in June before
      the Buddhist lent. Beginning in 1954, the following year, he was invited annually by the
      lay disciples of Yangon and Lower Myanmar to visit the capital and many other cities of
      Lower Myanmar. He became very famous as he was already reputedly an Arahat. He was also
      well-known for the simplicity of his Dhamma teaching, which could be understood by
      ordinary laymen and laywomen and which, in fact, appealed to everyone who heard it. See
      pp. 213ff. in the biography of U Ba Khin by U Ko Lay.</font></p>
