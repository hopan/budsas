<B><I>From a talk given at Chithurst, U.K., during the winter retreat, February
1991<BR></I></B><P>

WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE GOAL of Buddhist practice, about enlightenment
or Nibbana, we use the term 'realisation' as being the most accurate
way to approach it. Often one sees the term 'getting' enlightened,
or 'becoming' enlightened; this is good and meaningful enough
in ordinary speech but it also has connotations which are obstructive
or misleading. Whenever we think of 'getting' something or 'becoming'
something, it always implies that what there is right now is somehow
lacking, there is 'me' that is missing something and I have got
to get some kind of experience or some kind of quality that is
going to make me complete in the future and then, once I have
got it, it is going to be mine and I can keep it. There are many
characters who have 'got' enlightened and then their enlightenment
has wandered off and left them rather bereft and despairing for
months or sometimes years.<BR>

<P>
So when we think and talk about enlightenment it is much better
to use the word 'realisation', because it is pointing to the fact
that we are discovering what is here already; we are realising,
real-ising that which is already true, that which is the fabric
and nature of our own being. Any thought of getting or becoming
is what ties us to the incessant cycles of birth and death; this
is what is called the <B><I>bhavacakka</I></B>, the cycle of becoming,
because anything we get we can lose or we become anxious about
being separated from--ownership is suffering. Thinking in terms
of realisation, discovering the Truth, lends itself much less
to the idea of ownership. The Dhamma, the ultimate reality of
things, has no owner and this realisation of Truth is the fulfillment
of our life. You do not have to take this as a proclamation, but
I would say that this is the goal, the fulfillment of our life.
Everything else that happens in life that we achieve or create,
bring forth into the world, these are all secondary to the realisation
of Truth, to this quality of seeing and being Dhamma.<BR>

<P>
Knowing the reality of things does not seem like very much. Our
worldly tendencies and our habits of seeing always tend to focus
on the objects, beings and places, the achievements, triumphs
and disasters of our lives as being the real, substantial, important
aspects, and something as ephemeral or intangible as realising
Truth, on a conceptual level at least, seems a bit flimsy and
simple-minded.<BR>

<P>
Buddhism gets criticised a lot by people who take the position
of life affirmation. This has been the case right from the very
beginning when the Buddha first started teaching--particularly
because of being a religious tradition with a monastic order of
celibate monks and nuns. This renunciant lifestyle gets quite
a pounding from people, who are not necessarily worldly or indulgent,
but just those who see value in the fulfillment of life on the
worldly plane: the qualities of a loving relationship, of having
children, of creating music or beautiful things, planting gardens,
trees, building houses, forming friendships, creating new networks
of wholesome activity, learning, teaching, nursing, healing the
sick, helping the dying--these are all tremendously appealing,
important and positive things in life. There is something very
deep, very instinctual in our hearts which does appreciate and
celebrate this--that loves life, that wants to live, to laugh,
to love--and this seems to be the very fabric and essence, the
spice and purpose of life, to live life to the hilt, to the full.
<BR>

<P>
In the last 'Inquiring Mind', a Buddhist newspaper put out in
America, they had an article about Ajahn Sucitto and Ven. Vipassi
teaching a retreat in Massachusetts. This article went to great
lengths to make sure that people knew that both these monks had
lived very 'full' lives before they became monks; which is a polite
way of saying you have done everything you could think of and
then some before you became a monk. People are very scared of
the idea that you would become a monk before you had really done
<B><I>everything, </I></B>tried everything out. The idea is that life
is to be lived, everything is to be tasted, to be experienced--Rajneesh
was very keen on this kind of practice: doing absolutely everything
to the limit and learning from that. The true learning experience
in life is described as to take it all on, to swallow it whole
and watch the results--so this does make what we do here at this
monastery look a bit strange! Maybe I am sounding like an advert
for Dionysiac hedonism ( brandy will be served in the kitchen
after the evening meeting), but it is a very powerful streak in
our minds, it strikes a powerful chord. <BR>

<P>
The other day I ran across something that D.T. Suzuki wrote in
one of his books on Zen Buddhism, it went something like, &quot;The
spirit of freedom, which is the power behind Buddhism breaking
through its monastic shell to ever more vigorously bring enlightenment
to the masses, is the life impulse of the universe,&quot; then
he says something like, &quot;The spirit of Buddhism has always
been intellectual, moral and spiritual freedom, thus the moral
aristocracy and the disciplinary formalism of primitive Buddhism
could not bind our freedom, our spirit for very long,&quot; so
<B><I>we</I></B> are right out of the picture! I am not criticising D.T.
Suzuki but just saying that there is a strong tendency in people's
minds to think, &quot;Well, if you are living a very restrained,
renunciant life you really must be missing out on a lot; you are
not respecting all that life offers, these bodies are fertile,
they are designed to produce offspring and you have creative talents--we
can do, we can speak, we can create--why not!&quot; Because I
draw pictures for birthday cards for my family and occasionally
write poems, I find that this is one of the few things about my
life that my family can relate to. My mother is always encouraging
me to create more masterpieces; I have got pads and pads of drawing
paper and crayons and pens and ink, an incredible stash of stationery
to do my creations on. I regularly get a burdened feeling when
I look at this pile of stuff in my desk-drawer, &quot;Oh dear,
I suppose I should create something.&quot; I like doing that kind
of thing but one sees that for people with a perceptually based
perspective on life, what you create becomes the most important
thing-&quot;After all, you can draw such nice pictures, you can
say such nice things, why not? You are robbing the world by not
producing offspring, poems, pictures, etc. etc. etc.&quot;<BR>

<P>
This question had long puzzled me and struck me deeply when I
first arrived at the monastery in Thailand. I was reminded of
it this morning, since we have been having readings from 'The
Life of the Buddha' and we have just got to the time of the Enlightenment.
Oftentimes as a Westerner we think about enlightenment as meaning
having a mind which is happy all the time, regardless of whatever
is going on and whatever we choose to do--this is a very, very
attractive proposition! After the Buddha's enlightenment he sat
for a week rapt in meditation, experiencing the bliss of deliverance
and, after that absorption into bliss, he emerged and then what
did he do? He spent the whole night contemplating Dependent Origination,
the law of dependent arising: ignorance conditioning the arising
of desire, attachment, birth, death, suffering and so forth; contemplating
its arising, contemplating its cessation, backwards, forwards,
up, down, all night long. <BR>

<P>
Now, if you were enlightened and had just become completely, irreversibly
free from suffering, it's possible to imagine you might think,
&quot;What a relief! At last that's all over--no more suffering,
marvellous, amazing.&quot; And you might think, &quot;Let's go
eat pancakes!&quot; or &quot;I wonder what that nice young lady
who brought me the milk rice is doing tonight, maybe I'll pop
round and see her.&quot; Or, if you were of a less sensual character,
with a bit more nobility: &quot;Now I'll go back to my kingdom,
encourage my old father, give him a bit of support and then help
take over the kingdom and run a really good little country for
the rest of my life.&quot; <BR>

<P>
But we can see that, far from having this reaction, with his enlightenment
the Buddha experienced life from a completely new dimension. He
was seeing things in a way that he had not seen before, he was
seeing what the rest of the world could not see. It's rather like
when we come into a new situation--an institution, a school or
a family, a monastery--we are a stranger and we suddenly find
ourselves in the midst of all kinds of webs of relationship, power-trips,
struggles, gripes, loves and hates and personality conflicts going
on; we are an outsider for whom all this has no value and yet
to all the people involved in that place it's all terribly real
and important. We are not a part of it, however; we are not caught
up in the value system.<BR>

<P>
One can also see enlightenment as simply growing up; as an adult
one stops being able to play with dolls and toys in the same way
that one did when one was a child, it becomes impossible. It's
also like having solved a puzzle that everyone else is still deeply
involved in trying to unravel; you can see the answer, whereas
everyone else is anguishing and fretting and rushing about and
discussing how to find it. Or that lovely feeling of understanding
a clue in a crossword--when you have got it and the letters all
fit in the right places, &quot;Ah, I see!&quot; <BR>

<P>
At the enlightenment, the Buddha stepped out of the worldly perspective
and could see from above the world--<B><I>lokuttara.</I></B> There is
a wonderful passage in the scriptures that describes this insight
of the Buddha and the way he saw things after his enlightenment:
He saw that the worldly mind cherishes conditioned existence,
it cherishes becoming; it opens itself to and welcomes conditioned
existence, it welcomes becoming. The urge of the world, of worldly
thinking, is always to become other: to get to the next thing,
to progress, to develop, to have, to keep. It cherishes, relishes
conditioned existence; but the problem is that what it relishes
brings fear and what it fears is pain, because that which is the
very basis of conditioned existence is also the basis of suffering.
<BR>

<P>
This was the insight that he had with Dependent Origination--he
saw how ignorance was the originator of all problems in life;
how the reality that we give to our thoughts, feelings and emotions,
to our memories and perceptions, is the true creator of all our
difficulties. He also saw that if we believe in conditioned existence,
if we believe in our suffering and we will possess it, we will
own it, it will be ours. But with the ending of clinging, the
ending of attachment, then suffering ceases. <BR>

<P>
This is perhaps a difficult insight to comprehend and really digest.
In the same passage he says something like, &quot;Liberation does
not come through living conditioned existence but neither does
it come through living non-existence. One who is liberated abandons
craving for being without relishing non-being . . . .&quot; Now
where is that? You do not find that one in the 'A-to-Z'! &quot;Liberation
comes from abandoning craving for being, without relishing non-being.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
The worldly mind can only see that either we are or we are not,
something is or is not, but the Buddha is talking from a position
which is neither this nor that, neither being nor non-being, neither
existence nor non-existence. On hearing this sort of thing, maybe
our mind starts to go into a flap, just goes blank or thinks,
&quot;What on earth is this about? I mean, come on, let's be serious,
let's hear something useful, shall we!?&quot; But from my perspective
this is the most useful and powerful tool for insight that we
have with which to understand and live our lives.<BR>

<P>
It is, however, something that is very intangible; conceptually
it is not graspable, it evades our intellectual faculties. It
is also the very reason why in his life the Buddha was constantly
criticised for being a nihilist--because of not saying, &quot;This
is the Truth,&quot; and stressing some kind of metaphysical pattern
or grand cosmology. Instead he kept talking in terms of Nibbana,
which just means 'cooled' or 'blown out', like the blowing out
of a flame. Nibbana can also be translated as 'extinction' and
to many people the concept seemed nihilistic. &quot;Life has got
to have a bit more to it than just extinction to look forward
to!&quot; But he refused to go along with the eternalists, people
who were philosophically life-affirming, yet he also refused to
go along with the annihilationists, those who were philosophically
life-denying; he kept pointing at the fact that the Truth is other
than either of those two fixed positions. <BR>

<P>
There is a lovely story from the Theravada tradition concerning
a seeker called Kamanita. He, having heard of the Buddha's reputation,
was passing through Tajagaha on his way to meet him at Jeta's
Grove in Savatthi. At nightfall he put up in a potter's house;
little did he know at the time that the monk that he was sharing
his lodging with that night was the Buddha himself.<BR>

<P>
Kamanita, after a while, started enthusiastically telling his
fellow lodger how he was on his way to meet the Buddha. The Buddha
sat there listening and didn't let on who he was--&quot;Tell me
about this great master and his teaching,&quot; he said. So Kamanita
goes on for some time, telling the story of his own life and extolling
all the wonders of the Buddha's Dhamma, and how he teaches the
path of bliss and eternal happiness.<BR>

<P>
Finally, he said, &quot;Well, I've talked enough, you tell me
about your life. What is you philosophy? Who is your teacher?
What do you proclaim as the truth?&quot; The Buddha started to
speak, saying, &quot;I will, in return for your narrative, unfold
to you the doctrine of the Buddha.&quot; He described the Four
Noble Truths: the truth of suffering, the origin of suffering,
cessation of suffering and the Path; and he expounded on anicca,
impermanence, and anatta, selflessness. As he began, Kamanita
was looking quite interested and taking it all in, but after a
while he began to think, &quot;This guy is a bit of a sourpuss
. . . this isn't the Master's teaching as I understand it. Well,
never mind, he's got his right to think like he does.&quot;<BR>

<P>
As the Buddha continued, Kamanita got more and more uncomfortable.
All that this monk was saying to him seemed to hang together logically
and it felt disturbingly right, but seemingly it had a horrible
negative life-denying streak to it: all about extinction and cessation,
and with no promise of &quot;eternal and bless&egrave;d life&quot;
after death. His mind was still heavily programmed towards the
idea of eternal happiness so, by the time the Buddha got on to
anatta, Kamanita was decidedly agitated and did not know what
to do. The monk's exposition was obviously flawless but Kamanita's
heart was fixed on the fact that he must be wrong, so he thought,
&quot;What he is saying is all wrong! This is bad philosophy.
The Buddha is the great teacher, he teaches absolute bliss for
eternity. I am going to get the teaching directly from him. I
should forget this guy, he really does not know what he is talking
about.&quot; The Buddha finishes speaking and sees that Kamanita
is a bit agitated. <BR>

<P>
Finally, on a subdued tone Kamanita asks him, &quot;Have you ever
heard all this form the mouth of the perfect Buddha himself?&quot;
<BR>

<P>
At this point a smile plays around the Master's lips.<BR>

<P>
&quot;No, brother, I cannot say I have.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Greatly relieved to hear this, Kamanita reassures himself that
they will be able to meet the Buddha in person soon and that this
monk's mistaken and destructive conception of the Buddha's teaching
will be set straight.<BR>

<P>
Kamanita never realises his mistake--not until much later anyway,
but that's another story . . . . The Buddha, when asked about
him, said, &quot;Foolish as an unreasonable child was the pilgrim
Kamanita, he took offence at the Teaching . . .&quot;; in his
lifetime his karmic obstructions were too dense to enable him
to see what was right in front of him.<BR>

<P>
Ajahn Chah often said that this is a position that we find ourselves
in--face to face with the Buddha, sharing a room together, spending
hours and hours deep in conversation and never realising who this
is. The truth of life is staring us in the face, but because we
have already got programmed with something else that we want and
expect, we are missing out on the lessons that life is actually
able to teach us.<BR>

<P>
What we need to understand then, is what this knowledge was that
the Buddha was pointing to. Firstly, it's necessary to understand
what we mean by the word existence--clinging to existence and
clinging to being or non-being. The word 'existence' actually
means 'to stand out'; that which exists stands out, it protrudes,
it is something which comes out, like a branch coming out of a
tree. What the Buddha is pointing to is that, as long as we are
talking in terms of existence or even non-existence (which is
as if, instead of going out of the front door we have just gone
out of the back door), both are taking a fixed position about
some solid thing--there is still a separate 'thingness' there.
What the Buddha is pointing to is that which does not come forth,
that which is standing out, i.e. a condition of nature, mental
or physical. What the Buddha is pointing to here is the Unconditioned,
that which does not stand out, that which is not created, that
which is not born of dying.<BR>

<P>
This is perhaps a bit hard to grasp but it is a very important
point: as long as we are talking about something 'existing' it
does not mean that that is the only reality. An experience is
an excursion out from the Unconditioned through a pattern of events,
back to the Unconditioned, like water rising from rivers and back
to the sea. It is an excursion of existence; a lifetime is just
an excursion, so is a thought--it is something which arises from
the Unconditioned, from the space of the mind, and dissolves back
into it again.<BR>

<P>
When something 'exists' it has a false independence, a false individuality,
because at that time, it seems to be of a different and separate
substance to all other things. When we believe in separate existence
then we are giving solidity to that which is actually transparent,
ephemeral, merely an element of the infinite patters of consciousness
in the mind. So the Buddha is pointing to the Unconditioned as
the basis for reality. The Buddha's enlightenment was awakening
to this Unconditioned nature of the basis of life; this was the
dimension, the position from which he was seeing.<BR>

<P>
In this respect then, those aspects of life like that material,
manifest world that we celebrate and which are so important, they
become the basis for the realisation for the Unconditioned; the
conditioned is needed in order to realise the Unconditioned. Through
the agency of a human life and a human body, the Unconditioned
can be realised. This process is a ripening or a transition, a
transformation of the life spirit, the life force--the <B><I>jivita</I></B>.
The conditioned, the green, is the infertile but becomes the basis
for that which ripens into the gold, like a field of corn: the
green of life ripens as the gold of wisdom, civilisation and true
knowledge. The <B><I>lokiya</I></B> becoming the basis for the realisation
for the <B><I>lokuttara</I></B>, these two always exist in relationship
to each other and the transformation, the ripening of the one
to allow the realisation of the other is what, in Buddhism, is
called stream entry.<BR>

<P>
This is also called 'the change of lineage'--when we see through
our attachment to the body, to the mind, to ourself and to the
world, it's known as a change of lineage because, rather than
looking upon our physical parents as our origin and the source
of our being, we see that the true Origin of all is the Unconditioned
mind. This is the source of all creation--as Thomas Merton puts
it: &quot;the living law that rules the universe is nothing but
the secret gravitation that draws all things to God as to their
centre. Since all true art lays bare the action of this same law
in the depths of our own nature, it makes us alive to the tremendous
mystery of being, in which we ourselves, together with all other
living and existing things, come forth from the depths of God
and return again to Him.&quot; <BR>

<P>
So rather than placing ultimate value in the products and activities
of the manifest, existent world, we learn to see that the <B><I>saccadhamma</I></B>--the
Ultimate Reality of our own nature--is the source of all true
value. When the need arises, we act, but when there's no need
we are still--and whether there is activity or not, the essential
nature if the <B><I>saccadhamma</I></B> remains the same. It doesn't
have to prove its worth by taking a certain form, of any form
at all; the sea is still the sea whether its rough or placid,
gold still has the nature of gold whatever shape we make it. So,
in this process of realisation we are affirming the very source
of life--the Uncreated, Unconditioned--rather than making value
judgments about waves or their absence on the surface. The source
of our life is that source of the whole universe--the heart of
the universe is your heart--so, far from the Buddha-Dhamma being
a life-denying, negative philosophy, it is actually the most earth-shaking,
silent roar of <B>YES!!!</B>--it is just avoiding making a fuss
about the secondary details and attending to the essence instead.
It is a philosophy of the ultimate aesthetic: &quot;Truth is beauty--one
who has arrived at Release truly knows what Beauty is.&quot;<BR>
