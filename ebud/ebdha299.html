      Valley south of San Francisco to take part in an April 28 - 29 gathering 
      honoring the life and teachings of Ajahn Chah. Seated onstage beneath an 
      indoor forest, many of Ajahn Chah&#39;s earliest Western students - both 
      monastic and lay - told stories of their days with this beloved teacher. 
      The weekend also included three films, a display of photographs, periods 
      of meditation practice, and shared luncheons on the lawn. The event was 
      co-sponsored by Abhayagiri Monastery and the Sati Center for Buddhist 
      Studies. Following are short excerpts from various speakers and photos 
      from the conference.
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">* </P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Ajahn Sumedho: </FONT></B>What was so special 
      about Ajahn Chah? There were many monks who were strict and learned. There 
      were other popular teachers, several of whom were acknowledged masters. 
      What drew me to Ajahn Chah was that he was relaxed, at ease and completely 
      himself. </P>
      <P>When I first went to live with Ajahn Chah, I couldn&#39;t speak Thai all 
      that well. Most of my learning came through observing the example he set. 
      He seemed so confident yet relaxed. There was a strictness to the 
      monastery, but it was not at all oppressive. Ajahn Chah saw from the 
      beginning that I was a very serious and goal-oriented person. I tried to 
      control everything. Even though my intentions were good, I can now see 
      that I was grasping and trying too hard. The whole manner of Ajahn Chah 
      helped a person to relax. He had a great sense of humor. You felt at ease 
      being in the lightness of his presence and in his direct way of speaking.
      </P>
      <P>When I was a new abbot, I didn&#39;t know how to be an abbot, so I tried to 
      do things the way I thought Ajahn Chah would do them. I played at being 
      Ajahn Chah, and it came out false. People knew it was a phony act. When I 
      reflected on how at ease Ajahn Chah was with himself, I had a sense of how 
      to proceed. What I needed to do was to be comfortable with who I was - to 
      learn to trust and relax. I didn&#39;t have to copy Ajahn Chah or the other 
      great monks. My task was to develop within the confines of my own 
      character and not make my character into a problem. I trusted in that. It 
      resonated as true. In my life as a monk, I haven&#39;t always lived up to 
      other people&#39;s expectations. I&#39;ve learned to not always try to please 
      others or live up to expectations and ideals. </P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Gail Kappel:</FONT></B> I was blessed to 
      accompany Ajahn Chah on his trip to Mt. Rainier with my brother, Joseph 
      (the former Ajahn Pabhakaro). When Ajahn Chah saw joggers running along he 
      asked, &quot;Where are they running to?&quot; When he saw snow, he called it the 
      sawdust of water. It was my first experience with monastics. His presence 
      was something new to me. It was so lovely. </P>
      <P>On the day that he left Seattle, we offered the meal. After chanting, 
      Ajahn Chah asked forgiveness for whatever he might have said or done that 
      may have been hurtful. I was shocked that he could have believed he would 
      have offended anyone. He had such genuine humility. It touched me, and I 
      cried. Then he said to me, &quot;If you cry a little bit, it&#39;s good. If you cry 
      a lot, you&#39;re a fool.&quot; </P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Joseph Kappel (formerly Ajahn Pabhakaro):</FONT></B> 
      My father was a physical person, a very humble man. Ajahn Chah was a male 
      figure he could relate to and admire. From the first day they met, my 
      father loved Ajahn Chah. On this particular day, dad was out there moving 
      these stones around our cabin at Steven&#39;s Pass. He was a strong and 
      healthy man, quite comfortable doing physically demanding projects. He 
      enjoyed puttering. Ajahn Chah called him Por Nom. Por is a respectful way 
      of speaking to people. It means father or mother, aunt or uncle. Nom means 
      strong. &quot;Por Nom - you are very strong,&quot; Ajahn Chah said, as my father 
      sweated with the weight of the large stones he carried. &quot;Now, you need to 
      make your heart as strong as your body.&quot; My father listened and made a 
      sound. It was something like a whimper, a humble whimper. Then he said, 
      &quot;Yes, you&#39;re right.&quot; </P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Ajahn Amaro:</FONT></B> When people met Ajahn 
      Chah, they often asked how he came to embody such all encompassing wisdom. 
      They wondered if it may have arisen through extensive study of the 
      scriptures. Ajahn Chah responded to these assumptions in his 
      characteristically direct and earthy way. &quot;If wisdom has arisen,&quot; said 
      Luang Por, &quot;it was because of my defilements.&quot; Ajahn Chah was filled with 
      restlessness, anger, tremendous doubt and voluminous lust. The only 
      hindrance with which he was not blessed in full measure was dullness. The 
      other hindrances blazed so magnificently in his psyche that there was no 
      room for sleepiness. </P>
      <P>As a new monk, Ajahn Chah wanted to get a handle on his sexual desire. 
      He decided, as a plan of action, not to look at any woman for the entire 
      three - month rain&#39;s retreat. Whenever a female person entered the 
      monastery, he practiced restraint and looked down. At the end of the 
      retreat, he thought he had done pretty well. To test whether he had been 
      cured of his lust, he decided to deliberately look at the village women 
      when they came to the monastery. Rather than having gone beyond lust, he 
      found that he was a complete mess. As he related it, when his eyes rested 
      on a woman, it was as if he had been struck by lightning - his lust was 
      that overwhelming. Although he failed in this instance, he learned a 
      valuable lesson: restraint is insufficient in overcoming defilements. One 
      needs to develop understanding as well. </P>
      <P>In 1979 in Barre, Massachusetts, during a question-and-answer session 
      while on retreat, someone asked Ajahn Chah, &quot;Is it necessarily a barrier 
      to be in a sexual relationship? Can one not view sex in terms of it being 
      the dance of the sacred marriage? Couldn&#39;t it be noble and mystical?&quot; 
      After Ajahn Chah had the question translated, he pondered for a moment and 
      then started picking his nose in a very graphic and extended way. When 
      everyone was rolling on the floor laughing and he was sure they definitely 
      got the point, he pulled his finger out of his nose: &quot;There&#39;s nothing more 
      to it than that, except what the mind adds to it.&quot; Perhaps this story has 
      been altered a bit in the telling, but it&#39;s still a good story. </P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Thanissara:</FONT></B> When I first met Ajahn 
      Chah, perhaps even more than his words, I felt so uplifted in his 
      presence. He had enormous freedom and power. He seemed fearless. He didn&#39;t 
      need to please anyone. He was joyful and light, present and complete. This 
      is not something you meet every day. It was communicated on an almost 
      subliminal level. </P>
      <P>When you hear a Dharma talk from someone who has this quality of 
      presence, it&#39;s a bit like you are a withered flower in the desert and 
      someone finally gives you some water. I was drinking in his talk like that 
      - very simple, very direct. I remember thinking all the way through his 
      talk, this is so wonderful, so good. Then he said, &quot;If you&#39;ve been 
      listening to this talk and thinking, &#39;This is really good or really bad,&#39; 
      then you haven&#39;t been listening properly.&quot; Then I thought, &quot;This is really 
      good. I like that!&quot; </P>
      <P>A fundamental aspect of his teaching was to establish one in right view 
      - not holding to any particular view - but rather a direct ability to 
      experience life as it is. I had an experience of this when I went to visit 
      Ajahn Chah in Northeast Thailand. I had taken the overnight train from 
      Bangkok and asked the taxi driver to take me to Ajahn Chah. He knew 
      exactly where to go. I found him at a small monastery near the Mekong 
      river. I gathered some offerings and went to bow and pay respects. He 
      asked me about my practice. When I related my spiritual quest, he said 
      that I was looking around everywhere but what I needed to do was to look 
      in one place, my own heart. </P>
      <P>As a woman, I couldn&#39;t have a lot of contact with Ajahn Chah, and I 
      couldn&#39;t be sent to study with Ajahn Sumedho either. Instead, Ajahn Chah 
      suggested I practice with the American nun, Kum Fah. Kum Fah was very 
      inspiring to me. When I left Thailand, I decided to ordain as a nun in 
      England at Chithurst. After a time, Ajahn Sumedho organized a group from 
      England to return to Thailand. One of the things we were looking forward 
      to was reconnecting with this very inspiring nun. To our surprise, we 
      found that Kum Fah had become a rabid born-again Christian. It was very 
      distressing to see that this person had become so different than before. 
      Furthermore, she was very keen on putting down Ajahn Chah and converting 
      us to her views. Ajahn Sumedho went to Ajahn Chah very upset about the way 
      Kum Fah behaved. Ajahn Chah simply said to Ajahn Sumedho, &quot;Well, maybe 
      she&#39;s right.&quot; </P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#800000">Ajahn Sumedho </FONT><I>(on Ajahn Chah&#39;s first 
      trip to Britain)</I>:</B> I had only seen Ajahn Chah in Thailand. Over 
      there, he was quite famous. People would bow down and scurry around 
      falling over themselves trying to please him. I had some trepidation at 
      the start of our travels because I knew it was going to be different in 
      England. I wondered how he would respond. What a wonderful relief when I 
      saw that he was equally relaxed away from Thailand. </P>
      <P>On this first trip to a non - Buddhist country, we flew on Thai 
      International. On takeoff from Karachi, Pakistan - at that time, they 
      didn&#39;t have direct flights - one of the tires on the landing gear 
      exploded. The pilot told us to take emergency measures; there would have 
      to be an emergency landing in Rome. I explained all this to Ajahn Chah. He 
      had to take out his false teeth. Meanwhile, people were begging Ajahn Chah 
      to save them. They were frightened. He seemed quite amused by the whole 
      thing even though I think he fully expected the plane to crash. As it 
      turned out, we had only a bumpy landing. When we left the plane, all the 
      Thai people who had been begging for help didn&#39;t even notice us. They 
      didn&#39;t say anything to us at all. They were looking at the beautiful 
      hostesses instead. Ajahn Chah said, &quot;When they are in trouble, they come 
      to me. When they aren&#39;t, they like the pretty women.&quot; </P>
      <P>When we got off the plane, we had to get on a rail car. There were only 
      women standing near the door, and we were the last ones to get on. In 
      Thailand, we have very strict rules. Monks are not supposed to stand next 
      to women or let them touch you. I watched Ajahn Chah as he kind of looked 
      around and observed the scene. I saw that he just made up his mind and 
      walked in. Even though he had only known Thai social etiquette, he was 
      able to adapt to the the irregularities of a foreign country. </P>
      <P><I>(On patience) </I>Ajahn Chah would give very long talks at the 
      monastery, about three hours. The monks had to sit in a particular way, a 
      way that was painful to me. We couldn&#39;t move. I was in pain after sitting 
      about five minutes. When I moved, the Thai monks corrected me. I felt I 
      couldn&#39;t do anything right. I didn&#39;t understand the language all that 
      well, and they seemed to be laughing at me. This would bring up such anger 
      and rage. Ajahn Chah spoke in a Laotian dialect. After a while, I didn&#39;t 
      even try to understand what he said. I learned to turn off to the sound. 
      In my life, I had always been a reasonable person. Since I couldn&#39;t 
      understand the talks, I asked him if I could leave the sala (meditation 
      hall) at that time. I wanted to go back to my kuti and accomplish 
      something by practicing meditation. He said no. I felt he was being 
      unreasonable. However, I still did what he told me. He said that my 
      practice was patience, and I agreed with him. This is how I developed 
      patience. </P>
      <P>Everyone else seemed to be enjoying the talks so much, and I felt 
      hatred towards all of them without exception. I would say to myself, &quot;I&#39;m 
      going to leave. I&#39;ve had enough.&quot; I remember one specific time when I was 
      so angry. Ajahn Chah had been going on talking for ages. Then all of a 
      sudden, he stopped and looked at me and asked how I was doing. There was 
      so much love in the way he said it. The anger that had been brewing for 
      hours dissipated in a very short time. You would think that if there&#39;s 
      that much anger, it&#39;s going to take a long time to dissipate. But I saw 
      just how fleeting the feeling really was. When you are willing to endure 
      pain and emotional anguish - just let it patiently be - you can experience 
      the cessation of the mood. This is a very peaceful and blissful state. I 
      had known this in theory from studying the teaching. However, the actual 
      experience was another matter. </P>
      <P>Ajahn Chah constantly put me in situations that were difficult, 
      situations that I didn&#39;t want. I wanted to live life on my own terms. I 
      wanted to be a hermit. I didn&#39;t want to put up with the behavior of 
      others. Many times I wanted to run away. A voice in me would say, &quot;I&#39;ve 
      had enough of this. I&#39;ll get even with Ajahn Chah by leaving.&quot; I was sure 
      that I would break his heart. Instead of leaving I learned patience. I 
      learned to let go of my own opinions and desires. I learned to be with 
      things the way they are. </P>
