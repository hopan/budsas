      say that he who sows is absolutely the same as he who reaps is one 
      extreme, and to say that he who sows is totally different from he who 
      reaps is the other extreme. Avoiding these two extremes, the Buddha 
      teaches the doctrine of the middle way in terms of cause and effect. 
      &quot;Neither the same nor another&quot; <I>(na ca so na ca añño),</I> writes the 
      Venerable Buddhaghosa in the Visuddhi Magga. The evolution of the 
      butterfly may be cited in illustration.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Its initial stage was 
      an egg. Then it turned into a caterpillar. Later it developed into a 
      chrysalis, and eventually into a butterfly. This process occurs in<B> </B>
      the course of one lifetime. The butterfly is neither the same as, nor 
      totally different from, the caterpillar. Here also there is a flux of 
      life, or a continuity.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Venerable N&#257;gasena 
      explains this point by citing the illustration of a lamp that burns 
      throughout the night. The flame of the first watch is not identical with 
      that of the last watch, yet throughout the night the light burns in 
      dependence upon one and the same lamp. As with the flame so there is a 
      continuity of life -- each succeeding stage depending upon the preceding 
      one.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Yes, because there is a 
      continuity or identity in process, which is substituted for an identical 
      personality.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">A child, for instance, 
      becomes a man. The latter is neither absolutely the same as the former -- 
      since the cells have undergone a complete change nor totally different -- 
      being the identical stream of life. Nevertheless, the individual, as man, 
      is responsible for whatever he has done in his childhood. Whether the flux 
      dies here and is reborn elsewhere, or continues to exist in the same life, 
      the essential factor is this continuity. Suppose a person was 'A' in his 
      last birth, and is 'B' in this. With the death of 'A' the physical 
      vehicle, the outward manifestation of Kammic energy is relinquished and, 
      with the birth of 'B' a fresh physical vehicle arises. Despite the 
      apparent material changes, the invisible stream of consciousness <I>
      (cittasantati) </I>continues to flow, uninterrupted by death, carrying 
      along with it all the impressions received from the tributary streams of 
      sense. Conventionally speaking, must not 'B' be responsible for the 
      actions of 'A' who was his predecessor?</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Some may object that in 
      this case there is no memory owing to the intervening death.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">But is identity or 
      memory absolutely essential in assessing moral responsibility?</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Strictly speaking, 
      neither is essential.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">If, for instance, a 
      person were to commit a crime and suddenly, losing his memory, were to 
      forget the incident, would he not be responsible for his act?</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">His forgetfulness would 
      not exempt him from responsibility for the commission of that crime. To 
      this, some may ask: &quot;What is the use of punishing him, for he is not aware 
      that he is being punished for that crime? Is there any justice here?&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Of course, there is 
      not, if we are arbitrarily governed by a God who rewards and punishes us.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Buddhists believe in a 
      just and rational law of Kamma that operates automatically and speak in 
      terms of cause and effect instead of rewards and punishments.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In the words of Bhikkhu 
      Sil&#257;c&#257;ra: </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;If a person does 
      something in sleep, gets out of bed and walks over the edge of a verandah, 
      he will fall into the road below and in all likelihood break an arm or 
      leg. But this will happen not at all as a punishment for sleep-walking, 
      but merely as its result. And the fact that he did not remember going out 
      on the verandah would not<B> </B>make the slightest difference to the 
      result of his fall from it, in the shape of broken bones. So</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
      <I>the follower of the Buddha takes measures to see that he<B> </B>does 
      not walk over verandahs or other dangerous places, asleep or awake, so as 
      to avoid hurting himself or anyone who might be below and on whom he might 
      fall.&quot;</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The fact that a person 
      does not remember his past is no hindrance to the intelligent 
      understanding of the working of Kammic law. It is the knowledge of the 
      inevitability of the sequence of Kamma in the course of one's life in 
      Sams&#257;ra that helps to mould the character of a Buddhist.</SPAN></FONT></P>
