      Buddha can be considered the most energetic and the most active of all 
      religious teachers that ever lived on earth. The whole day He was occupied 
      with His religious activities except when He was attending to His physical 
      needs. He was methodical and systematic in the performance of His daily 
      duties. His inner life was one of meditation and was concerned with the 
      experiencing of Nibb&#257;nic Bliss, while His outer life was one of selfless 
      service for the moral upliftment of the world. Himself enlightened, He 
      endeavoured His best to enlighten others and liberate them from the ills 
      of life.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">His day was divided 
      into five parts, namely, (i) The Forenoon Session, (ii) The Afternoon 
      Session, (iii) The First Watch, (iv) The Middle Watch and (v) The Last 
      Watch.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Forenoon Session</SPAN></B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Usually early in the 
      morning He surveys the world with His Divine Eye to see whom he could 
      help. If any person needs His spiritual assistance, uninvited He goes, 
      often on foot, some times by air using His psychic powers, and converts 
      that person to the right path. </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">As a rule He goes in 
      search of the vicious and the impure, but the pure and the virtuous come 
      in search of Him. </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">For instance, the 
      Buddha went of His own accord to convert the robber and murderer <I>
      Angulim&#257;la </I>and the wicked demon <I>&#256;1avaka, </I>but pious young <I>
      Vis&#257;kh&#257;, </I>generous millionaire <I>An&#257;thapindika, </I>and intellectual
      <I>S&#257;riputta </I>and<I> Moggall&#257;na </I>came up to Him for spiritual 
      guidance.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">While rendering such 
      spiritual service to whomsoever it is necessary, if He is not invited to 
      partake of alms by a lay supporter at some particular place, He, before 
      whom Kings prostrated themselves, would go in quest of alms through alleys 
      and streets, with bowl in hand, either alone or with His disciples. </SPAN>
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Standing silently at 
      the door of each house, without uttering a word, He collects whatever food 
      is offered and placed in the bowl and returns to the monastery. </SPAN>
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Even in His eightieth 
      year when He was old and in indifferent health, He went on His rounds for 
      alms in Ves&#257;li. </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Before midday He 
      finishes His meals. Immediately after lunch He daily delivers a short 
      discourse to the people, establishes them in the Three Refuges and the 
      Five Precepts and if any person is spiritually advanced, he is shown the 
      Path to Sainthood. </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">At times He grants 
      Ordination to them if they seek admission to the Order and then retires to 
      His chamber.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      Session</SPAN></B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">After the noon meal He 
      takes a seat in the monastery and the Bhikkhus assemble to listen to His 
      exposition of the Dhamma. Some approach Him to receive suitable objects of 
      meditation according to their temperaments; others pay their due respects 
      to Him and retire to their cells to spend the afternoon.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">After His discourse or 
      exhortation to His disciples, He Himself retires to His private Perfumed 
      Chamber to rest. If He so desires, He lies on His right side and sleeps 
      for a while with mindfulness. On rising, He attains to the Ecstasy of 
      Great Compassion <I>(Mah&#257; Karun&#257; Sam&#257;patti)</I> and surveys, with His 
      Divine Eye, the world, especially the Bhikkhus who retired to solitude for 
      meditation and other disciples in order to give them any spiritual advice 
      that is needed. If the erring ones who need advice happen to be at a 
      distance, there He goes by psychic powers, admonishes them and retires to 
      His chamber.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Towards evening the lay

      about one hour. Each member of the audience, though differently 
      constituted, thinks that the Buddha's sermon is directed in particular to 
      him. Such was the Buddha's method of expounding the Dhamma. As a rule the 
      Buddha converts others by explaining His teachings with homely 
      illustrations and parables, for He appeals more to the intellect than to 
      emotion. </FONT></SPAN></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">To the average man the 
      Buddha at first speaks of generosity, discipline, and heavenly bliss. To 
      the more advanced He speaks on the evils of material pleasures and on the 
      blessings of renunciation. To the highly advanced He expounds the Four 
      Noble Truths.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">On rare occasions as in 
      the case <I>of Angulim&#257;la</I> and <I>Khem&#257; </I>did the Buddha resort to 
      His psychic powers to effect a change of heart in His listeners.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The sublime teachings 
      of the Buddha appealed to both the masses and the intelligentsia alike. A

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">This period of the 
      night extends from 6 to 10 p.m. and was exclusively reserved for 
      instruction to Bhikkhus. During this time the Bhikkhus were free to 
      approach the Buddha and get their doubts cleared, question Him on the 
      intricacies of the Dhamma, obtain suitable objects of meditation, and hear 
      the doctrine.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      which extends from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Celestial Beings such as Devas and 
      Brahmas, who are invisible to the physical eye, approach the Buddha to 
      question Him on the Dhamma. An oft-recurring passage in the Suttas is: 
      &quot;Now when the night was far spent a certain Deva of surpassing splendour 
      came to the Buddha, respectfully saluted Him and stood at a side.&quot; Several 
      discourses and answers given to their queries appear in the Samyutta 
      Nik&#257;ya.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      morning, extending from 2 to 6 a.m. which comprise the last watch, are 
      divided into four parts.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The first part is spent 
      in pacing up and down <I>(cankamana). </I>This serves as a mild physical 
      exercise to Him. During the second part, that is from 3 to 4 a.m. He 
      mindfully sleeps on His right side. During the third part, that is from 4 
      to 5 a.m., He attains the state of Arahantship and experiences Nibb&#257;nic 
      bliss. For one full hour from 5 to 6 a.m. He attains the Ecstasy of Great 
      Compassion <I>(Mah&#257; Karun&#257;sam&#257;patti) </I>and radiates thoughts of 
      loving-kindness towards all beings and softens their hearts. At this early 
      hour He surveys the whole world with His Buddha-Eye to see whether He 
      could be of service to any. The virtuous and those that need His help 
      appear vividly before Him though they may live at a remote distance. Out 
      of compassion for them He goes of His own accord and renders necessary 
      spiritual assistance.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The whole day He is 
      fully occupied with His religious duties. Unlike any other living being He 
      sleeps only for one hour at night. For two full<B> </B>hours in the 
      morning and at dawn He pervades the whole world with thoughts of boundless 
      love and brings happiness to millions. Leading a life of voluntary 
      poverty, seeking His alms without inconveniencing any, wandering from 
      place to place for eight months throughout the year preaching His sublime 
      Dhamma, He tirelessly worked for the good and happiness of all till His 
      eightieth year.</SPAN></FONT></P>
