      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Introduction</SPAN></B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Ancient India was noted 
      for distinguished philosophers and religious teachers who held diverse 
      views with regard to life and its goal. Brahmaj&#257;la Sutta of the D&#299;gha 
      Nik&#257;ya mentions sixty two varieties of philosophical theories that 
      prevailed in the time of the Buddha.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">One extreme view that 
      was diametrically opposed to all current religious beliefs was the 
      nihilistic teaching of the materialists who were also termed <I>C&#257;rv&#257;kas
      </I>after the name of the founder.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">According to ancient 
      materialism which, in P&#257;li and Samskrit, was known as Lok&#257;yata, man is 
      annihilated after death, leaving behind him whatever force generated by 
      him. In their opinion death is the end of all. This present world alone is 
      real. &quot;Eat, drink, and be merry, for death comes to all,&quot; appears to be 
      the ideal of their system. &quot;Virtue&quot;, they say, &quot;is a delusion and 
      enjoyment is the only reality. Religion is a foolish aberration, a mental 
      disease. There was a distrust of everything good, high, pure and 
      compassionate. Their theory stands for sensualism and selfishness and the 
      gross affirmation of the loud will. There is no need to control passion 
      and instinct, since they are the nature's legacy to men.</FONT><A HREF="#_edn1" NAME="_ednref1" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[1]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN><P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Another extreme view 
      was that emancipation was possible only by leading a life of strict 
      asceticism. This was purely a religious doctrine firmly held by the 
      ascetics of the highest order. The five monks that attended on the 
      Bodhisatta, during His struggle for Enlightenment, tenaciously adhered to 
      this belief.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In accordance with this 
      view the Buddha, too, before His Enlightenment subjected Himself to all 
      forms of austerity. After an extraordinary struggle for six years He 
      realized the utter futility of self-mortification. Consequently, He 
      changed His unsuccessful hard course and adopted a middle way. His 
      favourite disciples thus lost confidence in Him and deserted Him, saying 
      -- &quot;The ascetic <I>Gotama</I> had become luxurious, had ceased from 
      striving, and had returned to a life of comfort.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Their unexpected 
      desertion was definitely a material loss to Him as they ministered to all 
      His needs. Nevertheless, He was not discouraged. The iron-willed 
      Bodhisatta must have probably felt happy for being left alone. With 
      unabated enthusiasm and with restored energy He persistently strove until 
      He attained Enlightenment, the object of His life.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Precisely two months 
      after His Enlightenment on the <I>As&#257;lha </I>(July) full moon day the 
      Buddha delivered His first discourse to the five monks that attended on 
      Him.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The first Discourse 
      of the Buddha</SPAN></B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Dhammacakka </SPAN>
      </I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">is the name given to this first discourse of the 
      Buddha. It is frequently represented as meaning &quot;The Kingdom of Truth.&quot; 
      &quot;The Kingdom of Righteous-ness.&quot; &quot;The Wheel of Truth.&quot; According to the 
      commentators <I>Dhamma</I> here means wisdom or knowledge, and <I>Cakka</I> 
      means founding or establishment. <I>Dhammacakka</I> therefore means the 
      founding or establishment of wisdom<I>. Dhammacakkappavattana </I>means 
      The Expositon of the Establishment of Wisdom. <I>Dhamma</I> may also be 
      interpreted as Truth, and <I>cakka </I>as wheel. <I>Dhammacakkappavattana
      </I>would therefore mean -- The Turning or The Establishment of the Wheel 
      of Truth.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In this most important 
      discourse the Buddha expounds the Middle Path which He Himself discovered 
      and which forms the essence of His new teaching. He opened the discourse 
      by exhorting the five monks who believed in strict asceticism to avoid the 
      extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification as both do not lead to 
      perfect Peace and Enlightenment. The former retards one's spiritual 
      progress, the latter weakens one's intellect. He criticized both views as 
      He realized by personal experience their futility and enunciated the most 
      practicable, rational and beneficial path, which alone leads to perfect 
      purity and absolute Deliverance.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">This discourse was 
      expounded by the Buddha while He was residing at the Deer Park in 
      Isipatana near Benares.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The intellectual five 
      monks who were closely associated with the Buddha for six years were the 
      only human beings that were present to hear the sermon. Books state that 
      many invisible beings such as Devas and Brahmas also took advantage of the 
      golden opportunity of listening to the sermon. As Buddhists believe in the 
      existence of realms other than this world, inhabited by beings with subtle 
      bodies imperceptible to the physical eye, possibly many Devas and Brahmas 
      were also present on this great occasion. Nevertheless, it is clear that 
      the Buddha was directly addressing the five monks and the discourse was 
      intended mainly for them.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">At the outset the 
      Buddha cautioned them to avoid the two extremes. His actual words were: 
      &quot;There are two extremes <I>(ant&#257;) </I>which should not be resorted to by a 
      recluse <I>(pabbajitena).&quot; </I>Special emphasis was laid on the two terms
      <I>&quot;ant&#257;&quot;</I> which means end or extreme and <I>&quot;pabbajita&quot;</I> which 
      means one who has renounced the world.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">One extreme, in the 
      Buddha's own words, was the constant attachment to sensual pleasures <I>
      (k&#257;masukhal-lik&#257;nuyoga). </I>The Buddha described this extreme as base, 
      vulgar, worldly, ignoble, and profitless. This should not be misunderstood 
      to mean that the Buddha expects all His followers to give up material 
      pleasures and retire to a forest without enjoying this life. The Buddha 
      was not so narrow- minded.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Whatever the deluded 
      sensualist may feel about it, to the dispassionate thinker the enjoyment 
      of sensual pleasures is distinctly short-lived, never completely 
      satisfying, and results in unpleasant reactions. Speaking of worldly 
      happiness, the Buddha says that the acquisition of wealth and the 
      enjoyment of possessions are two sources of pleasure for a layman. An 
      understanding recluse would not however seek delight in the pursuit of 
      these fleeting pleasures. To the surprise of the average man he might shun 
      them. What constitutes pleasure to the former is a source of alarm to the 
      latter to whom renunciation alone is pleasure.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The other extreme is 
      the constant addiction to self-mortification <I>(attakilamath&#257;nuyoga). </I>
      Commenting on this extreme, which is not practised by the ordinary man, 
      the Buddha remarks that it is painful, ignoble, and profitless. Unlike the 
      first extreme this is not described as base, worldly, and vulgar. The 
      selection of these three terms <B>is </B>very striking. As a rule it is 
      the sincere recluse who has renounced his attachment to sensual pleasures 
      that resorts to this painful method, mainly with the object of gaining his 
      deliverance from the ills of life. The Buddha, who has had painful 
      experience of this profitless course, describes it as useless. It only 
      multiplies suffering instead of diminishing it.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddhas and 
      Arahants are described as <I>Ariyas </I>meaning Nobles. <I>Anariya </I>
      (ignoble) may therefore be construed as not characteristic of the Buddha 
      and Arahants who are free from passions. <I>Attha </I>means the ultimate 
      Good, which for a Buddhist is Nibb&#257;na, the complete emancipation from 
      suffering. Therefore <I>anatthasamhit&#257; </I>may be construed as not 
      conducive to ultimate Good.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddha at first 
      cleared the issues and removed the false notions of His hearers. </SPAN>
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When their troubled 
      minds became pliable and receptive the Buddha related His personal 
      experience with regard to these two extremes.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddha says that He 
      (the Tath&#257;gata), realizing the error of both these two extremes, followed 
      a middle path. This new path or way was discovered by Himself. The Buddha 
      termed His new system <I>Majjhim&#257; Patipad&#257; -- </I>the Middle Way. To 
      persuade His disciples to give heed to His new path He spoke of its 
      various blessings. Unlike the two diametrically opposite extremes this 
      middle path produces spiritual insight and intellectual wisdom to see 
      things as they truly are. When the insight is clarified and the intellect 
      is sharpened everything is seen in its true perspective.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Furthermore, unlike the 
      first extreme which stimulates passions, this Middle Way leads to the 
      subjugation of passions which results in Peace. Above all it leads to the 
      attainment of the four supramundane Paths of Sainthood, to the 
      understanding of the four Noble Truths, and finally to the realization of 
      the ultimate Goal, Nibb&#257;na.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Now, what is the Middle 
      Way? The Buddha replies: It is the Noble Eightfold Path. The eight factors 
      are then enumerated in the discourse.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The first factor is 
      Right Understanding, the keynote of Buddhism. The Buddha started with 
      Right Understanding in order to clear the doubts of the monks and guide 
      them on the right way.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Right Understanding 
      deals with the knowledge of oneself as one really is; it leads to Right 
      Thoughts of non-attachment or renunciation <I>(nekkhamma samkappa), </I>
      loving-kindness <I>(avy&#257;p&#257;da samkappa), </I>and harmlessness <I>(avihims&#257;</I>
      <I>samkappa)</I>, which are opposed to selfishness, illwill, and cruelty 
      respectively. Right Thoughts result in Right Speech, Right Action, and 
      Right Livelihood, which three factors perfect one's morality. The sixth 
      factor is Right Effort which deals with the elimination of evil states and 
      the development of good states in oneself. This self-purification is best 
      done by a careful introspection, for which Right Mindfulness, the seventh 
      factor, is essential. Effort, combined with Mindfulness, produces Right 
      Concentration or one-pointedness of the mind, the eighth factor. A 
      one-pointed mind resembles a polished mirror where everything is clearly 
      reflected with no distortion.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Prefacing the discourse 
      with the two extremes and His newly discovered Middle Way, the Buddha 
      expounded the Four Noble Truths in detail.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Sacca </SPAN></I>
      <SPAN LANG="EN-US">is the P&#257;li term for Truth which means <I>that which 
      is. </I>Its Samskrit equivalent is <I>satya</I> which denotes an 
      incontrovertible fact. The Buddha enunciates four such Truths, the 
      foundations of His teaching, which are associated with the so-called 
      being. Hence His doctrine is homocentric, opposed to theo-centric 
      religions. It is introvert and not extrovert. Whether the Buddha arises or 
      not these Truths exist, and it is a Buddha that reveals them to the 
      deluded world. They do not and cannot change with time, because they are 
      eternal truths. The Buddha was not indebted to anyone for His realization 
      of them, as He Himself remarked in this discourse thus: &quot;With regard to 
      things unheard before, there arose in me the eye, the knowledge, the 
      wisdom, the insight and the light.&quot; These words are very significant 
      because they testify to the originality of His new Teaching. Hence there 
      is no justification in the statement that Buddhism is a natural outgrowth 
      of Hinduism, although it is true that there are some fundamental doctrines 
      common to both systems.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">These Truths are in 
      P&#257;li termed <I>Ariya Sacc&#257;ni. </I>They are so called because they were 
      discovered by the Greatest Ariya, that is, one who is far removed from 
      passions.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The First Noble Truth 
      deals with <I>dukkha </I>which, for need of a better English equivalent, 
      is inappropriately rendered by suffering or sorrow. As a feeling <I>dukkha
      </I>means that which is difficult to be endured. As an abstract truth <I>
      dukkha </I>is used in the sense of contemptible <I>(du)</I> emptiness <I>
      (kha). </I>The world rests on suffering -- hence it is contemptible. It is 
      devoid of any reality -- hence it is empty or void. <I>Dukkha </I>
      therefore means contemptible void.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Average men are only 
      surface-seers. An Ariya sees things as they truly are.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">To an Ariya all life is 
      suffering and he finds no real happiness in this world which deceives 
      mankind with illusory pleasures. Material happiness is merely the 
      gratification of some desire.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">All are subject to 
      birth <I>(j&#257;ti) </I>and consequently to decay <I>(jar&#257;), </I>disease<I> 
      (vy&#257;dhi) </I>and finally to death<I> (marana). </I>No one is exempt from 
      these four causes of suffering.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Wish unfulfilled is 
      also suffering. As a rule one does not wish to be associated with things 
      or persons one detests nor does one wish to be separated from things or 
      persons one likes. One's cherished desires are not however always 
      gratified. At times what one least expects or what one least desires is 
      thrust on oneself. Such unexpected unpleasant circumstances become so 
      intolerable and painful that weak ignorant people are compelled to commit 
      suicide as if such an act would solve the problem.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Real happiness is found 
      within, and is not to be defined in terms of wealth, power, honours or 
      conquests. If such worldly possessions are forcibly or unjustly obtained, 
      or are misdirected or even viewed with attachment, they become a source of 
      pain and sorrow for the possessors.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Normally the enjoyment 
      of sensual pleasures is the highest and only happiness of the average 
      person. There is no doubt some momentary happiness in the anticipation, 
      gratification, and retrospection of such fleeting material pleasures, but 
      they are illusory and temporary. According to the Buddha non-attachment <I>
      (vir&#257;gatt&#257;) </I>or the transcending of material pleasures is a greater 
      bliss.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In brief this composite 
      body <I>(pañcup&#257;danakkhandha) </I>itself is a cause of suffering.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">There are three kinds 
      of craving. The first is the grossest form of craving, which is simple 
      attachment to all sensual pleasures <I>(k&#257;matanh&#257;). </I>The second is 
      attachment to existence <I>(bhavatanh&#257;). </I>The third is attachment to 
      non-existence <I>(vibhavatanh&#257;). </I>According to the commentaries the 
      last two kinds of craving are attachment to sensual pleasures connected 
      with the belief of Eternalism <I>(sassataditthi) </I>and that which is 
      connected with the belief of Nihilism <I>(ucchedaditthi). Bhavatanh&#257;</I>
