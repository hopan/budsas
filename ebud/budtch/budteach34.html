      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Arising or becoming is an essential characteristic 
      of everything that is conditioned by a cause or causes. That which arises 
      or becomes is subject to change and dissolution. Every conditioned thing 
      is constantly becoming and is perpetually changing. The universal law of 
      change applies to everything in the cosmos -- both mental, and physical -- 
      ranging from the minutest germ or tiniest particle to the highest being or 
      the most massive object. Mind, though imperceptible, changes faster even 
      than matter.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Nibb&#257;na, a supramundane state, realized by Buddhas 
      and Arahants, is declared to be not conditioned by any cause. Hence it is 
      not subject to any becoming, change and dissolution. It is birthless <I>
      (aj&#257;ta), </I>decayless<I> (ajara), </I>and deathless <I>(amara). </I>
      Strictly speaking, Nibb&#257;na is neither a cause nor an effect. Hence it is 
      unique <I>(kevala).</I></SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Everything that has sprung from a cause must 
      inevitably pass away, and as such is undesirable <I>(asubha).</I></SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Life is man's dearest possession, but when he is 
      confronted with insuperable difficulties and unbearable burdens, then that 
      very life becomes an intolerable burden. Sometimes he tries to seek relief 
      by putting an end to his life as if suicide would solve all his individual 
      problems.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Bodies are adorned and adored. But those charming, 
      adorable and enticing forms, when disfigured by time and disease, become 
      extremely repulsive.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Men desire to live peacefully and happily with their 
      near ones, surrounded by amusements and pleasures, but, if by some 
      misfortune, the wicked world runs counter to their ambitions and desires, 
      the inevitable sorrow is then almost indescribably sharp.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The following beautiful parable aptly illustrates 
      the fleeting nature of life and its alluring pleasures.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">A man was forcing his way through a thick forest 
      beset with thorns and stones. Suddenly to his great consternation, an 
      elephant appeared and gave chase. He took to his heels through fear, and, 
      seeing a well, he ran to hide in it. But to his horror he saw a viper at 
      the bottom of the well. However, lacking other means of escape, he jumped 
      into the well, and clung to a thorny creeper that was growing in it. 
      Looking up, he saw two mice -- a white one and a black one -- gnawing at 
      the creeper. Over his face there was a beehive from which occasional drops 
      of honey trickled.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">This man, foolishly unmindful of this precarious 
      position, was greedily tasting the honey. A kind person volunteered to 
      show him a path of escape. But the greedy man begged to be excused till he 
      had enjoyed himself.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The thorny path is sams&#257;ra, the ocean of life. Man's 
      life is not a bed of roses. It is beset with difficulties and obstacles to 
      overcome, with opposition and unjust criticism, with attacks and insults 
      to be borne. Such is the thorny path of life.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The elephant here resembles death; the viper, old 
      age; the creeper, birth; the two mice, night and day. The drops of honey 
      correspond to the fleeting sensual pleasures. The man represents the 
      so-called being. The kind person represents the Buddha.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The temporary material happiness is merely the 
      gratification of some desire. When the desired thing is gained, another 
      desire arises. Insatiate are all desires.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Sorrow is essential to life, and cannot be evaded.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Nibb&#257;na, being non-conditioned, is eternal, <I>
      (dhuva), </I>desirable<I> (subha), </I>and happy <I>(sukha).</I></SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The happiness of Nibb&#257;na should be differentiated 
      from ordinary worldly happiness. Nibb&#257;nic bliss grows neither stale nor 
      monotonous. It is a form of happiness that never wearies, never 
      fluctuates. It arises by allaying passions <I>(vupasama) </I>unlike that 
      temporary worldly happiness which results from the gratification of some 
      desire <I>(vedayita).</I></SPAN></P>

      [2]</SPAN></SPAN></A> the Buddha enumerates ten grades of happiness 
      beginning with the gross material pleasures which result from the pleasant 
      stimulation of the senses. As one ascends higher and higher in the moral 
      plane the type of happiness becomes ever more exalted, sublime and subtle, 
      so much so that the world scarcely recognizes it as happiness. In the 
      first <I>Jh&#257;na </I>one experiences a transcendental happiness <I>(sukha),</I> 
      absolutely independent of the five senses. This happiness is realized by 
      inhibiting the desire for the pleasures of the senses, highly prized by 
      the materialist. In the fourth <I>Jh&#257;na<B> </B></I>however, even this type

      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The chief difference between the Buddhist concepion 
      of Nibb&#257;na and the Hindu conception of Nirv&#257;na or Mukti lies in the fact 
      that Buddhists view their goal without an eternal soul and creator, while 
      Hindus do believe in an eternal soul and a creator.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">This is the reason why Buddhism can neither be 
      called Eternalism nor Nihilism.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In Nibb&#257;na nothing is 'eternalised' nor is anything 
      'annihilated.'</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">As Sir Edwin Arnold says:--</SPAN></P>

      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It must be admitted that this question of Nibb&#257;na is 
      the most difficult in the Teaching of the Buddha. However much we may 
      speculate we shall never be in a position to comprehend its real nature. 
      The best way to understand Nibb&#257;na is to try to realize it with our own 
      intuitive knowledge.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Although Nibb&#257;na cannot be perceived by the five 
      senses and lies in obscurity in so far as the average man is concerned, 
      the only straight path that leads to Nibb&#257;na has been explained by the 
      Buddha with all the necessary details and is laid open to all. The goal is 
      now clouded, but the method of achievement is perfectly clear and when 
      that achievement is realized, the Goal is as clear as &quot;<I>the moon freed 
      from clouds</I>.&quot;</SPAN></P>
