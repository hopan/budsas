      pivot of suffering. Although Buddhism emphasizes the existence of 
      suffering yet it does not follow that Buddhism is a pessimistic religion. 
      On the contrary it is neither totally pessimistic nor totally optimistic

      attitude of hopelessness towards life, a vague general opinion that pain

      is in fact as optimistic as any optimism of the West. To call it 
      'pessimism' is merely to apply to it a characteristically Western 
      Principle according to which happiness is impossible without personality. 
      The true Buddhist looks forward with enthusiasm to absorption into eternal 
      Bliss.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>

      of another as life <B>is </B>precious to all. </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">A Bhikkhu is expected 
      to exercise this loving kindness to such an extent that he is forbidden by 
      the Vinaya rules even to dig or cause to dig the ground. He cannot even 
      drink water without it being filtered.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Asoka, </SPAN></I>
      <SPAN LANG="EN-US">the greatest Buddhist King, wrote on rock and monolith, 
      saying: &quot;The living must not be nourished with the living. Even chaff with 
      insects must not be burnt.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">A genuine Buddhist must 
      practise this Mett&#257; towards every living being and identify himself with 
      all, making no distinctions whatever. It is this Buddhist Mett&#257;, one of 
      the most salient characteristics of Buddhism, that attempts to break all 
      the barriers of caste, colour and creed which separate one man from 
      another. If followers of different faiths cannot meet on a common platform 
      like brothers and sisters just because they belong to different religions, 
      then surely the religious teachers have failed in their noble missions.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In that noble 
      Toleration Edict, which is based on the Culla Vy&#363;ha and Mah&#257; Vy&#363;ha Suttas, 
      King <I>Asoka </I>says: &quot;Concourse alone is best, that is, all should 
      hearken willingly to the doctrines professed by others.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In its teaching 
      Buddhism has no features to confine it to any particular nation or any 
      particular country. It is universal in its appeal.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">To the Buddhist there 
      is no far or near, no enemy or foreigner, no renegade or untouchable, 
      since universal love, realized through understanding, has established the 
      brotherhood of all living beings. A real Buddhist is a citizen of the 
      world.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Some salient 
      characteristics of Buddhism are, therefore, its rationality, 
      practicability, efficacy, non-aggressiveness, harmlessness, tolerance, and 
      universality.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Buddhism is the noblest 
      of all unifying and uplifting influences that has operated for more than 
      2500 years.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Nations have come and 
      gone. Empires built on might and force have flourished and perished. But 
      the Dhamma Empire of the Buddha, founded on love and reason, still 
      flourishes and will continue to flourish as long as its followers adhere 
      to its noble principles.</SPAN></FONT></P>
