      is a mysterious being with inconceivable potentialities. Latent in him are 
      both saintly characteristics and criminal tendencies. They may rise to the 
      surface at unexpected moments in disconcerting strength. How they 
      originated we know not. We only know that they are dormant in man in 
      varying degree.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Within the powerful 
      mind in this complex machinery of man are also found a storehouse of 
      virtue and a rubbish heap of evil. With the development of the respective 
      characteristics man may become either a blessing or a curse to humanity.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Those who wish to be 
      great, noble and serviceable, who wish to sublimate themselves and, serve 
      humanity both by example and by precept, and who wish to avail themselves 
      of this golden opportunity as human beings, endeavour their best to remove 
      the latent vices and to cultivate the dormant virtues.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">To dig up precious gems 
      embedded in the earth men spend enormous sums of money and make laborious 
      efforts, and sometimes even sacrifice their lives. But to dig up the 
      valuable treasures latent in man, only persistent effort and enduring 
      patience are necessary. Even the poorest man or woman can accomplish this 
      task, for wealth is not an essential prerequisite to the accumulation of 
      transcendental treasures.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It is strange that the 
      vices latent in man seem to be almost natural and spontaneous. It is 
      equally strange that every vice possesses its opposite sterling virtue, 
      which does not however appear to be so normal and automatic, though still 
      within the range of all.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">One powerful 
      destructive vice in man is anger <I>(dosa). </I>The sweet virtue that 
      subdues this evil force and sublimes man is loving-kindness <I>(mett&#257;).</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Cruelty <I>(hims&#257;) </I>
      is another vice that is responsible for many horrors and atrocities

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Jealousy <I>(iss&#257;) </I>
      is another vice that poisons one's system and leads to unhealthy rivalries

      drug is appreciative joy<I> (mudit&#257;).</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">There are two other 
      universal characteristics that upset the mental equipoise of man. They are 
      attachment to the pleasurable and aversion to the non-pleasurable. These 
      two opposite forces can be eliminated by developing equanimity <I>
      (upekkh&#257;).</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">These four sterling 
      virtues are collectively termed in P&#257;li <I>&quot;Brahmavih&#257;ra&quot;</I> which may be 
      rendered by Modes of Sublime Conduct, Sublime States, or Divine Abodes.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">These virtues tend to 
      elevate man. They make one divine in this life itself. They can transform 
      man into a superman. If all try to cultivate them, irrespective of creed, 
      colour, race, or sex, the earth can be transformed into a paradise where 
      all can live in perfect peace and harmony as ideal citizens of one world.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The four sublime 
      virtues are also termed illimitables <I>(appamaññ&#257;). </I>They are so

      towards all beings without exception. They embrace all living beings 
      including animals.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Irrespective of

      is <I>Mett&#257;</I> <I>(Samskrit-Maitri). </I>It means that which softens 
      one's heart, or the state of a true friend. It is defined as the sincere 
      wish for the welfare and genuine happiness of all living beings without 
      exception. It is also explained as the friendly disposition, for a genuine 
      friend sincerely wishes for the welfare of his friend.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Just as a mother 
      protects her only child even at the risk of her life, even so one should 
      cultivate boundless loving-kindness towards all living beings&quot; is the 
      advice of the Buddha.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It is not the 
      passionate love of the mother towards her child that is stressed here but 
      her sincere wish for the genuine welfare of her child.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Mett&#257; is neither carnal 
      love nor personal affection, for grief inevitably arises from both.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Mett&#257; is not mere 
      neighbourliness, for it makes no distinction between neighbours and 
      others.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Mett&#257; is not mere 
      universal brotherhood, for it embraces all living beings including 
      animals, our lesser brethren and sisters that need greater compassion as 
      they are helpless.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Mett&#257; is not political 
      brotherhood or racial brotherhood, or national brotherhood, or even 
      religious brotherhood.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Political brotherhood 
      is confined only to those who share similar political views, such as the 
      partial brotherhood of Democrats, Socialists, Communists, and so forth.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Racial brotherhood and 
      national brotherhood are restricted only to those of the same race and 
      nation. Some nationalists love their race so much that sometimes they 
      ruthlessly kill innocent men, women and children because they 
      unfortunately are not blessed with blond hair and blue eyes. The white 
      races have particular love for the white skin, the black for the black, 
      the yellow for the yellow, the brown for the brown, the pale for the pale, 
      the red for the red. Others of a different complexion are at times viewed 
      with suspicion and fear. Very often to assert their racial superiority 
      they resort to brutal warfare, killing millions by mercilessly raining 
      bombs from the sky above. The pathetic incidents of the Second World War 
      are striking examples which can never be forgotten by mankind.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Amongst some 
      narrow-minded peoples, within the wider circle of their ancient nations, 
      there exist minor circles of caste and class where the so-called 
      brotherhood of the powerful oppressors is so limited that the oppressed 
      are not even permitted to enjoy bare human rights merely because of the 
      accidents of birth or class. These oppressors are to be pitied because 
      they are confined to their water-tight compartments.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Mett&#257; is not religious 
      brotherhood either. Owing to the sad limitations of so-called religious 
      brotherhood human heads have been severed without the least compunction, 
      sincere outspoken men and women have been roasted and burnt alive; many 
      atrocities have been perpetrated which baffle description; cruel wars have 
      been waged which mar the pages of world history. Even in this supposedly 
      enlightened twentieth century the followers of one religion hate or 
      ruthlessly persecute and even kill those of other faiths merely because 
      they cannot force them to think as they do or because they have a 
      different label.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">If, on account of 
      religious views, people of different faiths cannot meet on a common 
      platform like brothers and sisters, then surely the missions of 
      compassionate world teachers have pitifully failed.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Sweet <I>mett&#257; </I>
      transcends all these kinds of narrow brotherhood. It is limitless in scope 
      and range. Barriers it has none. Discrimination it makes not. Mett&#257; 
      enables one to regard the whole world as one's motherland and all as 
      fellow beings.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Just as the sun sheds 
      its rays on all without any distinction, even so sublime <I>mett&#257; </I>
      bestows its sweet blessings equally on the pleasant and the unpleasant, on 
      the rich and the poor, on the high and the low, on the vicious and the 
      virtuous, on man and woman, and on human and animal.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Such was the boundless
      <I>Mett&#257; </I>of the Buddha who worked for the welfare and happiness of 
      those who loved Him as well as of those who hated Him and even attempted 
      to harm and kill Him.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddha exercised <I>
      mett&#257; </I>equally towards His own son R&#257;hula, His adversary Devadatta, His 
      attendant &#256;nanda, His admirers and His opponents.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">This loving-kindness 
      should be extended in equal measure towards oneself as towards friend, foe 
      and neutral alike. Suppose a bandit were to approach a person travelling 
      through a forest with an intimate friend, a neutral person and an enemy, 
      and suppose he were to demand that one of them be offered as a victim. If 
      the traveller were to say that he himself should be taken, then he would 
      have no <I>mett&#257; </I>towards himself. If he were to say that anyone of the 
      other three persons should be taken, then he would have no <I>mett&#257; </I>
      towards them.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Such is the 
      characteristic of real <I>mett&#257;. </I>In exercising this boundless 
      loving-kindness oneself should not be ignored. This subtle point should 
      not be misunderstood, for self-sacrifice is another sweet virtue and 
      egolessness is yet another higher virtue. The culmination of this <I>mett&#257;
      </I>is the identification of oneself with all beings <I>(sabbattat&#257;),</I> 
      making no difference between oneself and others. The so-called &quot;I&quot; is lost 
      in the whole. Separatism evaporates. Oneness is realized.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">There is no proper 
      English equivalent for this graceful P&#257;li term <I>Mett&#257;. </I>Goodwill, 
      loving-kindness, benevolence and universal love are suggested as the best 
      renderings.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The antithesis of <I>
      mett&#257; </I>is anger, ill-will, hatred, or aversion. <I>Mett&#257; </I>cannot

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Mett&#257; not only tends to 
      conquer anger but also does not tolerate hateful thoughts towards others. 
      He who has <I>mett&#257; </I>never thinks of harming others, nor does he 
      disparage or condemn others. Such a person is neither afraid of others nor 
      does he instil fear into any.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">A subtle indirect enemy 
      assails <I>mett&#257; </I>in the guise of a friend. It is selfish affection <I>
      (pema), </I>for unguarded <I>mett&#257; </I>may sometimes be assailed by lust. 
      This indirect enemy resembles a person who lurks afar in the jungles or 
      hills to cause harm to another. Grief springs from affection but not from
      <I>mett&#257;.</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">This delicate point 
      should not be misunderstood. Parents surely cannot avoid having affection 
      towards their children and children towards their parents; husbands 
      towards their wives and wives towards their husbands. Such affection is 
      quite natural. The world cannot exist without mutual affection. The point 
      to be clarified here is that unselfish mett&#257; is not synonymous with 
      ordinary affection.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">A benevolent attitude 
      is the chief characteristic of <I>inett&#257;. </I>He who practises <I>mett&#257;
      </I>is constantly interested in promoting the welfare of others. He seeks 
      the good and beautiful in all but not the ugliness in others.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">1. He who practises <I>
      mett&#257; </I>sleeps happily. As he goes to sleep with a light heart free from 
      hatred he naturally falls asleep at once. This fact is clearly 
      demonstrated by those who are full of loving-kindness. They are fast 
      asleep immediately on closing their eyes.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">2. As he goes to sleep 
      with a loving heart he awakes with an equally loving heart. Benevolent and 
      compas-sionate persons often rise from bed with smiling faces.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">3. Even in sleep loving 
      persons are not perturbed by bad dreams. As they are full of love during 
      their waking hours, they are peaceful in their sleeping hours too. Either 
      they fall into deep sleep or have pleasant dreams.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">4. He becomes dear to 
      human beings. As he loves others, so do others love him.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When a persons looks at 
      a mirror with a smiling face, a similar face will greet him. If, on the 
      contrary, he looks with a wry face, he will see a similar reflection. The 
      outside world reacts on one in the same way that one acts towards the 
      world. One full of faults himself is apt to see the evil in others. The 
      good he ignores. An English poet -- Bolton Hall -- has put it beautifully: 
      --</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;I looked at my 
      brother with the Microscope of</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> <I>Criticism.<BR>

      I looked at him through the Telescope of Scorn<BR>
      And I said, 'How small my brother is!'<BR>
      Then I looked in the Mirror of Truth<BR>
      And I said, 'How like me my brother is!' &quot;</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Why should we see the

      good and beautiful in all.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">5. He who practises <I>
      mett&#257; </I>is dear to non-humans as well. Animals are also attracted to 
      him. Radiating their loving-kindness, ascetics live in wild forests amidst 
      ferocious beasts without being harmed by them.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">6. Owing to his power 
      of <I>mett&#257; </I>he becomes immune from poison and so forth unless he is 
      subject to some inexorable Kamma.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">As<I> mett&#257; </I>is a 
      constructive healthy force it has the power to counteract hostile 
      influence. Just as hateful thoughts can produce toxic effects in the 
      system, even so loving thoughts can produce healthy physical effects. It 
      is stated that a very generous and devout woman named Suppiy&#257;, who had a 
      wound in her thigh, was healed on seeing the Buddha. The peaceful thought 
      vibrations of the Buddha and the woman combined to produce this salutary 
      effect.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When the Buddha visited 
      His birthplace for the first time, His son R&#257;hula, who was only seven

      your shadow is pleasing to me.&quot; The child was so much dominated by the 
      Buddha's <I>mett&#257; </I>that he deeply felt its magnetic power.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      to quick mental concentration. As the mind is not perturbed by hostile 
      vibrations one-pointedness can be gained with ease. With mind at peace he 
      will live in a heaven of his own creation. Even those who come in contact 
      with him will also experience that bliss.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">9.<I> Mett&#257; </I>tends 
      to beautify one's facial expression. The face as a rule reflects the state 
      of the mind. When one gets angry, the heart pumps blood twice or three 
      times faster than the normal rate. Heated blood rushes up to the face, 
      which then turns red or black. At times the face becomes repulsive to 
      sight. Loving thoughts on the contrary, gladden the heart and clarify the 
      blood. The face then presents a lovable appearance.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It is stated that when 
      the Buddha, after Enlightenment, reflected on the Causal Relations <I>
      (Patth&#257;na), </I>His heart was so pacified and His blood so clarified that 
      rays of different hue such as blue, yellow, red, white, orange, and a 
      mixture of these emanated from His body.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">10. A person imbued

      would run after its mother he ran from cell to cell in the monastery

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Mett&#257;</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> 
      should be practised first towards oneself. In doing so a person should 
      charge his mind and body with positive thoughts of peace and happiness. He 
      should think how he could be peaceful, happy, free from suffering, worry 
      and anger. He then becomes the embodiment of loving-kindness. </SPAN>
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Shielded by 
      loving-kindness, he cuts off all hostile vibrations and negative thoughts. 
      He returns good for evil, love for anger. He becomes ever tolerant and 
      tries his best not to give occasion for anger to any. Himself beaming with 
      happiness, he injects happiness into others not only inwardly but also 
      outwardly by putting his<I> mett&#257; </I>into practice in the course of his 
      daily life.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When he is full of 
      peace and is free from thoughts of hatred, it is easy for him to radiate 
      loving-kindness towards others. What he does not possess he cannot give to 
      others. Before he tries to make others happy he should first be happy 
      himself. He should know the ways and means to make himself happy.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">He now radiates his 
      loving-kindness towards all his near and dear ones individually and 
      collectively, wishing them peace and happiness and freedom from suffering, 
      disease, worry and anger.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Diffusing his thoughts 
      of loving-kindness towards his relatives and friends, he radiates them 
      also towards neutrals. Just as he wishes for the peace and happiness of 
      himself and of his near and dear ones, even so he sincerely wishes for the 
      peace and happiness of those who are neutral to him, wishing them freedom 
      from suffering, disease, worry and anger. Finally, though this is somewhat 
      difficult, he should radiate his <I>mett&#257; </I>in the same way towards 
      those (if any) who are inimical to him. If, by practising <I>mett&#257;, </I>he 
      could adopt a friendly attitude towards those thought to be inimical 
      towards him, his achievement would be more heroic and commendable. As the

      irrespective of creed, race, colour, or sex, including dumb animals, until 
      he has identified himself with all, making no distinction whatever. He 
      merges himself in the whole universe and is one with all. He is no more 
      dominated by egoistic feelings. He transcends all forms of separatism. No 
      longer confining himself to water-tight compartments, no longer influenced 
      by caste, class, national, racial, or religious prejudices, he can regard 
      the whole world as his motherland and all as fellow beings in the ocean of

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Many amidst us deserve 
      our compassion. The poor and the needy, the sick and the helpless, the 
      lonely and the destitute, the ignorant and the vicious, the impure and the 
      undisciplined are some that demand the compassion of kind-hearted, 
      noble-minded men and women, to whatever religion or to whatever race they 
      belong.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Some countries are 
      materially rich but spiritually poor, while some others are spiritually

      themselves.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      removed the door curtain in his house and gave it to a poor person telling

      commendable.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It is gratifying to 
      note that some wealthy countries have formed themselves into various 
      philanthropic bodies to help under-developed countries, especially in 
      Asia, in every possible way. Charitable organizations have also been 
      established in all countries by men, women and students to give every 
      possible assistance to the poor and the needy. Religious bodies also 
      perform their respective duties in this connection in their own humble 
      way. Homes for the Aged, Orphanages and other similar charitable 
      institutions are needed in under-developed countries.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The beggar problem has 
      still to be solved in some countries where begging has become a 
      profession. Out of compassion for the unfortunate beggars this problem has

      of beggars is an insult to any self-respecting nation.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">As the materially rich 
      should have compassion on the materially poor and try to elevate them, it 
      is the duty of the spiritually rich, too, to have compassion on the 
      spiritually poor and sublime them though they may be materially rich. 
      Wealth alone cannot give genuine happiness. Peace of mind can be gained 
      not by material treasures but by spiritual treasures. Many in this world 
      are badly in need of substantial spiritual food,<B> </B>which is not

      sickness prevails throughout the world. Many are physically sick, some are

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">There are causes for

      been employed by various nations to prevent and cure diseases not only of

      render free services towards the alleviation of suffering. Some expend

      the risk of their lives.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Hospitals and free 
      dispensaries have become a blessing to humanity but more are needed so 
      that the poor may benefit by them. In underdeveloped countries the poor 
      suffer through lack of medical facilities. The sick have to be carried for 
      miles with great inconvenience to the nearest hospital or dispensary for 
      medical treatment. Sometimes they die on the way. Pregnant mothers suffer 
      most. Hospitals, dispensaries, maternity homes, etc. are essential needs 
      in backward village areas.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The lowly and the 
      destitute deserve the compassion of wealthy men and women. Sometimes 
      servants and workers are not well paid, well fed, well clothed and more 
      often than not they are ill treated. Justice is not meted out to them. 
      They are neglected and are powerless as there is nobody to plead for them. 
      Glaring cases of inhuman cruelty receive publicity in some exceptional 
      cases. Many such cases are not known. These unfortunate ones have no other 
      alternative but to suffer meekly even as Mother Earth suffers everything 
      in silence. When the grief is unbearable, they commit suicide in utter 
      desperation.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The vicious, the 
      wicked, and the ignorant deserve compassion even, more than those who 
      suffer physically as they are mentally and spiritually sick. They should 
      not be condemned and despised but sympathised with for their failings and 
      defects. Though a mother has equal compassion towards all her children 
      still she may have more compassion towards a sick child. Even so, greater 
      compassion should be exercised towards the spiritually sick as their 
      sickness ruins their character.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddha, for 
      instance, had great compassion towards the courtesan Ambap&#257;li, and towards 
      Angulim&#257;la the murderer. Both of them later became His converts and 
      underwent a complete reformation in character.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">We must understand that 
      greatness is latent in all however wicked they may be. Perhaps one

      perpetrated many crimes, so much so that he was stigmatized Asoka the

      the Righteous <I>(Dharm&#257;soka).</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddha's advice is 
      to shun the company of the foolish. That does not mean that the good 
      should not associate with them so as to reform them. People avoid those 
      who suffer from contagious diseases. But compass-sionate physicians, 
      attend on them so as to heal them. Otherwise they might die. In the same 
      way the wicked may die spiritually if the good are not tolerant and

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">To deny the rights and
