      which Buddhists do not regard as a mere theory but as a fact verifiable by 
      evidence, forms a fundamental tenet of Buddhism, though its goal Nibb&#257;na 
      is attainable in this life itself. The Bodhisatta Ideal and the 
      correlative doctrine of freedom to attain utter perfection are based on 
      this doctrine of rebirth.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Documents record that this belief in rebirth, viewed 
      as transmigration or reincarnation, was accepted by philo-sophers like<I> 
      Pythagoras </I>and <I>Plato, </I>poets like <I>Shelly, Tennyson </I>and<I> 
      Wordsworth, </I>and many ordinary people in the East as well as in the 
      West.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddhist doctrine of rebirth should be 
      differentiated from the theory of transmigration and reincarnation of 
      other systems, because Buddhism denies the existence of a transmigrating 
      permanent soul, created by God, or emanating from a <I>Param&#257;tma </I>
      (Divine Essence).</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It is Kamma that conditions rebirth. Past Kamma 
      conditions the present birth; and present Kamma, in combination with past 
      Kamma, conditions the future. The present is the offspring of the past, 
      and becomes, in turn. the parent of the future.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The actuality of the present needs no proof as it is 
      self-evident. That of the past is based on memory and report, and that of 
      the future on forethought and inference.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">If we postulate a past, a present and a future life, 
      then we are at once faced with the problem &quot;What is the ultimate origin of 
      life?&quot;</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">One school, in attempting to solve the problem, 
      postulates a first cause, whether as a cosmic force or as an Almighty

      had a beginning, according to the latter, it is beginningless. In the 
      opinion of some the conception of a first cause is as ridiculous as a 
      round triangle.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">One might argue that life must have had a beginning 
      in the infinite past and that beginning or the First Cause is the Creator.</SPAN></P>

      may not be made of this postulated Creator.</SPAN></P>

      held widely different views. In interpreting this First Cause, Param&#257;tma, 
      Brahma, Isvara, Jehovah, God, the Almighty, Allah, Supreme Being, Father 
      in Heaven, Creator, Order of Heaven, Prime Mover, Uncaused Cause, Divine 
      Essence, Chance, Pakati, Padh&#257;na are some significant terms employed by 
      certain religious teachers and philosophers.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Hinduism traces the origin of life to a mystical 
      Param&#257;tma from which emanate all <I>&#256;tmas </I>or souls that transmigrate 
      from existence to existence until they are finally reabsorbed in 
      Param&#257;tma. One might question whether there is any possibility for these 
      reabsorbed <I>&#256;tmas </I>for a further transmigration.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Christianity, admitting the possibility of an

      eternity had begun, through which he will never cease to be, is a 
      monstrous thought.</SPAN></I></P>
      <P><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Moreover, if birth is the absolute beginning,

      character, or God is not Almighty. The former theory is disproved by the 
      fact that some people who have suffered very little but have been 
      fortunate in their ancestry and education have very fine characters. The 
      objection to the second is that it is only in connection with the universe

      God grows more and more refined. There is at present a tendency to

      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Modern science endeavours to tackle the problem with 
      its limited systematized knowledge. According to the scientific 
      standpoint, we are the direct products of the sperm and ovum cells 
      provided by our parents. But science does not give a satisfactory 
      explanation with regard to the development of the mind, which is 
      infinitely more important than the machinery of man's material body, 
      Scientists, while asserting <I>&quot;Omne vivum</I> <I>ex vivo&quot; </I>&quot;all life 
      from life&quot; maintain that mind and life evolved from the lifeless.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Now from the scientific standpoint we are absolutely 
      parent-born. Thus our lives are necessarily preceded by those of our 
      parents and so on. In this way life is preceded by life until one goes 
      back to the first protoplasm or colloid. As regards the origin of this 
      first protoplasm or colloid, however, scientists plead ignorance.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">What is the attitude of Buddhism with regard to the 
      origin of life?</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">At the outset it should be stated that the Buddha 
      does not attempt to solve all the ethical and philosophical problems that 
      perplex mankind. Nor does He deal with speculations and theories that tend 
      neither to edification nor to enlightenment. Nor does He demand blind 
      faith from His adherents anent a First Cause. He is chiefly concerned with 
      one practical and specific problem -- that of suffering and its 
      destruction, all side issues are completely ignored.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">On one occasion a Bhikkhu named <I>M&#257;lunkyaputta,
      </I>not content to lead the Holy Life, and achieve his Emancipation by 
      degrees, approached the Buddha and impatiently demanded an immediate 
      solution of some speculative problems with the threat of discarding the 
      robes if no satisfactory answer was given.</SPAN></P>
      <P><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Lord,&quot;</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> he said, <I>
      &quot;these theories have not been elucidated, have been set aside and rejected 
      by the Blessed One -- whether the world is eternal or not eternal, whether 
      the world is finite or infinite. If the Blessed One will elucidate these 
      questions to me, then I will lead the Holy</I> <I>Life under Him. If he 
      will not, then I will abandon the precepts and return to the lay life.</I></SPAN></P>
      <P><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;If the Blessed One knows that the world is 
      eternal, let the Blessed One elucidate to me that the world is eternal; if 
      the Blessed One knows that the world is not eternal, let the Blessed One 
      elucidate that the world is not eternal -- in that case, certainly, for 
      one who does not know and lacks the insight, the only upright thing is to 
      say: I do not know, I have not the insight.&quot;</SPAN></I></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Calmly the Buddha questioned the erring Bhikkhu 
      whether his adoption of the Holy Life was in any way conditional upon the 
      solution of such problems.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Nay, Lord,&quot; the Bhikkhu replied.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddha then admonished him not to waste time and 
      energy over idle speculations detrimental to his moral progress, and said:</SPAN></P>

        not lead the Holy Life under the Blessed One until the Blessed One

        questions had ever been elucidated by the Accomplished One.</SPAN></I></P>
        <P><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;It is as if a person were pierced by an arrow 
        thickly smeared with poison, and his friends and relatives were to 
        procure a surgeon, and then he were to say. 'I will not have this arrow 
        taken out until I know the details of the person by whom I was wounded, 
        nature of the arrow with which I was pierced, etc.' That person would 
        die before this would ever be known by him.</SPAN></I></P>
        <P><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;In exactly the same way whoever should say, 'I 
        will not lead the Holy Life under the Blessed One until He elucidated to 
        me whether the world is eternal or not eternal, whether the world is 
        finite or infinite. . .' That person would die before these questions 
        had ever been elucidated by the Accomplished One.</SPAN></I></P>
        <P><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;If it be the belief that the world is eternal, 
        will there be the observance of the Holy Life? In such a case -- No! If 
        it be the belief that the world is not eternal, will there be the 
        observance of the Holy Life? In that case also -- No! But, whether the 
        belief be that the world is eternal or that it is not eternal, there is 
        birth, there is old age, there is death, the extinction of which in this 
        life itself I make known.</SPAN></I></P>
        <P><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;M&#257;lunkyaputta, I have not revealed whether the 
        world is eternal or not eternal, whether the world is finite or

        profitable, do not concern the bases of holiness, are not conducive to 
        aversion, to passionlessness, to cessation, to tranquility, to intuitive 
        wisdom, to enlightenment or to Nibb&#257;na. Therefore I have not revealed

      place means the setting of the sun in another place. This enigmatic 
      statement may be better understood by imagining life as a wave and not as 
      a straight line. Birth and death are only two phases of the same process. 
      Birth precedes death, and death, on the other hand, precedes birth. This
