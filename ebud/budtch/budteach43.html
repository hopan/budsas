      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Business men, as a 
      rule, are subject to both gain <I>(l&#257;bha)</I> and loss <I>(al&#257;bha)</I>. It 
      is quite natural to be complacent in obtaining a gain or a profit. In 
      itself there is nothing wrong. Such righteous or unrighteous profits 
      produce some pleasure which average men seek. Without pleasurable moments, 
      though temporary, life would not be worth living. In this competitive and 
      chaotic world rarely do people enjoy some kind of happiness which gladdens 
      their hearts. Such happiness, though material, does conduce to health and 
      longevity.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The problem arises in 
      case of loss. Profits one can bear smilingly but not so the losses. More 
      often than not they lead to mental derangement and sometimes to suicide 
      when the losses are unbearable. It is under such adverse circumstances 
      that one should exhibit moral courage and maintain a balanced mind. All 
      have ups and downs while battling with life. One should always be prepared 
      for the losses in particular. Then there will be less disappointment.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When something is 
      stolen naturally one feels sad. But by becoming sad one would not be able 
      to retrieve the loss. One should think that someone had benefited thereby 
      though unrighteously. May he be well and happy!</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Or one can console 
      oneself thinking:-- &quot;It's only a minor loss.&quot; One may even adopt a highly 
      philosophical attitude &quot;there is nothing to be called Me or Mine.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In the time of the 
      Buddha once a noble lady was offering food to the Venerable S&#257;riputta and 
      some monks. While serving them she received a note stating that her 
      husband and all her sons who had gone to settle a dispute were waylaid and 
      killed. Without getting upset, calmly she kept the note in her waist-pouch 
      and served the monks as if nothing had happened. A maid, who was carrying 
      a pot of ghee to offer to the monks, inadvertently slipped and broke the 
      pot of ghee. Thinking that the lady would naturally feel sorry over the 
      loss, Venerable S&#257;riputta consoled her, saying that all breakable things 
      are bound to break. The wise lady unperturbly remarked -- &quot;Bhante, what is 
      this trivial loss? I have just received a note stating that my husband and 
      sons were killed by some assassins. I placed it in my pouch without losing 
      my balance. I am serving you all despite the loss.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Such valour on the part 
      of courageous women is highly commendable.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Once the Buddha went 
      seeking alms in a village. Owing to the intervention of M&#257;ra the Evil One, 
      the Buddha did not obtain any food. When M&#257;ra questioned the Buddha rather 
      sarcastically whether He was hungry or not, the Buddha solemnly explained 
      the mental attitude of those who are free from Impediments, and replied:-- 
      &quot;Ah, happily do we live, we who have no Impediments. Feeders of joy shall 
      we be even as the gods of the Radiant Realm.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">On another occasion the 
      Buddha and His disciples observed <I>vassa </I>(rainy period) in a village 
      at the invitation of a brahmin, who, however, completely forgot his duty 
      to attend to the needs of the Buddha and the Sangha. Throughout a period 
      of three months, although Venerable Moggall&#257;na volunteered to obtain food 
      by his psychic powers, the Buddha, making no complaint, was contented with 
      the fodder of horses offered by a horse-dealer.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Vis&#257;kh&#257;, the Buddha's 
      chief female lay disciple, used to frequent the monastery to attend to the 
      needs of the Buddha and the Sangha decked with a very valuable outer 
      garment. On entering the monastery, she used to remove it and give it to 
      the maid for safe custody. Once the maid inadvertently left it in the 
      temple and returned home. Venerable &#256;nanda, noticing it, kept it in a safe 
      place to be given to Vis&#257;kh&#257; when she visited the monastery. Vis&#257;kh&#257; 
      discovering the loss advised the maid to look for it but not to take it 
      back in case any Bhikkhu had touched it. On inquiry the maid understood 
      that Venerable &#256;nanda had kept it in safe custody. Returning home, she 
      reported the matter. </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Vis&#257;kh&#257; visited the 
      monastery and inquired of the Buddha what meritorious act should she 
      perform with the money obtained by selling the costly garment. The Buddha 
      advised her to build a monastery for<I> </I>the benefit of the Sangha. As 
      there was nobody to buy the garment because of its high cost, she herself 
      bought it and built a monastery and offered it to the Sangha. After the 
      offering, she expressed her gratitude to the maid, saying:-- &quot;If you had 
      not inadvertently left my garment, I would not have got an opportunity to 
      perform this meritorious act. Please share the merit.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Instead of grieving 
      over the temporary loss and reprimanding the maid for her carelessness she 
      thanked her for granting an opportunity for service.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The exemplary attitude 
      of cultured Vis&#257;kh&#257; is a memorable lesson to all those who are quickly 
      irritated over the misdoings of helpless servants.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Losses one must try to 
      bear cheerfully with manly vigour. Unexpectedly one confronts them, very 
      often in groups and not singly. One must face them with equanimity <I>
      (upekkh&#257;) </I>and think it is an opportunity to practise that sublime 
      virtue.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      that confront us in the course of our daily lives.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Fame we welcome, defame 
      we dislike. Fame gladdens our mind, defame disheartens us. We desire to 
      become famous. We long to see our names and pictures appear in the papers. 
      We are greatly pleased when our activities, however insignificant, are 
      given publicity. Sometimes we seek undue publicity too.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">To see their picture in 
      a magazine some are ready to pay any amount. To obtain an honour some are 
      prepared to offer any bribe or give a fat donation to the party in power. 
      For the sake of publicity some exhibit their generosity by giving alms to 
      one hundred monks and even more, but they may be totally indifferent to 
      the sufferings of the poor and the needy in the neighbourhood. One may 
      charge and punish a starving person who, to appease his hunger, were to 
      steal a coconut in his garden, but would not hesitate to present thousand 
      coconuts to get a good name.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">These are human 
      frailties. </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Most people do even a 
      good action with an ulterior motive. Selfless persons who act 
      disinterestedly are rare in this world. Even if the motive is not very 
      praiseworthy, those who do any good are to be congratulated on having done 
      a beneficial act. Most worldlings have something up their sleeves. Well, 
      who is hundred percent good? How many are perfectly pure in their motives? 
      How many are absolutely altruistic?</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">We need not hunt after 
      fame. If we are worthy of fame, it will come to us unsought. The bee will

      invite the bee.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">True indeed, we feel 
      naturally happy, nay extremely happy, when our fame is spread far and 
      wide. But we must realize that fame, honour and glory only lead to the 
      grave. They vanish in thin air. Empty words are they, though pleasing to 
      the ear.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">What about defame? It 
      is not palatable either to the ear or mind. We are undoubtedly perturbed 
      when unkind defamatory words pierce our ears. The pain of mind is still 
      greater when the so-called report is unjust and absolutely false.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Normally it takes years 
      to erect a magnificent building. In a minute or two, with modern 
      devastating weapons, it could easily be demolished. Sometimes it takes 
      years or a lifetime to build up a good reputation. In no long time the 
      hard-earned good name can be ruined. Nobody is exempt from the devasting 
      remark beginning with the infamous &quot;but&quot;. Yes, he is very good, he does 
      this and that, but... His whole good record is blackened by the so-called 
      &quot;but&quot;. You may live the life of a Buddha, but you will not be exempt from 
      criticism, attacks and insults.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddha was the most

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Some antagonists of the 
      Buddha spread a rumour that a woman used to spend the night in the 
      monastery. Foiled in this base attempt, they spread a false rumour amongst 
      the populace that the Buddha and His disciples murdered that very woman 
      and hid her corpse in the rubbish-heap of withered flowers within the 
      monastery. When His historic mission met with success and when many sought 
      ordination under Him, His adversaries maligned Him, saying that He was 
      robbing the mothers of their sons, depriving wives of their husbands, and 
      that He was obstructing the progress of the nation. Failing in all these 
      attempts to ruin His noble character, His own cousin and a jealous 
      disciple of His, attempted to kill him by hurling a rock from above.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      world exhibits your shortcomings and misdoings but hides your salient 
      virtues. The winnowing fan ejects the husks but retains the grains: the 
      strainer, on the contrary, retains the gross remnants but drains out the 
      sweet juice. The cultured take the subtle and remove the gross; the 
      uncultured retain the gross and reject the subtle.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When you are

      </SPAN></B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Happiness <I>(sukha)
      </I>and pain <I>(dukkha) </I>are the last pair of opposites. They are the 
      most powerful factors that affect mankind. What can be endured with ease 
      is <I>sukha </I>(happiness), what is difficult to bear is <I>dukkha </I>
      (pain). Ordinary happiness is the gratification of a desire. No sooner is 
      the desired thing gained than we desire some other kind of happiness. So 
      insatiate are our selfish desires. The enjoyment of sensual pleasures is 
      the highest and only happiness to an<B> </B>average person. There is no 
      doubt a momentary<I> </I>happiness in the anticipation, gratification and 
      recollection of such material pleasures highly priced by the sensualist, 
      but they are illusory and temporary.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      possessions give one genuine happiness? </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">If so, millionaires 
      would not think of committing suicide. In a certain country which has 
      reached the zenith of material progress about ten percent suffer from 
      mental diseases. Why should it be so if material possessions alone can 
      give genuine happiness?</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Can dominion over the 
      whole world produce true happiness? </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Alexander, who 
      triumphantly marched to India, conquering the lands on the way, sighed for 
      not having more pieces of earth to conquer.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Are Emperors and Kings 
      who wear crowns always happy?</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Very often the lives of 
      statesmen who wield power are at stake. The pathetic cases of Mahatma 
      Gandhi and J. F. Kennedy are illustrative examples.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Real happiness is found 
      within, and is not to be defined in terms of wealth, power, honours or 
      conquests.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">If such worldly 
      possessions are forcibly or unjustly obtained, or are misdirected, or even 
      viewed with attachment, they will be a source of pain and sorrow for the 
      possessors. What is happiness to one may not be happiness to another. What 
      is meat and drink to one may be poison to another.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddha enumerates 
      four kinds of happiness for a layman. </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">They are the happiness 
      of possession <I>(atthi sukha)</I>, namely, health, wealth, longevity, 
      beauty, joy, property, strength, children, etc.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The second source of 
      happiness is derived by the enjoyment of such possessions <I>(bhoga 
      sukha). </I>Ordinary men and women wish to enjoy themselves. The Buddha 
      does not advise all to renounce their worldly pleasures and retire to 
      solitude.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The enjoyment of wealth 
      lies not only in using it for ourselves but also in giving it for the 
      welfare of others. What we eat is only temporary. What we preserve we 
      leave and go. What we give we take with us. We are remembered for ever by 
      the good deeds we have done with our worldly possessions.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Not falling into debt
      <I>(ananasukha) </I>is another source of happiness. If we are contented 
      with what we have and if we are economical, we need not be in debt to any 
      one. Debtors live in mental agony and are under obligation to their 
      creditors. Though poor, when debt free, you feel relieved and are mentally 
      happy.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Leading a blameless 
      life <I>(anavajjasukha) </I>is one of the best sources of happiness for a 
      layman. A blameless person is a blessing to himself and to others. He is 
      admired by all and feels happier, being affected by the peaceful 
      vibrations of others. It should be stated however that it is very, very 
      difficult to get a good name from all. The noble-minded persons are 
      concerned only with a blameless life and are indifferent to external 
      approbation. The majority in this world delight themselves in enjoying 
      pleasures while some others seek delight in renouncing them. 
      Non-attachment or the transcending of material pleasures is happiness to 
      the spiritual. Nibb&#257;nic bliss, which is a bliss of relief from suffering, 
      is the highest form of happiness.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Ordinary happiness we 
      welcome, but not its opposite -- pain, which is rather difficult to 
      endure.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Pain or suffering comes 
      in different guises.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">We suffer when we are 
      subject to old age which is natural. With equanimity we have to bear the 
      sufferings of old age.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">More painful than 
      sufferings due to old<I> </I>age are sufferings caused by disease, which, 
      if chronic, we feel that death is preferable. Even the slightest toothache 
      or headache is sometimes unbearable.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When we are subject to 
      disease, without being<B> </B>worried, we should be able to bear it at any 
      cost. Well, we must console ourselves thinking that we have escaped from a 
      still more serious disease.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Very often we are 
      separated from our near and dear ones. Such separation causes great pain 
      of mind. We should understand that all association must end with 
      separation. Here is a good opportunity to practise equanimity.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">More often than not we 
      are compelled to be united with the unpleasant which we detest. We should 
      be able to bear them. Perhaps we are reaping the effects of our own Kamma, 
      past or present. We should try to accommodate ourselves to the new 
      situation or try to overcome the obstacle by some means or other.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Even the Buddha, a 
      perfect being, who has destroyed all defilements, had to endure physical 
      suffering caused by disease and accidents.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddha was 
      constantly subject to headache. His last illness caused Him much physical 
      suffering. As a result of Devadatta's hurling a rock to kill Him, His foot 
      was wounded by a splinter which necessitated an operation. Sometimes He 
      was compelled to starve. At times He had to be contented with 
      horse-fodder. Due to the disobedience of His own pupils, He was compelled 
      to retire to a forest for three months. In the forest, on a couch of 
      leaves spread on rough ground, facing piercing cool winds, He slept with 
      perfect equanimity. Amidst pain and happiness He lived with a balanced 
      mind. Death is the greatest sorrow we are compelled to face in the course 
      of our wanderings in <I>sams&#257;ra.&nbsp; </I>Sometimes, death comes not 
      singly but in numbers which may even cause insanity.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Pat&#257;c&#257;r&#257; lost her near 
      and dear ones -- parents, husband, brother and two children -- and she 
      went mad. The Buddha consoled her.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Kis&#257; Gotami lost her 
      only infant, and she went in search of a remedy for her dead son, carrying 
      the corpse. She approached the Buddha and asked for a remedy.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Well, sister, can you<B>
      </B>bring some mustard seed?&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Certainly, Lord!&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>

      be from a house where no one has died.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Mustard seeds she 
      found, but not a place where death had not visited.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">She understood the 
      nature of life.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When a mother was
