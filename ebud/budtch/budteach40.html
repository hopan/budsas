      to become an Arahant usually seeks the guidance of a superior enlightened 
      instructor. A slight indication from an understanding teacher would alone 
      be sufficient for a morally advanced aspirant to progress on the upward 
      path of Enlightenment. Venerable S&#257;riputta, for instance, attained the 
      first stage of Sainthood, hearing only half a stanza from the Arahant 
      Assaji. The sorrow-afflicted Pat&#257;c&#257;ra, who lost all those dear to her 
      under tragic circumstances, attained Arahantship by watching the water 
      that washed her feet. The child-like Kis&#257;gotam&#299; who implored the Buddha 
      for a cure for her dead infant, attained Sainthood by watching a lamp that 
      was being extinguished. C&#363;la Panthaka, who could not memorize a verse for 
      four months, attained Arahantship by meditating on imper-manence while 
      handling a clean piece of white cloth in his hand, gazing at the sun.</FONT></SPAN></P>

      goal, an Arahant devotes the remainder of his life to serving other 
      seekers of peace by example and by precept. First he purifies himself, and 
      then he tries to purify others by expounding to them the teachings which 
      he himself has followed. An Arahant is more qualified to teach the Dhamma 
      than ordinary worldling teachers, who have no realization of Truth, since 
      he speaks from personal experience.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      selfish in the noble ideal of Arahantship, for Arahantship is gained only 
      by eradicating all forms of selfishness. Self-illusion and Egoism are some 
      of the fetters that have to be discarded in order to attain Arahantship. 
      The wise men and women who lived in the time of the Buddha, and others 
      later, benefited by the golden opportunity offered by Him to gain their 
      enlightenment in this present life itself.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      the Sutta Nip&#257;ta are treasured some beautiful sayings of Pacceka Buddhas.

      fully self-enlightened One. He is so called because he not only

      doctrine to seekers of truth to purify and save them from this 
      ever-recurring cycle of birth and death. Unlike the Private Buddhas, only

      no compulsion that all must strive to attain Buddhahood, which, to say the

      sun arouse them in order to remove the undefiled ignorance (akilishta

      Enlightenment and, though they abide in a state of</I> <I>deliverance, 
      they act (in the phenomenal world) as if they were making a descent to 
      hell. And gradually, having accumulated all the factors for the attainment

      Arahantship is selfish and that all must strive to attain Buddhahood to 
      save others. Well, one might ask:-- What is the object of attaining 
      Buddhahood ? Is it to make others attain Arahantship and save them? If so, 
      the logical conclusion is that Buddhahood itself fosters selfishness which 
      is absurd.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      specially graced persons.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It should be noted that 
      Buddhists do not believe that there lies dormant in us all a divine spark 
      that needs development, for they deny the existence of a Creator, but they 
      are conscious of the innate possibilities and the creative power of man.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Buddhism denies too the 
      existence of a permanent soul that transmigrates from life to life, 
      acquiring all experiences. Instead of an unchanging soul, the so-called 
      essence of man, it posits a dynamic life-flux where there is an identity 
      in process.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">As a man Prince <I>
      Siddh&#257;rta, </I>by his own will, wisdom and love, attained Buddhahood, the 
      highest state of perfection any being could aspire to, and He revealed to 
      mankind the only path that leads thereto. A singular characteristic of 
      Buddhism is that anyone may aspire to the state of the teacher himself if 
      only he makes the necessary exertion. The Buddha did not claim any 
      monopoly of Buddhahood. It is not a sort of evolutionary process. It may 
      be achieved by one's own effort without the help of another. The Buddha 
      does not condemn men by calling them wretched sinners, but, on the 
      contrary, encourages them saying that they are pure in heart at 
      conception. Instead of disheartening followers, creating an inferiority 
      complex, and reserving the exalted state of Buddha to Himself, He 
      encourages them and inspires them to emulate Him. </SPAN></FONT></P>

      They are always guided by reason and accept nothing on blind belief. They 
      make no self-surrender, and are not slaves either to a book or to an 
      individual. They prefer lonely meditation. With their silent but<B> </B>

      that Buddhists do not worship an image. They pay homage to what it

      not denounce these external forms of homage <I>(&#257;misa p&#363;j&#257;) </I>though 
      undoubtedly practice <I>(patipatti p&#363;j&#257;) </I>is more commendable and

      Prof. Rhys Davids writes in his <I>Buddhist Birth Stories</I> (p. 
      xxxiv):--&nbsp; &quot;There is a religious romance called Barlaam and Joasaph, 
      giving the history of an Indian prince who was converted by Barlaam and 
      became a hermit. This history, the reader will be surprised to hear, is 
      taken from the life of the Buddha; and Joasaph is merely the Buddha under 
      another name, the word Joasaph, or, Josaphat, being simply a corruption of 
      the word Bodisat.&quot; &quot;Joasaph is in Arabic written also Yudasatf; and this, 
      through a confusion between the Arabic letters Y and B, is for Bodisat&quot;. 
      See <I>Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, </I>vol. 6, p. 567.</SPAN></FONT></P>
