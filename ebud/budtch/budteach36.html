      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Preparation</SPAN></B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Before practising 
      Sam&#257;dhi, the qualified aspirant should give a careful consideration to the 
      subject of meditation. In ancient days it was customary for pupils to seek 
      the guidance of a competent teacher to choose a suitable subject according 
      to their temperaments. But, today if no competent teacher is available, 
      the aspirant must exercise his own judgement and choose one he thinks most 
      suited to his character.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When the subject has 
      been chosen, he should withdraw to a quiet place where there are the 
      fewest distractions. The forest, a cave, or any lonely place is most 
      desirable, for there one is least liable to interruption during the 
      practice.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It should be understood 
      that solitude is within us all. If our minds are not settled, even a quiet 
      forest would not be a congenial place. But if our minds are settled, even 
      the heart of a busy town may be congenial. The atmosphere in which we live 
      acts as an indirect aid to tranquillize our minds.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Next to be decided by 
      the aspirant is the most convenient time when he himself and his 
      surroundings are in<B> </B>the best possible condition for the practice.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Early in the morning 
      when the mind is fresh and active, or before bedtime, if one is not 
      overtired, is generally the most appropriate time for meditation. But 
      whatever the time selected, it is advisable daily to keep to that 
      particular hour, for our minds then become conditioned to the practice.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The meditating posture, 
      too, serves as a powerful aid to concentration.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Easterners generally 
      sit cross-legged, with the body erect. They sit placing the right foot on 
      the left thigh and the left foot on the right thigh. This is the full 
      position. If this posture is difficult, as it certainly is to many, the 
      half position may be adopted, that is, simply placing the right foot on 
      the left thigh or the left foot on the right thigh.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When this triangular 
      position is assumed, the whole body is well balanced. The right hand 
      should be placed on the left hand, the neck straightened so that the nose 
      is in a perpendicular line with the navel. The tongue should rest on the 
      upper palate. The belt should be loosened, and clothes neatly adjusted. 
      Some prefer closed eyes so as to shut out all unnecessary light and 
      external sights.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Although there are 
      certain advantages in closing the eyes, it is not always recommended as it 
      tends to drowsiness. Then the mind gets out of control and wanders 
      aimlessly, vagrant thoughts arise, the body loses its erectness, quite 
      unconsciously the mouth opens itself, saliva drivels, and the head nods.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddhas usually sit 
      with half closed eyes looking through the tip of the nose not more than a 
      distance of four feet away.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Those who find the 
      cross-legged posture too difficult may sit comfortably in a chair or any 
      other support, sufficiently high to rest the feet on the ground.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It is of no great 
      importance what posture one adopts provided it is easy and relaxed.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The aspirant who is 
      striving to gain one-pointedness of the mind should endeavour to control

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">While meditating one

      aspirant may be on the object of his meditation he will not be exempt from

      to the slowness of progress, and his efforts slacken in consequence.&quot; The 
      determined aspirant only welcomes these obstacles, the difficulties he 
      cuts through and looks straight to his goal, never for a moment turning 
      away his eyes from it.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Suppose, for instance, 
      an aspirant takes an earth-kasina for his object <I>(kammatth&#257;na).</I></SPAN></FONT></P>

      saying -- <I>pathavi, pathavi</I> (earth, earth), until he becomes so 
      wholly absorbed in it that all adventitious thoughts get automatically 
      excluded from the mind. When he does this for some time -- perhaps weeks 
      or months or years -- he would be able to visualize the object with closed 
      eyes. On this visualized image <I>(uggaha nimitta), </I>which is a mental

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Adopting a convenient 
      posture, breathe out and close the mouth. Then breathe through the 
      nostrils naturally and not forcefully. Inhale first and mentally count 
      one. Exhale and count two, concentrating on<B> </B>the breathing process. 
      In this manner one may count up to ten constantly focussing one's 
      attention on respiration. It is possible for the mind to wander before one 
      counts up to ten. But one need not be discouraged. Let one try till one 
      succeeds. Gradually one may increase the number of series -- say five 
      series of ten. Later one may concentrate on respiration without counting. 
      Some prefer counting as it aids concentration, while some others prefer 
      not to count. </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">What is essential is 
      concentration and not counting which is secondary. When one does this 
      concentration, one feels light in body and mind and very peaceful too. One 
      might perhaps feel as if one were floating in the air. When this 
      concentration is practised for a certain period, a day will come when one 
      will realize that this so-called body is supported by mere breath and that 
      body perishes when breathing ceases. </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">One instantly realizes 
      impermanence. Where there is change there cannot be a permanent entity or
