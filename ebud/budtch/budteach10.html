      Buddha worked disinterestedly for the weal of mankind, making no 
      distinction between the rich and the poor, the high and the low. His 
      followers and supporters were drawn both from the highest and lowest rungs 
      of the social ladder. So spontaneous was the love and so profound was the 
      veneration of the people, that kings and nobles, millionaires and paupers, 
      pious folk and courtesans, men and women of all ranks, vied with one 
      another to be of service to Him and make His noble mission a success. The 
      wealthy spent lavishly to erect suitable monasteries for Him, while the 
      poor, full of faith, demonstrated their piety in their humble way. With 
      perfect equanimity He accepted the gifts of the rich and the poor, but 
      showed no partiality to any. Nevertheless, He showed more compassion to 
      the poor and the lowly. Like a bee that extracts honey from a flower 
      without hurting it, He lived amongst His followers and supporters without 
      causing the slightest inconvenience to any. Offerings of diverse kinds 
      were showered on Him, and He accepted them all with perfect 
      non-attachment.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Though absolutely pure 
      in motive and perfectly selfless in His service to humanity, yet, in 
      preaching and spreading His teaching, the Buddha had to contend against 
      strong opposition. He was severely criticised, roundly abused, insulted 
      and ruthlessly attacked, as no other religious teacher had been. His chief 
      opponents were ordinary teachers of rival sects and followers of heretical 
      schools whose traditional teachings and superstitious rites and ceremonies 
      He justly criticised. His greatest personal enemy, who made a vain attempt 
      to kill Him, was His own brotber-in-law and an erstwhile disciple -- 
      Devadatta.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddha and

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Devadatta </SPAN>
      </I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">was the son of King <I>Suppabuddha</I> and<I> 
      Pamit&#257; </I>an aunt of the Buddha. <I>Yasodhar&#257;</I> was his sister. He was 
      thus a cousin and brother-in-law of the Buddha. He entered the Order in 
      the early part of the Buddha's ministry together with <I>&#256;nanda </I>and 
      other S&#257;kya princes. He could not attain any of the stages of Sainthood, 
      but was distinguished for worldly psychic powers <I>(pothujjanika-iddhi).
      </I>One of his chief supporters was King <I>Aj&#257;tasattu </I>who built a 
      monastery for him.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">During the early part 
      of his career he led such an exemplary life that even Venerable <I>
      S&#257;riputta</I> went about <I>R&#257;jagaha </I>extolling him. Later, overcome by 
      worldly gain and honour, and growing jealous of the Buddha, <I>Devadatta
      </I>became so radically changed in his character that he proved to be the 
      greatest personal enemy of the Buddha. Simultaneous with the arising of 
      ill-will in his heart towards the Buddha his psychic powers automatically 
      ceased.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Despite his evil ways 
      and corrupt life, he had a large following and many admirers, and some 
      even preferred him to Venerable <I>S&#257;riputta.</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">On one occasion he 
      approached the Buddha and requested Him to hand over the leadership of the 
      Sangha to him as the Buddha was advanced in age. The Buddha straightway 
      refused, saying: &quot;Not even to <I>S&#257;riputta </I>or <I>Moggall&#257;na </I>would 
      I hand over the Sangha. Would I then hand it over to thee?&quot; He was enraged 
      at this refusal and vowed vengeance. To safeguard and maintain the dignity 
      of the Sangha the Buddha caused a proclamation to be made that <I>
      Devadatta </I>alone was responsible for anything done by him in the name 
      of the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">He, therefore, 
      conspired with King <I>Aj&#257;tasattu</I> to kill the Buddha. <I>Aj&#257;tasattu
      </I>was advised to kill his father and usurp the throne, while he himself 
      decided to kill the Buddha and lead the Sangha. </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Ungrateful <I>
      Aj&#257;tasattu </I>succeeded in killing his devout father, and <I>Devadatta
      </I>hired bowmen to murder the Buddha but, contrary to his expectations, 
      all the hirelings became the Buddha's followers. Foiled in his attempt, he 
      himself resolved to kill the Buddha. When the Buddha was walking on the 
      slopes of Gijjhak&#363;ta he climbed the Peak and mercilessly hurled a rock at 
      the Buddha. Fortunately it struck another piece of rock and a splinter 
      slightly wounded His foot, causing the blood to flow. <I>J&#299;vaka </I>the 
      physician attended on Him and cured Him.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Devadatta </SPAN>
      </I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">made another unsuccessful attempt to kill the 
      Buddha by dispatching the elephant <I>N&#257;l&#257;giri, </I>after infuriating him 
      with liquor, against the Teacher. When the ferocious elephant approached 
      the Buddha the Venerable <I>&#256;nanda </I>stepped forward to sacrifice his 
      life for the sake of his Master, but the Buddha subdued the beast by His 
      loving-kindness <I>(Mett&#257;).</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">By this last wicked act
      <I>Devadatta </I>became extremely unpopular, and public opinion was so 
      much against him that the King was compelled to withdraw his patronage. <I>
      Devadatta </I>fell into disrepute and all his favours decreased.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">He now decided to live 
      by deceit. His fertile brain devised another seemingly peaceful plan.
      </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">With the help of 
      equally evil-minded Bhikkhus like<I> Kok&#257;lika, </I>he thought of causing a 
      schism in the Order. He requested the Buddha to enforce the following five 
      rules among the Bhikkhus:</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P STYLE="margin-left: 36.0pt"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
      <SPAN LANG="EN-US">i) That monks should dwell all their lives in the 
      forest.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      <SPAN LANG="EN-US">ii) That they should live on alms begged.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P STYLE="margin-left: 36.0pt"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
      <SPAN LANG="EN-US">iii) That they should wear Pamsak&#363;la robes (i.e., robes 
      made from rags collected from the dust-heap and cemeteries.)</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P STYLE="margin-left: 36.0pt"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
      <SPAN LANG="EN-US">iv) That they should live at the foot of a tree.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P STYLE="margin-left: 36.0pt"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
      <SPAN LANG="EN-US">v) That they should not eat fish or flesh throughout 
      life.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">This he did, knowing 
      fully well that the Buddha would not assent thereto. He desired to make 
      Buddha's refusal a pretext for disparaging the Buddha, and thereby winning 
      the support of the ignorant masses.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When this request was 
      made the compassionate and tolerant Buddha declared that His disciples 
      were free to adopt these rules or not, but would not make them compulsory 
      for all.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Devadatta </SPAN>
      </I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">made this refusal a cause for a schism in the 
      Order. He appealed to the Bhikkhus, saying: &quot;Brethren, whose words are the 
      nobler, the words of the Tath&#257;gata or the words which I myself have 
      uttered? Whoever desires release from suffering, let him come with me.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Newly ordained monks, 
      who were not conversant with the Dhamma, apparently approved of his 
      demands and went over to him. Accompanied by them, he went to Gay&#257;sisa. 
      But Venerable<I> S&#257;riputta </I>and<I> Mogall&#257;na, </I>on the advice of the 
      Buddha, went there and succeeded in winning them back after explaining the 
      Dhamma to them.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Thereafter evil days 
      fell upon <I>Devadatta. </I>He fell grievously ill, and before his death 
      he sincerely repented and desired to see the Buddha. But his bad Kamma 
      interfered and he had to die a miserable death without seeing the Buddha. 
      However, he sought refuge in the Buddha at the last moment.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Although he suffers in 
      a woeful state for his heinous crimes, yet as a result of the Holy Life he 
      led during the early part of his career, it is stated that he would become 
      a Pacceka Buddha named<I> Atthissara </I>in the distant future.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">AN&#256;THAPINDIKA</SPAN></B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The chief supporter of 
      the Buddha was <I>An&#257;thapindika </I>the millionaire. Amongst His 
      lay-followers he was regarded as the foremost alms-giver <I>(d&#257;yaka).</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The original name of <I>
      An&#257;thapindika, </I>which means the &quot;Feeder of the Helpless&quot;, was <I>
      Sudatta. </I>Owing to his unparalleled generosity he was latterly known by 
      his new name. His birthplace was S&#257;vatthi.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">One day he visited his 
      brother-in-law in R&#257;jagaha to transact some business. He did not come 
      forward as usual to welcome him but <I>Sudatta</I> found him in the 
      backyard making preparations for a feast. On inquiry, to his indescribable 
      joy, he understood that those arrangements were being made to entertain 
      the Buddha on the following day. The utterance of the mere word &quot;Buddha&quot; 
      roused his interest and he longed to see Him. As he was told that the 
      Buddha was living in the S&#299;tavana forest in the neighbourhood and that he 
      could see Him on the following morning, he went to sleep. His desire to 
      visit the Buddha was so intense that he had a sleepless night and he arose 
      at an unusual hour in the morning to start for the S&#299;tavana. It appears 
      that, owing to his great faith in the Buddha, a light emanated from his 
      body. He proceeded to the spot passing through a cemetery. It was pitch 
      dark and a fear arose in him. He thought of turning back. Then S&#299;vaka, a 
      Yakkha, himself invisible, encouraged him, saying:</SPAN></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">His fear vanished and

      and yet a third time. </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Ultimately He reached 
      S&#299;tavana where the Buddha was pacing up and down in the open air

      suggesting that Buddhas take pleasure in solitude. <I>An&#257;thapindika </I>
      returning to S&#257;vatthi, bought the park belonging to Prince <I>Jeta </I>at 
      a price determined by covering, so the story goes, the whole site with 
      gold coins, and erected the famous Jetavana Monastery at a great cost. 
      Here the Buddha spent nineteen rainy seasons. This monastery where the 
      Buddha spent the major part of His life was the place where He delivered 
      many of His sermons.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It is evident from this

      More important than generosity is the observance of at least the five

      deeds. Still more important and more beneficial is the cultivation of such 
      ennobling virtues like loving-kindness which lead to self-development.

        stealing, 3. incelibacy, 4. lying, 5. liquor, 6. eating food after 
        midday, 7. dancing, singing, music, unseemly shows, using garlands,
