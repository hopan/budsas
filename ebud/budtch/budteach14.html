      shall promulgate nothing that has not been promulgated, abrogate not what 
      has been promulgated, and act in accordance with the already prescribed 
      rules; (4) as long as the Bhikkhus support, respect, venerate and honour 
      those long-ordained Theras of experience, the fathers and leaders of the 
      Order, and respect their worthy speech; (5) as long as the Bhikkhus fall 
      not under the influence of uprisen attachment that leads to repeated 
      births; (6) as long as the Bhikkhus shall delight in forest retreats; (7) 
      as long as the Bhikkhus develop mindfulness within themselves so that 
      disciplined co-celibates who have not come yet may do so and those who are 
      already present may live in peace -- so long may the Bhikkhus be expected

      attaining Arahantship.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>

      added that as long as the Bhikkhus shall be devout, modest, conscientious,

      prosper.</SPAN></FONT></P>
