        As He fully comprehended the four Noble Truths and as He arose from the

        religious teachers of the day, but He could not find what He sought in 
        their teachings. Circumstances compelled Him to think for Himself and 
        seek the Truth. He sought the Truth within Himself. He plunged into the 
        deepest profundities of thought, and He realized the ultimate Truth 
        which He had not heard or known before. Illumination came from within 
        and shed light on things which He had never seen before.</SPAN></P>

        accomplish one's ends, and how superficial and futile it is to seek 
        redemption through benignant saviours, and crave for illusory happiness 
        in an afterlife through the propitiation of imaginary gods by fruitless

        His life came to an end. Though human, He became an extraordinary man 
        owing to His unique characteristics. The Buddha laid stress on this 
        important point, and left no room for any one to fall into the error of 
        thinking that He was an immortal being. It has been said of Him that 
        there was no religious teacher who was &quot;ever so godless as the Buddha,

        <SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Born a man, 
        living as a mortal, by His own exertion He attained that supreme state 
        of perfection called Buddhahood, and without keeping His Enlightenment 
        to Himself, He proclaimed to the world the latent possibilities and the 
        invincible power of the human mind. Instead of placing an unseen 
        Almighty God over man, and giving man a subservient position in relation 
        to such a conception of divine power, He demonstrated how man could 
        attain the highest knowledge and Supreme Enlightenment by his own 
        efforts. He thus raised the worth of man. He taught that man can gain 
        his deliverance from the ills of life and realize the eternal bliss of 
        Nibb&#257;na without depending on an external God or mediating priests. He 
        taught the egocentric, power-seeking world the noble ideal of selfless 
        service. He protested against the evils of caste-system that hampered 
        the progress of mankind and advocated equal opportunities for all. He 
        declared that the gates of deliverance were open to all, in every 
        condition of life, high or low, saint or sinner, who would care to turn 
        a new leaf and aspire to perfection. He raised the status of 
        down-trodden women, and not only brought them to a realization of their 
        importance to society but also founded the first religious order for 
        women. For the first time in the history of the world He attempted to 
        abolish slavery. He banned the sacrifice of unfortunate animals and 
        brought them within His compass of loving kindness. He did not force His 
        followers to be slaves either to His teachings or to Himself, but 
        granted complete freedom of thought and admonished His followers to 
        accept His words not merely out of regard for Him but after subjecting 
        them to a thorough examination &quot;even as the wise would test gold by 
        burning, cutting, and rubbing it on a piece of touchstone.&quot; He comforted 
        the bereaved mothers like Pat&#257;c&#257;r&#257; and Kis&#257;gotami by His consoling 
        words. He ministered to the deserted sick like Putigatta Tissa Thera 
        with His own hands. He helped the poor and the neglected like Rajjum&#257;l&#257; 
        and Sop&#257;ka and saved them from an untimely and tragic death. He ennobled 
        the lives of criminals like Angulimala and courtesans like Ambap&#257;li. He 
        encouraged the feeble, united the divided, enlightened the ignorant, 
        clarified the mystic, guided the deluded, elevated the base, and 
        dignified the noble. The rich and the poor, the saint and the criminal, 
        loved Him alike. His noble example was a source of inspiration to all. 
        He was the most compassionate and tolerant of teachers.</SPAN></P>

        <SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&quot;In the Buddha 
        you see clearly a man, simple, devout, lonely, battling for light, a 
        vivid human personality, not a myth. He too gave a message to mankind 
        universal in character. Many of our best modern ideas are in closest 
        harmony with it. All the miseries and discontents of life are due, he 
        taught, to selfishness. Before a man can become serene he must cease to 
        live for his senses or himself. Then he merges into a greater being. 
        Buddhism in different language called men to self-forgetfulness 500 
        years before Christ. In some ways he was nearer to us and our needs. He 
        was more lucid upon our individual importance in service than Christ and 
        less ambiguous upon the question of personal immortality.&quot;</SPAN></I></P>
