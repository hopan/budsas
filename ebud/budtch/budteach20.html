      the essence of the so-called being, plays the most important part in the

      which is more or less passive than active. It is similar to the 
      consciousness one experiences at the moment of conception and at the 
      moment of death <I>(cuti). </I>The Buddhist philosophical term for this 
      type of consciousness is <I>Bhavanga </I>which means factor of life, or 
      indispensable cause or condition of existence. Arising and perishing every 
      moment, it flows on like a stream not remaining the same for two

      an indispensable condition of life.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      consciousness, which one always experiences as long as it is uninterrupted 
      by external stimuli, vibrates for a thought-moment and passes away when a 
      physical or mental object enters the mind. Suppose, for instance, the 
      object presented is a physical form. Now, when the<I> Bhavanga </I>stream 
      of consciousness is arrested, sense door consciousness <I>
      (pañcadv&#257;r&#257;vajjana),</I> whose function is to turn the consciousness 
      towards the object, arises and passes away. Immediately after this there 
      arises visual consciousness <I>(cakkhuviññ&#257;na) </I>which sees the object, 
      but yet knows no more about it. This sense operation is followed by a 
      moment of the reception of the object so seen <I>(sampaticchana). </I>Next 
      arises the investigating thought-moment <I>(sant&#299;rana) </I>which 
      momentarily examines the object so seen. This is followed by the 
      determining thought-moment <I>(votthapana) </I>when discrimination is 
      exercised and freewill may play its part. On this depends the subsequent 
      psychologically important stage <I>Javana. </I>It is at this stage that an 
      action is judged, whether it be moral or immoral. Kamma is performed at 
      this stage.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      undesirability of the object presented to the mind, it is possible for one 
      to make the Javana process moral or immoral. If, for instance, one meets 
      an enemy, anger will arise automatically. A wise person might, on the 
      contrary, with self-control, radiate a thought of love towards him. This

      According to Buddhist philosophy there is no moment when we do not 
      ordinarily experience a particular kind of consciousness, hanging on to 
      some object -- whether physical or mental. The time limit of such 
      consciousness is termed one thought-moment. Each thought-moment is 
      followed by another. The rapidity of the succession of such 
      thought-moments is hardly conceivable by the ken of human knowledge. It 
      pleases the commentators to say that during the time occupied by a flash 
      of lightning billions and billions of thought-moments may arise.</SPAN></FONT></P>
