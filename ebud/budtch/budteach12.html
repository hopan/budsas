      Buddha's beneficent and successful ministry lasted forty-five years. From 
      His 35th year, the year of His Enlightenment, till His death in His 80th 
      year, He served humanity both by example and by precept. Throughout the 
      year He wandered from place to place, at times alone, sometimes 
      accompanied by His disciples, expounding the Dhamma to the people and 
      liberating them from the bonds of Sams&#257;ra. During the rainy season <I>
      (vass&#257;na) </I>from July to November, owing to incessant rains, He lived in 
      retirement as was customary with all ascetics in India in His time.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In ancient times, as 
      today, three regular seasons prevailed in India, namely, <I>vass&#257;na, </I>
      (rainy) <I>hemanta </I>(winter) and <I>gimh&#257;na </I>(hot). The <I>vass&#257;na
      </I>or rainy season starts in <I>&#256;s&#257;lha </I>and extends up to <I>Assayuga,
      </I>that is approximately from the middle of July to the middle of 
      November.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">During the <I>vass&#257;na
      </I>period, due to torrential rains, rivers and streams usually get 
      flooded, roads get inundated, communications get interrupted and people as 
      a rule are confined to their homes and villages and live on what 
      provisions they have collected during the previous seasons. During this 
      time the ascetics find it difficult to engage in their preaching tours, 
      wandering from place to place. An infinite variety of vegetable and animal 
      life also appears to such an extent that people could not move about 
      without unconsciously destroying them. Accordingly all ascetics including 
      the disciples of the Buddha, used to suspend their itinerant activities 
      and live in retirement in solitary places. As a rule the Buddha and His 
      disciples were invited to spend their rainy seasons either in a monastery 
      or <B>in </B>a secluded park. Sometimes, however, they used to retire to 
      forests. During these rainy seasons people flocked to the Buddha to hear 
      the Dhamma and thus availed themselves of His presence in their vicinity 
      to their best advantage.</SPAN></FONT></P>
