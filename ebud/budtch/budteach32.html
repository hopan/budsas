      Doctrine of Kamma and rebirth is the keystone of the philosophy of Plato. 
      Beings are for ever travelling through &quot;a cycle of necessity&quot;; the evil 
      they do in one semicircle of their pilgrimage is expiated in the other. In 
      the Republic, we find Kamma personified as &quot;Lachesis, the daughter of 
      necessity,&quot; at whose hands disembodied beings choose their incarnations. 
      Orpheus chooses the body of a swan. Thersites that of an ape, Agamemmon 
      that of an eagle. &quot;In like manner, some of the animals passed into men, 
      and into one another, the unjust passing into the wild, and the just into 
      the tame.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>

      the Ionian Greeks of Asia Minor, who were influenced by India.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      doctrine of Metempsychosis, springing from the earliest and noblest ages 
      of the human race, always spread abroad in the earth as the belief of the 
      great majority of mankind, nay really as the teaching of all religions, 
      with the exception of the Jews and the two which have proceeded from it in 
      the most subtle form however, and coming nearest to the truth as has 
      already been mentioned in Buddhism. Accordingly while Christians</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
      <I>console themselves with the thought of meeting in another world in 
      which one regains one's complete personality and knows oneself at once, in 
      these other religions the meeting again is already going on only 
      incognito. In the succession of births those who now stand in close 
      connection or contact with us will also be born along with us at our next 
      birth, and will have the same or analogous relations and sentiments 
      towards us as now, whether these are of a friendly or hostile description.</I></SPAN></FONT></P>

      the Vedas, as in all sacred books of India, metempsychosis is well known

      the present day in the whole of the non-Mohammedan Asia, thus among more 
      than half of the whole human race, as the firmest conviction and with an 
      incredibly strong practical influence. It was also the belief of the 
      Egyptians from whom it was received with enthusiasm by Orpheus, Pythagoras 
      and Plato: the Pythagoreans, however, specially retain it. That it was 
      also taught in the mysteries of the Greeks undeniably follows the ninth

      familiarises us with the facts which are grouped under the name of 
      heredity. Everyone of us bears upon him obvious marks of his parentage 
      perhaps of remoter relationships. More particularly the sum of tendencies 
      to act in a certain way, which we call character, is often to be traced 
      through a long series of progenitors and collaterals. So we may justly say 
      that this character, this moral and intellectual essence of a man does 
      veritably pass over from one fleshly tabernacle to another, and does 
      really transmigrate from generation to generation. In the new-born infant 
      the character of the stock lies latent, and the ego is little more than a 
      bundle of potentialities, but, very early these become actualities: from 
      childhood to age they manifest themselves in dullness or brightness, 
      weakness or strength, viciousness or uprightness; and with each feature 
      modified by confluence with another character, if by nothing else, the 
      character passes on to its incarnation in new bodies.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Our life on earth 
      is rightly held to be a discipline and a preparation for a higher and 
      eternal life hereafter, but if</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> <I>limited to 
      the duration of a single mortal body, it is so brief as to seem hardly 
      sufficient for so grand<B> </B>a purpose. Three score years and ten must 
      surely be an inadequate preparation for eternity. But what assurance have 
      we that the probation of the soul is confined within such narrow limits? 
      Why may it not be continued or repeated through a long series of 
      successive generations, the same personality animating one after another 
      an indefinite number of tenements of flesh and<B> </B>carrying forward 
      into each the training it has received, the character it has formed, the 
      temper and dispositions it has indulged, in the steps of existence 
      immediately preceding. It need not remember its past history even whilst 
      bearing the fruits and the consequence of that history deeply ingrained 
      into its present nature. How many long passages of any one life are now 
      completely lost to memory, though they may have contributed largely to 
      build up the heart and the intellect which distinguish one man from 
      another? Our responsibility surely is not lessened by such forgetfulness. 
      We still</I> <I>seem accountable for the misuse of time, though we have 
      forgotten how or on<B> </B>what we have wasted it. We are even now reaping 
      the bitter fruits, through enfeebled health and vitiated desires and 
      capacities, of many forgotten acts of self-indulgence, wilfulness and sin 
      -- forgotten just because they were so numerous.</I></SPAN></FONT></P>

      an<B> </B>act of absolute creation, the introduction to life of an 
      entirely new creature, we might reasonably ask why different souls are so 
      variously constituted at the outset? If metempsychosis is included in</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
      <I>the scheme of the divine government of the world, this difficulty 
      disappears altogether. Considered from this point of view, every one is 
      born into the state which he had fairly earned by his own<B> </B>previous 
      history. The doctrine of inherited sin<B> </B>and its consequence is a 
      hard lesson to be learned. But no one can complain of the dispositions and 
      endowments which he has inherited so to speak from himself, that is from 
      his former self in a previous state of existence. What we call death is 
      only the introduction of another life on earth, and if this be not<B> </B>
      a higher and better life than the one just ended, it is our own fault.&quot;</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
