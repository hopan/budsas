      that the Buddha was residing at Rajagaha and was preaching His Dhamma 
      reached the ears of the aged King <I>Suddhodana </I>and his anxiety to see 
      his enlightened son grew stronger and stronger. On nine successive 
      occasions he sent nine courtiers, each with a large following, to invite 
      the Buddha to Kapilavatthu. Contrary to his expectations, they all heard 
      the Dhamma and, attaining Arahantship, entered the Order. Since Arahants 
      were indifferent to worldly things they did not convey the message to the 
      Buddha.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      granted permission to enter the Order.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      the rest he also had the fortune to attain Arahantship and join the Order. 
      But, unlike the others, he conveyed the message to the Buddha, and 
      persuaded Him to visit His aged royal father. As the season was most 
      suitable for travelling, the Buddha, attended by a large retinue of His 
      disciples, journeyed the whole distance by slow stages preaching the 
      Dhamma on the way, and in due course arrived at Kapilavatthu in two 
      months.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      Him due reverence He subdued their pride by rising into the air and
