      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Pathavi</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> 
      means the element of extension, the substratum of matter. Without it 
      objects cannot occupy space. The qualities of hardness and softness which 
      are purely relative are two conditions of this element. This element of 
      extension is present in earth, water, fire and air. For instance, the 
      water above is supported by water below. It is this element of extension 
      in conjunction with the element of motion <I>(V&#257;yo)</I> that produces the 
      upward pressure. Heat or cold is the <I>Tejo</I> element, while fluidity

      <SPAN LANG="EN-US">is the element of cohesion. Unlike <I>Pathavi </I>it is 
      intangible. It is this element which enables the scattered atoms of matter 
      to cohere and thus gives us the idea of body.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      <SPAN LANG="EN-US">is the element of heat. Cold is also a form of <I>Tejo.</I> 
      Both heat and cold are included in <I>Tejo </I>because they possess the

      <SPAN LANG="EN-US">is the element of motion. The movements are caused by 
      this element. Motion is regarded as the force or the generator of heat. 
      Both motion and heat in the material realm correspond respectively to 
      consciousness and Kamma in the mental.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">These four powerful 
      forces are inseparable and interrelated, but one element may preponderate

      from matter and mind from life. But they do not give us a satisfactory 
      explanation with regard to the development of the mind</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Unlike the material

      developed consciousness.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In Buddhism no 
      distinction is made between mind and consciousness. Both are used as 
      synonymous terms. Mind may be defined as simply the awareness of an object 
      since there is no agent or a soul that directs all activities. It consists 
      of fleeting mental states which constantly arise and perish with lightning 
      rapidity. &quot;With birth for its source and death for its mouth it 
      persistently flows on like a river receiving from the tributary streams of 
      sense constant accretions to its flood.&quot; Each momentary consciousness of 
      this ever-changing life-stream, on passing away, transmits its whole 
      energy, all the indelibly recorded impressions, to its successor. Every 
      fresh consciousness therefore consists of the potentialities of its 
      predecessors and something more. As all impressions are indelibly recorded 
      in this ever-changing palimpsest-like mind, and as all potentialities are 
      transmitted from life to life, irrespective of temporary physical 
      disintegrations, reminiscence of past births or past incidents becomes a 
      possibility. If memory depends solely on brain cells, it becomes an 
      impossibility.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Like electricity mind 
      is both a constructive and destructive powerful force. It is like a 
      double-edged weapon that can equally be used either for good or evil. One 
      single thought that arises in this invisible mind can even save or destroy 
      the world. One such thought can either populate or depopulate a whole 
      country. It is mind that creates one's heaven. It is mind that creates 
      one's hell.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      consciousness, i.e. in thoughts, feelings, desires, we discover that its 
      potentiality is even more immeasurable, more boundless. From personal 
      experience, from observation, from history, we know that ideas, feelings, 
      desires, manifesting themselves, can liberate enormous quantities of 
      energy, and create infinite series of phenomena. An idea can act for 
      centuries and milleniums and only grow and deepen, evoking ever new series 
      of phenomena, liberating ever fresh energy. We know that thoughts continue 
      to live and act when even the very name of the man who created them has 
      been converted into a myth, like the names of the founders of ancient 
      religions, the creators of the immortal poetical works of antiquity, 
      heroes, leaders, and prophets. Their words are repeated by innumerable

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Mind or consciousness, 
      according to Buddhism, arises at the very moment of conception, together 
      with matter. Consciousness is therefore present in<B> </B>the foetus. This 
      initial consciousness, technically known as rebirth-consciousness or 
      relinking-consciousness <I>(Patisandhi viññ&#257;na), </I>is conditioned by 
      past kamma of the person concerned. The subtle mental, intellectual, and 
      moral differences that exist amongst mankind are due to this Kamma 
      conditioned consciousness, the second factor of man.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">To complete the trio 
      that constitutes man there is a third factor, the phenomenon of life that 
      vitalizes both mind and matter. Due to the presence of life reproduction 
      becomes possible. Life manifests itself both in physical and mental 
      phenomena. In P&#257;li the two forms of life are termed <I>N&#257;ma</I> <I>

      beginning for man or there cannot be a beginning. Those who belong to the 
      first school postulate a first cause, whether as a cosmic force or as an<B>
      </B>Almighty Being. Those who belong to the second school deny a first 
      cause for, in common experience, the cause ever becomes the effect and the 
      effect becomes the cause. In a circle of cause and effect a first cause is 
      inconceivable. According to the former life has had a beginning; while 
      according to the latter it is beginningless. In the opinion of some the

      from the lifeless.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">According to Buddhism 
      man is born from the matrix of action <I>(kammayoni). </I>Parents merely 
      provide man with a material layer. As such being precedes being. At the 
      moment of conception, it is Kamma that conditions the initial 
      consciousness that vitalizes the foetus. It is this invisible Kammic 
      energy generated from the past birth that produces mental phenomena and 
      the phenomenon of life in an already extant physical phenomenon, to 
      complete the trio that constitutes man.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      the world and decreed the laws of nature because he foresaw that in time

      mind of the Creator, who remains external to His creation.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      form, God is not external to the universe, but is merely the universe 
      considered as a whole. There cannot therefore be an act of creation, but 
      there is a kind of creative force in the universe, which causes it to 
      develop according to a plan which this creative force may be said to have 
      had in mind throughout the process.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;In the 'emergent' form 
      the purpose is more blind. At an earlier stage, nothing in the universe 
      foresees a later stage, but a kind of blind impulsion leads to those 
      changes which bring more developed forms into existence, so that, in some 
      rather obscure sense, the end is implicit in the beginning. </FONT>

      be attracted to the ground just as an inanimate stone would. In this case 
      he cannot use his freewill although he has a mind unlike the stone. If he 
      were to climb a cliff, he could certainly use his freewill and act as he 
      likes. A stone, on the contrary, is not free to do so of its own accord. 
      Man has the power to choose between right and wrong, good and bad. Man can

      Others say that the meaning of life is in the approach to non-existence;
