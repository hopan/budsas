      part of an inch across, inherited from parents, explains only a portion of 
      man, his physical foundation. With regard to the more complex and subtle 
      mental, intellectual, and moral differences we need more enlightenment. 
      The theory of heredity cannot satisfactorily account for the birth of a

      role played by the germ in the question of heredity we repeat that the 
      physical germ, of itself alone, explains only a portion of man; it throws 
      light on the physical side of heredity, but leaves in as great darkness as 
      ever the problem of moral and intellectual faculty. If it represented the 
      whole man, one would expect to find in any individual the qualities 
      manifested in his progenitors and parents -- never any other; these 
      qualities could not exceed the amount possessed by the parents, whereas we 
      find criminals from birth in the most respectable families, and saints 
      born to parents who are the very scum of society. You may come across 
      identical twins, i.e., beings born from the same germ, under the same 
      conditions of time and environment, one of whom is an angel and the other 
      a demon, though their physical forms closely resemble each other. Child 
      prodigies are sufficiently numerous to trouble frequently the thinker with

      realized; many a physical characteristic is not reproduced, in families 
      tainted with dangerous physiological defects, many children escape the

      contradicts the belief that all physical circumstances and mental 
      attitudes spring solely from past Kamma. If the present life is totally 
      conditioned or wholly controlled by our past actions, then Kamma is 
      certainly tantamount to fatalism or pre-determination or pre-destination. 
      One will not be free to mould one's present and future. If this were true, 
      freewill would be an absurdity. Life would be purely mechanical, not much 
      different from a machine. Whether we are created by an Almighty God who 
      controls our destinies and fore-ordains our future, or are produced by an 
      irresistible past Kamma that completely determines our fate and controls 
      our life's course, independent of any free action on our part, is 
      essentially the same. The only difference then lies in the two words God 
      and Kamma. One could easily be substituted for the other, because the 
      ultimate operation of both forces would be identical.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      normally burns, and extreme cold freezes, but man has walked unscathed 
      over fire and meditated naked on Himalayan snows; horticulturists have 
      worked marvels with flowers and fruits; and Yogis have performed 
      levitation. Psychic law is equally mechanical, but Buddhist training aims 
      at control of mind, which is possible by right understanding and skilful 
      volition. Kamma law operates quite automatically and, when the Kamma is 
      powerful, man cannot interfere with its inexorable result though he may 
      desire to do so; but here also right understanding and skilful volition 
      can accomplish much and mould the future. Good Kamma, persisted in, can 
      thwart the reaping of bad.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      respect to this similarity of action and reaction the following note by 
      Dr. Grimm<B> </B>will perhaps be of interest to the readers: &quot;It is not 
      difficult in all these cases also to show the law of affinity as the 
      regulator of the grasping of a new germ that occurs at death.&nbsp; 
      Whosoever devoid of compassion, can kill men or, animals, carries deep 
      within himself the inclination to shorten life.&nbsp; He finds 
      satisfaction or even pleasure in the short-livedness of other creatures.&nbsp; 
      Short-lived germs have therefore some affinity which makes itself known 
      after his death in the grasping of another germ which then takes place to 
      his own detriment.&nbsp; Even so, germs bearing within themselves the 
      power of developing into a deformed body, have an affinity for one who 
      finds pleasure in ill-treating and disfiguring others. </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P ><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
      <SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;An angry person begets within himself an affinity for 
      ugly bodies and their respective germs, since it is the characteristic 
      mark of anger to disfigure the face.&nbsp; &quot;Whoever is jealous, niggardly, 
      haughty, carries within himself the tendency to grudge everything to 
      others and to despise them . Accordingly germs that are destined to 
      develop in poor, outward circumstances, possess affinity for him.</SPAN></FONT></P>
