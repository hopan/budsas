      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In the same way one's 
      individuality is the combination of all the five aggregates.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The whole process of 
      these psycho-physical phenomena which are constantly becoming and passing 
      away, is at times called, in conventional terms, the self or <I>att&#257; </I>
      by the Buddha; but it is a process, and not an identity that is thus 
      termed.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Buddhism does not 
      totally deny the existence of a personality in an empirical sense. It 
      denies, in an ultimate sense <I>(paramattha saccena), </I>an identical 
      being or a permanent entity, but it does not deny a continuity in process. 
      The Buddhist philosophical term for an individual is <I>santati,</I> that 
      is, a flux or continuity. This uninterrupted flux or continuity of 
      psycho-physical phenomena, conditioned by Kamma, having no perceptible 
      source in the beginningless past nor any end to its continuation in the 
      future, except by the Noble Eightfold Path, is the Buddhist substitute for 
      the permanent ego or eternal soul in other religious systems.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">How is rebirth possible 
      without a soul to be reborn?</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Birth, according to 
      Buddhism, is the arising of the <I>khandas, </I>the aggregates or groups
      <I>(khandh&#257;nam p&#257;tubh&#257;vo).</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Just as the arising of 
      a physical state is conditioned by a preceding state as its cause, so the 
      appearance of these psycho-physical phenomena is conditioned by causes 
      anterior to its birth. The present process of becoming is the result of 
      the craving for becoming in the previous birth, and the present 
      instinctive craving conditions life in a future birth.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">As the process of one 
      life-span is possible without a permanent entity passing from one 
      thought-moment to another, so a series of life-processes is possible 
      without anything to transmigrate from one existence to another.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddhist doctrine 
      of rebirth should be differentiated from the theory of reincarnation which 
      implies the transmigration of a soul and its invariable material rebirth.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      </I>and<I> Visuddhi Magga</I> the Venerable N&#257;gasena and Buddhaghosa have

      transmigrates from one life to another.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The simile of the flame 
      is very striking. Life is compared to a flame. Rebirth is the transmitting 
      of this flame from one group to another. The flame of life is continuous 
      although there is an apparent break at so-called death.</SPAN></FONT></P>
