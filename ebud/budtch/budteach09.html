      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">On the third day after 
      the arrival of the Buddha at Kapilavatthu, Prince <I>Nanda, </I>the son of 
      Queen <I>Mah&#257; Paj&#257;pati Gotami, </I>was celebrating his consecration 
      ceremony, marriage ceremony, and the house-warming ceremony. It was on the 
      occasion of these three festivals when congratulations were being offered 
      to the prince that the Buddha visited the palace. After the meal the 
      Buddha handed the bowl to the prince, and uttering a Blessing, rose to go 
      without taking the bowl.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The prince followed Him 
      thinking that the Buddha would take the bowl from him at any moment. But 
      the Buddha would not take it, and the prince out of reverence for Him 
      continued to follow the Teacher.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Janapada Kaly&#257;ni,

      prince was following the Buddha with bowl in<B> </B>hand, with tears 
      streaming down her cheeks and hair half-combed, ran after Prince <I>Nanda
      </I>as fast as she could and said to him: &quot;Return quickly, O noble Lord&quot;! 
      These affectionate words penetrated his heart and he was deeply moved, but 
      with deference to the Buddha he could not possibly return the bowl to Him. 
      So he accompanied the Buddha to the park, His temporary residence. On 
      arrival there the Buddha questioned<I> Nanda </I>whether he would become a 
      monk. So great was his reverence for Him as the Buddha and as an elder 
      brother of his that, with reluctance, he agreed to be admitted into the 
      Order.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">But<I> Nanda </I>
      Bhikkhu enjoyed no spiritual happiness resulting from renunciation. He was 
      greatly depressed, and was constantly thinking of his bride. He related 
      his mental troubles to the Bhikkhus, saying: &quot;Brethren, I am dissatisfied. 
      I am now living the Religious Life, but I cannot endure to lead the Holy 
      Life any longer. I intend to abandon the higher precepts and return to the 
      lower life, the life of a layman&quot;.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Hearing this, the 
      Buddha questioned Venerable <I>Nanda </I>whether such report was true. He 
      admitted his weakness, and stated that he was worried about his bride.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddha devised a 
      means to set him on the right path. With the object of showing him 
      celestial nymphs the Buddha, using His Psychic powers, took him to the 
      Tavatimsa Heaven. On the way the Venerable <I>Nanda </I>was shown a singed 
      she-monkey who had lost her ears, nose, and tail in a fire,<B> </B>
      clinging to a burnt-up stump in a scorched field. Reaching heaven, the 
      Buddha pointed to him celestial nymphs and asked him: <I>&quot;Nanda, </I>which 
      do you regard as being the<B> </B>more beautiful and fair to look upon and 
      handsome -- your noble wife <I>Janapada Kaly&#257;ni </I>or the celestial 
      nymphs?&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Venerable Sir, <I>
      Janapada Kaly&#257;ni </I>is like the singed monkey when compared to those

      <I>Nanda </I>was living the Holy Life with the object of winning celestial 
      nymphs, the Bhikkhus ridiculed him calling him &quot;hireling.&quot; Eventually he 
      became ashamed of his base motive, and striving diligently, attained 
      Arahantship.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">He thereupon, 
      approached the Buddha and said: &quot;Venerable Sir, I release the Exalted One 
      from the promise that He made when He guaranteed that I should win 
      celestial nymphs.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddha replied: 
      &quot;When, <I>Nanda, </I>you ceased to cling to the things of the world, and 
      your heart was released from the Corruptions, at that moment I was 
      released from that promise.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">He then uttered the
