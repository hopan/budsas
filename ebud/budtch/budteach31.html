      <SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 24.0pt">I</SPAN><SPAN LANG="EN-US">s 
      Kammic descent possible? In other words, can a man be born as an animal?</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddhist answer may 
      not be acceptable to all, for Buddhism does recognize this possibility.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Material forms, through 
      which the life-continuum expresses itself, are merely temporary visible 
      manifestations of the Kammic energy. The present physical body is not 
      directly evolved from the past physical form, but is the successor of this 
      past form -- being linked with it through the same stream of Kammic 
      energy.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Just as an electric 
      current can be manifested in the forms of light, heat and motion 
      successively -- one not necessarily being evolved from the other -- so 
      this Kammic energy may manifest itself in the form of a Deva, man, animal, 
      or other being, one form having no physical connection with the other. It 
      is one's Kamma that determines the nature of one's material form, which 
      varies according to the skilfulness or unskilfulness of one's past 
      actions, and this again depends entirely on the evolution of one's 
      understanding of reality. Instead of saying that man becomes an animal, or<I> 
      vice versa, </I>it would be more correct to say that the Kammic force 
      which manifested itself in the form of man may manifest itself in the form 
      of an animal.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In the course of our 
      wanderings in Sams&#257;ra -- to speak in conventional terms -- we gather 
      various experiences, receive manifold impressions, acquire diverse 
      character-istics. Our very thought, word, or deed is indelibly recorded in 
      the palimpsest-like mind. The different natures we thus acquire in the 
      course of such successive births whether as men, Devas, animals or Petas, 
      lie dormant within us, and as long as we are worldlings these undestroyed 
      natures may, at unexpected moments, rise to the surface &quot;in disconcerting 
      strength&quot; and reveal our latent Kammic tendencies.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It is quite natural for 
      us to remark after witnessing an unexpected outburst of passion in a 
      highly cultured person: &quot;How could he have done such a thing? Who would 
      have thought that he would commit such an act!&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">There is nothing 
      strange in this misdemeanour of his. It is just a revelation of a hidden 
      part of his intricate self. This is the reason why men normally of lofty 
      motives are sometimes tempted to do things which one would least expect of 
      them.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Devadatta, </SPAN>
      </I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">for example, a noble prince by birth, a leading 
      member of the Holy Order, was possessed of supernormal powers. Overcome by 
      jealousy, latent in him, he made several attempts to kill his own master 
      the Buddha.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Such is the intricate 
      nature of man. One's immediate past is not always a true index to one's 
      immediate future. Every moment we create fresh Kamma. In one sense we are 
      truly what we were, and we will be what we are. In another sense we are 
      not absolutely what we were, and we will not be what we are. Who was 
      yesterday a criminal may today become a saint, who today is holy may 
      tomorrow turn out to be a wretched sinner.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">We can safely and 
      rightly be judged by this eternal present. Today we sow the seeds of the 
      future. At this very moment we may act the part of a brute and create our 
      own hell, or, on the other hand, act the part of a superman and create our 
      own heaven. Each present thought-moment conditions the next 
      thought-moment. The subsequent birth also, according to Buddhist 
      philosophy, is determined by the last thought-process we experience in 
      this life. Just as through the course of one's life each thought perishes, 
      giving up all its potentialities to its successor, even so the last 
      thought-process of this life ends, transmitting all its acquired 
      characteristics and natures to the succeeding moment -- namely, the first 
      thought-moment<I> (patisandhi viññ&#257;na) </I>in the subsequent birth.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Now, if the dying 
      person cherishes a base desire or idea, or experiences a thought, or does 
      an act which befits an animal, his evil Kamma will condition him to birth 
      in animal form. The Kammic force which manifested itself in the form of a 
      man will manifest itself in the form of an animal. This does not imply 
      that thereby all his past good Kammic tendencies are lost. They too lie 
      dormant seeking an opportunity to rise to the surface. It is such a good 
      Kamma that will later effect birth as a human being.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The last 
      thought-process does not, as a rule, depend on the sum-total of our 
      actions in our lifetime. Generally speaking, a good person gets a good 
      birth, and a bad person, a bad one. Under exceptional circumstances, 
      however, the unexpected may happen.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">for example, led a good life, but as the 
      result of experiencing an evil thought at her dying moment, she was born 
      in a state of woe. As her good Kamma was powerful the expiation lasted 
      only for a few days.</FONT></SPAN></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Is this justifiable?&quot; 
      one might ask.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">If a holy person, due 
      to some provocation, were to commit a murder, he would be charged as a 
      murderer. His past good actions would no doubt stand to his credit and 
      have their due effect, but the brutal act could not be obliterated by his 
      past good. Perhaps his past good record would tend to mitigate the 
      sentence, but never could it acquit him altogether of his heinous crime. 
      This unexpected event would compel him to live in an uncongenial 
      atmosphere amongst similar criminals. Is this fair? Imagine how one single 
      immoral act may degrade a noble man!</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">On one occasion two 
      ascetics <I>Punna </I>and<I> Seniya</I> who were practising ox-asceticism 
      and dog-asceticism came to the Buddha and questioned Him as to their 
      future destiny:</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddha replied:</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;In this world a 
      certain person cultivates thoroughly and constantly the practices, habits, 
      mentality, and manners of a dog. He, having cultivated the canine 
      practices, habits, mentality, and manners thoroughly and constantly, upon 
      the breaking up of the body, after death, will be reborn amongst dogs. 
      Certainly if he holds such a belief as this – 'By virtue of this practice, 
      austerity or noble life, I shall become a god or a deity of some kind' -- 
      that is a false belief of his. For one who holds a false belief I declare 
      that there is one of two future states -- the state of torment or the 
      animal kingdom. Thus, failing a state of torment, successful canine 
      asceticism only delivers one to companionship with dogs. </FONT>

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In the same way the 
      Buddha declared that he who observes ox-asceticism will, after death, be 
      born amongst oxen. So there is the possibility for a Kammic descent in one 
      bound in the so-called evolutionary scale of beings.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">But the contrary, a 
      Kammic ascent, is also possible.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When, for instance, an 
      animal is about to die, it may experience a moral consciousness that will 
      ripen into a human birth. This last thought-process does not depend wholly 
      on any action or thought of the animal, for generally speaking, its mind 
      is dull and it is incapable of doing any moral action. This depends on 
      some past good deed done during a former round of its existence which has 
      long been prevented from producing its inevitable results. In its last 
      moment the animal therefore may conceive ideas or images which will cause 
      a human birth.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Poussin, </SPAN></I>
      <SPAN LANG="EN-US">a French writer, illustrates this fact by the law of 
      heredity: &quot;A man may be like his grandfather but not like his father. The 
      germs of disease have been introduced into the organism of an ancestor, 
      for some generations they remain dormant. But suddenly they manifest 
      themselves in actual diseases.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">So intricate is the 
      nature of this doctrine of Kamma and Rebirth!</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Whence we came, whither 
      we go, and when we go, we know not. The fact that we must go we know for 
      certain.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Our cherished 
      possessions, our kith and kin follow us not -- nay, not even our bodies 
      which we call our own. From elements they came, to elements they return. 
      Empty fame and vain glory vanish in thin air.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Alone we wander in this 
      tempest-tossed sea of Sams&#257;ra wafted hither and thither by our own Kamma, 
      appearing here as an animal or man and there perchance as a god or Brahma.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">We meet and part and 
      yet we may meet again incognito. For seldom do we find a being who, in the 
      course of our wandering, had not at one time been a mother, a father, a 
      sister, a son, a daughter.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;If a man,&quot;</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> 
      says the Buddha, <I>&quot;were to prune out the grasses, sticks, boughs, and 
      twigs in this India and collecting them together, should make a pile 
      laying them in a four inch stack, saying for each: 'This is my mother, 
      this is my mother's mother,' -- the grasses, sticks, boughs, twigs in this 
      India would be used up, ended but not the mothers of that man's mother.&quot;</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">So closely bound are we

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The countless lives we 
      have led and the innumerable sufferings we were subject to in the infinite

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;The bones of a 
      single person wandering in Sams&#257;ra would be a cairn, a pile, a heap as

      collections not destroyed.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Longtime have you 
      suffered the death of father and mother, of sons, daughters, brothers and

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Long time did your
