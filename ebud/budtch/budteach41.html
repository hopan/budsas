      towards all beings. so boundless is his love and so pervasive is his 
      infinite compassion that unceasingly throughout the series of his 
      countless lives he strives to diminish suffering, to elevate to greater 
      honour the poor and the lowly, and to help the needy in every possible 
      way.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      or Generosity is the first P&#257;rami. It confers upon the giver the double 
      blessing of inhibiting immoral thoughts of selfishness, while developing 
      pure thoughts of selflessness. </SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;It blesseth him that 
      gives and him that takes.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">A Bodhisatta is not 
      concerned as to whether the recipient is truly in need or not, for his one 
      object in practising generosity, as he does, is to eliminate craving that 
      lies dormant within himself. The joy of service, its attendant happiness, 
      and the alleviation of suffering are other blessings of generosity.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In extending his love 
      with supernormal generosity, he makes no distinction between one being and 
      another, but he uses judicious discrimination in this generosity. If, for 
      instance, a drunkard were to seek his help, and, if he were convinced that 
      the drunkard would misuse his gift, the Bodhisatta without hesitation 
      would refuse it, for such misplaced generosity would not constitute a 
      P&#257;ram&#299;.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Should anyone seek his 
      help for a worthy purpose, then instead of assuming a forced air of 
      dignity or making false pretensions, he would simply express his deep 
      obligation for the opportunity afforded, and willingly and humbly render 
      every possible aid. Yet, he would never set it down to his own credit as a 
      favour conferred upon another, nor would he ever regard the man as his 
      debtor for the service rendered. He is interested only in the good act, 
      but in nothing else springing from it. He expects no reward in return, nor 
      even does he crave enhancement of reputation from it.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">A Bodhisatta, though 
      always ready to confer a favour, seldom, if ever, stoops to ask one. The 
      Brahma J&#257;taka (No. 323) relates that once the Bodhisatta was leading an 
      ascetic life in the park of a certain king who used to visit him daily and 
      minister to his needs. Yet, for twelve long years he refrained from asking 
      the boon of a pair of sandals and a leaf-parasol, trifling as they were.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When questioned as to 
      his strange, but modest attitude, he replied to the king:-</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Who beg, <I>Pañc&#257;la,
      </I>Lord, to weep are fain. <BR>
      They who refuse are apt to weep again&quot;.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In abundance he gives 
      to others, irrespective of caste, creed, or colour, though seeking nothing 
      for himself in return. A characteristic of his mind is perfect contentment 
      such as the poet Edward Dyer contemplated.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Some have too much, 
      yet still do crave,</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> <BR>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In the Kanha J&#257;taka 
      (No. 440) it is related that <I>Sakka, </I>attracted by the exemplary, 
      virtuous life of the Bodhisatta, approached him and offered him a boon. 
      Acceding to Sakka's kindly request, he wished for the following:</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P STYLE="margin-left: 21.3pt"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">

      4. May I possess<I> equanimity!</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Greatly disappointed, 
      though full of admiration for the disinterest shown, Sakka entreated him 
      to choose yet another boon. </SPAN></FONT></P>

      said, &quot;Choose a boon!&quot; </SPAN></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">A Bodhisatta<B> </B>
      exercises this virtue of generosity to such an extent that he is prepared 
      to give away not only wealth and other cherished possessions, but also his 
      kingdom, his limbs and even his children and wife; and he is ever ready to 
      sacrifice his own life wherever such sacrifice would benefit humanity.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Vessantara J&#257;taka 
      (No. 547) relates how, when Prince <I>Vessantara </I>was a child of only 
      eight years, he thought with all sincerity: &quot;If one should need my heart, 
      I would cut open my breast, tear it out and give it; if one should need my 
      eyes, I would gouge them out and give them; if one should need my flesh, I 
      would cut off what he needed.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Vy&#257;ghr&#299; J&#257;taka 
      depicts, in growing terms, an incident in which he willingly and joyfully 
      sacrificed his life for the good and happiness of others. In the 
      J&#257;takam&#257;l&#257; the story runs as follows:--</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;On one occasion 
      when the Bodhisatta was passing through a forest, accompanied by his 
      disciple, he saw a tigress and her three cubs near death from starvation. 
      Moved to compassion, he asked his disciple to secure some food for them. 
      This was but a pretext to send him away, for the Bodhisatta thought:-</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Why<B> </B>should I 
      search after meat from the body of another while the whole of my own body 
      is available? Finding other meat is a matter of chance, and I may well 
      lose the opportunity of doing my duty. This body being foul and a source 
      of suffering, he is not wise who would not rejoice at its being spent for 
      the</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> <I>benefit of another. There are but two 
      things that make one disregard the grief of another -- attachment to one's 
      own pleasure and the absence of the power of helping. But I cannot take my 
      pleasure while another grieves, as long as I am able to help him. Why 
      should I, therefore, be indifferent?</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;By casting myself 
      down this precipice, I sacrifice my miserable body which will feed the 
      tigress, thus preventing her from killing the young ones and saving the 
      young ones from dying by the teeth of their mother.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Furthermore, by so 
      doing I set an example to those whose longings are for the good of the 
      world. I encourage the feeble; I gladden those who understand the meaning 
      of charity; and I inspire the virtuous. And finally that opportunity I 
      yearned for, when may I have the opportunity of benefiting others by 
      offering them my own limbs, I shall obtain it now, and acquire before long 
      the Samm&#257; Sambuddhahood -- Supreme Enlightenment.&quot;</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Thinking thus, he cast 
      himself down the precipice sacrificing his life for the welfare of those 
      helpless beings.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Nevari (Nep&#257;la 
      Bh&#257;sh&#257;) version of this interesting and pitiful story is as follows:--</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In the remote past 
      there lived a devout and powerful king named Mah&#257;rattha. He had three sons 
      by name, Mah&#257; Prash&#257;da, Mah&#257; Deva, and Mah&#257;sattva, all good and obedient.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">One bright day the 
      king, accompanied by the princes and attendants, went on an excursion to a 
      forest park. The</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> <I>young princes, admiring 
      the enchanting beauty of the flowers and trees, gradually penetrated far 
      into the thick forest.</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The attendants 
      noticed their absence and reported the matter to the king. He ordered his 
      ministers to go in search of them and returned to his palace.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The three princes, 
      wandering through the forest, reached a mountain top. From there the 
      eldest saw a starving tigress with five cubs almost on the verge of death. 
      For seven days since her delivery she had been without food. The cubs 
      approached the mother to suck milk, but she had nothing to satisfy their 
      hunger, and the tigress, driven by starvation, was clearly at the point of 
      unnaturally devouring her own cubs.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The eldest brother 
      was the first to see this pathetic spectacle. He showed the tigress to his 
      brothers and said:--&quot;Behold that pitiful sight, O brothers! That starving 
      tigress is about to devour her cubs. How wretched is their condition!&quot;</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;What is their 
      staple food, brother?&quot; inquired Mah&#257;sattva.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Flesh and blood is 
      the staple food of tigers and lions.&quot; replied Mah&#257; Prash&#257;da.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;The tigress seems 
      to be very weak. Evidently she is without food for some days. How noble if 
      one could sacrifice one's body for their sake!</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;But, who is willing 
      to make such great sacrifice!&quot; remarked Mah&#257; Deva.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Surely, no one 
      would be able to do so,&quot; stated Mah&#257; Prash&#257;da.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;I lack 
      intelligence. Ignorant persons like us would not be able to sacrifice 
      their bodies for the sake of another. But there may be selfless men of 
      boundless compassion who would willingly do so,&quot; said Mah&#257;sattva in a 
      merciful tone.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Thus they discussed 
      amongst themselves and casting a last glance at the helpless tigress, they 
      departed.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Mah&#257;sattva thought 
      to himself:--</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Sacrifice I must 
      this fleeting body for the sake of this starving tigress. Foul is this 
      body, and is subject to decay and death. One may adorn and perfume it, but<B>
      </B>soon it will stink and perish.&quot;</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Reflecting thus, he 
      requested his brothers to proceed as he would be retiring to the forest 
      for some reason or other.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">He retraced his 
      steps to the place where the tigress was resting. Hanging his garments and 
      ornaments on a tree, again he thought:--</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Work I must for the 
      weal of others. Compassionate we must be towards all beings. To serve 
      those who need our succour is our paramount duty. This foul body of mine 
      will I sacrifice and thus save the tigress and her five cubs. By this 
      meritorious act may I gain Samm&#257; Sambuddhahood and save all beings from 
      the ocean of Sams&#257;ra! May all beings be well and happy!&quot;</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Moved by compassion 
      and inspired by the spirit of selfless service, dauntlessly he jumped off 
      the precipice towards the tigress.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The fall did not 
      result in an instantaneous death. The tigress, though ruthless by nature, 
      pitied the Bodhisattva and would not even touch his body.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Bodhisattva 
      thought otherwise: &quot;Obviously the poor animal is too weak to devour me!&quot;</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">So h<B>c </B>went in 
      search of a weapon. He came across a bamboo splinter, and drawing near the 
      tigress, he cut off his neck and fell dead on the ground in a pool of 
      blood.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The hungry tigress 
      greedily drank the blood and devoured the flesh leaving mere bones.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The story adds that, 
      at the moment the Bodhisattva sacrificed his body, the earth quaked, the 
      waters of the ocean were disturbed, the sun's rays dimmed, eye-sight was 
      temporarily blurred, Devas gave cries of S&#257;dhu, and P&#257;rij&#257;ta flowers came 
      down as rain from heaven.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Affected by the 
      earthquake, the two elder brothers rightly guessed that their younger 
      brother must have become a prey to the tigress.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
