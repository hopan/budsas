      the deluded world. They do not and cannot change with time because they 
      are eternal Truths. The Buddha was not indebted to anyone for His 
      realization of them. He Himself said: &quot;They were unheard before.

      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These Truths 
      are in P&#257;li termed <I>ariyasacc&#257;ni. </I>They are so called because they 
      were discovered by the Greatest Ariya, the Buddha, who was far removed 
      from passion.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The first Truth 
      deals with <I>dukkha, </I>which for need of a better English equivalent, 
      is rendered by suffering or sorrow. As a feeling <I>dukkha </I>means that 
      which is difficult to be endured <I>(du --</I> difficult, <I>kha -- </I>to 
      endure). As an abstract truth <I>dukkha </I>is used in the sense of 
      &quot;contemptible&quot; (<I>du</I>) and &quot;emptiness&quot; <I>(kha). </I>The world rests 
      on suffering hence it is contemptible. The world is devoid of any reality 
      -- hence it is empty or void. <I>Dukkha,</I> therefore, means contemptible 
      void.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Average men are 
      only surface-seers. An Ariya sees things as they truly are. To an Ariya 
      all life is suffering and he finds no real happiness in this world which 
      deceives mankind with illusory pleasures. Material happiness is merely the 
      gratification of some desire. &quot;No<B> </B>sooner is the desired thing 
      gained than it begins to be scorned.&quot; Insatiate are all desires.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All are subject 
      to birth <I>(j&#257;ti), </I>and consequently to decay <I>(jar&#257;), </I>disease<I> 
      (vy&#257;dhi), </I>and finally to death<I> (marana). </I>No one is exempt from 
      these four inevitable causes of suffering.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Impeded wish is 
      also suffering. We do not wish to be associated with things or persons we 
      detest, nor do we wish to be separated from things or persons we love. Our 
      cherished desires are not, however, always gratified. What we least expect 
      or what we least desire is often thrust on us. At times such unexpected 
      unpleasant circumstances become so intolerable and painful that weak 
      ignorant folk are compelled to commit suicide as if such an act would 
      solve the problem. </SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Real happiness 
      is found within, and is not to be defined in terms of wealth, power, 
      honours or conquests. If such worldly possessions are forcibly or unjustly 
      obtained, or are misdirected, or even viewed with attachment, they will be 
      a source of pain and sorrow for the possessors.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Ordinarily the 
      enjoyment of sensual pleasures is the highest and only happiness to an 
      average person. There is no doubt a momentary happiness in the 
      anticipation, gratification, and recollection of such fleeting material 
      pleasures, but they are illusory and temporary. According to the Buddha 
      non-attachment <I>(vir&#257;gat&#257;) </I>or the transcending of material pleasures 
      is a greater bliss.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In brief, this 
      composite body itself is a cause of suffering.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This First 
      Truth of suffering which depends on this so-called being and various 
      aspects of life, is to be carefully analysed and examined. This 
      examination leads to a proper understanding of oneself as one really is.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The cause of 
      this suffering is craving or attachment <I>(tanh&#257;) </I>which is the Second 
      Noble Truth.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Dhammapada

      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This craving is 
      a powerful mental force latent in all, and is the chief cause of most of 
      the ills of life. It is this craving, gross or subtle, that leads to 
      repeated births in Sams&#257;ra and makes one cling to all forms of life.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The grossest

      stage of Sainthood, and are eradicated on attaining <I>An&#257;g&#257;mi, </I>the 
      third stage of Sainthood. The subtle forms of craving are eradicated on

      suffering and craving can only be eradicated by following the Middle Way,

      Nibb&#257;na.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Third Noble 
      Truth is the complete cessation of suffering which is Nibb&#257;na, the 
      ultimate Goal of Buddhists. It is achieved by the total eradication of all 
      forms of craving.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This Nibb&#257;na is 
      to be comprehended by the mental eye by renouncing all internal attachment

      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This Truth has 
      to be realized by developing the Noble Eightfold Path which is the Fourth 
      Noble Truth. This unique path is the only straight route that leads to 
      Nibb&#257;na. It avoids the extreme of self-mortification that weakens one's 
      intellect and the extreme of self-indulgence that retards one's moral 
      progress.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It consists of 
      the following eight factors.:</SPAN></P>

      8) Right Concentration <I>(Samm&#257; Sam&#257;dhi),</I></SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. <B>Right 
      Understanding</B> is explained as the knowledge of the four Noble Truths. 
      In other words, it is the understanding of oneself as one really is, 
      because, as the Rohitassa Sutta states, these truths are concerned with 
      the &quot;one-fathom long body of man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The key-note of 
      Buddhism is this right understanding.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. Clear vision 
      or right understanding leads to clear thinking. The second factor of the 
      noble Eightfold Path is, therefore, <I>Samm&#257; Samkappa. </I>The English 
      renderings -- &quot;Right Resolutions&quot;, &quot;Right Aspirations&quot; -- do not convey 
      the actual meaning of the P&#257;li term. Right Ideas or Right Mindfulness 
      comes closer to the meaning. <B>&quot;Right Thoughts&quot;</B> may be suggested as 
      the nearest English equivalent.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By<I> Samkappa
      </I>is meant the <I>&quot;Vitakka&quot; </I>mental state, which, for want of a 
      better rendering, may be called &quot;initial application.&quot; This important 
      mental state eliminates wrong ideas or notions and helps the other moral 
      adjuncts to be diverted to Nibb&#257;na.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is one's 
      thoughts that either defile or purify a person. One's thoughts mould one's 
      nature and controls one's destiny. Evil thoughts tend to debase one just 
      as good thoughts tend to elevate one. Sometimes a single thought can 
      either destroy or save a world.</SPAN></P>
      <P><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Samm&#257; 
      Samkappa </SPAN></I>
      <SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">serves the double 
      purpose of eliminating evil thoughts and developing pure thoughts.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Right Thoughts, 
      in this particular connection, are threefold. They consist of:</SPAN></P>
      <P STYLE="margin-left: 36.0pt">
      <SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i<I>. Nekkhamma --
      </I>Renunciation<I> </I>of worldly pleasures or selflessness which is 
      opposed to attachment, selfishness, and self-possessiveness.</SPAN></P>
      <P STYLE="margin-left: 36.0pt">
      <SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ii. <I>Avy&#257;p&#257;da</I>

      ill-will, or aversion, and</SPAN></P>
      <P STYLE="margin-left: 36.0pt">
      <SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">iii. <I>Avihims&#257;</I> 
      -- Harmlessness or compassion, which is opposed to cruelty and 
      callousness.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These evil and 
      good forces are latent in all. As long as we are worldlings these evil 
      forces rise to the surface at unexpected moments in disconcerting 
      strength. When once they are totally eradicated on attaining Arahantship, 
      one's stream of consciousness gets perfectly purified.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Attachment and 
      hatred, coupled with ignorance, are the chief causes of all evil prevalent 
      in this deluded world. &quot;The enemy of the whole world is lust, through 
      which all evils come to living beings. This lust when obstructed by some 
      cause is transformed into wrath.&quot;</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">One is either 
      attached to desirable external objects or is repulsed with aversion in the 
      case of undesirable objects. Through attachment one clings to material 
      pleasures and tries to gratify one's desire by some means or other. 
      Through aversion one recoils from undesirable objects and even goes to the 
      extent of destroying them as their very presence is a source of 
      irritation. With the giving up of egoism by one's own intuitive insight, 
      both attachment and hatred automatically disappear.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Dhammapada

      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. As one 
      ascends the spiritual ladder one renounces by degrees both gross and 
      subtle attachment to material pleasures like grown-up children giving up 
      their petty toys. Being children, they cannot be expected to possess an 
      adult's understanding, and they cannot be convinced of the worthlessness 
      of their temporary pleasures. With maturity they begin to understand 
      things as they truly are and they voluntarily give up their toys. As the 
      spiritual pilgrim proceeds on the upward path by his constant meditation 
      and reflection, he perceives the futility of pursuing base material 
      pleasures and the resultant happiness in forsaking them. He cultivates 
      non-attachment to the fullest degree. &quot;Happy is non-attachment in this 
      world, so is the transcending of all sensual pleasures,&quot; is one of the 
      early utterances of the Buddha.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ii. The other 
      most rebellious passion is anger, aversion, illwill, or hatred, all of 
      which are implied by the P&#257;li term <I>vy&#257;p&#257;da. </I>It consumes the person 
      in whom it springs and consumes others as well. The P&#257;li term <I>avy&#257;p&#257;da,
      </I>literally, non-enmity, corresponds to that most beautiful virtue <I>
      Mett&#257;</I> (Samskrit <I>Maitri) </I>which means loving-kindness or goodwill 
      towards all without any distinction. He whose mind is full of 
      loving-kindness can harbour no hatred towards any. Like a mother who makes 
      no difference between herself and her only child and protects it even at 
      the risk of her own life, even so does the spiritual pilgrim who follows 
      this middle path radiate his thoughts of loving-kindness identifying 
      himself with all. Buddhist Mett&#257; embraces all living beings, animals not 
      excluded.</SPAN></P>

      sweet virtue which makes the tender hearts of the noble quiver at the

      limitless. It is not restricted only to co-religionists or co-nationals or 
      to human beings alone. Limited compassion is not true <I>karun&#257;.</I></SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A compassionate 
      one is as soft as a flower. He cannot bear the sufferings of others. He 
      might at times even go to the extent of sacrificing his own life to 
      alleviate the sufferings of others. In every J&#257;taka story it is evident 
      that the Bodhisatta endeavoured his best to help the distressed and the 
      forlorn and to promote their happiness in every possible way.</SPAN></P>

      being able to tolerate the sufferings of others. Its manifestation is 
      perfect non-violence and harmlessness -- that is, a compassionate person 
      appears to be absolutely non-violent and harmless. The sight of the

        Unsullied shall our minds remain, neither shall evil words escape our 
        lips. Kind and compassionate ever shall we abide with hearts harbouring 
        no ill-will. And we shall enfold those very persons with streams of 
        loving thoughts unfailing, and forth from them proceeding we shall 
        radiate the whole wide world with constant thoughts of loving-kindness, 
        ample, expanding, measureless, free from enmity, free from ill-will. 
        Thus must you train yourselves.&quot;</SPAN></I></P>

      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He whose mind 
      is free from selfish desires, hatred and cruelty, and is saturated with 
      the spirit of selflessness, loving-kindness and harmlessness, lives in 
      perfect peace. He is indeed a blessing to himself and others.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Right 
      Thoughts lead to <B>Right Speech</B>, the third factor. It deals with 
      refraining from falsehood, slandering, harsh words, and frivolous talk.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He who tries to 
      eradicate selfish desires cannot indulge in uttering falsehood or in 
      slandering for any selfish end or purpose. He is truthful and trustworthy 
      and ever seeks the good and beautiful in others instead of deceiving, 
      defaming, denouncing or disuniting his own fellow beings. A harmless mind 
      that generates loving-kindness cannot give vent to harsh speech which 
      first debases the speaker and then hurts another. What he utters is not 
      only true, sweet and pleasant but also useful, fruitful and beneficial.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4. Right Speech 
      follows <B>Right Action</B> which deals with abstinence from killing, 
      stealing and sexual misconduct.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These three 
      evil deeds are caused by craving and anger, coupled with ignorance. With 
      the gradual elimination of these causes from the mind of the spiritual 
      pilgrim, blameworthy tendencies arising therefrom will find no expression. 
      Under no pretence would he kill or steal. Being pure in mind, he would 
      lead a pure life.</SPAN></P>

      thoughts, words and deeds at the outset, the spiritual pilgrim tries to 
      purify his livelihood (<B>Right Livelihood)</B> by refraining from the 
      five kinds of trade which are forbidden to a lay-disciple. They are 
      trading in arms <I>(satthavanijj&#257;), </I>human beings <I>(sattavanijj&#257;),

      removes this rubbish-heap and cultivates these latent virtues.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">7. Right Effort 
      is closely associated with <B>Right Mindfulness</B>. It is the constant
