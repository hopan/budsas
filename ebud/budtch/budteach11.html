        and sat at a side. Of his subjects some respectfully saluted Him, some 
        looked towards him with expression of friendly greetings, some saluted 
        Him with clasped hands, some introduced themselves, while others in 
        perfect silence took their seats. As both the Buddha <I>Gotama </I>and 
        Venerable<I> Kassapa </I>were held in high esteem by the multitude they 
        were not certain whether the Buddha was leading the Holy Life under 
        Venerable <I>Kassapa</I> or the latter under the former. The Buddha read 
        their thoughts and questioned Venerable <I>Kassapa</I> as to why he had 
        given up his fire-sacrifice. Understanding the motive of the Buddha's 
        question, he explained that he abandoned fire-sacrifice because he 
        preferred the passionless and peaceful state of Nibb&#257;na to worthless 
        sensual pleasures. After this he fell at the feet of the Buddha and 
        acknowledging his superiority said: &quot;My teacher, Lord, is the Exalted

        to his palace for the meal on the following day. After the meal the King 
        wished to know where the Buddha would reside. The Buddha replied that a

        those who desire to visit Him, pleasant, not crowded during the day, not 
        too noisy at night, with as few sounds as possible, airy and fit for the

        providing a dowry: The Buddha, unlike any other religious teacher, paid
