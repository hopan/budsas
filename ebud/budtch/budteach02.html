        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Meeting with disappointment, but 
        not discouraged, the ascetic <I>Gotama </I>seeking for the incomparable 
        Peace, the highest Truth, wandered through the district of Magadha, and 
        arrived in due course at <I>Uruvel&#257;, </I>the market town of <I>Sen&#257;ni.
        </I>There he spied a lovely spot of ground, a charming forest grove, a 
        flowing river with pleasant sandy fords, and hard by was a village where 
        he could obtain his food. Then he thought thus:</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Lovely, indeed, O Venerable 
        One, is this spot of ground, charming is the forest grove, pleasant is 
        the flowing river with sandy fords, and hard by is the village where I 
        could obtain food. Suitable indeed is this place for spiritual exertion 
        for those noble scions who desire to strive.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt"> 
        (</SPAN><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Majjhima Nik&#257;ya, <I>Ariya-Pariyesana Sutta</I> 
        No. 26, Vol. 1, p. 16)</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The place was congenial for his 
        meditation. The atmosphere was peaceful. The surroundings were pleasant. 
        The scenery was charming. Alone, he resolved to settle down there to 
        achieve his desired object.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Hearing of his renunciation, <I>
        Kondañña, </I>the youngest brahmin who predicted his future, and four 
        sons of the other sages<I> -- Bhaddiya, Vappa,</I> <I>Mah&#257;n&#257;ma, </I>and<I> 
        Assaji -- also </I>renounced the world and joined his company.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In the ancient days in India, 
        great importance was attached to rites, ceremonies, penances and 
        sacrifices. It was then a popular belief that no Deliverance could be 
        gained unless one leads a life of strict asceticism. Accordingly, for 
        six long years the ascetic <I>Gotama </I>made a superhuman struggle 
        practising all forms of severest austerity. His delicate body was 
        reduced to almost a skeleton. The more he tormented his body the farther 
        his goal receded from him.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">How strenuously he struggled, 
        the various methods he employed, and how he eventually succeeded are 
        graphically described in his own words in various Suttas.</SPAN></P>

        [1]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A> </SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">describes his 
        preliminary efforts thus:</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Then the following thought 
        occurred to me:</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;How if I were to clench my 
        teeth, press my tongue against the palate, and with (moral) thoughts 
        hold down, subdue and destroy my (immoral) thoughts!</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;So I clenched my teeth, pressed 
        my tongue against the palate and strove to hold down, subdue, destroy my 
        (immoral) thoughts with (moral) thoughts. As I struggled thus, 
        perspiration streamed forth from my armpits.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Like unto a strong man who 
        might seize a weaker man by head or shoulders and hold him down, force 
        him down, and bring into subjection, even so did I struggle.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Strenuous and indomitable was 
        my energy. My mindfulness was established and unperturbed. My body was, 
        however, fatigued and was not calmed as a result of that painful 
        endeavour -- being overpowered by exertion. Even though such painful 
        sensations arose in me, they did not at all affect my mind.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Then I thought thus: How if I 
        were to cultivate the non-breathing ecstasy!</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Accordingly, I checked 
        inhalation and exhalation from my mouth and nostrils. As I checked 
        inhalation and exhalation from mouth and nostrils, the air issuing from 
        my ears created an exceedingly great noise. Just as a blacksmith's 
        bellows being blown make an exceedingly great noise, even so was the 
        noise created by the air issuing from my ears when I stopped breathing.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Nevertheless, my energy was 
        strenuous and indomitable. Established and unperturbed was my 
        mindfulness. Yet my body was fatigued and was not calmed as a result of 
        that painful endeavour -- being over-powered by exertion. </SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Even though such painful 
        sensations arose in me, they did not at all affect my mind.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Then I thought to myself: 'How 
        if I were to cultivate that non-breathing exercise!</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Accordingly, I checked 
        inhalation and exhalation from mouth, nostrils, and ears. And as I 
        stopped breathing from mouth, nostrils and ears, the (imprisoned) airs 
        beat upon my skull with great violence. Just as if a strong man were to 
        bore one's skull with a sharp drill, even so did the airs beat my skull 
        with great violence as I stopped breathing. Even though such painful 
        sensations arose in me, they did not at all affect my mind.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Then I thought to myself: How 
        if I were to cultivate that non-breathing ecstasy again!</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Accordingly, I checked 
        inhalation and exhalation from mouth, nostrils, and ears. And as I 
        stopped breathing thus, terrible pains arose in my head. As would be the 
        pains if a strong man were to bind one's head tightly with a hard 
        leathern thong, even so were the terrible pains that arose in my head. 
        &quot;Nevertheless, my energy was strenuous. Such painful sensations did not 
        affect my mind.</SPAN></P>
        <P><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Then 
        I thought to myself: How if I were to cultivate that non-breathing 
        ecstasy again!</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Accordingly, I stopped 
        breathing from mouth, nostrils, and ears. As I checked breathing thus, 
        plentiful airs pierced my belly. Just as if a skilful butcher or a 
        butcher's apprentice were to rip up the belly with a sharp butcher's 
        knife, even so plentiful airs pierced my belly.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Nevertheless, my energy was 
        strenuous. Such painful sensations did not affect my mind.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Again I thought to myself: How 
        if I were to cultivate that non-breathing ecstasy again!</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Accordingly, I checked 
        inhalation and exhalation from mouth, nostrils, and ears. As I 
        suppressed my breathing thus, a tremendous burning pervaded my body. 
        Just as if two strong men were each to seize a weaker man by his arms 
        and scorch and thoroughly burn him in a pit of glowing charcoal, even so 
        did a severe burning pervade my body.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Nevertheless, my energy was 
        strenuous. Such painful sensations did not affect my mind.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Thereupon the deities who saw 
        me thus said: 'The ascetic Gotama is dead.' Some remarked: 'The ascetic 
        Gotama is not dead yet, but is dying'. While some others said: 'The 
        ascetic Gotama is neither dead nor is dying but an Arahant is the 
        ascetic Gotama. Such is the way in which an Arahant abides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
        <P><B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Change of Method: Abstinence 
        from Food</SPAN></B></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Then I thought to myself: How 
        if I were to practise complete abstinence from food!</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Then deities approached me and 
        said: 'Do not, good sir, practise total abstinence from food. If you do 
        practise it, we will pour celestial essence through your body's pores; 
        with that you will be sustained.&quot;</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;And I thought: 'If I claim to 
        be practising starvation, and if these deities pour celestial essence 
        through my body's pores and I am sustained thereby, it would be a fraud 
        on my part.' So I refused them, saying 'There is no need'.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Then the following thought 
        occurred to me: How if I take food little by little, a small quantity of 
        the juice of green gram, or vetch, or lentils, or peas!</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;As I took such small quantity 
        of solid and liquid food, my body became extremely emaciated. Just as 
        are the joints of knot-grasses or bulrushes, even so were the major and 
        minor parts of my body owing to lack of food. Just as is the camel's 
        hoof, even so were my hips for want of food. Just as is a string of 
        beads, even so did my backbone stand out and bend in, for lack of food. 
        Just as the rafters of a dilapidated hall fall this way and that, even 
        so appeared my ribs through lack of sustenance. Just as in a deep well 
        may be seen stars sunk deep in the water, even so did my eye-balls 
        appear deep sunk in their sockets, being devoid of food. Just as a 
        bitter pumpkin, when cut while raw, will by wind and sun get shrivelled 
        and withered, even so did the skin of my head get shrivelled and 
        withered, due to lack of sustenance.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;And I, intending to touch my 
        belly's skin, would instead seize my backbone. When I intended to touch 
        my backbone, I would seize my belly's skin. So was I that, owing to lack 
        of sufficient food, my belly's skin clung to the backbone, and I, on 
        going to pass excreta or urine, would in that very spot stumble and fall 
        down, for want of food. And I stroked my limbs in order to revive my 
        body. Lo, as I did so, the rotten roots of my body's hairs fell from my 
        body owing to lack of sustenance. The people who saw me said: 'The 
        ascetic <I>Gotama </I>is black.' Some said, 'The ascetic <I>Gotama </I>
        is not black but blue.' Some others said: 'The ascetic <I>Gotama </I>is 
        neither black nor blue but tawny.' To such an extent was the pure colour 
        of my skin impaired owing to lack of food.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Then the following thought 
        occurred to me: Whatsoever ascetics or brahmins of the past have 
        experienced acute, painful, sharp and piercing sensations, they must 
        have experienced them to such a high degree as this and not beyond. 
        Whatsoever ascetics and brahmins of the future will experience acute, 
        painful, sharp and piercing sensations they too will experience them to 
        such a high degree and not beyond. Yet by all these bitter and difficult 
        austerities I shall not attain to excellence, worthy of supreme 
        knowledge and insight, transcending those of human states. Might there 
        be another path for Enlightenment!&quot;</SPAN></P>
        <P><B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Temptation of M&#257;ra the Evil 
        One</SPAN></B></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">His prolonged painful 
        austerities proved utterly futile. They only resulted in the exhaustion 
        of his valuable energy. Though physically a superman his delicately 
        nurtured body could not possibly stand the great strain. His graceful 
        form completely faded almost beyond recognition. His golden coloured 
        skin turned pale, his blood dried up, his sinews and muscles shrivelled 
        up, his eyes were sunk and blurred. To all appearance he was a living 
        skeleton. He was almost on the verge of death.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">At this critical stage, while he 
        was still intent on the Highest <I>(Padh&#257;na), </I>abiding on the banks 
        of the <I>Nerañjar&#257; </I>river, striving and contemplating in order to 
        attain to that state of Perfect Security, came <I>Namuci,<A HREF="#_edn2" NAME="_ednref2" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[2]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>
        </I>uttering kind words thus:<A HREF="#_edn3" NAME="_ednref3" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[3]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></P>

        which tends to retard moral progress. He conceived the idea of adopting 
        the Golden Mean which later became one of the salient features of his 
        teaching.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">He recalled how when his father 
        was engaged in ploughing, he sat in the cool shade of the rose-apple 
        tree, absorbed in the contemplation of his own breath, which resulted in 
        the attainment of the First <I>Jh&#257;na </I>(Ecstasy)<A HREF="#_edn9" NAME="_ednref9" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[9]</SPAN></SPAN></A>. 
        Thereupon he thought: &quot;Well, this is the path to Enlightenment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">He realized that Enlightenment 
        could not be gained with such an utterly exhausted body: Physical 
        fitness was essential for spiritual progress. So he decided to nourish 
        the body sparingly and took some coarse food both hard and soft.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The five favourite disciples who 
        were attending on him with great hopes thinking that whatever truth the 
        ascetic <I>Gotama </I>would comprehend, that would he impart to them, 
        felt disappointed at this unexpected change of method. and leaving him 
        and the place too, went to Isipatana, saying that &quot;the ascetic <I>Gotama
        </I>had become luxurious, had ceased from striving, and had returned to 
        a life of comfort.&quot;</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">At a crucial time when help was 
        most welcome his companions deserted him leaving him alone. He was not 
        discouraged, but their voluntary separation was advantageous to him 
        though their presence during his great struggle was helpful to him. 
        Alone, in sylvan solitudes, great men often realize deep truths and 
        solve intricate problems.</SPAN></P>
        <P><B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Dawn of Truth</SPAN></B></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Regaining his lost strength with 
        some coarse food, he easily developed the First <I>Jh&#257;na </I>which he 
        gained in his youth. By degrees he developed the second, third and 
        fourth <I>Jh&#257;nas </I>as well.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">By developing the <I>Jh&#257;nas </I>
        he gained perfect one-pointedness of the mind. His mind was now like a 
        polished mirror where everything is reflected in its true perspective.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Thus with thoughts 
        tranquillized, purified, cleansed, free from lust and impurity, pliable, 
        alert, steady, and unshakable, he directed his mind to the knowledge as 
        regards &quot;The Reminiscence of Past Births&quot; <I>(Pubbe-niv&#257;s&#257;nussati m&#257;na).
        </I></SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">He recalled his varied lots in 
        former existences as follows: first one life, then two lives, then 
        three, four, five, ten, twenty, up to fifty lives; then a hundred, a 
        thousand, a hundred thousand; then the dissolution of many world cycles, 
        then the evolution of many world cycles, then both the dissolution and 
        evolution of many world cycles. In that place he was of such a name, 
        such a family, such a caste, such a dietary, such the pleasure and pain 
        he experienced, such his life's end. Departing from there, he came into 
        existence elsewhere. Then such was his name, such his family, such his 
        caste, such his dietary, such the pleasure and pain he did experience, 
        such life's end. Thence departing, he came into existence here.</SPAN></P>
        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Thus he recalled the mode and 
        details of his varied lots in his former births.</SPAN></P>
        <P><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">This, indeed, as the First

        <P><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Dispelling thus the ignorance

        supernormal, he perceived beings disappearing from one state of 
        existence and reappearing in another; he beheld the base and the noble, 
        the beautiful and the ugly, the happy and the miserable, all passing 
        according to their deeds. He knew that these good individuals, by evil 
        deeds, words, and thoughts, by reviling the Noble Ones, by being 
        misbelievers, and by conforming themselves to the actions of the 
        misbelievers, after the dissolution of their bodies and after death, had 
        been born in sorrowful states. He knew that these good individuals, by 
        good deeds, words, and thoughts, by not reviling the Noble Ones, by 
        being right believers, and by conforming themselves to the actions of 
        the right believers, after the dissolution of their bodies and after
