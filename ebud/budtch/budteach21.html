      and good Kamma by his various religious and social deeds. Owing to his 
      good Reproductive Kamma he was born in a heavenly blissful state. 
      Tradition says that he will have his last birth in the time of the future 
      Buddha Metteyya. His evil Kamma cannot, therefore, successfully operate 
      owing to his favourable birth.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      legitimate heir to the throne may not perhaps be raised to that exalted 
      position if he happens to be physically deformed. Beauty, on the other 
      hand, will be an asset to the possessor. A good-looking son of a poor

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Of these beneficent and 
      maleficent forces the most important is effort <I>(Payoga). </I>In the 
      working of Kamma effort or lack of effort plays a great part. By present 
      effort one can create fresh Kamma, new surroundings, new environment, and 
      even a new world. Though placed in the most favourable circumstances and 
      provided with all facilities, if one makes no strenuous effort, one not

      effort to cure himself of a disease or to save himself from his 
      difficulties, or to strive with diligence for his progress, his evil Kamma

      contrary, he endeavours on his part to surmount his difficulties, to 
      better his circumstances, to make the best use of the rare opportunities, 
      to strive strenuously for his real progress, his good Kamma will come to 
      his succour.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      Kamma that give consolation, hope, reliance, and moral courage to a 
      Buddhist.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When the unexpected 
      happens, difficulties, failures, and misfortunes confront him, the 
      Buddhist realizes that he is reaping what he has sown, and is wiping off a 
      past debt. Instead of resigning himself, leaving everything to Kamma, he 
      makes a strenuous effort to pull out the weeds and sow useful seeds in 
      their place, for the future is in his hands.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">He who believes in 
      Kamma, does not condemn even the most corrupt, for they have their chance 
      to reform themselves at any moment. Though bound to suffer in woeful 
      states, they have the hope of attaining eternal peace. By their deeds they 
      create their own hells, and by their own deeds they can also create their 
      own heavens.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">A Buddhist who is fully 
      convinced of the law of Kamma does not pray to another to be saved but 
      confidently relies on himself for his emancipation. Instead of making any 
      self-surrender, or propitiating any supernatural agency, he would rely on 
      his own will-power and work incessantly for the weal and happiness of all.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">This belief in Kamma, 
      &quot;validates his effort and kindles his enthusiasm,&quot; because it teaches 
      individual responsibility.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">To an ordinary Buddhist 
      Kamma serves as a deterrent, while to an intellectual it serves as an 
      incentive to do good.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">This law of Kamma 
      explains the problem of suffering, the mystery of the so-called fate and 
      predestination of some religions, and above all the inequality of mankind.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">We are the architects 
      of our own fate. We are our own creators. We are our own destroyers. We 
      build our own heavens. We build our own hells.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">What we think, speak 
      and do, become our own. It is these thoughts, words, and deeds that assume 
      the name of Kamma and pass from life to life exalting and degrading us in 
      the course of our wanderings in Sams&#257;ra.</SPAN></FONT></P>
