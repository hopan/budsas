        From the foot of the <I>R&#257;j&#257;yatana </I>tree the Buddha proceeded to the
        <I>Ajap&#257;la </I>banyan tree and as He was absorbed in solitary meditation 
        the following thought occurred to Him.</SPAN></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        &quot;This Dhamma which I have realized is indeed profound, difficult to 
        perceive, difficult to comprehend, tranquil, exalted, not within the 
        sphere of logic, subtle, and is to be understood by the wise. These 
        beings are attached to material pleasures. This causally connected 
        'Dependent Arising' is a subject which is difficult to comprehend. And 
        this Nibb&#257;na -- the cessation of the conditioned, the abandoning of all 
        passions, the destruction of craving, the non-attachment, and the 
        cessation -- is also a matter not easily comprehensible. If I too were 
        to teach this Dhamma, the others would not understand me. That will be 
        wearisome to me, that will be tiresome to me.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        Then these wonderful verses unheard of before occurred to the Buddha:</SPAN></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        &quot;With difficulty have I comprehended the Dhamma. There is no need to 
        proclaim it now. This Dhamma is not easily understood by those who are 
        dominated by lust and hatred. The lust-ridden, shrouded in darkness, do 
        not see this Dhamma, which goes against the stream, which is abstruse, 
        profound, difficult to perceive and subtle.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">As 
        the Buddha reflected thus, he was not disposed to expound the Dhamma.</SPAN></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        Thereupon Brahma <I>Sahampati </I>read the thoughts of the Buddha, and, 
        fearing that the world might perish through not hearing the Dhamma, 
        approached Him and invited Him to teach the Dhamma thus:</SPAN></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;O 
        Lord, may the Exalted One expound the Dhamma! May the Accomplished One

        understand the Dhamma.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>

        Dhamma understood by the Stainless One! Just as one standing on the 
        summit of a rocky mountain would behold the people around, even so may 
        the All-Seeing, Wise One ascend this palace of Dhamma! May the 
        Sorrowless One look upon the people who are plunged in grief and are

        When he appealed to the Buddha for the third time, the Exalted One, out

          The Buddha uttered these words because He attained Enlightenment by 
          Himself without the aid of a teacher. He had teachers before His 
          Enlightenment, but nobody taught Him the way to attain Buddhahood. It 
          is therefore not correct to say that Buddhism is a natural outgrowth 
          of Hinduism.</SPAN></FONT>
