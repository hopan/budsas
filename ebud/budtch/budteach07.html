      Buddha was thus the first religious teacher to send His enlightened 
      ordained disciples to propagate the doctrine out of compassion for others. 
      With no permanent abode, alone and penniless, these first missioners were 
      expected to wander from place to place to teach the sublime Dhamma. They 
      had no other material possessions but their robes to cover themselves and 
      an alms-bowl to collect food. As the field was extensive and the workers 
      were comparatively few they were advised to undertake their missionary 
      journeys alone. As they were Arahants who were freed from all sensual 
      bonds their chief and only object was to teach the Dhamma and proclaim the 
      Holy Life <I>(Brahmacariya). </I>The original role of Arahants, who 
      achieved their life's goal, was to work for the moral upliftment of the 
      people both by example and by precept. Material development, though 
      essential, was not their concern.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      Ones as the nucleus the Buddha founded a celibate Order which &quot;was 
      democratic in constitution and communistic in distribution.&quot; The original 
      members were drawn from the highest status of society and were all 
      educated and rich men, but the Order was open to all worthy ones, 
      irrespective of caste, class or rank. Both young and old belonging to all 
      the castes, were freely admitted into the Order and lived like brothers of 
      the same family without any distinction. This Noble Order of Bhikkhus,

      approached him first and sought his permission to spend the night in his 
      fire-chamber where dwelt a fierce serpent-king. By His psychic powers the 
      Buddha subdued the serpent. This pleased <I>Uruvela Kassapa </I>and he 
      invited the Buddha to stay there as his guest. The Buddha was compelled to 
      exhibit His psychic powers on several other occasions to impress the 
      ascetic, but still he adhered to the belief, that the Buddha was not an 
      Arahant as he was. Finally the Buddha was able to convince him that he was

      far from R&#257;jagaha in the village Upatissa, also known as N&#257;laka, there 
      lived a very intelligent youth named <I>S&#257;riputta </I>(-- son of S&#257;ri).</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Since 
      he belonged to the leading family of the village, he was also called <I>
      Upatissa.</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
      Though nurtured in Brahmanism, his broad outlook on life and matured 
      wisdom compelled him to renounce his ancestral religion for the more 
      tolerant and scientific teachings of the Buddha Gotama. His brothers and 
      sisters followed his noble example. His father, <I>Vanganta, </I>
      apparently adhered to the Brahmin faith. His mother, who was displeased 
      with the son for having become a Buddhist, was converted to Buddhism by 
      himself at the moment of his death.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
      Upatissa </SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">was brought up in the lap of 
      luxury. He found a very intimate friend in Kolita, also known as 
      Moggall&#257;na, with whom he was closely associated from a remote past. One 
      day as both of them were enjoying a hill-top festival they realized how 
      vain, how transient, were all sensual pleasures. Instantly they decided to 
      leave the world and seek the Path of Release. They wandered from place to 
      place in quest of Peace.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
      two young seekers went at first to <I>Sañjaya,</I> who had a large 
      following, and sought ordination under him. Before long they acquired the 
      meager knowledge which their master imparted to them, but dissatisfied 
      with his teachings -- as they could not find a remedy for that universal 
      ailment with which humanity is assailed -- they left him and wandered 
      hither and thither in search of Peace. They approached many a famous 
      brahmin and ascetic, but disappointment met them everywhere. Ultimately 
      they returned to their own village and agreed amongst themselves that 
      whoever would first discover the Path should inform the other.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It 
      was at that time that the Buddha dispatched His first sixty disciples to 
      proclaim the sublime Dhamma to the world. The Buddha Himself proceeded 
      towards Uruvel&#257;, and the Venerable <I>Assaji,</I> one of the first five 
      disciples, went in the direction of R&#257;jagaha.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
      good Kamma of the seekers now intervened, as if watching with sympathetic 
      eyes their spiritual progress. For <I>Upatissa, </I>while wandering in the 
      city of R&#257;jagaha, casually met an ascetic whose venerable appearance and 
      saintly deportment at once arrested his attention. This ascetic's eyes 
      were lowly fixed a yoke's distance from him, and his calm face betokened 
      deep peace within him. With body well composed, robes neatly arranged, 
      this venerable figure passed with measured steps from door to door, 
      accepting the morsels of food which the charitable placed in his bowl. 
      Never before have I seen, he thought to himself, an ascetic like this. 
      Surely he must be one of those who have attained Arahantship or one who is 
      practising the path leading to Arahantship. How if I were to approach him 
      and question, &quot;For whose sake, Sire, have you retired from the world? Who 
      is your teacher? Whose doctrine do you profess?&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
      Upatissa, </SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">however, refrained from 
      questioning him as he thought he would thereby interfere with his silent 
      begging tour.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
      Arahant <I>Assaji, </I>having obtained what little he needed, was seeking 
      a suitable place to eat his meal. <I>Upatissa </I>seeing this, gladly 
      availed himself of the opportunity to offer him his own stool and water 
      from his own pot. Fulfilling thus the preliminary duties of a pupil, he 
      exchanged pleasant greetings with him and reverently inquired:--</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
      &quot;Venerable Sir, calm and serene are your organs of sense, clean and clear 
      is the hue of your skin. For whose sake have you retired from the world? 
      Who is your teacher? Whose doctrine do you profess?&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
      unassuming Arahant <I>Assaji </I>modestly r<B>e</B>plied, as is the 
      characteristic of all great men -- &quot;I am still young in the Order, 
      brother, and I am not able to expound the Dhamma to you at length.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;I am<I> 
      Upatissa, </I>Venerable Sir. Say much or little according to your ability, 
      and it is left to me to understand it in a hundred or thousand ways&quot;.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">&quot;Say

      no avail.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
      Venerable <I>Assaji </I>uttered a four line stanza, thus skilfully summing

      Upatissa </SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">was sufficiently enlightened to 
      comprehend such a lofty teaching though succinctly expressed. He was only 
      in need of a slight indication to discover the truth. So well did the 
      Venerable <I>Assaji </I>guide him on his upward path that immediately on 
      hearing the first two lines, he attained the first stage of Sainthood, <I>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
      new convert <I>Upatissa </I>must have been, no doubt, destitute of words 
      to thank to his heart's content his venerable teacher for introducing him 
      to the sublime teachings of the Buddha. He expressed his deep 
      indebted-ness for his brilliant exposition of the truth, and obtaining 
      from him the necessary particulars with regard to the Master, took his 
      leave.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
      Later, the devotion he showed towards his teacher was such that since he

      clasped hands in an attitude of reverent obeisance and in that direction

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Now, 
      in accordance with the agreement, he returned to his companion <I>Kolita
      </I>to convey the joyful tidings. <I>Kolita, </I>who was as enlightened as 
      his friend, also attained the first stage of Sainthood on hearing the 
      whole stanza. Overwhelmed with joy at their successful search after Peace, 
      as in duty bound, they went to meet their teacher <I>Sañjaya </I>with the 
      object of converting him to the new doctrine. Frustrated in their attempt
      <I>Upatissa </I>and <I>Kolita, </I>accompanied by many followers of<I>
