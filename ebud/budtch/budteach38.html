      grasping<I> (up&#257;d&#257;na), </I>Kamma, and physical food of the present life. 
      On account of these five causes this so-called being has arisen, and as

      becomes even-minded, religious fervour increases, mindfulness becomes

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Majjhima Nik&#257;ya 
      also relates an interesting discussion between the Buddha and Vacchagotta

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Vacchagotta, a 
      wandering ascetic, approached the Buddha and questioned:</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;But, Gotama, where 
      is the Bhikkhu who is delivered of mind reborn?</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He was of course 
      referring to the Arahant.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha replied<I>:--</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;Vaccha, to say that 
      he is reborn would not fit the case.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;Then, Gotama, he is 
      not reborn.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;Vaccha, to say that 
      he is not reborn would not<B> </B>fit the case.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;Then<B>, </B>
      Gotama, he is both reborn and not reborn.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;Vaccha, to say that 
      he is both reborn and not reborn would not<B> </B>fit the case.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;Then, Gotama, he is 
      neither reborn nor not reborn.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;Vaccha, to say that 
      he is neither reborn nor not reborn would not fit the case.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Vaccha was baffled on<B>
      </B>hearing these seemingly inconsistent answers, and, in his confusion, 
      exclaimed:</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;Gotama, I am at a 
      loss to think in this matter, and I have become greatly confused.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;Enough, O Vaccha. 
      Be not at a loss to think in this matter, and be not greatly confused. 
      Profound, O Vaccha, is this doctrine, recondite and difficult of 
      comprehension, good, excellent, and not to be reached by mere reasoning, 
      subtle and intelligible only to the wise and it is a hard</SPAN></I>
      <I>doctrine for you to learn, who belong to another sect, to another 
      faith, to another persuasion, to another discipline, and who sit at the 
      feet of another teacher. Therefore, O Vaccha, I shall now question you, 
      and do you make answer as may seem to you good. What think you, Vaccha? 
      Suppose a fire were to burn in front of you, would you be aware that fire 
      was burning in front of you?</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;Gotama, if a fire 
      were to burn in front of me, I should be aware that a fire was burning in 
      front of me.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;But<B> </B>suppose, 
      Vaccha, someone were to ask you: On</SPAN></I> <I>what 
      does this fire that is burning in front of you depend?' What would you 
      answer, Vaccha ?</I></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;I would answer, O 
      Gotama, 'it is on fuel of grass and wood that this fire burning in front 
      of me depends.'</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;But Vaccha, if the 
      fire in front of you were to become extinct, would you be aware that the 
      fire in front of you had become extinct ?</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;Gotama, if the fire 
      in front of me were to become extinct, I should be aware that the fire in 
      front of me had become extinct.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;But, Vacca, if 
      someone were to ask you -- 'In what direction has that fire gone, East or 
      West, North or South?' What would you say, Vaccha?</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;The question would 
      not fit the case, Gotama, for the fire depended on fuel of grass and wood, 
      and when that fuel has all gone, and it can get no other, being thus 
      without nutriment, it is said to be extinct.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;In exactly the same 
      way, Vaccha, all forms, sensations, perceptions, mental activities, and 
      consciousness have been abandoned, uprooted, made like a palmyra stump, 
      become extinct, and not liable to spring up in the future.</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;The Saint, O 
      Vaccha, who has been released from what are styled the Five Aggregates, is 
      deep, immeasurable like the mighty ocean. To say that he is reborn would 
      not fit the case. To say that he is not reborn would not fit the case. To 
      say that he is neither reborn nor not reborn would not fit the case.&quot;</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One cannot say that the 
      Arahant is reborn as all passions that condition rebirth are eradicated, 
      nor can one say that the Arahant is annihilated, for there is nothing to 
      annihilate.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Robert Oppenheimer, a 
      scientist, writes:-</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;If we ask, for 
      instance, whether the position of the electron remains the same, we must 
      say 'no', if we ask wether the electron's position changes with time, we 
      must say 'no'; if we ask whether it is in motion, we must say 'no.'</SPAN></I></FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;The Buddha has 
      given such answers when interrogated as to the condition of man's self 
      after death. </FONT><A HREF="#_edn14" NAME="_ednref14" TITLE>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Nibb&#257;na, it may safely 
      be concluded, is obtained by the complete cessation of the defilements <I>

      expressed in words.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">From a metaphysical 
      standpoint, Nibb&#257;na is complete deliverance from suffering. From a 
      psychological standpoint, Nibb&#257;na is the eradication of egoism. From an 
      ethical standpoint, Nibb&#257;na is the destruction of lust, hatred and
