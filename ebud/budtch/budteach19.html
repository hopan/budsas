      whether mental, verbal, or physical is regarded as Kamma. It covers all 
      that is included in the phrase: &quot;Thought, word and deed&quot;. Generally 
      speaking, all good and bad actions constitute Kamma. In its ultimate sense 
      Kamma means all moral and immoral volition <I>(kusala akusala cetan&#257;). </I>
      Involuntary, unintentional or unconscious actions, though technically 
      deeds, do not constitute Kamma, because volition, the most important 
      factor in determining Kamma, is absent. </FONT>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Every volitional action 
      of persons, except those of Buddhas and Arahants, is called Kamma. An 
      exception is made in their case because they are delivered from both good 
      and evil. They have eradicated both ignorance and craving, the roots of 
      Kamma. &quot;Destroyed are their (germinal) seeds <I>(kh&#299;na-bij&#257;), </I>selfish 
      desires no longer grow,&quot; states the Ratana Sutta. This does not mean that 
      the Buddhas and Arahants are passive. They are tirelessly active in 
      working for the real well-being and happiness of all. Their deeds, 
      ordinarily accepted as good or moral, lack creative power as regards 
      themselves. Understanding things as they truly are, they have finally 
      shattered their cosmic fetters -- the chain of cause and effect.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      burnt if one gets another to put his hand into the fire. Moreover 
      unintentional actions would be much worse than intentional wrong actions, 
      for, according to the comparison, a man who touches fire without knowing 
      that it would burn is likely to be more deeply burnt than the man who 
      knows.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      blessings and curses conferred on his creation by an omniscient and 
      omnipotent Divine Ruler, who sits in heaven above controlling the 
      destinies of the human race. Buddhism that emphatically denies an 
      arbitrarily created immortal soul, believes in natural law and justice 
      which cannot be suspended by either an Almighty God, or an 
      All-compassionate Buddha. According to this natural law, acts bring their

      psyche,&quot; writes a certain psychoanalyst, &quot;but usually inaccessible and to 
      be reached only by some, is the whole record, without exception, of every 
      experience the individual has passed through, every influence felt, every 
      impression received. The subconscious mind is not only an indelible record 
      of individual experiences but also retains the impress of primeval 
      impulses and tendencies, which so far from being outgrown as we fondly 
      deem them in civilized man, are subconsciously active and apt to break out 
      in disconcerting strength at unexpected moments.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>

      the same assertion with a vital modification. Not stored within any 
      postulatory &quot;psyche&quot;, for there is no proof of any such receptacle or 
      store-house in this ever-changing complex machinery of man, but dependent 
      on the individual psycho-physical continuity or flux is every experience 
      the so-called being has passed through, every influence felt, every 
      impression received, every characteristic -- divine, human, or brutal-- 
      developed. In short the entire Kammic force is dependent on the dynamic

      mind and matter it rests manifesting itself at the opportune moment, just 
      as mangoes are not said to be stored somewhere in the mango tree, but 
      dependent on the mango tree they lie, springing up in due season. </FONT>
