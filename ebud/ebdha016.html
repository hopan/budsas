10 February 2531 (1988) at Suan Mokkhabalarama.)</p>
<HR>
<br/>
<p>Today, we'll talk about the thing called &quot;prison.&quot;

This should help us to understand the thing called

&quot;life&quot; better. Then, we'll know Dhamma better, which

will help us to live life without dukkha (dissatisfaction, pain,

stress, suffering). So today we'll talk about the thing called

&quot;prison.&quot; Please prepare your minds to listen

carefully.</p>



<p>Wherever the conditions and signs of prison exist, right there

is dukkha. You should observe that all the forms and types of

dukkha have a quality of prison about them. Being captured,

incarcerated, enchained, and put through difficulties and

hassles, are characteristics of dukkha. If you understand this,

then you will understand more clearly the meaning of what we call

&quot;upadana&quot; (clinging, attachment). Wherever there is

upadana, right there is a prison. This thing &quot;upadana&quot;

itself brings about the conditions of imprisonment.</p>



<p>Wherever there is upadana, right there is bondage. The bondage

may be positive or negative; both are equally binding. By

regarding things and clinging to them as &quot;I&quot; or

&quot;mine,&quot; bondage occurs. When bound to something, we get

stuck in it, just like being stuck in prison.</p>



<p>All of the Dhamma principles of Buddhism can be summarized:

upadana is the cause of dukkha; dukkha is born out of upadana. We

all must understand this matter of upadana well. To make it easy

to understand, we must see it clearly as being just like a prison

-- a mental prison, a spiritual prison. We come to study Dhamma

and develop samadhi (mental stability and calm) and vipassana

(insight) in order to destroy upadana. Or, if we speak

metaphorically, we study Dhamma and develop the mind in order to

destroy the prison that now traps us.</p>



<p>We're speaking about a mental or spiritual prison, but it has

the same meaning as a concrete prison. It's just like the

physical prisons that people are caught in everywhere, but now

we're speaking of a purely spiritual prison. This prison's a bit

odd, or extraordinary, in that we can't see its substance with

our eyes. What's even more extraordinary is that people volunteer

to get locked up in this prison. People are actually delighted to

go and get locked up in spiritual prison. This is a very queer

aspect of the spiritual prison.</p>



<h2>Freedom is Salvation from Prison</h2>



<p>You must recall the words &quot;salvation&quot; or

&quot;liberation&quot; that are used in all religions. The final

goal of all religions is salvation, or emancipation, or whatever

word is most suitable in each language. But all these words have

the same meaning -- getting saved. All religions teach salvation.

Yet, from what are we saved? We are saved from spiritual prison.

The thing that all of you want and need even right at this moment

is the thing called &quot;freedom&quot; or &quot;liberty,&quot;

which is, simply, escape from prison. Whether a physical,

material prison or a mental, spiritual prison, the meaning is the

same. In all cases, we want freedom.</p>



<p>Those who lack wisdom can see and fear only the physical,

material prisons. But those who have the wisdom (pa��a) to look

more deeply will see how much more terrifying and dangerous the

spiritual prison is. Really, we can see that hardly anybody is

locked up in the ordinary jails, while everyone in the world is

caught in the spiritual prison. For instance, every one of you

sitting here is free of the ordinary prison, but you all are

incarcerated in the spiritual prison. That which drives us to be

interested in Dhamma, to come to study Dhamma, to practice mental

development, is the oppression and force of being caught in this

spiritual prison. Whether you feel it or not isn't important. It

forces us, no matter what, to struggle and search for a way out

of spiritual imprisonment. Nonetheless, it's forcing all of you,

whether you realize it or not, to find spiritual freedom. So you

come looking here and other such places.</p>



<p>Although that which imprisons us is only one thing, namely,

upadana all by itself, this prison takes on many different forms.

There are dozens of styles and kinds of prison. If we take the

time to study every type of prison, it will help us to understand

this phenomenon much better. Then we will understand upadana

better, and we also will better understand tanha (craving) and

kilesa (defilements of mind) which, according to the Buddhist

teaching, cause dukkha. We will understand the issue of dukkha if

we understand the issue of prison clearly and thoroughly.</p>



<p>I'd like to advise that you use this word &quot;upadana&quot;

instead of &quot;attachment&quot;or any other English

translation. Those English words are constantly being

misunderstood. You may not understand it fully at this time, but

try to use this word upadana to accustom your mouth, your mind,

and your feelings to it. </p>



<p>We must realize that the heart of Buddhism is to wipe out

upadana. The heart of Buddhism is that which gets rid of upadana,

or cut it out. Then there is no prison, and then there is no

dukkha.</p>



<p>You must take the meaning of the English words attachment,

grasping, and clinging, then combine them to get the meaning of

&quot;upadana.&quot; It's better for us to use the word upadana.

Its meaning is broader and it will enable us to look into this

matter more deeply and extensively.</p>



<h2>The Single Essence of Buddhism</h2>



<p>It may be just one simple word, but upadana is the most

important thing. The heart of Buddhism is just to uproot or cut

out this upadana. Then dukkha will be finished. Please understand

that this is the heart of all Buddhism, it is found in every sect

and school. Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism, Zen Buddhism,

Tibetan Buddhism, whatever kind of Buddhism you like, they're

different only in name or in the external ceremonies and

practices. But inside it's all the same thing: the cutting off of

upadana. </p>



<p>Don't be sad, don't be disappointed or anxious, don't make

trouble for yourself thinking that you haven't been able to study

all the schools of Buddhism. Don't worry if you haven't been able

to study Buddhism in Tibet, in Sri Lanka, in Burma, in China, or

anywhere. That's a waste of time. There is just a single essence

or heart of it all, namely, to eliminate upadana. The labels

Theravada, Mahayana, Zen, Tibetan, and Chinese reflect only the

outer covers of what seems to be different kinds of Buddhism. If

there are any differences they are merely surface or superficial

ones, just a bunch of accumulated rites and rituals. The true

heart of the matter, the heart of all Buddhism, is the same

everywhere: the uprooting and cutting out of upadana. </p>



<p>So just study this one thing. Don't waste time being sad or

thinking that you haven't studied all the different kinds of

Buddhism. Study this single matter of the cutting off of upadana,

that is enough.</p>



<p>If you really want to know Mahayana Buddhism like an expert,

then you'll have to go and learn Sanskrit. You can spend almost

your entire life trying to learn Sanskrit and still not really

know anything. Or if you want to know Zen well, then you have to

learn Chinese. Spend your whole life learning Chinese and in the

end you still won't know Zen. To know Vajrayana, the Buddhism of

Tibet, you'll have to learn Tibetan. Just learning the languages

will cost almost your whole life, yet you won't really have

learned anything. </p>



<p>You still haven't gotten into the heart of Buddhism. These are

just superficialities conjured up as new developments. Understand

the heart of it all and learn just this one thing: the cutting

off of upadana. Then you'll know the essence of Buddhism, whether

it is labeled Mahayana, Theravada, Zen, or Vajrayana. Whether its

from China, Japan, Korea, or anywhere else, it's all in one

place: cutting out upadana.</p>



<p>Even in the single school of Theravada Buddhism there are many

different forms. There are many different ways of mental

cultivation, too. There's the kind of meditation from Burma,

where they watch the rising and falling of the abdomen. There are

the kinds based on the mantras &quot;Samma Araham&quot; and

&quot;Buddho, Buddho,&quot; as well as all other kinds of

different things. But if it's correct, the heart of each is

always in exactly the same place: the need to eradicate upadana.

If it hasn't gotten to the elimination of upadana, it isn't the

real thing yet. And it won't be of any use or benefit, either.

Why not be interested in the matter of cutting off upadana, or,

if we speak metaphorically, destroying the prison? So it's best

if we speak about this prison.</p>



<h3>Discover It Inside</h3>



<p>To speak most correctly, we really can't learn from

scriptures, from techniques, or from those various teachings if

we are to be truly successful. To successfully reap any real

benefits, we must learn in the thing itself, namely, the actual

prison. Study the actual dukkha in itself, that prison itself. So

we'd better look for and find this prison.</p>



<p>At this point, we are confronted by two choices: are you going

to learn from the outside or are you going to learn from the

inside? The distinction is crucial. The Buddha said that we must

study from inside. The external learning is from books,

ceremonies, practices, and things like that. Everything that we

must learn, the Tathagata has explained in terms of the body

which is still alive. That means a living body, with a living

mind, not a dead one. That's where real learning takes place, so

learn there. Learn from that inside, which means learn within

yourself while still alive, before you die. External studies,

learning from books and all those different ceremonies and

rituals, hasn't really accomplished anything of value. So let's

study inside. Please remember these words &quot;learn

inside.&quot;</p>



<p>Training in samadhi and vipassana (concentration and insight),

that is, developing mindfulness with breathing

(anapanasati-bhavana) as we have been doing here, is this

learning inside. To do this inner study takes a fairly good

amount of patience and endurance, but not too much. Actually, in

comparison with some of the things other people are practicing,

such as high level sports, gymnastics, and acrobatics, training

in samadhi and vipassana is less difficult. Yet people have

enough endurance and perseverance to be able to do such things.

Just have moderate endurance and we will be able to train with

samadhi and vipassana, through mindfulness with breathing. Some

people can't take it, and have run away already. We have had

enough endurance to get this far, and if we continue a bit more,

then we'll be able to do it and we'll receive the proper

benefits. So, please, apply yourself to this inner study and do

so with sufficient patience and endurance.</p>



<h3>Life Itself Is Prison</h3>



<p>Using metaphors makes it easier for us to understand the

matter we're discussing. So we will make use of them here today.

The first prison which you must look for and see is life itself.

If you look on life as a prison, and see the prison that it is,

then we must say that you know the truth of nature quite well.

Most people, however, look on life as something enjoyable, as an

opportunity to have fun. They are willing to live for the

enjoyment of life. They then become infatuated with and engrossed

in life, which is what turns it into prison.</p>



<p>If we see life as a prison, then we must have seen the upadana

in this life. If we haven't seen the upadana in life, we won't

see that life is a prison and we'll be content to think that this

life is heaven instead. This is because there are so many things

in life that satisfy us, that trick us and engross us; however,

in anything that we find satisfying, agreeable, attractive, and

infatuating there will be upadana as well. That thing becomes a

prison. However much we love something, it becomes at least that

much a prison because of upadana. This is a positive kind of

upadana. As soon as we hate something, or dislike something, that

becomes a negative kind of upadana, which is a prison just the

same. To be beguiled and misled, either by the positive or by the

negative, is a prison both ways. And that prison turns life into

dukkha.</p>



<p>In addition, one will be able to see that when there is

upadana in life, then life becomes a prison. And so, when there

is no upadana, then life is not a prison at all. You can see this

right now, here, whether or not there is upadana in your life?

&quot;Is my life a prison or not? Am I living in a prison of

upadana, or not?&quot; Each of you must look very carefully into

your own hearts and see absolutely clearly whether life is a

prison for you or not. Have you got a prison or not? Are you

living in a prison or not? Otherwise, why are we coming here to

meditate, to cultivate the mind? In essence, the true goal and

purpose of mental development is the destruction of our prisons.

Whether your studies and practice are successful, whether you can

destroy the prison or not, is another question. Nonetheless, our

real aim and purpose is to destroy the prison of life.</p>



<p>Consider this carefully. If we don't recognize upadana, we are

caught in prison without even recognizing the prison. We are

trapped in prison without knowing the prison at all. What's more,

we are satisfied and infatuated with that prison, just as we are

infatuated and satisfied with life. Because we are infatuated and

satisfied in life, we get caught in the prison of life. What are

we going to do that it won't be a prison? This is the question

that we must answer most carefully and correctly. </p>



<p>How are we to live so that life is not a prison? This means

that ordinarily, or naturally, life is not a prison, that we only

make it into a prison through upadana. Because of our own

ignorance, our own stupidity, our own lack of correct

understanding, we have upadana in life. Life then becomes a

prison for us. In Thai we have a phrase which is both crude and

critical, &quot;som nam na man,&quot; which means something like,

&quot;it serves you right.&quot; Life isn't a prison or any such

thing, but through our own stupidity we make upadana with

ignorance (avijja) and then there's the prison. What can we say

but &quot;som nam na man, it serves you right.&quot;</p>



<p>If you are successful in practicing anapanasati-bhavana

(mindfulness with breathing mind cultivation), you will

understand life well. You will know upadana well and you won't

have any upadana in this thing called &quot;life.&quot; Then any

prison that is happening dissolves and disappears, and new

prisons don't occur. This kind of life has the most value, but

who gets it or does not get it is another matter. Please try to

understand these facts as you ought to. This will motivate you to

apply yourselves with energy and patience to be able to destroy

the prison.</p>



<p>One way to look at these facts is to observe that life must

carry on according to the law of nature; or that we ourselves

must carry on in line with natural law. We must search for food,

must exercise, must rest and relax, must work to maintain and

support our lives: we must do these and all the other things that

you know so well. Not to do them is impossible. We're forced to

do them. This is a prison, too. The fact that we must always

follow the law of nature is a kind of prison. How are we going to

break out of this particular prison?</p>



<p>Why have we gotten caught in the prison of having to live

subject to the law of nature? This prison comes from our upadana

regarding ourselves, or regarding our lives. When there is

upadana toward ourselves, then &quot;I,&quot; the self is born.

This &quot;I&quot; is anxious about, it worries over, it is

frightened and afraid of, these natural duties, and so is made

miserable by them. These difficulties come from upadana. If we

had no upadana regarding &quot;I,&quot; then these necessary

duties would not be like a prison. We would be able to hunt for

our needs, earn a living, and exercise and care for the body,

without being miserable, if we didn't have any upadana toward

life. This is very subtle; it's a mystery for most people. This

is the subtlety of natural truth. How are we going to live so

that there's no dukkha connected with the fact that everything in

this life must be performed in line with the law of nature? </p>



<h3>The Instincts Are Prison</h3>



<p>The next prison to consider is that we live under the

influence of the instincts. We are under the instincts' power.

All living things, whether people, animals, or plants, have

instincts. These instincts constantly force us to follow their

concerns and needs. This is especially true for the sexual or

reproductive instinct. How much does it control, hassle,

activate, and complicate us? Sexual feelings and reproductive

urges squeeze us, oppress us, disturb us so profoundly; they

force us through all kinds of difficulties. But we can't stop.

Sometimes we prefer it this way. Our children grow and mature to

the stage where the sexual instinct ripens completely and then

the child is caught in the prison of this sexual instinct.</p>



<p>Finally, even the instinct of showing off can run our lives.

Many people wouldn't think of this as an instinct, but all

animals have it. The need to show off, to brag, to display

oneself is an instinct. Even animals have the condition of

wanting to show off that they are beautiful, or strong, or agile,

or whatever. Even this craziest, most ridiculous instinct is a

prison. We want to show off and boast. If it wasn't a prison, it

wouldn't force and oppress us in the least. Now, however, it

forces us to buy beautiful clothing, beautiful jewelry, beautiful

shoes even, and lots of them, too! </p>



<p>Why must we have many beautiful shirts and many pairs of

beautiful shoes? Why do we need them all? (And forgive me, we

must mention the women in particular here.) There is this

instinct to show off and it is one kind of prison. Because people

can't endure it, they are forced to follow this instinct,

spending all kinds of money on all kinds of things. The instinct

to show off is the funniest, most ridiculous of them all. Still

it truly is a prison. People never have enough money because of

this prison. Please consider and reflect carefully about these

examples of instincts which we have raised. They are prisons too.</p>



<p>If we think about this, if we make an account of all our

expenses, we'll discover that some people spend more money on

clothing, jewelry, and keeping themselves always beautiful than

they spend on food. Further, they insist on decorating and

prettying up their houses, which piles up their expenses. Taken

together, the two are more than they spend on food, which is

necessary for life. We put more money into things which are

unnecessary in life than we put into the necessities of life,

like food. This is one more way of getting caught in the

instinctual prison.</p>



<h3>The Senses Are Prison</h3>



<p>Next, we come to the most amusing prison, the prison that's

closest to us. There are these eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body,

and mind: the six ayatana, the six sense media or bases. They are

prisons, too. Take a slow, careful look at them. Listen carefully

in order to understand how our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body,

and mind -- all six of them -- become prisons.</p>



<p>In Pali we call them the ayatana. The root of this word

literally means &quot;tools or means for communicating with the

external world&quot; -- places, mechanisms, means, or whatever,

for contacting or communicating with the external world. We call

them &quot;ayatana.&quot; If you're willing, use this Pali word

&quot;ayatana.&quot; We aren't sure what to call them in English,

maybe &quot;sense media&quot; or &quot;connectors.&quot; All six

ayatana are prisons.</p>



<p>We have upadana towards life, regarding ourselves, which has

these six media for sensing, for experiencing, for communicating,

or for tasting and receiving sense objects. When there's upadana

regarding these six ayatana, we serve them and become their

slaves. We serve the eyes to gratify the eyes. We serve the ears

to gratify the ears. We serve the nose to satisfy the nose. We

serve the tongue to satiate the tongue. We serve the skin and

general body sense to make it comfortable. We serve the mind, the

mental sense, in order to soothe and comfort it. This means that

all our behavior is just for entertaining these ayatana.

Everything we do is for the sake of these six ayatana. We

surrender to them and become their slaves. Then, they squeeze and

control us, there's no avoiding them. We call this &quot;getting

caught in the prison of the ayatana.&quot;</p>



<p>Consider whether there is anyone, whether there are any of

you, who is not slavishly serving these six ayatana. And you

serve them willingly, don't you? You endure hardships and bend

over backwards in order to serve them, always looking for ways to

make the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind comfortable and

happy, in the most bound up way. So we must admit that we are

slaves. Those people who lack wisdom will certainly be slaves of

the ayatana, will keep getting caught in the prison of ayatana.

Through the correct and successful practice of mindfulness with

breathing, we can escape from the prison. If we practice

anapanasati incorrectly and incompletely, we will remain caught

in the ayatana prison for who knows how long.</p>



<h3>Superstition Is Prison</h3>



<p>For the next prison, we want to mention being deceived by the

thing known as &quot;saiyasatr&quot;. All the superstitious

formalities and beliefs are saiyasatr. The more ignorance there

is, the more one lacks correct knowledge, then the more trapped

one is in superstitious prisons. Now, education and science

(vidayasatr) have improved, which has led to a better

understanding of natural truths, and of all things. Still, there

remains too much entrapment in superstitious prisons. It's a

personal thing. Some people are caught very much and others not

so much. People are caught in different degrees and ways, but we

can say that there are still people caught in the prison of

saiyasatr, trapped by superstition. </p>



<p>Although in general superstition has diminished greatly due to

the progress of science, there is still quite a bit of saiyasatr

left in the temples and churches. Please forgive us for saying

so, but the place we can find superstition the most is in

churches, in the temples, and in those kinds of places. Although

superstition has lessened in general, there's a lot remaining in

such places. Wherever there are altars, wherever people bow down

and worship so-called sacred and holy things, there is the place

where the &quot;science of the sleeper&quot; persists.

Superstition, saiyasatr, is for people who are asleep. It's for

those who don't understand correctly, who are ignorant. We are

taught these things as children, before we have the intelligence

and ability to reason about them. Children believe whatever

they're told, and so &quot;adults&quot; teach them many

superstitious things. If you still feel that thirteen is an

unlucky number, that's saiyasatr. You're still sleeping. There

are many other examples of superstition, but we'd better not name

them. Some people might get offended. These kinds of things are

prisons. Why not look carefully enough to see them as such. Even

the number &quot;13&quot; becomes a prison when we're foolish.</p>



<h3>Sacred Institutions Are Prisons</h3>



<p>We should continue with those institutions or establishments

which are holy and sacred, or are famous and celebrated; or those

that are rumored to be so elite and prestigious that anyone who

becomes a member of one is prestigious, too. There are a number

of such places and institutions around. As soon as someone

registers as a member of that association or this organization,

that institute or this establishment, they start to get ideas and

feelings about it. They feel that &quot;we're better than

them&quot; or &quot;we're the ones who are right and the rest are

stupid.&quot; They grasp and cling without the least bit of

consideration or critical thinking. In this way, that

institution, even that church -- we can't avoid saying so --

becomes a prison. So we beg of you, don't think that Suan Mokkh

is some holy or miraculous institution, otherwise Suan Mokkh will

become a prison. Please don't turn Suan Mokkh into your prison.

You ought to think freely, examine carefully, evaluate

critically. Understand and believe only what is genuinely

beneficial. Don't get imprisoned in any of those prestigious or

famous institutions.</p>



<h3>Teachers Are Prison</h3>



<p>Now we come to the prison called &quot;ajahn&quot; (teacher,

master, guru), the famous teachers whose names reverberate afar.

In Burma there's &quot;Sayadaw This,&quot; in Sri Lanka there's

&quot;Bhante That,&quot; in Tibet there's &quot;Lama So- and

-so,&quot; in China there's &quot;Master Whoever.&quot; Every

place has its famous teacher whose name is bouncing around.

Whether national, regional, provincial, or local, every place has

got its Big Guru. Then people cling and attach to their teachers

as being the only teacher who is correct; their teacher is right

and all other teachers are completely wrong. They refuse to

listen to other people's teachers. And they don't think about or

examine the teachings of their own Ajahns. They get caught in the

&quot;Teacher Prison.&quot; They turn the teacher into a prison,

then get caught in it. It's an attachment which is truly

ridiculous. Whether a big teacher or a small teacher, it's

upadana just the same. They keep building prisons out of their

teachers and gurus. Please don't get caught in even this prison.</p>



<h3>Holy Things Are Prison</h3>



<p>The next prison is that of holy scriptures, which we can find

everywhere. Among those people where there isn't much wisdom,

these things are much clung to, and the more so as being

&quot;holy.&quot; They even become stand-ins or replacements for

God. It's as if merely bringing in the holy books is the same as

actually getting help. It leads to there being many kinds of holy

objects: sacred relics, holy water, and all kinds of sacred

things. Be most careful of this word &quot;holy.&quot; It will

become a prison before you know it. The more holy something is,

the more greatly it imprisons. Watch out for so-called

&quot;sacredness&quot; or &quot;holiness.&quot; </p>



<p>You ought to know that there is nothing more sacred than the

law of idappaccayata (the law of conditionality), the supreme

holiness higher than all things. Everything else is holy by

convention or by what people concoct themselves, which is holy

through upadana. Wherever there is holiness through upadana, that

holiness is a prison. The law of idappaccayata is sacred in

itself, without needing any attachment. There's no need for

upadana. It controls everything already and is truly holy all by

itself. Please don't get caught in the prison of holy things.

Don't make sacred things into a prison for yourself.</p>



<h3>Goodness Is Prison</h3>



<p>A further prison is one that is very important, one that

causes all sorts of problems. This prison is what they call

&quot;goodness.&quot; Everyone likes the &quot;good&quot; and

they all teach each other to do good. Then they worship what they

call &quot;good.&quot; But as soon as there is upadana mixed in

with what they call good, that good becomes a prison. You ought

to have good, have goodness, without having upadana. Then good

won't be prison. If there's upadana it becomes prison. Like we

say, they go crazy about good, they get drunk on good, they get

lost in good, until it turns into a problem. So be extremely

careful not to make goodness into a prison. But there's nothing

we can do to help now, everyone is caught in the prison of

goodness -- blindly, obliviously, trapped in the prison of good.</p>



<p>If you are a Christian, we request that you think and ponder

much about the teaching in the book of Genesis, where God forbids

Adam and Eve to eat the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of

Good and Evil. Don't go and eat it, or it will lead to knowing

how to discriminate between good and evil. Then it attaches with

upadana toward that good and evil. And then good and evil become

prisons. This teaching is very profound and good, most

intelligent and wise, but nobody seems to understand it. People

don't show much interest in it and thus can't be correct

Christians. If they were proper Christians they would not cling

with upadana to good and evil. We must not make either good or

evil into prisons. This means not getting caught in the prison of

goodness.</p>



<p>We swallowed that fruit and came to know good and evil, then

got caught and stuck in all the good and evil. We have had

continual problems ever since, that's how it came to be called

&quot;original sin,&quot; or sometimes &quot;perpetual sin.&quot;

It became the original prison, a perpetual prison. Please beware:

be careful not to get caught in this original prison, this

perpetual prison. Don't ever let yourself get caught in this

prison.</p>



<p>With being imprisoned in goodness, or the good, as soon as one

gets caught it carries on further all the way to the highest

good, to supreme goodness. Then the supreme goodness will become

that supreme prison. If it develops this way, then God will

become the supreme prison. May you understand and remember that

upadana builds prisons in this way.</p>



<h3>Views Are Prison</h3>



<p>The next prison is our own ditthi. The Pali word ditthi is

difficult to translate. Knowledge, thoughts, ideas, theories,

opinions, beliefs, understanding -- all these are ditthi. Ditthi

means all our personal thoughts, opinions, theories, and beliefs.

It isn't just certain opinions and little beliefs, it's all of

them, all views. Everything with which we view experience is

called ditthi. We are caught in a prison of our own views. We

don't obey anyone except our personal ditthi. This is a most

terrifying prison, because we impetuously, rashly, hastily sail

along according to our own personal views. We turn our backs on

and lose out to the things that ought to benefit us, because our

minds are closed to everything but our own ideas, beliefs, and

views. Thus, these views become a horrible prison that holds us

and locks us into just one way of understanding. Beware of the

prison of one's own <em>ditthi.</em></p>



<h3>Purity is the Highest Prison</h3>



<p>Next we come to a prison which is really strange and

marvelous; you could call it the &quot;highest prison.&quot; The

highest prison is what they call &quot;innocence&quot; or

&quot;purity.&quot; It's difficult to understand exactly what

they mean by these words. We hear all kinds of talk about

innocence and purity, but people never seem to know what they're

talking about. This purity is clung to and attached to, is

regarded as this and that, is worshipped, is used for show and

competition, is for boasting all over how pure &quot;I am.&quot;

But if there's <em>upadana</em> it's all just purity through

upadana, not genuine purity. There are many forms of purity that

are assumed out of clinging, such as, needing to take baths;

making incantations; being anointed, sprinkled, or dowsed with

who knows what; or any of the myriad rituals and ceremonies done

for &quot;purity.&quot; This purity is pure <em>upadana,</em> and

purity through attachment is a prison. Please don't get lost and

end up in the prison named &quot;purity.&quot;</p>



<p>It's something pitiful to see. Clinging to self so much, then

attaching to purity just as much, some religious creeds even go

so far as to teach some perpetual purity as some eternal soul

dwelling in some eternity, or some such thing. The whole thing

comes from grasping and clinging to purity through <em>upadana</em>

until one is caught in an eternal prison. It just ends up an

eternal prison.</p>



<h3>Voidness is Prison</h3>



<p>May we tell you that this is the last one, the final prison.

Escape from the prison of highest purity, break out of the purest

prison, into the voidness free of soul and self. Not having any

self, living free from self, voidness of self -- of any sense of

self, void of all ideas and notions about self -- is true purity.

Any purity which is truly eternal cannot be a prison in any

respect, unless people misunderstand and cling to it as some self

or soul, in which case it becomes a prison again. Let go

unequivocally, be absolutely free of self -- that is real purity.

It's no prison. Voidness is the purity which isn't a prison.</p>



<p>So it is that the real prison, the collection of all these

prisons that we have mentioned, is the thing they call

&quot;atta&quot; (in Pali), &quot;self,&quot; or

&quot;soul.&quot; Oneself is the prison. This self here is the

prison. Every kind of prison is included in, comes down to the

words &quot;oneself&quot; or &quot;myself.&quot; Clinging to self

as self, and then as belonging to self, attaching to

&quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine,&quot; this is the true prison, the

heart and soul of all prisons. All prisons are gathered in the

word <em>&quot;atta.&quot;</em> Tear out the foolishness that

creates <em>atta,</em> along with <em>atta</em> itself, and all

the prisons will be gone. If you practice <em>anapanasati</em>

(mindfulness with breathing in and out) correctly until truly

successful in it -- real, not imagined success -- you will

destroy all the prisons completely. That is, destroy atta, then

all the prisons are finished and we won't build any more of them

ever again. May you all experience success in destroying the

prisons, that is, <em>atta</em> or self.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The purpose of anapanasati is to remove all vestiges of

upadana regarding self. The complete removal of attachment toward

self is the final and perfect quenching of <em>dukkha,</em> which

happens to be the meaning of liberation, of salvation. The

highest goal of every religion is salvation, the value and

benefits of which are beyond words. So please try. <em>Anapanasati,</em>

when practiced correctly, leads to this liberation from <em>atta</em>.

I have been trying my best and I am willing to do whatever I can

to help everyone understand <em>anapanasati</em> and practice it

successfully, in order that all of us can escape from all aspects

of humanity's prison.&nbsp;</p>
