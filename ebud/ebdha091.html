  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sorry. You are wrong.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hinayana is an echo of a debate long dead, and the word
    should not be used about any Buddhist tradition - living or extinct. It is a most
    derogatory term. It does not simply mean &quot;Lesser vehicle&quot; as one often can see
    stated. It is worse than that. The second element of Hiina-yaana - that is yaana - means
    vehicle, OK. But Hiina very seldom has the simple meaning of 'lesser' or 'small'. If that
    had been the case, the Pali (or Sanskrit) texts would have used it as an opposite of Maha
    - big. But they don't. The opposite of Maha is Cuu.la, so this is the normal word for
    'small'. How then is 'Hiina' used? It signifies bad quality, and is found in quality
    gradations as &quot;Hiina - Majjhima - Pa.niita&quot; - that is: bad - medium - good.
    Hiina also means despicable, etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hinayana thus means 'The despicable vehicle', and has
    approximately the same value as calling an afro-american person a 'nigger' (according to
    an American person - as for myself, I am no American, so my sensibilities on this matter
    may be wrong).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">No sane Buddhist would profess following 'a despicable
    vehicle', and no polite Buddhist would say that a fellow Buddhist is doing so. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The term Hinayana is an echo of a debate long dead - or
    rather a debate where one of the debaters is dead and the other one is shouting to the
    winds. To make a long story short: When Mahayana developed, the adherents of the older
    schools criticized the Mahayanists, especially for creating new sutras. The Mahayanists on
    the other side reacted to that critique by accusing their opponents of not quite
    understanding the teaching of the Buddha. The debate got heated, and accusations flowed
    from both sides. Then some brilliant person at the Mahayana side of the debate created the
    word pair Mahayana/Hinayana, and it stuck. Hinayana became an excellent insult - with a
    simplicity and a parallellity to Mahayana that any fool could grasp (and still do).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So who were the opponents who were labeled Hinayana?
    Theravada? Probably not. At the time when Mahayana was created, Theravada had already
    'emigrated' to Sri Lanka, and could hardly be counted among the dominating schools on the
    Indian mainland - where most of the Mahayana/Hinayana debate took place. The most
    influential of the old schools at that time, was Sarvastivada, so they were the most
    probable - but hardly the only - targets for the 'Hinayana'-invectives.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now the Sarvastivada school is long dead, but the debate
    and the arguments found their way into the Mahayana sutras, as is apparent from the
    anti-Hinayana messages you found in the Lotus sutra. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But since the obsolete term Hinayana was deposited in the
    Mahayana sutras, the Mahayanists seem to feel obliged to use it. I have seen them use it
    in two ways. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of these is that they mistakenly think that Theravada
    - as the only of the old schools that still exist - is equal to Hinayana. This can be
    found in quite recent Mahayana literature.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The other is that the term Hinayana is reinterpreted in a
    most unhistorical way. Some say that it means a certain stage in the path of training, a
    stage to be respected, but also to be transcended. This is a highly unhistorical
    interpretation, but by using the term Hinayana in this way, Mahayanists in fact make
    Hinayana a part of Mahayana. How anyone can assert that 'a despicable vehicle' forms a
    part of their own training, is beyond me ... but I will leave it to those who so assert.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Theravada is alive and well. Hinayana belongs to an old
    and long dead debate that ought to be buried and forgotten a long time ago. (...)</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Below are some other common misconceptions
  which need clarification, edited from a thread of discussion in the <a
  href="mailto:dhamma-list@quantrum.com.my">dhamma-list@quantrum.com.my</a> mailing list in
  August 1999.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Buddhism is divided,
    mainly, in Hinayana (literally, the&nbsp; &quot;inferior vehicle &quot;) and Mahayana (the
    &quot;great vehicle&quot;). Vajrayana&nbsp; (the &quot;diamond&nbsp;&nbsp; vehicle&quot;)
    is a subsequent unfolding of Mahayana and appeared&nbsp; together with the development of
    Tantra. Buddhism in Tibet, in reality, is a combination of the three vehicles...&nbsp; The
    Hinayana way, also called Theravadin or &quot;the path of the elders&quot;, is a
    continuation of Primitive Buddhism. It emphasizes renunciation, ascetic purity and
    meditation on awareness. Its central concept is &quot;impermanence&quot;.</em></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">-- &quot;Literally&quot;, Hinayana means
    &quot;small or mean vehicle&quot; and consequently there&nbsp; is no school that accept
    that. There are here vestiges of regional disputes coming from the beginning of the
    millenium (even before year 0), that unfortunately remains till today due to ignorance
    and&nbsp; geographical distance. Hinayana was the name given by some within the Mahayana
    movement to designate some schools that preceded them.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">After the 2nd council (around 100 years after
    Buddha's demise), the original monastic Sangha underwent a process of successive division
    till it was split in around 18 different schools. They spread as much in doctrine as
    geographically, till, centuries later, a new doctrinal approach started to arise.
    Unfortunately, some people more enthusiastic within this new approach started to denigrate
    everything that have preceded them as being inferior while, at the same time
    self-applauding themselves. It's not the occasion here to consider how far they were right
    or wrong in their criticisms, however, the fact is that the Theravada, one of the 18
    ancient schools wasn't even significantly present in the region where those enthusiastic
    followers started to compare themselves with others (we should remember that maana&nbsp;
    -comparison with other - is one of the samyojanas that bind people to the samsara).
    Theravada was already established in Sri Lanka, while only in mainlaind India, schools
    like the Sarvastivada were the target of Mahayana attacks. Therefore to call Theravada as
    Hinayana is not only depreciative, but also historical ignorant.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It should be clear that technically neither
    mahayana nor vajrayana are &quot;schools&quot;, in the same sense that Theravada is a
    school. You can't compare them. As their names tell, they are yaanas and not vaadas, that
    is, they are vehicles, or as I rather would call them, they are &quot;movements&quot;,
    independent of such and such &quot;school&quot;. One can attend UCLA and be communist and
    another can attend New York University and be fascist. School are something different than
    philosophical affiliation. Zen, Gelug, Nyingma, Pure Land are schools, and within them we
    can find many hinayanists, mahayanically speaking. Besides, &quot;impermanence&quot;
    (anicca) is not a central concept of Theravada, but of <strong>all</strong> Buddhist
    schools. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">2. <em>The spiritual ideal of Hinayana is to
    reach liberation for oneself. It is exemplified in the Arahat figure, that attains the
    tranquility of nirvana and does not come anymore to the realm of birth and death, however
    it is not the complete Buddhahood but rather a state of saintity.</em> </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">-- Well, this is somehow funny to hear. The
    basic teaching of Theravada and of the attainment of arahathood is <strong>anatta</strong>
    (no-self). No-self means exactly that there is no absolute distinction between
    &quot;me&quot; and &quot;other&quot;. Then, someone comes and says that the arahant search
    for liberation for himself! So he finds no-self being very clear about his self! In
    reality, there is a large quantity of words whose original meaning were changed by the
    Mahayana schools. Words like arahant, buddha, bodhisattva, nibbaana (skr. nirvaa.na) have
    not the same technical meaning in the ancient schools (and therefore in the original
    Canon) as they have in mahayana works. That is a source of endless misunderstanding
    between the two, Mahayana and Theravada.</font></p>
