    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Cultivate the healing power of the pure
    unattached mind. -- Ruth Denison</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">M</font>y spiritual practice was
    inaugurated twenty years ago in the Mojave Desert. A friend drove me there -- ten hours
    south from Oakland, through the little town of Joshua Tree, and up the long desert slope
    to Copper Mountain Mesa where, halfway along a sandy dirt road, we came to a cluster of
    low buildings huddled under the killer sun. Here I first met Ruth Denison, a German-born
    woman trained in the Burmese tradition of Theravada Buddhism, whose flexibility and sense
    of what Westerners need in order to practice mindfulness had led her to a challenging
    teaching style grounded in traditional practice augmented with sometimes outrageously
    innovative techniques. She was known as an eccentric, who would employ any means to
    communicate her beloved &#147;Dharma&#148;; she was also the first Buddhist teacher to
    offer women-only retreats.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another person would have approached meditation gradually,
    carefully, beginning with short sessions of a few minutes each day and slowly graduating
    to longer periods of sitting -- the sane way to proceed. But I plunged in, signing up for
    a seven-day meditation retreat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the silence -- observed by everyone but Ruth, who gave
    a talk each evening -- I felt unseen, unacknowledged. At first this was excruciating, but
    as the week progressed, I found myself grateful to be experiencing my own livingness
    without the distraction of others&#146; opinions of me and responses to me. Sometimes a
    sadness would well up and I would feel warm tears running down my face; sometimes I felt a
    great wounded tenderness for myself, as if I watched a child struggling to accomplish a
    task too difficult; now and then an expansive peacefulness opened in my chest and I found
    myself smiling. The silence had become my friend.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Over the years, Ruth&#146;s meditation center -- named
    Dhamma Dena for a distinguished female teacher from the Buddha&#146;s lifetime
    (Dhammadinna) -- became the cradle in which my timid beginning attempts at awareness were
    rocked and nurtured. I learned that the practice Ruth taught, called Vipassana, or
    insight-meditation, came from the Theravada Buddhist tradition. Theravada is known as the
    gradual path, involving effort made through many lifetimes toward the goal of liberation
    from suffering. It emphasizes &#147;bare attention&#148; and &#147;choiceless
    awareness,&#148; teaching a method for being wholly present to one&#146;s own experience.
    Its practices lead to an apprehension of the three &#147;marks&#148; of existence:
    impermanence, suffering and the insubstantiality of the self.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Theravada Buddhism was brought to the United States mostly
    by Westerners, young people who studied in Burma or Thailand or Sri Lanka and brought the
    practice back to pass on to their peers in America. Ruth Denison, somewhat older than her
    counterparts, journeyed to Burma with her American husband, studied and practiced there,
    and received &#147;transmission&#148; from a noted Burmese Buddhist master. The teacher, U
    Ba Khin, told her to go back to the United States and teach meditation, but Ruth was
    modest, uncertain about her capacities. On her return to this country she steadily pursued
    her meditation practice, both alone and at Zen centers in Los Angeles (at that time there
    were no Theravada centers in southern California), but did not set out to teach. She and
    her husband hosted spiritual teachers in their Hollywood home, and were part of a circle
    of seekers that included Alan Watts and Timothy Leary. Eventually, students began to
    gather around Ruth and ask her to teach them to meditate. They followed her to the desert,
    and Dhamma Dena was born in several tiny buildings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the beginning of my visits to Dhamma Dena, the stark,
    spacious environment made a vibrant container for the practice. My memory holds many
    encounters with Ruth, like the morning in the early eighties when I was using the break
    after breakfast to hide away behind the work shed and write in my journal. (Reading and
    writing are discouraged at meditation retreats.) I was picking up my notebook and readying
    myself to leave when a long-skirted figure appeared from around the woodpile, her hair
    covered by a white scarf tucked up behind, her long-sleeved white blouse and tan skirt
    fluttering against her body in the wind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&#147;Ah, this is where you are hiding!&#148; said Ruth.
    She came to sit across from me on an upended milk carton.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Adjusting my now-stiffening buttocks on my makeshift seat
    of piled boards, I looked over at Ruth, who had picked up a piece of rusted metal and was
    examining it with the shrewd eye of one who knows how to recycle everything. I was feeling
    grumpy and tired, having struggled through the early morning meditation session and
    afterwards castigating myself that I was not really a very religious or spiritual person.
    She, on the other hand, had always been drawn to religious practice; as a child in Germany
    she was always devout. She was even attracted to her husband because he was so
    &#147;spiritual,&#148; having been a monk in the Hindu tradition of Vedanta. We began to
    talk about how Ruth was led to offer all-women retreats.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&#147;Certainly I am a woman who is not totally dependent
    on the man,&#148; Ruth said. &#147;Before I married I was very independent. I was a
    schoolteacher and a principal. When I married, I just took that wifely role for a while
    because I didn&#146;t need to work. But as you can see, I didn&#146;t stay in that role,
    so there is some blood in me. But I must say, I have one thing which is remarkable, which
    is, I have no need for revenge.&#148; (She had told us about her experiences during the
    war in Germany, when she was raped and violently handled, but she obviously harbors no
    bitterness.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ruth squinted against the sun, and looked up at me from
    deepset thoughtful blue eyes. &#147;In many ways I have brought good karma forces with me,
    with natural balance, with a sense of justice coming from a deeper soul or ground, and a
    great compassionate feeling. I have a love for life, hmmm?, which brings with it
    sensitivity and care, real care. So when you have that certain sense you cannot really
    charge back, no matter how wrong it was done to you. Because when you charge back, you see
    that you injure life. And the principle then is not injuring life.&#148;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">How to be present to life, to allow each life-form to
    realize its full cycle and potential. I felt something celebratory in this idea, some
    large and joyful possibility. Later I watched Ruth stride briskly away. In headlong
    flight, short, square-shouldered body tilted slightly forward, skirt billowing about her
    legs, little cap gleaming in the sun, Ruth looked like one of the factory women in a
    Kï¿½the Kollwitz lithograph, someone sturdy and strong-armed and reliable, whose life is
    labor. I stood thinking about the concept she articulated: To promote life, to nurture and
    celebrate it. Even my own life -- to get out of my way and enjoy the show.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I think about what I receive from Ruth. For some people I
    know, it has made sense to move from spiritual teacher to spiritual teacher, seeking out
    the yet-more-illumined guide who can take them the next step in their practice. For me,
    although I have sat with numerous teachers, it has made sense to stay loyal to one
    teacher, for I have understood over the years that a teacher is a mirror, reflecting one
    back to oneself. Staying with the same mirror over years has allowed me to see the
    patterns in myself and how they have changed. Ruth has remained herself, offering the
    teachings in the ways she has developed; I come to her each time experiencing her and
    myself differently, learning new things, going deeper.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we first came to the desert -- a ragtag band of young
    hippies, political activists, and fledgling healers in the early eighties -- Ruth had
    emphasized dukkha, the Buddha&#146;s First Noble Truth, the truth of suffering embedded in
    each moment of our human lives. I remembered learning that new word, rolling it on my
    tongue, and not wanting to admit its gritty truth. But over time, sitting in the small
    crowded zendo that was all we had then, I experienced the restlessness and anger and
    stubborn resistance that ruled my life, the insistence that things be other than they
    were, and I knew this to be dukkha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ruth taught us to redirect the urge to escape our
    suffering; she guided us into the sensations of each successive moment, trained us to
    bring our attention there and to simply watch our busy thoughts, our unruly emotions, and
    return again to attention to our sensory experience.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But for three years I resisted Ruth, realizing the value
    of what she taught but not yet ready to accept her guidance. I would sit in the meditation
    hall among the other meditators as she guided us, and I would argue with her in my mind. I
    criticized her, prayed that she would shut up and leave us alone, yearned for her to be
    more like other people and not so eccentrically herself. I would wait impatiently for her
    to do what she had said she would do, and when she did something unexpected instead, I
    would explode in an inner tantrum of rage and disappointment, as if she had personally
    betrayed me.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even so, the truth she was offering pierced through to me,
    and those glimpses so drew me, with their promise of freedom, that I came every year and
    sometimes twice a year, to retreats at Dhamma Dena. From a worldly perspective it would
    seem that I was wasting my time in a particularly perverse way, but on a spiritual path
    there is no such thing as wasted time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I was fighting Ruth in order to preserve the familiar,
    desire-ridden, out-of-control self that caused me so much suffering. It was a life and
    death struggle, for she threatened me with the death -- in any moment -- of my concepts
    and opinions and self-construction. I exerted all my power against her -- and made myself
    miserable -- to protect my little self-referential identity. I came to her because I could
    no longer bear to live in such a limited way, and yet I could not open to her. This
    existential struggle went on, as I said, for three years. The war raged in me, hurting me,
    stifling me, continually thwarting my efforts to concentrate and meditate and be simply
    present.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During those years I saw how much of my suffering is
    self-created; I experienced the tremendous power of my conditioned responses. Perhaps I
    could have continued my internal war for decades, if I had not found myself utterly
    without money as a retreat-session drew near. I telephoned Dhamma Dena and explained my
    predicament. Was there a way, I asked, that I could attend the retreat for free? Half an
    hour later someone called back to convey Ruth&#146;s message that I was welcome to work
    for my room and board.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So I spent hours each day painting and cleaning and
    building, and I began to experience myself joined with my surroundings. I became part of
    the physical reality of structures, carpets, windows; I entered the energy of the place,
    promoting its continued existence, creating order. And I began to be wholly committed to
    each task, fully present in the doing of it, so that self was forgotten, and only the
    action of hand holding rag wiping wall was known.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One particular labor tried my endurance. I had to dig a
    hole for a latrine, bending over the shovel, lifting the heavy dirt, within sight of the
    zendo where the other retreatants sat peacefully in meditation. A cold wind battered me;
    the wooden handle of the shovel wore against the skin of my hands raising blisters; my
    back began to ache. In the performance of this task, at last the hard carapace of my
    resistance broke apart. After hours of shoveling, I entered the zendo and lowered my body
    onto my cushion. To sit still, to meditate, seemed a great privilege and gift in itself.
    And looking at Ruth at the front of the room, I saw her anew -- not as my tormentor but as
    one who offered a precious opportunity. I saw that she was always gently pointing to the
    complexity and authenticity of this moment, suggesting a new way for me to be with my
    experience.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I surrendered utterly to her teaching, opening to receive
    her directions, no longer shutting my heart and mind to them but letting them enter me,
    and I was profoundly touched. In those few days, all the teachings of the previous three
    years that I had so vigorously rejected gelled in me. I felt myself enter a deep enduring
    life-force, expansive and sure, and full of a quiet joy. Not that I was totally
    transformed -- even now my resistance will pop up to impede me -- but there was a
    qualitative change during that retreat that left me much more receptive to and able to
    make use of Ruth&#146;s teachings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The spiritual teachers I have experienced use stories as
    devices to engage us, instruct us, and wake us up. At Dhamma Dena, Ruth Denison often
    weaves tales from her life, stories that will appear to wander and traverse many detours
    but always arrive at a moment that sticks in the mind, like an arrow pointing at something
    one has missed before, or has never considered. She is willing to offer up the moments of
    her life in the effort to give us ways to connect with ourselves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one particular morning, after several hours of sitting
    and walking meditation, someone had asked Ruth about difficulties with the breathing
    practice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&#147;If our mind is open and free of resenting or
    wishing, we can allow the breath to come to its own naturalness,&#148; Ruth answered.
    &#147;But somehow we can&#146;t just do that! The problem is that our mind runs along on
    its own way. We have very little control over it. Who notices this?&#148; A number of the
    meditators nodded. Ruth sat back, adjusting the chain that held her eyeglasses hanging on
    her chest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&#147;There was a time in my life when I experienced
    extreme states of terror and pain because of difficulties with breathing.&#148; A deeper
    silence fell among us as she continued. &#147;My difficulties had arisen from wrong
    practice. I had been too eager-beaver, I was concentrating too harshly, pushing it too
    hard in a determined way. Today I know why I had to experience that. It brought me into a
    great space of humbleness and respect for myself, and love. But then all I knew was that I
    had no power over the mind. It just roamed around and created pictures and fear. Some of
    you are psychologists or social workers -- you have probably met people in this condition,
    hmmm?&#148;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">She peered out among us, nodding as someone indicated
    agreement. &#147;My mind suffered tremendously, but I did not suffer doubt, because I
    could remember that this practice is good. So I trusted, and I began humbly returning to
    the lowest, most modest type of practice, to begin there, and I could gradually come back.
    That gave me wonderful ways of exploration that I can share with you now when I am
    teaching.&#148;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">She reminded us that the Buddha did not tell us to strive
    to attain something in breathing but merely directed us to observe the breath just as it
    is.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&#147;This he did because he understood the healing power
    of the pure, unattached mind,&#148; she said, &#147;this correcting power which demands
    nothing and thus allows what you observe to come into its natural order again.&#148; She
    adjusted herself on her seat, leaned back a little. &#147;So if you feel difficulties and
    pain and congestion, don&#146;t be too much concerned. Be only concerned that your mind is
    pure, not reacting. With a quiet, nondetermined mind, just observe what you are doing.
    Watch how you breathe. Can you discover something in it? It is all for one reason -- to
    train the mind to stay here, to invite it, hmmm? To overcome some of the difficulties and
    give us more trust, to give us more confidence.&#148;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ruth finished slowly, bringing home the message. &#147;You
    allow the mind to come in with its desires, with all its conditioning, with its compulsion
    to think, to strive, to resent, to want, and so on. And then you are really an explorer.
    You are noticing all this coming in and not forbidding it, not pushing it away but
    permitting it to live in the light of your attention.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&#147;Remember this Vipassana mind, this witnessing,
    attending mind, is already part of your beautiful self. So if you can hold on to that in a
    modest way you can sustain that cool, you can provide again and again a beautiful
    condition for your practice.&#148; She lifted her head, looking to the back of the room
    where I sat and inquiring briskly, &#147;Does that make sense to you, Sandy?&#148; I
    thought for a moment, not wanting to answer hastily. &#147;Yes, it does,&#148; I said.
    &#147;Good.&#148; Ruth gave a decisive nod. &#147;I hope it makes sense to all of
    us.&#148;./.</font></p>
