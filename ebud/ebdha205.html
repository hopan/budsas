    indicate physical conditions for success in meditation, and also acceptance of a not-Self
    tile-principle (primarily vinnana) which is (usually) dependent on the mortal physical
    body. In the Abhidhamma and commentaries, the physical acts on the mental through the
    senses and through the 'basis' for mind-organ and mind-consciousness, which came to be
    seen as the 'heart-basis'. Mind acts on the body through two 'intimations': fleeting
    modulations in the primary physical elements. Various forms of rupa are also said to
    originate dependent on citta and other types of rupa. Meditation makes possible the
    development of a 'mind-made body' and control over physical elements through psychic
    powers. The formless rebirths and the state of cessation are anomalous states of
    mind-without-body, or body-without-mind, with the latter presenting the problem of how
    mental phenomena can arise after being completely absent. Does this twin-category process
    pluralism avoid the problems of substance-dualism?</font><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font

    <p><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#00007f" face="Times New Roman"><b>The Interaction of Body and
    Mind in Spiritual Development</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the discourses of the Buddha (Suttas), a number of
    passages indicate that the state of the body can have an impact on spiritual development.
    For example, it is said that the Buddha could only attain the meditative state of jhana
    once he had given up harsh asceticism and built himself up by taking sustaining food (M.I.
    238ff.). Similarly, it is said that health and a good digestion are among qualities which
    enable a person to make speedy progress towards enlightenment (M.I. 95). The crucial
    spiritual quality of mindfulness (sati), moreover, is first developed with processes of
    the physical body as object. This enables mindfulness to be strengthened, before being
    applied to more illusive mental states.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is also clearly stated that the attainment of jhana,
    meditative trance, has a marked effect on the body. Of the first of the four jhanas, it is
    said that the meditator, &quot;drenches, saturates, permeates, suffuses this very body
    with joy and happiness&quot; (M.I. 276f.). On the third jhana, Buddhaghosa also refers to
    &quot;the exceedingly superior rupa [matter] originated by that happiness associated with
    the group of mental states (nama-kaya)&quot; (Vism. 163).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Physical and mental/spiritual states are thus seen as
    constantly interacting; they are not two totally separate spheres. As Winston King says:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">At any given moment of experience, body-mind represents an
      intimate organic unity. For though Buddhism recognizes a polarity between mental and
      physical constituents of sentient beings, it never sharply divides them but on the
      contrary strongly emphasizes the close relationship of all mental and physical states.
      (1964, p. 19)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <font SIZE="4" COLOR="#00007f"><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The 'Life-principle'
    (Jiva) and the 'mortal body' (Satira)</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was often asked a set of questions known as the
    'undetermined (avyakata) questions' which included 'is the life-principle the same as the
    mortal body' and 'is the life-principle different from the mortal body?'. The questions
    are said to be 'undetermined' because the Buddha did not accept any of the views expressed
    in the questions. He 'set aside' the questions as timewasting and misconstrued. The
    crucial reason that he saw them as misconstrued was that he saw them as asking about a
    permanent Self (S. IV. 395). In the case of the above questions: how is a permanent
    Self/life-principle related to the mortal body? As he did not accept such a Self, he could
    not accept any view on how it was related to the body! Apart from this, he also seems not
    to have accepted either view because he saw body and that which enlivened it as neither
    identical nor totally distinct. That is, while he did not accept a permanent
    life-principle, he accepted a changing, empirical life-principle. This life-principle was
    partly dependent on the mortal physical body, but not in such a way that the death of the
    body destroyed it; this would be to deny rebirth. The life-principle is normally sustained
    by (and sustains) the body, but it can be sustained without it, too.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The evidence for the Buddhist acceptance of a
    'life-principle' is as follows. At D.I. 157-58, the Buddha is asked the undetermined
    questions on the life-principle. Part of his reply is that one who had attained any of the
    four meditative jhanas would not give either answer. The same is then said of someone in
    the fourth jhana who applies his mind to 'knowledge and vision' (nana-dassana). Elsewhere,
    'knowledge and vision' is said to consist of a series of meditation-based knowledges (D.I.
    76-7). The first is where one comprehends:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This body (kayo) of mine has form (rupi), it is made from
    the four great elements, produced by mother and father ... is subject to erasion,
    abrasion, dissolution and distintegration; this is my consciousness (vinnana), here
    supported (sitam), here bound.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This suggests that one who is proficient in meditation is
    aware of a kind of life-principle in the form of consciousness (perhaps with some
    accompaniments), this being dependent on the mortal physical body. In this, consciousness
    is like its synonym citta, which is said to be 'without a mortal body (asariram)' (Dhp.
    37) but to be 'born of the mortal body (sarira-ja)' (Thag. 355).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The early Buddhist understanding of the life-principle, in
    the context of rebirth, can be seen at D. II. 332ff. Here, the materialist prince Payasi
    feels that he has disproved rebirth as, when he put a criminal man in a sealed jar and let
    him die, he saw no life-principle leaving the jar when it was opened. In order to show
    that this gruesome 'experiment' does not disprove rebirth, Maha-Kassapa argues that, as
    the prince's attendants do not see his life-principle 'entering or leaving' him when he
    dreams, he cannot expect to see the life-principle of a dead person 'entering or leaving'
    (D. II. 334). Thus the life-principle is not denied, but accepted, as an invisible
    phenomenon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Certainly, the start of life, at conception, is seen as
    involving the flux-of-consciousness, from a past life, entering the womb and, along with
    the requisite physical conditions, leading to the development of a new being in the womb:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Were consciousness, Ananda, not to fall into the mother's
      womb, would mind-and-body (nama-rupa) be constituted there?' 'It would not, Lord'. 'Were
      consciousness, having fallen into the mother's womb, to turn aside from it, would
      mind-and-body come to birth in this present state?'. 'It would not, Lord.' (D. II. 62-3)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It can thus be seen that the life-principle referred to by
    Maha-Kassapa seems to be, in the main, the flux of consciousness which enters the womb at
    conception and leaves the body at death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In arguing against another 'experiment' of Payasi
    concerning a life-principle, Maha-Kassapa says that a body &quot;endowed with vitality,
    heat and consciousness&quot; is lighter and more pliable than a dead body, just as a
    heated iron ball &quot;endowed with heat and (hot) air&quot; is lighter and more pliable
    than a cool one (D. II. 334-5). Moreover, only a body so endowed can be aware of
    sense-objects, just as a conch-shell-trumpet will only make a sound when &quot;endowed
    with a man, an effort and air&quot; (D. II. 337-8).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A third simile is that of a fire-drill which will only
    make fire when properly used, not when chopped up to look for the 'fire' in it (D. II.
    340-2). That is, the life-principle is not a separate part of a person, but is a process
    which occurs when certain conditions are present, namely 'vitality (ayu)' 'heat (usma)'
    and consciousness. This life-principle complex relates to the body like heat and
    surrounding hot air to heated iron. A more modern analogy might be to see it as like the
    magnetic-field of a piece of magnetised iron: both heat and magnetism may be a property of
    iron, but this does not prevent them being transferred to something else: an analogy for
    rebirth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It can thus be seen that the 'life-principle' accepted by
    the Suttas is a complex of 'vitality, heat and consciousness'. 'Heat' is a physical
    process, 'vitality' consists, according to the Abhidhamma, of one 'life-faculty'
    (jivit-indriya) which is physical, and one which is mental, and consciousness is mental.
    This complex consists of conditionally arisen changing processes, which are not identical
    with the mortal body (except for heat and the physical life-faculty), nor totally
    different from it, but partly dependent on it. If the life-principle is taken as a
    (non-existent) substantial Self, it is meaningless to say that 'it' is the 'same as' or
    'different from' the mortal body, but if it is recognised as not-Self, then these views
    can be seen as actually false. The life-principle is neither the same as nor different
    from the mortal body, as the relationship is that of the mingling of mutually-dependent
    processes. Thus at S.I. 206, when a nature-spirit (yakkha) says &quot;'Material shape is
    not alive (na jivan)' say the Buddhas, then how does this [life-principle] find this
    mortal body?&quot;, the Buddha replies by outlining his view of the stages of embryonic
    growth. As seen above, the mortal body of a person develops because consciousness, the
    crucial factor in the life-principle process, enters the womb at conception; consciousness
    then remains supported by and bound to the body (though meditation can lead to it becoming
    less dependent on the body: see below).</font></p>
    <font SIZE="4" COLOR="#00007f"><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Inter-relation of
    Nama and Rupa</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most common way of dividing the component processes of
    a person is into 'nama', literally 'name' and 'rupa', 'form', 'material shape'. Rupa is
    said, in the Suttas, to consist of the 'four great elements', or the four 'primaries':
    solidity (literally 'earth'), cohesion (literally 'water'), heat (literally 'fire') and
    motion (literally 'air'), and rupa 'derived' (upadaya) from these. The Theravadin
    Abhidhamma enumerates the forms of 'derived' rupa as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1-5: the sensitive parts of the five physical
      sense-organs;<br>
      6-9: visible appearance, sound, smell and taste;<br>
      10-12: the faculties of femininity, masculinity and physical life;<br>
      13-14: bodily intimation and verbal intimation (see below);<br>
      15: space;<br>
      16-23: lightness, pliability, workableness, integration, maintenance, ageing, and
      impermanence of rupa, and nutritive essence (Dhs. section 596); later texts also add the
      'heart basis'--see below.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of these, items 10-23 cannot be sensed by the physical
    sense-organs, but are known only by the mind (Dhs. 980), be this by inference or
    clairvoyance. Apart from the occurrence of the 'four great elements' and the various forms
    of 'derived' rupa, all of which are mutually conditioning in various ways, there is no
    'material substance': rupa is just the occurrence of these states or processes. However,
    D. J. Kalupahana argues that the four primary elements can be seen as 'material substance'
    as they are the underlying basis of 'derived' matter (1976, p. 100). He compares this with
    John Locke's idea of material 'substance' as an imperceptible basis which must be
    postulated as the 'support' for material qualities such as hardness, shape or colour. This
    comparison is inappropriate, though, for the Abhidhamma holds that the primary elements
    can be directly sensed, by touch (at least in the case of solidity, heat and motion). He
    likewise holds that citta is like a mental 'substance' as 'mental states' (cetasikas)
    depend on it. But again, citta is not an unexperienceable support of that which can be
    experienced. It is itself experiencable. Having wrongly argued that the four elements and
    citta are like two substances, Kalupahana then wrongly interprets a text as saying that
    these cannot interact (1976, p. 99). He cites Ask 313, &quot;Where there is a difference
    of kind, there is no stimulus. The Ancients (porana) say that sensory stimulus is of
    similar kinds, not of different kinds.&quot; Kalupahana sees this as saying that mind and
    matter cannot affect each other, whereas the context shows that it is simply saying the
    the sensitive part of a sense-organ only responds to the relevant kind of stimulus (e.g.
    the ear to sounds).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Suttas, nama is used to refer to all aspects of
    mind except consciousness itself. In later texts, it usually also includes consciousness.
    As 'name' it essentially refers to those states which are intensional: which take an
    object. According to the Abhidhamma, this differentiates all such states from the rupa
    states, which never take an object (Dhs. 1408). On the other hand, states of nama (i.e.
    mental states) have no rupa, or 'form', 'material shape'.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Abhidhamma, mental states and material states are
    seen as interacting from the moment of conception. The Patthana Vol. I, pp. 5, 8, 9; see
    CR. I. 5-11) holds that, at this time, states of nama and rupa are mutually related to
    each other by a number of conditions, the meaning of which is explained by Vism. 535:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">i) conascent (sahajata) condition (the states support each
      other by arising together);<br>
      ii) mutuality (annamanna) condition (the states mutually arouse and consolidate each
      other, like sticks in a tripod supporting each other);<br>
      iii) support (nissaya) condition (the states act as a foundation for each other, as earth
      is a support or foundation for trees);<br>
      iv) presence (atthi) and non-disappearance (avigata) conditions.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover (p. 7), throughout life, mental states act as
    'postnascent' conditions for physical ones, i.e. they help to consolidate those physical
    states which have already arisen (Vism. 537).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The commentator Buddhaghosa explains the inter-dependence
    of the two at Vism. 596. On its own, nama lacks efficient power, for it does not eat,
    speak or move; likewise rupa lacks efficient power, on its own, for it has no desire to do
    such things. Each can only 'occur' when 'supported by' (nissaya) the other. The
    relationship between the two is like that of a blind man (rupa) who carries an immobile
    cripple (nama) on his shoulders: together they can prosper. They are like two sheaves of
    reeds which lean against each other and support each other (Vism. 595). Buddhaghosa then
    quotes an undetermined source in support of his position:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">They cannot come to be by their own strength, Or yet
    maintain themselves by their own strength; Conforming to the influence of other dhammas,
    Weak in themselves and conditioned, they come to be. They come to be with others as
    condition. They are aroused by others as objects; They are produced by object and
    condition And each by a dhamma other [than itself]. (Vism. 596-7)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, the reference to 'object', here, shows that the
    lines mainly concern nama.</font></p>
    <font SIZE="4" COLOR="#00007f"><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Action of the
    Physical on the Mental</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most obvious way in which the physical affects the
    mental is through the process of perceiving objects. From the Suttas it is clear that
    consciousness (and other mental states) arise dependent on sense-organ and sense-object. A
    common refrain is:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Eye-consciousness arises dependent on the eye and visible
      shape; the coming together of the three is stimulation; from stimulation as condition is
      feeling; what one feels one cognizes ... (e.g. M.I. 111)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Parallel things are also said about ear-consciousness,
    nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness and mentation-consciousness.
    M.I. 190 makes it clear that a sense-consciousness is not only conditioned by a
    sense-organ and its object, but also by an appropriate act of attention. Again, in the
    Adhidhamma, it is clear that the arising of a sense-consciousness is not only conditioned
    by physical factors, but also by mental ones: the previous moments of cifra such as the
    bhavanga state, the latent ground state of consciousness (Ptn. I. 312-13, 369; CR. I.
    338-39, 407; Vism. 458-60). That is, consciousness is dependent on physical states, but
    also on previous states of consciousness and other mental states.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What, though, is said of whether there is a physical basis
    for mind-consciousness? The Abhidhamma clearly specifies that there is such a basis
    (vatthu), though it does not specify what it is. The Patthana (Vol. I, p. 5; see CR. I. 6)
    says:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The rupa supported by which mentation-element (mano-dhatu)
      and mentation-consciousness-element (mano-vinnana-dhatu) occur, that rupa is related to
      them and their associated states by support condition ... by presence condition ... by
      non-disappearance condition.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Likewise it is said (p. 72):</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Conditioned by eye-sense-sphere is eye-consciousness; ...
      conditioned by basis (vatthu) are (karmically) fruitional and functional indeterminate
      (mental) groups. Moreover, karmically active mental states are also seen as conditioned by
      such a basis (ibid). However, the physical 'basis' of mind is itself said to be dependent
      on mental states, from the moment of conception (p. 70). While this basis is always a
      'prenascent' (i.e. prior) condition for mentation (that which adverts to objects), it is
      not always so for mentation-consciousness (p. 71). This must be because, at conception,
      mentation-consciousness is that which is transmitted from a dead person and, on entering
      the womb, conditions the development of a new psycho-physical organism, including
      mentation and the physical basis for the continuance of consciousness. In the ongoing flow
      of life, the mental dhammas mutually condition each other, but are also conditioned by the
      physical 'basis' (ibid.).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the later Theravada tradition, the physical 'basis' of
    mind is specified as the 'heart-basis' (hadaya-vatthu) (Vism. 537), and this was added to
    the list of types of 'derived' rupa (the Sarvastivadin tradition remained uncommitted as
    to what the 'basis' was). The heart was probably chosen as, in terms of immediate
    experience, many emotional states seem to be physically centred in the middle of the
    chest. Certainly, many of the physical sensations associated with meditation are 'felt'
    here.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The 'heart-basis' is said to act as the 'support' for
    mentation-element and mentation-consciousness-element, and to 'uphold' them, being itself
    dependent on the blood (Vism. 447). Buddhaghosa sees the 'basis' as a tiny region of the
    heart (Vism. 256), and dismisses the brain as a lump of marrow in the skull (Vism. 259).
    W. F. Jayasuriya, though, argues that 'heart' is not literally meant, and that what may be
    referred to is the entire nervous system (including the brain): which certainly is
    dependent on (the oxygen supply in) blood (1963, appendix A). Yet if the 'basis' is seen
    as present from conception, it cannot be identified, as such, with either the heart or
    nervous system in their fully developed forms.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhaghosa also holds that in being the 'basis' for
    mind-consciousness, the heart-basis is not a 'door' for consciousness, like
    eye-sensitivity (Vism. 451). That is, it is not a place where consciousness receives
    content from outside (Asl. 85). It simply supports it occurrence. Similarly, it is not a
    'door' to setting up activity in the body, as 'bodily intimation' and 'vocal intimation'
    are (Vism. 451).</font></p>
    <font SIZE="4" COLOR="#00007f"><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Mind's Action on the
    Body</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps the main way in which the mind produces effect in
    the body is through states of mind leading to speech and physical behaviour. In the
    Theravadin Abhidhamma, the two crucial intermediaries in these situations are:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">i) 'vocal intimation' (vaci-vinnatti);<br>
      ii) 'bodily intimation' (kaya-vinnatti).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Dhammasangani (sec. 596), these are described as
    forms of 'derived (upada) matter (rupa)'. That is they are forms of matter dependent on
    the 'four great elements'.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Bodily intimation' is defined (Dhs. 636) as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">That state of bodily tension or excitement, or state of
      excitement, on the part of one who advances, or moves back, or fixes the gaze, or glances
      round, or retracts an arm, or stretches it forth: the intimation, the making known, the
      state of having made known a citta (mind-moment or thought) ...</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhs. 637 says much the same on 'vocal intimation'. That
    is, both are seen as physical states which make known a thought. As Buddhaghosa says, they
    'display intention' (Vism. 448f.) and communicate (Asl. 82 and 87). as among states of
    rupa which are 'citta-born' and 'citta-caused', as 'originated from citta'. However, the
    two intimations are the only kind of rupa which are said to be 'coexistent with citta'
    (Dhs. 669) and to 'follow after citta' (Dhs. 671). That is they are the only kind of
    material dhammas that last no longer than a moment of citta, and change in unison with
    citta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In his commentary on these passages, though (Asl. 337),
    Buddhaghosa explains that, &quot;in the ultimate sense&quot;, only the phenomena on which
    the two intimations depend are genuinely &quot;originated from citta&quot;, and neither
    are they literally &quot;coexistent with citta&quot;. This is because a cifra exists only
    for one seventeenth of the time a rupa dhamma lasts (Vism. 614). In fact, Buddhaghosa sees
    the two intimations as only 'nominal' dhammas (Vism. 450): they are not separate dhammas,
    but only aspects of other 'real' rupa dhammas, which can be said to be genuinely
    'originated from citta'. They are 'nominal' in a similar way to that in which the
    'impermanence' of rupa is a nominal dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As Asl. 83 explains:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now the body originated from citta: that is not
      'intimation'. But there is a certain alteration in the mode (akara-vikaro) of the primary
      (physical) elements when set up by citta, through which, as condition, the motion element
      is able to strengthen and agitate the conascent body. This is intimation.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">More specifically, Vism. 447-8 says:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bodily intimation is the alteration in the mode in the
      citta-originated motion element that causes the occurrence of moving forward etc., which
      alteration in the mode is a condition for the tension, upholding and moving of the
      conascent rupa-body.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Similarly,Vism. 448 sees vocal intimation as an
    'alteration in the mode in the citta-originated solidity element'.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the two intimations are seen as fleeting modulations
      in the 'motion' and 'solidity' elements, which modulations can last as long as a citta
      (mind-moment), but not as long as other rupa dhammas. They are 'nominal' dhammas as they
      are merely modulations of other 'real' dhammas.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the mind sets up movement in the body by altering the
    mode of rupa produced by citta. Non-solid mind does not so much 'bump into' extended,
    solid matter, as modulate the way in which aspects of matter arise. Note that the
    'motion/air' element might be related to the modern concept of electrical discharges in
    the nerves: at M.I. 185ff., there is reference to &quot;airs/winds which shoot across
    several limbs&quot;. In that case, the mind would move the body by effecting the
    electrical modulation of nerve discharges.</font></p>
    <font SIZE="4" COLOR="#00007f"><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Meaning of
    'Citta-originated'</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The discussion still leaves the meaning of
    'citta-originated' (citta-samutthana) rupa states to be determined. Dhs. 667 holds that
    the two intimations are always 'citta-originated', and that certain other rupa dhammas,
    including the four primary elements, may be, when they are 'born of citta', 'citta-caused'
    (citta-ja, citta-hetuka). Does this imply that citta can actually create certain kinds of
    matter, or what?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Patthana (Vol. I, pp. 22-23) holds that there are four
    ways in which a rupa dhamma may 'originate': by citta, by karma, and by natural physical
    processes related to 'nutriment' and temperature. Nevertheless, citta cannot 'originate'
    matter on its own: citta-originated rupa arises dependent on the primary elements, and
    skilful or unskilful mental processes (ibid). This is because any 'derived' rupa depends
    on the primary elements, and these always arise dependent on each other. Thus the position
    of the Theravadin Abhidhamma seems to be that citta can produce or create certain kinds of
    matter, but not literally 'out of nothing', for 'citta-originated' matter is also
    dependent on other forms of matter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The kind of mental processes that can 'originate' rupa are
    said to include: desire, energy, thought (citta), investigation (when concentrated these
    are the 'four bases of psychic power'), volition, and meditative trance (jhana) (Ptn. I,
    pp. 2, 7, 8). These act as conditions for the origination of rupa dhammas by being
    conascent with them (i.e. born at the same time), and supporting them by their continued
    presence (pp. 5, 8, 9).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As explained by Buddhaghosa (Vista. 624):</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The citta-originated becomes evident through one who is
      joyful or grieved. For the rupa arisen at the time when he is joyful is smooth, tender,
      fresh and soft to touch. That arisen at the time when he is grieved is parched, stale and
      ugly.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This clearly implies that mental states effect the kind of
    physical states that arise in the body. As Asl. 82 says:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When a thought 'I will move forward or step back' occurs,
      it sets up bodily qualities. Now there are eight groups of these bodily qualities: the
      four primaries ... and the four depending on these: colour, odour, taste, and nutritive
      essence [examples of 'derived' rupa]. Among these, motion strengthens, supports, agitates,
      moves backward and forward the conascent material body.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <font SIZE="4" COLOR="#00007f"><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Mind-made Body</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While mental processes are normally seen as conditioned by
    physical ones, there are said to be situations where this is less so than normal. Thus one
    Sutta passage, after referring to an awareness of consciousness as dependent on the
    physical body (see above, life-principle section), refers to a meditative state in which
    the meditator applies himself to calling up a 'mind-made body' (mano-maya kaya):</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He calls up from this body another body, having form,
    mind-made, having all limbs and parts, not deficient in any organ. Just as if, O king, a
    man were to pull a reed out of its sheath, he would know 'This is the reed, this the
    sheath. The reed is different from the sheath. It is from the sheath that the reed has
    been drawn forth'. (D.I. 77)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This shows that that consciousness is seen as able to
    leave the physical body by means of a mind-made body. Such a body could be seen as a kind
    of 'subtle body', for a being with a mind-made body is said to feed on joy (D.I. 17), not
    on solid nutriment (D.I. 195): it thus lacks the four great elements of the physical body
    (solidity, cohesion, heat and motion: D.I. 195). As such a body relates to the 'realm of
    (pure) form', the subtle matter composing it can only be visible and audible matter (Vibh.
    405). However, the mind-made body is invisible to the normal eye (Pati. II. 209). It
    occupies space, but does not impinge on gross physical matter, for the 'selfhood' of a
    certain god with a mind-made body is said to be as large as two or three fields, but to
    cause no harm to anyone (A. III. 122). With such a body, a person can exercise psychic
    powers such as going through solid objects, being in many places at once, or flying (D.I.
    78).</font></p>
    <font SIZE="4" COLOR="#00007f"><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Psychic Powers</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Suttas, there is a standard list of
    meditation-based 'psychic powers' (iddhis). These include: multiplying one's form; going
    through a wall as if through space; diving into the earth as if through water; walking on
    water as if on the ground; flying, crosslegged, through the air (M.I. 494). The Buddha is
    said to have claimed that he could do these either with his mind-made body, or with his
    physical body of the four elements (S.V. 283). At D. II. 89, for example, the Buddha
    crosses a river by simply disappearing from one bank and instantaneously appearing on the
    other.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such powers, if one is to take them seriously, clearly
    involve remarkable 'mental' control of matter, whether this be the matter of one's own
    body or of objects passed through, for example. In discussing such powers, Buddhaghosa
    says that when, for example, diving into the earth, the earth usually only becomes water
    for the performer (Vism. 396), but it can also become water for others too. This suggests
    that, when psychic powers are exercised by means of the 'mind-made' body, there is no
    effect on ordinary matter, but that when it is done with the physical body, such matter is
    affected.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The late canonical text the Patisambhidamagga goes into
    some detail on how the powers are developed. They require that a person has attained one
    of the meditative jhana states and has developed the four 'bases of psychic power':
    concentration of desire, of energy, of thought and of investigation (Pati. II. 205). As
    seen above, these four states are listed in the Patthana as mental states which can
    'originate' rupa states. To develop the power of diving through the earth, the meditator
    attains meditative concentration by focussing on water, then makes water appear where
    there is earth (p. 208). To walk on water or fly, meditation is on earth, then earth is
    made to appear in water or the air (ibid). The implicit principle, here, is that by
    focusing on, investigating, and gaining knowledge of an element (e.g. earth/solidity), one
    can gain power over it, and change other elements into it. The later tradition, though,
    holds that all physical matter contains all four primary elements, though in different
    'intensity'. Thus to change water into earth, the solidity element in it becomes
    predominant rather than the cohesion element.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All this suggests that, in the Buddhist view, the mind
    purified, calmed and tuned by meditative concentration has great transformative power over
    matter, and that the physical world is not as stable as is normally seen. Its
    transformation is not seen as 'miraculous' or super-natural, though, just super-normal. It
    is done in a law-like way by drawing on the power of the meditative mind.</font></p>
    <font SIZE="4" COLOR="#00007f"><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Formless State</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However much the mind is seen as normally inter-dependent
    with body, Buddhism also accepts that there are levels of existence where only mental
    phenomena exist, with nothing whatever of rupa. These are the four 'formless' (arupa)
    rebirths:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">i) the sphere of infinite space;<br>
      ii) the sphere of infinite consciousness;<br>
      iii) the sphere of nothingness;<br>
      iv) the sphere of neither-cognition-nor-non-cognition.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">They correspond exactly to four meditative states, with
    the same names, attainable from the fourth jhana. The first is attained by transcending
    any cognition of rupa; that is, by abandoning the metal image that was previously the
    object of concentration, and seeing that space is infinite. In the second state, the focus
    is on the consciousness that had been aware of infinite space. In the third, this object
    is dropped, and the focus is on the apparent nothingness remaining. In the fourth, this
    object is dropped and the mind is in an attenuated state where it is hardly functioning
    (Vism. ch. x).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In these rebirth realms, there are feelings, cognitions,
    constructing activities such as volition, and mind-consciousness. There are none of the
    five forms of sense-consciousness, nor even mind-element (mano) (Vibh. 407). The 'beings'
    of such a level are clearly seen as totally bodiless, but this means that their
    mode-of-being is far from normal. Their 'mode of personality' (atta-patilabha) is said to
    be 'formless, made of cognition' (D.I. 195), and their predominant awareness is of such
    things as infinite space. Thus, while they can be seen as composed of mind separated from
    any matter, this separation leads to a transformation in their nature: mind cannot be
    separated from matter without this having an effect on mind. A 'formless' being has
    thoughts devoid of any kind of sense-perceptions.</font></p>
    <font SIZE="4" COLOR="#00007f"><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The State of Cessation</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the meditative sequence described above, going
    through the 'formless' attainments, it is also held that a further state can be attained
    by a meditator. This is the 'cessation of feeling and cognition', or simply the
    'attainment of cessation'. This is an anomalous state that, by the combination of profound
    meditative calming, and of meditative insight, all mental states come to a complete halt.
    The mind totally shuts down, devoid of even subtle feeling and cognition, due to turning
    away from even the very refined peace of the fourth formless level. In this state, the
    heart and breathing stop (M.I. 301-02), but a residual metabolism keep the body alive for
    up to seven days. Only an Arahat, the highest saint who has fully attained Nibbana, or a
    Non-returner, the second highest saint, can experience cessation (A. III. 194; Vism. 702);
    they emerge from it experiencing the 'fruit' of their respective attainment (Vism. 708).
    It is thus one possible route to experiencing Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Suttas, it is said that, while a dead person is
    without vitality and heat, and their sense-organs are 'scattered', a person in cessation
    still has vitality and heat, and his sense-organs are 'purified' (M.I. 296). In other
    contexts (D. II. 334-5), it is said that a living person is one endowed with 'vitality,
    heat and consciousness'. At M.I. 296, it is notable that there is no reference to
    consciousness. In the Theravadin view, as expressed by Buddhaghosa in chapter 23 of Vism.
    (pp. 702-9), cessation is 'the non-occurrence of citta and mental states as a result of
    their successive cessation' (p. 702). A person in this state is 'without citta' (p. 707).
    Not even the latent form of mind present in dreamless sleep, bhavanga, is said to be
    present. A person in this state is seen as only a body, with no mental states whatever.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The philosophical problems this raises is: when the
    meditator emerges from this state, and mental states recommence, how does this occur? If
    there are only physical states occurring in cessation, does this mean that mind re-starts
    thanks to these alone? This issue is discussed by Griffiths (1986), looking at the
    Theravadin, Sarvastivadin, Sautrantika and Yogacara views on the matter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Suttas emphasise that no thought 'I will emerge'
    immediately leads up to emergence from the state, but that this occurs simply because the
    mind of the meditator has been 'previously so developed' (M.I. 302). For the Theravada,
    Buddhaghosa explains that emergence occurs due to the intention made before cessation was
    entered. Cessation then lasts for a pre-determined time unless interrupted by death, the
    call of the monastic community, or of a person's teacher.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now in Buddhist Abhidhamma theory, mental states only
    lasts for a micro-moment before decaying and being replaced by other mental-states.
    Physical states last for slightly longer moments. If this is so, it would seem that the
    only way an intention can effect a future event is if it sets in train a causal chain
    culminating in that event, During cessation, the components of that chain can only be
    physical states. This implies that it is these which lead to the emergence. Griffiths sees
    this as an implication which the Theravada does not want to embrace, due to its 'dualism',
    in which mental events are not seen to directly arise from physical ones (1986, p. 37).
    This overlooks the fact, though, that the Theravadin Abhidhamma does talk of a physical
    'basis' for mentation-consciousness and mentation-element (see above). While normally
    these are also dependent on prior moments of the same type, 'cessation' is clearly not a
    normal-type state, and so may acceptably be seen as one in which the physical 'basis'
    alone, thanks to a prior intention, leads to the arising of mentation-consciousness and
    mentation-element, at emergence from the state. As even Griffiths admits, the Theravadins
    see at least one physical event--death--as leading to emergency from cessation. This is
    because bhavanga, a state of citta, occurs at the moment of death, so that cessation is no
    longer operative then. As to how the call of the community or a teacher ends cessation,
    this is not stated. It could be either through stimulating the body to re-start the mind,
    or perhaps a more direct 'mental' stimulation of the organism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Sarvastivadin view of emergence from cessation is that
    it is directly produced by the last moment of mind before entering cessation. This is
    possible, in their view, because past, future and present dharmas all 'exist' in some
    sense. Thus A can directly affect B even if they are separated in time. The Sautrantikas,
    on the other hand, held that the body alone leads to emergence from cessation, as it has
    been 'seeded' by prior moments of mind. The Yogacarins (a Mahayana school) hold that a
    form of residual consciousness remains in cessation. This is the 'store-consciousness'
    (alaya-vijnana), a concept in some ways similar to the bhavanga citta of the Theravadins.</font></p>
    <font SIZE="4" COLOR="#00007f"><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Conclusion</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pali Buddhism's overall understanding of the mind-body
    relationship is thus as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">i) There is a clear differentiation between dhammas which
      are intensional (part of nama) and those which pertain to material form (rupa).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">ii) Nevertheless, not all rupa dhammas can be sensed by a
      physical sense organ; some must be inferred or clairvoyantly known: thus rupa does not
      refer simply to that-which-is-(physically)-sensed, as some have held (Johansson, 1979, p.
      34).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">iii) While nama is centred on citta and rupa is centred on
      the 'four great elements', there is no dualism of a mental 'substance' versus a physical
      'substance': both nama and rupa each refer to clusters of changing, interacting processes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">vi) The processes of nama and rupa also interact with each
      other, from the moment of conception, mutually supporting each other.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">v) For a life to begin, there must be the coming together,
      in the womb, of appropriate physical conditions and a flow of consciousnss from a previous
      life.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">vi) Life continues while there is 'vitality, heat and
      consciousness' in a person, these comprising a conditioned, empirical life-principle that
      is neither identical with nor entirely different from the mortal body, but is (normally)
      dependent on and bound to such a body.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">vii) In the normal situation, mental processes are
      affected by physical ones in that the physical sense enables there to be types of
      consciousness that would not otherwise exist (the five sense-consciousnesses), and give
      specific kinds of input-content to the mind; the physical mind-basis also support the
      occurrence of mentation (that which is aware of mental objects) and
      mentation-consciousness.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">viii) In the normal situation, certain mental processes
      also lead to the origination of certain types of physical processes (which are also
      dependent on other physical processes), and some of these (mind-originated motion- and
      solidity-elements), in turn, may be modulated by mental processes so as to lead to
      specific bodily movements or vocal articulations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">ix) Death leads to the break-up of the normal mind-body
      interaction, such that consciousness, and certain accompaniments, flow on to another life.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">x) Four of the many forms of rebirth are anomalous in that
      they remain totally free of physical form: but when there is thus nama unaccompanied by
      rupa, nama itself occurs in a different way from normal. The mind cannot be simply
      separated from the body without it undergoing change.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">xi) Another anomalous state is that of 'cessation', where
      there is temporarily a living body and yet no consciousness whatsoever. Again, when nama
      restarts after cessation, it does so in a new way, with a deeper level of insight. A
      plausible route for the restarting of mental processes is the physical mind-basis.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">xii) Other non-normal patterns of interaction between mind
      and body are found in the cases of development of the 'mind-made' body and the exercise of
      psychic powers. As in the cases of the formless rebirths and cessation, these non-normal
      cases are dependent on the power of meditation to bring about transformations in the
      normal pattern of nama-rupa interaction.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The 'mind-body' relationship, then, is seen as a pattern
    of interaction between two types of processes. The interactions which take place between
    these two sets of processes are part of an overall network of interactions which also
    include mental-mental and physical-physical interactions. Neither the two sets, or the
    processes they comprise, are independent substances, for they are streams of momentary
    events which could not occur without the interactions which condition their arising.
    Meditation has the power to alter the usual patterns of interaction into non-normal
    configurations, which accordingly affect the type of process-events that arise.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As I have argued elsewhere, however, the Pali Suttas
    (though not later Pali material) includes indications that the early Buddhists regarded
    consciousness (vinnana) as able to 'break free' of the network of interactions (Harvey,
    1989; 1990, pp. 61-68, 58). Indeed, the Suttas often see personality as a vortex of
    interaction not between nama (including consciousness) and rupa, but between consciousness
    and nama-rupa (D. II. 32, 63-4, S. III. 9-10). By turning away from all objects, seen as
    ephemeral and worthless, consciousness could become objectless. 'It' would then not be a
    limited, conditioned process, but the unconditioned: Nibbana. Unlike the situation of
    cessation, this would not be the complete absence of consciousness, but the timeless
    experience of a 'consciousness' which had transcended itself by dropping all objects.</font></p>
