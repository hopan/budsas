<h1>Going for Refuge</h1>

The act of going for refuge marks the point where one commits
oneself to taking the Dhamma, or the Buddha's teaching, as the
primary guide to the conduct of one's life. To understand why
this commitment is called a "<b>refuge</b>", it is helpful to look at
the history of the custom. 
<P>
In pre-Buddhist India, going for refuge meant proclaiming one's
allegiance to a patron-a powerful person or god-submitting to the
patron's directives in hopes of receiving protection from danger
in return. In the early years of the Buddha's teaching career,
his new followers adopted this custom to express their allegiance
to <b>the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha</b>, but in the Buddhist context
this custom took on a new meaning. 
<P>
Buddhism is not a theistic religion -- the Buddha is not a god-and
so a person taking refuge in the Buddhist sense is not asking for
the Buddha personally to intervene to provide protection. Still,
the Buddha's teachings center on the realization that human life
is fraught with dangers-from greed, anger, and delusion -- and so
the concept of refuge is a central part of the path of practice,
in that the practice is aimed at gaining release from those
dangers. Because both the dangers and the release from them come
ultimately from the mind, there is a need for two levels of
refuge: <b>external refuges</b>, which provide models and guidelines so
that we can identify which qualities in the mind lead to danger
and which to release; and <b>internal refuges</b>, i.e., the qualities
leading to release that we develop in our own mind in imitation
of our external models. The internal level is where true refuge
is found. 
<P>
Although the tradition of going to refuge is an ancient practice,
it is still relevant for our own practice today, for we are faced
with the same internal dangers that faced people in the Buddha's
time. We still need the same protection as they. When a Buddhist
takes refuge, it is essentially an act of taking refuge in the
doctrine of karma: It is an act of submission in that one is
committed to living in line with the belief that actions based on
skillful intentions lead to happiness, while actions based on
unskillful intentions lead to suffering; it is an act of claiming
protection in that one trusts that by following the teaching one
will not fall into the misfortunes that bad karma engenders. To
take refuge in this way ultimately means to take refuge in the
quality of our own intentions, for that's where the essence of
karma lies. 
<P>
The refuges in Buddhism -- both on the internal and on the external
levels -- are the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, also known as the
<b>Triple Gem</b>. They are called gems both because they are valuable
and because, in ancient times, gems were believed to have
protective powers. The Triple Gem outdoes other gems in this
respect because its protective powers can be put to the test and
can lead further than those of any physical gem, all the way to
absolute freedom from the uncertainties of the realm of aging,
illness, and death. 
<P>
<b>The Buddha</b>, on the external level, refers to Siddhattha Gotama,
the Indian prince who renounced his royal titles and went into
the forest, meditating until he ultimately gained Awakening. To
take refuge in the Buddha means, not taking refuge in him as a
person, but taking refuge in the fact of his Awakening: placing
trust in the belief that he did awaken to the truth, that he did
so by developing qualities that we too can develop, and that the
truths to which he awoke provide the best perspective for the
conduct of our life. 
<P>
<b>The Dhamma</b>, on the external level, refers to the path of practice
the Buddha taught to his followers. This, in turn, is divided
into three levels: the words of his teachings, the act of putting
those teachings into practice, and the attainment of Awakening as
the result of that practice. This three-way division of the word
"Dhamma" is essentially a map showing how to take the external
refuges and make them internal: learning about the teachings,
using them to develop the qualities that the Buddha himself used
to attain Awakening, and then realizing the same release from
danger that he found in the quality of Deathlessness that we can
touch within. 
<P>
The word <b>Sangha</b>, on the external level, has two senses:
conventional and ideal. In its ideal sense, the Sangha consists
of all people, lay or ordained, who have practiced the Dhamma to
the point of gaining at least a glimpse of the Deathless. In a
conventional sense, Sangha denotes the communities of ordained
monks and nuns. The two meanings overlap but are not necessarily
identical. Some members of the ideal Sangha are not ordained;
some monks and nuns have yet to touch the Deathless. All those
who take refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha become members
of the Buddha's four-fold assembly (<b>parisa</b>) of followers: <i><b>monks,
nuns, male lay devotees, and female lay devotees</b></i>. Although it is
widely believed that all Buddhist followers are members of the
Sangha, this is not the case. Only those who are ordained are
members of the conventional Sangha; only those who have glimpsed
the Deathless are members of the ideal Sangha. Nevertheless,
those followers who do not belong to the Sangha in either sense
of the word still count as genuine Buddhists in that they are
members of the Buddha's parisa. 
<P>
When taking refuge in the external Sangha, one takes refuge in
both senses of the Sangha, but the two senses provide different
levels of refuge. The conventional Sangha has helped keep the
teaching alive for more than 2,500 years. Without them, we would
never have learned what the Buddha taught. However, not all
members of the conventional Sangha are reliable models of
behavior. So when looking for guidance in the conduct of one's
life, one must look to the living or recorded examples provided
by the ideal Sangha. Without their example, we would not know (1)
that Awakening is available to all, and not just to the Buddha;
and (2) how Awakening expresses itself in the varied aspects of
everyday life. 
<P>
On the internal level, the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha are the
skillful qualities that we develop in our own minds in imitation
of our external models. For instance, the Buddha was a person of
wisdom, purity, and compassion. When we develop wisdom, purity,
and compassion in our own minds, they form our refuge on an
internal level. The Buddha tasted Awakening by developing
conviction, persistence, mindfulness, concentration, and
discernment. When we develop these same qualities to the point of
attaining Awakening too, that Awakening is our ultimate refuge.
This is the point where the three aspects of the Triple Gem
become one: beyond the reach of greed, anger, and delusion, and
thus totally secure.
