  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">O</b>ne question we all need to ask ourselves is, Why
  do we come to a monastery? Whether we are monks, nuns, novices, lay guests or visitors, we
  should ask, Why have I come? We need to be clear about this in order to derive the
  greatest benefit from what a monastery has to offer. If we are not clear, we can waste a
  lot of time doing things that may detract from the possible benefits to be found here. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>he Buddha spoke of three fires three ailments that
  we, as human beings are afflicted by. These three things keep us continually moving, never
  able to rest or to be completely at ease; they are listed as greed, hatred and delusion <i>lobha,
  dosa, moha</i>. He also, out of compassion, pointed out the antidote. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A</b>ctually, these fires are based on natural
  instincts. For example, greed or sensual desire the sexual drive and the desire for food
  is what allows humanity to survive. Without sexual desire, none of us would be here now!
  And of course without hunger, or desire for food, we would not be inclined to take in the
  nourishment we need to maintain the body in a reasonable state of health. However, a
  difficulty arises when we lose touch with what is needed, and seek sensual gratification
  for its own sake. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A</b>nother kind of survival instinct is our response
  to danger. Either we turn around and attack something that is perceived as a threat to our
  physical survival, or we try to get away from it. This is the basis for <i>dosa</i> hatred
  or aversion. Clearly, too, this has an important place in nature, but again we have become
  confused and what we frequently find ourselves defending is not so much the physical body,
  but the sense of self what we perceive ourselves to be, in relation to one another. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>he third fire, which follows on quite naturally
  from this, is delusion <i>moha</i>; not really seeing clearly or understanding how things
  are, not really understanding what it is to be a human being. We tend to fix ourselves and
  each other as personalities, or selves. But these are just ideas or concepts, which we
  measure against other concepts of who or what we should be. Then if anyone comes along and
  challenges that self, it can bring out a strong reaction in us we instinctively attack,
  defend or try to get away from the perceived threat. Really, it's a kind of madness, when
  you think about it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>N</b>ow, as I said before, the Buddha, having pointed
  out the nature of the disease, also presented the cure. This came in the form of simple
  teachings, which can help us to live in a way that enables us to understand, and thereby
  free ourselves from these diseases; and also to avoid doing things that exacerbate them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>his brings me to the real reason that we come to a
  monastery. We want to free our hearts from disease, from the bonds of desire and
  confusion; and we recognise that what is presented here is the possibility of bringing
  this about. Of course there may be other reasons: some people don't really know why they
  have come they just feel attracted to the place. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>S</b>o what is it about the monastery that is different
  from what happens outside it?... It is a place that reminds us of our aspiration and
  potential. There are the lovely images, of the Buddha and his disciples which seem to
  radiate a feeling of calm, ease and alertness. Also, here we find a community of monks and
  nuns who have decided to live following the lifestyle that the Buddha recommended for
  healing those diseases. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>H</b>aving recognised that we are sick and that we need
  help, we begin to see that the cure is in direct opposition to the ways of the world. We
  see that if we are to cure ourselves we need first to understand the cause of the
  sickness, which is desire. So we need to understand our desires to get, to get rid of and
  to exist and be a separate self in order to free ourselves from them. So instead of
  following desires, we examine them closely. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>he discipline that we follow is based on precepts,
  which, used wisely, can engender a sense of dignity and self-respect. They restrain us
  from actions or speech which are harmful to ourselves or others, and delineate a standard
  of simplicity or renunciation. We ask ourselves, What do I really need?, rather than
  responding to the pressures of a materialistic society. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>B</b>ut how do precepts help us to understand these
  three fires? In a sense, what our monastic discipline offers is a container within which
  one can observe desire as it arises. We deliberately put ourselves into a form which
  prevents us from following all our desires, in order to see them and to notice how they
  change. Normally, when we are caught up in the process of desire, there is no sense of
  objectivity. We tend to be totally identified with it, so it is very difficult to see it
  clearly or to do anything about it, other than be swept along with it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>S</b>o with lust or aversion, we can recognise that
  these are natural energies or drives, which everyone has. We are not saying that its
  wrong, say, to have sexual desire or even to follow it in appropriate circumstances but we
  recognise that it is for a particular purpose, and it will bring about a certain result.
  As monks and nuns we have decided that we do not want to have children. We also recognise
  that the pleasure of gratification is only very fleeting, in relation to the possible
  longer term implications and responsibility. So we choose not to follow sexual desire. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>H</b>owever, this does not mean that we don't
  experience it that as soon as we shave our heads and put on a robe, we immediately stop
  experiencing any kind of desire. In fact, what can happen is that our experience of these
  desires is actually enhanced when we come to a monastery. This is because in lay life we
  can do all kinds of things to make ourselves feel OK usually without really being aware of
  what we are doing. Sometimes there is just a subliminal sense of dis-ease, followed by the
  reaching out to get something to relieve it always moving from one thing to the next. In
  the monastery it's not so easy to do this any more. We deliberately tie ourselves down in
  order to look at the drives, energies or desires that would normally keep us moving. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>N</b>ow you might ask: But what kind of freedom is
  this? tying oneself down in a situation where one is constantly restrained, always having
  to conform? Always having to behave in a particular way; to bow in a particular way, and
  at particular times; to chant at a particular speed and pitch; to sit in a particular
  place, beside particular people I've been sitting next to or behind Sister Sundara for the
  past fifteen years! . . What kind of freedom is this? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>I</b>t brings freedom from the bondage of desire.
  Rather than helplessly, blindly being pulled along by our desire, we are free to choose to
  act in ways that are appropriate, in harmony with those around us. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>N</b>ow it's important to realise that `freedom from
  desire' doesn't mean `not having desire.' We could feel very guilty and really struggle if
  we thought like that. As I said before, desire is part of nature, only it has been
  distorted as a result of our conditioning, our upbringing, the values of society and
  education. We are not going to get rid of it just like that - just because we want to, or
  feel that we shouldn't have desire; it's actually a more subtle approach that's required. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>he monastic form and precepts help us to make a
  peaceful space around these desire energies, so that, having arisen, they can burn
  themselves out. It is a process that takes great humility, because first we have to
  acknowledge that the desire is there, and that can be very humbling. Often, particularly
  in monastic life, our desires can be extremely petty; the sense of self can be bound up in
  something very trivial. For example, it might be that we have a very strong idea about how
  carrots should be chopped; so if someone suggests that we do it differently we can become
  very agitated and defensive! So we need to be very patient, very humble. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>F</b>ortunately there are some simple reference points,
  or Refuges, which can provide us with security and a sense of perspective, amid the
  chaotic world of our desires. These of course are <i>Buddha</i>, <i>Dhamma</i>, <i>Sangha</i>:
  the <i>Buddha</i>, our teacher also that within which knows things as they are, seeing
  clearly, not confused or agitated by sense impression; the <i>Dhamma</i>, the Teaching or
  the Truth, how things actually are right now often quite different from our ideas about
  things; and <i>Sangha</i> the lineage or community of those who practise, and also our
  aspiration to live in accordance with what we know to be true, rather than to follow all
  kinds of confused and selfish impulses that can arise. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>he Buddha gave some simple ways of turning to
  these. These are called Foundations of Mindfulness. Mindfulness of the body is one I use a
  great deal in my own practice. The body can be a very good friend to us because it doesn't
  think! The mind, with its thoughts and concepts can always confuse us, but the body is
  very simple we can notice how it is at any moment. For example, if someone acts or speaks
  in a way that I find intimidating, I can notice my instinctual reaction, which is to tense
  up in a defensive attitude, and perhaps respond in an aggressive way. However, when I am
  mindful of the process, I can choose not to react in this way. Instead of breathing in,
  puffing myself up, I can concentrate on breathing out relaxing, so that I become a less
  threatening presence to the other person. If, through mindfulness, I can let go of my
  defensive attitude, they too can relax rather than perpetuating the process of reactivity.
  In this way, we can bring a little peace into the world. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>P</b>eople visiting the monasteries often comment on
  the peaceful atmosphere that they find there. But this is not because everyone is feeling
  peaceful or experiencing bliss and happiness continuously they can be experiencing all
  kinds of things. In fact, one sister said that she had never experienced such murderous
  rage or such powerful feelings of lust until she entered the Sangha! What is different in
  a monastery is the practice. So whatever the monks and nuns might be going through, they
  are at least making the effort to be present with it, bearing it patiently, rather than
  feeling that it shouldn't be like that, or trying to make it change. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>he monastic form provides a situation in which
  renunciation and constraint are the very conditions for the arising of passionate
  feelings; but also there is the reassuring presence of other samanas. When we're really
  going through it, we can speak to an older, more experienced brother or sister in the
  life, whose response is likely to be something like, Oh yes, don't worry about that; it
  will pass. That happened to me. Its normal, it's simply part of the process of
  purification. Be patient. So we find the confidence to continue even when everything seems
  to be collapsing or going crazy inside. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>C</b>oming to a monastery we find people who are
  willing to look at and understand the root cause of human ignorance, selfishness and all
  the abominable things that happen in the world; people who are willing to look into their
  own hearts and to witness the greed and violence that others are so ready to criticise out
  there. Through experiencing and knowing these things we learn how to make peace with them,
  right here in our own hearts, in order that they may come to cessation. Then, maybe,
  rather than simply reacting to the ignorance of humanity and adding to the confusion and
  violence that we see around us, we are able to act or speak with wisdom and compassion in
  ways that can help to bring a sense of ease and harmony among people. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>S</b>o its not an escape, but an opportunity to turn
  around and face up to all the things we have tended to avoid in our lives. Through calmly
  and courageously acknowledging things as they are, we begin to free ourselves from the
  doubts, anxiety, fear, greed, hatred and all the rest which constantly bind us into
  conditioned reactions. Here, we have the support of good friends, and a discipline and
  teachings to help keep us on course in what sometimes seems like an impossible endeavour! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>M</b>ay we all realise true freedom. Evam. </font></p>
