        evening I want to talk about the Four Noble Truths (suffering, its
        cause, its ending and the path leading to its ending). Towards the end
        of any retreat, whether it is a three-month rainy season retreat or a
        shorter one, it's worthwhile to bring the meditator's attention to the
        core teaching of the Lord Buddha. Bringing the attention to this
        marvelous and profound teaching might be sufficient to take the
        meditator just that one step into full awareness, full knowledge and
        full realisation of the Dhamma. Thereby you might see what the Lord
        Buddha saw under the Bodhi tree. This will qualify you to enter the
        stream and to make the transition to the Noble Person (<i>Ariya-puggala)
        -</i> that is, seeing this very profound and powerful teaching of the
        Four Noble Truths. Obviously, it's important to first know those Four
        Noble Truths theoretically, and each one of you here has that
        theoretical knowledge. I am going to try to build upon and deepen that
        knowledge in this talk.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Joy at Last…</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As I was about to give this talk I
        brought to mind a well-known picture of my teacher, Ajahn Chah (a Thai
        meditation master), in his first monastery in England. In this picture,
        he has his arms raised above his head in imitation of a statue from
        another monastery. Beneath this statue it says, &quot;Joy at last to
        know there is no happiness in the world&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I'm going to start from there because so
        often in our practice and in our lives we are seeking for happiness in
        the world. We seek for happiness in so many areas and in so many ways,
        always seeking in the wrong place. Eventually we realise that not
        finding happiness in these places doesn't mean there is something wrong
        with us. It doesn't mean we are incompetent or hopeless. Insight will
        show us that there is no way anyone can find happiness in the place we
        were looking. The mind realises that the world can only be <i>dukkha </i>(suffering).
        The wise person, instead of being distressed by that suffering and
        wallowing in it, contemplates what the Lord Buddha says about suffering,
        the Four Noble Truths. That means, they seek to understand this whole
        process of suffering.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes the suffering can be raw,
        going deep into the bones, even deeper than the bones, right to the very
        source of what we think we are. It goes so deep and can cause so many
        problems. It's such a relief to find out that this is par for the
        course, that there's nothing wrong with this. This is the nature of the
        world. What do we expect?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes we go about with the false
        expectation that if we're clever enough, if we're smart enough, if we
        keep all the rules and do all the right things, somehow we can have a
        happy life. Sometimes we think everybody is happy but me. Often people
        in this monastery think, &quot;I bet everybody in this monastery has
        experienced <i>Jhana </i>(meditative absorption) but me&quot;. What we
        need to understand is that there is nothing special with us, and that as
        we practise in this monastery these are things which everyone has to
        deal with. Ajahn Chah said that when we first come to a monastery, when
        we first start to practise in the true way, we can expect suffering.
        We're going against the stream, and we can expect to feel the pressure
        of the defilements just in the same way as when we go against the wind
        we can feel the force against our bodies. This is a sign we are getting
        somewhere.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wisdom Power Better Than Will Power</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You will find that when suffering
        arises, you have two options. You can either try to escape from the
        suffering or you can investigate it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ajahn Maha Boowa (a contemporary Thai
        meditation master) would only give talks when there was a special
        occasion to do so. I'm pretty sure that when I went to visit him as a
        young monk it must have been such an occasion because he asked one of
        his senior Western monks to translate for the visiting Western monk,
        which was me. Fortunately, I could already speak Thai so I understood
        perfectly what Ajahn Maha Boowa was saying. The story that he told -
        which I took for my own benefit - turned out to be very instructive for
        my whole monastic life.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">He was talking about himself as a young
        monk in the time of Tan Ajahn Mun (Thai meditation master and 'founder'
        of the Thai forest meditation tradition). He was saying that once he had
        malaria and, instead of just laying in bed, in typical Ajahn Maha Boowa
        style he decided to fight it, to battle it and conquer it with his will.
        So he got off the floor, went out of his hut, got a broom, and started
        to sweep even though he was sweating and shaking. Tan Ajahn Mun saw him
        and told him off. Later that evening he gave a talk to the monks saying:
        &quot;There are some people in this monastery who are born boxers and
        they haven't changed&quot;. He was of course alluding to Ajahn Maha
        Boowa who was a boxer when he was a layperson. Ajahn Mun said that's not
        the way of Buddhism. He actually said it is the way of Hindu yogis. The
        way of Buddhism is to investigate suffering, not to fight it. Because if
        you fight you will find that you just get more and more suffering.
        Instead, use wisdom power rather than will power. Wisdom power is always
        much more effective because it's coming from a good place. Will power,
        in nearly all cases, comes from ego, from self, and you cannot expect it
        to produce results if it's coming from such an unfortunate source.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To use wisdom power means remembering
        the Teachings and looking at your experience in the framework of those
        teachings, the framework of the Four Noble Truths. The Lord Buddha
        taught that birth is suffering, old age, sickness and death are
        suffering. And all that goes in between is also suffering. In brief,
        life is suffering. So when suffering comes - as disappointment, as
        frustration, as loneliness or depression, or as wondering what you're
        supposed to be doing - you're seeing here a basic truth of nature which
        every human being, whether in a monastery or outside, must come across
        from time to time in their lives.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are times when you don't know what
        to do because the suffering is so bad. As Ajahn Chah used to say,
        &quot;You cannot go forward, you cannot go back, you cannot stand
        still&quot; - you don't know what to do. This is a beautiful time. It is
        the time you can really understand what the Lord Buddha was talking
        about - about the suffering of life. The thing to do when suffering
        arises is to investigate. To investigate means to watch and to observe
        in silence. You have to watch without interfering, without getting
        involved, because if you get involved you're not watching fully.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It requires courage and strength to
        stand your ground and just watch. One of the things you will see is that
        suffering passes, and it always passes into happiness. This is the play
        of <i>samsara</i> (the perpetual wandering from life to life), the play
        of night and day, the play of warmth and cold. It is the basic duality
        of experience. There is no escape from that in this realm or in any
        other realm. It will always follow you around, this duality of
        experience.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Lord Buddha said that getting what
        you don't want is suffering and not getting what you do want is also
        suffering. I often ask myself, &quot;Just what do I want?&quot; I use
        that as a mantra as I walk along the meditation path, or as I sit if my
        mind is restless. &quot;What do I want?&quot; I've been in this world
        long enough now - forty-eight years - and I have experienced much of
        this world. I wasn't born in a monastery, and from all that I have
        experienced and seen, from all that I have known, I know there is not a
        corner of this world where I can find happiness [1]. By its very nature,
        sensory experience is going to be disappointing, and I know that if I
        ask for something the world can never give me, I will suffer. When I
        crave for something I cannot reach, I know I am just torturing myself
        more than necessary.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Putting Make-Up On The Mirror</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Instead of craving for something else
        you learn to be content with what you have. When you talk about
        contentment you are talking about the Third Noble Truth. The Third Noble
        Truth is letting go of craving. Contentment is the letting go of wanting
        something else. It is learning to be at peace with what you have. This
        is where in this struggle - and it is always a struggle - you can be at
        peace. How can you be content when everything is going wrong? How can
        you be content when the body is on fire with pain? How can you be at
        peace and content when the mind is going crazy with so many thoughts?
        Even in these situations you can find contentment in letting go, letting
        go of the 'controller'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I gave a simile to some Thai's last
        week. I gave this simile to the Thai ladies because some of them are
        very vain - you've all seen the way they dress up when they come to the
        monastery. I told them it's just like when one sees oneself in the
        mirror, and sees this ugly person, but instead of actually doing
        something with one's face, one puts make up on the mirror. One tries to
        make the mirror look good! Of course, it's a complete waste of time. The
        mirror might look good for a while with all the make up on it, but when
        one walks somewhere else and sees another mirror one is back to square
        one again. Putting make up on the mirror is like trying to solve the
        'outside' by craving instead of trying to solve the 'inside' through
        contentment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the last sixteen years I've worked
        hard - extremely hard, as many of you would know - trying to build up
        this monastery. It's been a complete waste of time trying to make a
        perfect monastery, or even trying to make an adequate monastery, because
        it's never good enough. The way that craving works, the Second Noble
        Truth, is to delude you into thinking that if you just try and do a
        little bit more, if you just strive harder, work harder for just one
        more day, then everything will be O.K. &quot;I'll just work another year
        and I'll pay off my mortgage.&quot; &quot;I'll just sit for one more
        retreat, that's all I need, and I'll get my <i>Jhanas.</i>&quot;
        &quot;There's this one last course of medicine then I'll be healthy
        again.&quot; You might put off sickness for a while, but you'll never
        escape it. It's just the nature of the body. You might put off suffering
        for a while, but you'll never escape it in that way. You're just putting
        it off.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Happiness And Suffering Of The
        Senses Are Just Contrast - That's All</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the nature of a human being to get
        suffering and happiness in roughly equal proportions. If we're suffering
        now, it's because of some happiness that we had before and lost.
        Happiness is no more than the end of suffering, just as suffering is no
        more than the end of happiness. We go around in this cycle throughout
        our lives.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This existential fact is why the Lord
        Buddha says in the First Noble Truth that the five aggregates <i>(khandhas)</i>
        that make up a human being are suffering. By their very nature they are
        suffering. So, if anyone comes for an interview with me and says she is
        having a terrible time, often I want to say, &quot;Of course, what's
        wrong with that?&quot; Ajahn Chah used to say it's like someone who goes
        into the army to become a soldier, and then goes on to complain about
        being shot at and being wounded. What do you expect when you join the
        army? That's what happens. What do you expect when you become a human
        being? It's suffering.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes in the world, people run away
        from suffering, they hide from it. You ask them how they are and they
        say, &quot;I'm doing fine today&quot;, even though they are going
        through divorces, psychotherapy, chemotherapy or the like. They keep on
        saying they are 'fine' because that is what we are supposed to say in
        this world. That's what's expected of us. If only people were really
        honest, you'd ask them how they are and they'd say, &quot;I'm bloomin
        awful today - I've got a headache, I've got a stomach ache, the family
        is causing me all sorts of trouble, I feel rotten.&quot; If most people
        were honest, that's what they would say. If they really knew what was
        going on, that's what they would say. There's nothing wrong with
        recognising the suffering of existence. It's being honest and having the
        courage to face up to the truth.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">How many people do you know who are
        happy - really happy, really content? Not just people who say they are
        happy but people who really are happy. The only people I have ever seen
        in my forty-eight years of life who are happy are the Enlightened Ones <i>(Arahants)</i>
        whom I have had the good fortune to meet. Other than that, nobody! When
        you understand this you understand the First Noble Truth, that the very
        nature of life is suffering, and you understand it in the very deepest
        of senses.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have this world of the five senses.
        When we analyse it in the way the Lord Buddha asked us to, we use wisdom
        to ask, &quot;Well, what is this world anyway, this world is made up of
        sight, sound, taste, touch, smell, and mind?&quot; When we analyse it in
        that way, we can see that what we see, hear, taste, and touch by their
        very nature are part of the duality of happiness and suffering. Even the
        food we get here which is so wonderful, after a while it's not good
        enough. If we had rotten food here as I had in my first years of being a
        monk, after a while we would get to like it. It's just contrast, that's
        all. The happiness and suffering of the senses are just contrast.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I've known people who went to great
        restaurants, and because the food wasn't quite up to the standard it was
        the week before, they got upset and complained. Whereas other people
        would be glad just to get anything to eat because they hadn't eaten for
        days. With the same food, why is it that some people find it joyful and
        others find it full of suffering? Just contrast, that's all!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whatever you take to be happiness in the
        world is all of the same nature. Take sexual happiness, most of that is
        just the excitement of wanting beforehand. When that happiness is
        reached it becomes exhausted in no time. Sexual desire is basically a
        hunger, a thirst, a state of separation from what you want, and you take
        that to be happiness! What the Buddha said is suffering, you take to be
        happiness!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's craving you take to be happiness.
        But actually, the craving, the thirst, the stressing out to try and
        reach something that is always beyond your grasp, is suffering. Wanting
        is suffering. The trying to achieve what you want, the manipulating, the
        thinking, the planning, that's all suffering.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">How much time have you wasted in this
        rains retreat planning, manipulating and thinking about how you can get
        what you want? How much more freedom would you have if you had no wants
        at all and didn't need to plan? When all the manipulation or craving is
        abandoned, can you understand the peace and contentment that will come
        then?</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pulling Out The Thorn</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Often, when there is great pain in the
        body, or when there is great disturbance in the mind, a skilful
        meditator can just say 'stop'! They can let go in a moment and stop
        fighting, stop craving, stop trying to control. But when you experience
        great pain you may think you are going crazy and fight even more. Ask
        yourself, what's wrong with being in great pain or being greatly
        disappointed? The answer is, nothing is wrong. Such things are a natural
        part of life. They are unavoidable. So, let go of the 'controller'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you let go of the controller and
        stop craving, a strange thing happens. The madness stops and the pain
        disappears. I had that happen to me with great pain once. Every monastic
        has to come across this sooner or later. Some just want to run away, but
        they know they can't. It's a case of wanting to go forward, but you
        can't go forward, wanting to go backwards, but you can't go backwards,
        wanting to stay still, but you can't stay still. You don't know what to
        do! You can't go forward, you can't go back, you can't stay still - this
        is where you let go. When you do let go, you find out that half of the
        suffering was the fighting.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Lord Buddha said there are two
        thorns which cause suffering in a human being (see SN,36,6). The first
        thorn is the thorn of the five senses which is physical suffering. The
        second thorn is the mental thorn. There's the thorn of having sickness,
        having pain, and having to hear, see, taste, smell, and touch unpleasant
        things. Then there is the proliferation which goes around that, which is
        mental pain. It's very important here to notice the physical pain -
        seeing what you don't want to see, hearing what you don't want to hear,
        and doing what you don't want to do. And it's important to recognise
        there's not much you can do about that. For example, when I was a young
        monk I thought if I ever became an abbot, it would be fine because I
        could always do what I wanted to do. I could give all the orders, and
        I'd only give the orders I wanted to. Ironically, I found out that the
        more authority I had, the more of a prison I was in! I couldn't just do
        what I wanted. I had responsibility. I was even more controlled by the
        situation than before. So in the end I realised I had to give up trying
        to control, trying to somehow make things different.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let go, just be with the present moment.
        You will find out that if you can let go of the pain and allow it to be,
        the whole situation changes. The first time I did this as a monk in
        Thailand was with a toothache. As soon as I let go the pain disappeared.
        It was quite a remarkable event in my monastic life to see intense pain
        suddenly go - just through wisdom power. Ajahn Chah and other great
        monks, following the Lord Buddha, always taught the Third Noble Truth as
        a way to end suffering, that is to let go of craving. They kept on
        saying it again and again, but theory is never as powerful as practise.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you really let go, the whole problem
        just caves in - it fades and disappears. This is a beautiful moment of
        insight. Not insight based on thinking or theory, but insight based on
        experience. For a moment you let go of suffering because you don't
        fight. Thus the Second and Third Noble Truths are not just something to
        be thought about, written about, and theorised about, they are to be
        practised, especially the Third Noble Truth about letting go.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is why in this monastery I have
        been teaching meditation aimed at letting go of the 'controller',
        particularly in deeper meditation when we can carelessly get too
        involved in trying to make the breath quiet or make some mental images <i>(nimitta)</i>
        appear and move it this way or that. What are we doing that for? - or
        rather, what's doing it? As we look deeper and deeper into the problem,
        we might have enough wisdom and enough courage to let go. Every
        meditator who has ever come to me and said that they got into a deep
        meditation always says that it was because they let go of something -
        that 'controller', that 'doer'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You can only teach the Four Noble Truths
        deeply once a person has done a lot of meditation, because suffering,
        its cause, and the end of suffering, can only be seen through practise,
        through letting go of suffering. When you are meditating you are letting
        go of the world. You are letting go of one thorn, the physical thorn of
        suffering, for a short while, by going into the world of the mind.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Revulsion Towards This Thing We Call
        Existence</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Lord Buddha kept on saying that the
        five aggregates are suffering. I know some monks who say it is just
        attachment to the five aggregates that is suffering, not the aggregates
        themselves. You just chanted the <i>Anattalakkhana Sutta </i>(the
        Discourse on Non-Self; Mv,I,6,38-47), a very beautiful <i>Sutta </i>which
        does say quite clearly that it's not just the attachment to the
        aggregates that is suffering: it's form <i>(rupa)</i>,<i> </i>this body
        itself, that <b>is </b>suffering, feeling <i>(vedana)</i><b> is</b>
        suffering, perception<i> (sañña)</i>, consciousness<i> (viññana)</i>
        and mental formations <i>(sankhara)<b> </b></i><b>are</b> suffering. All
        formations are suffering (<i>sabbe sankhara dukkha</i>; AN,III,134).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you see this, you get revulsion <i>(nibbida)</i>
        to these aggregates. Revulsion means that you see that the five
        aggregates are just a bunch of suffering. To really see it means that
        you get fed up, you get disinterested, you get repulsed from these five
        aggregates! Not just from one of them but from all five, especially the
        mental aggregates. Why do you always want to go out into the world and
        get more feeling, more sensations, and more experience? &quot;Let's go
        out and see a movie and get more experience. Let's go out and get a
        wife, get a husband, and have children. You haven't lived until you've
        had kids&quot;, so people say. That's stupid! That's just getting more
        feeling to be worried about, to be concerned about, and to torture
        yourself with. The whole point of the practise of Buddhism as expressed
        in the Third Noble Truth is to try and let go of feeling, to try and let
        go of perception, to try and calm mental formations<i> </i>and to try
        and eliminate consciousness, to bring it all to an end.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes I get into trouble when I say
        that consciousness is suffering. I like to use the metaphor for
        consciousness of a television screen. When you really investigate it,
        you see that this is not one 'television set' with six different
        programs on it, ie. sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch and mental
        phenomena, but it's six completely different types of televisions with
        only one type of program on each. This is where you actually see what
        consciousness truly is. When there is consciousness there will be
        suffering. &quot;Consciousness is the condition for suffering&quot; <i>(</i>v<i>iññana
        paccaya dukkha),</i> as is stated in the <i>Sutta Nipata</i> (734-735).
        If you know this, you know the danger <i>(adinava)</i> in consciousness,
        and then you get revulsion towards consciousness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The world, life, no matter how you
        arrange it, always ends up in suffering. You get your share of
        happiness, then suffering, then happiness, then suffering, in whatever
        realm. Even if you get into the bliss of <i>Jhanas </i>it doesn't last,
        you have to come out afterwards. You have a beautiful two-week retreat,
        and when you come out, you find your disciples are going up the wall and
        you've got work to do. No matter how high you get on your retreat,
        you've got to come down.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is just the nature of life. So what
        we actually see when we use wisdom power is that wherever we go in the
        world, no matter what we do, ultimately all we have is suffering. Ajahn
        Chah used to tell the story of the mangy dog. It itches so much that it
        goes into the sun to try to get rid of the mange. It doesn't go away, so
        it goes into the rain. The itch doesn't go away, so it goes under a
        rock, into the forest, into the village, but of course, wherever it goes
        it always takes the mange with it. It doesn't matter where we go in this
        world, or in other worlds, that suffering which we experience now will
        go with us. There is no escape in that way because suffering is inherent
        to human existence and even to the existence of the <i>devas </i>(heavenly
        beings).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whether you get into <i>Jhanas </i>or
        you don't, there is still suffering. After a while of looking at all the
        different aspects and all the different types of happiness to be found
        in the world - sex, drugs, rock'n'roll, even right up to the high
        meditative happinesses - you see that each one of them are by their very
        nature impermanent and are therefore conducive to suffering. After a
        while you realise what the Lord Buddha was saying: form is suffering,
        feeling is suffering, perception, mental formations, and consciousness
        are suffering - the whole caboodle is suffering.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you truly see suffering, and that
        wherever you go suffering will be with you, then you get revulsion
        towards this thing we call existence. You find that whether it's in the <i>deva
        </i>realms or in the hell realms or in the human realm, it's just like
        the dog going to different places to get rid of the itch. It's just that
        some realms hurt more than others, but all realms hurt. When the <i>Jhana
        </i>realms fall apart, there comes the hurt and pain. The higher the
        happiness you have, the more suffering there is when that happiness
        disappears. It's like people in the world, the more they love someone,
        the more they suffer when that person dies. The more you love your
        existence in the great <i>Jhana </i>realms, in the higher <i>deva </i>realms
        <i>(brahmaloka),</i> the more suffering there is when that existence
        collapses and disappears. This is the nature of experience. After a
        while you realise that the whole purpose of the Buddha's teaching is to
        end suffering through the ending of birth - to find the cause for birth
        and to eliminate that cause.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why Would You Crave For Suffering</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As to this particular life you have now,
        you're stuck with it. If you try to end it prematurely you just get
        another life, and you have to go through the whole thing all over again.
        That's not the way to end life, through suicide. You end life through
        cutting off craving, cutting off the cause. If you investigate things
        according to Dependent Origination <i>(Paticca Samuppada)</i>, you will
        see how rebirth occurs and what this process is that makes you go into
        another life in the future. You are already fueling that process now
        from the delusion of a self and from the delusion that there is some
        happiness somewhere in the world. You crave based on the lie that
        somewhere, some place, there can be happiness, there can be fulfillment,
        there can be what you really want. What you are really looking for in
        the world, &quot;It's over there somewhere&quot;, so you think. For that
        reason you crave.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you knew there is no happiness in the
        world - no place, no where - why would you crave? All sorts of craving
        would be taken away. If you really saw that &quot;all formations are
        suffering&quot; if you could actually understand and accept this fully,
        that would be the end of craving. Why would you crave for <i>dukkha</i>?
        You only crave for what you assume to be happiness. This 'happiness' has
        been burning you for lifetime, after lifetime, after lifetime.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When I ask myself what I really want, I
        always get the same answer. What I really want is more <i>dukkha</i>.
        &quot;Stupid monk, shut up!&quot; Seeing that you're looking and
        searching for more <i>dukkha</i>,<i> </i>is a good way to end wanting.
        You actually see that the illusion <i>(avijja)</i> is that you think
        you're going to get happiness. Again, if you see with clear
        understanding that what you really want is suffering, you can give up
        wanting. What do you want in the world anyway? What do you <b>really</b>
        want? What you are asking for is just more suffering. Let go!</font></p>
        <b><font color="#00007f">
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Renunciation Leads To Peace</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you've been meditating, you find
        that the most happy times, the times when you've come closest to real
        happiness, are when you've been content. You find in your life that you
        can be happy with such a small amount. In fact, the less you have, the
        happier you can be. That's why the path of renunciation and letting go
        overcomes craving. It's the path of the Third Noble Truth - renunciation
        leads to peace.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Practise that principle in your life.
        Every time there is some suffering, that is where you have to renounce.
        What are you hanging onto anyway? Give up something, let go of
        something, be content. As soon as you are content the problem is solved.
        You don't need to think about it, just be at peace with whatever
        happens. Who knows, maybe the mob has been hired to come and beat me up
        tonight. O.K., I can handle that. Whatever happens to you, if you know
        contentment, then you know the path to freedom from suffering.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the Third Noble Truth. Don't
        just think about it, practise it - let go of craving. If ever there is a
        problem in your meditation or in your life, instead of trying other
        solutions to overcome suffering, try 'The Third Noble Truth Solution' -
        let go of something, let go of craving. Again, you're craving for
        something, and that is causing suffering, so abandon it. Find out what
        you want, what you really want, and you'll know what's causing you to
        suffer. Give it up!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I want to be healthy&quot;, - give
        it up! Just be content being sick. &quot;O.K. I'm sick. Let's see how
        sick I can be!&quot; That sort of attitude really gets <i>Mara </i>[2]<i>
        </i>worried. When you do things like that, the reply comes back,
        &quot;Come on, don't be stupid, you'll get even more sick and it will
        hurt even more.&quot; See how sick you can be. That's the sort of
        contentment which goes in the opposite direction of craving. This is
        what release is.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Don't Make Any Future Houses</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Blinded by illusion, fettered by
        craving&quot;, we actually take up and create our 'houses' for the
        future (see Dhp,153-154). That creating a house for the future is <i>bhava</i>
        (literally 'existence'). Its like when we are building huts here in the
        monastery; we have to build the hut before someone can move into it. We
        build our next existence in this life through illusion and craving. We
        are making the <i>kamma </i>(volitional actions) and creating the <i>bhava</i>
        for the next life. We're just creating a house for the future.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's why you've heard - and it comes
        straight from the Buddha's teachings - that for people who make great
        merit there is a heavenly mansion <i>(vimana)</i> already waiting for
        them in a heavenly realm. For those who are creating bad <i>kamma </i>the
        pots of boiling liquid are already being heated up for them, waiting for
        them to fall down into hell. You are already creating your house for the
        future.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you really are a homeless one, an <i>anagarika</i>,
        you should not just sell your existing house in this world but make sure
        you're not making any future houses for your fantasies, dreams, and
        hopes for some sort of happiness at some time in the future. Again, with
        those dreams and fantasies you're actually creating the conditions,
        you're building the house, building the state of existence where you'll
        find rebirth. Don't underestimate the power of the mind to create realms
        of existence. &quot;Mind is the forerunner and mind is the chief&quot;
        (Dhp,1-2). Mind is the main thing. The world exists in the mind. The
        mind can create whole worlds, whole universes, whole states of existence
        through illusion and craving.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Lord Buddha kept on saying that
        because you've been fed up, because you've been depressed until you've
        gone crazy, because this thing has happened to you and because that
        thing has happened to you, you've cried more tears in all of your
        existences than the water in all the oceans of the world (SN,15,3).
        That's a lot of tears you've shed and a lot of crying you've done. When
        are you going to stop filling up the oceans? When are your bones going
        to stop filling up the graveyards? When you see the Four Noble Truths,
        that's when.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Lord Buddha said that once you've
        seen the Four Noble Truths and seen the inherent suffering of life, you
        get revulsion coming up - this beautiful, wonderful revulsion, which
        does not seek for escape outside, but seeks for escape inside instead.
        You're not like that dog with the mange trying to go somewhere else to
        get rid of the mange, and you're not like a dog trying to kill itself to
        get rid of the mange. Instead you're trying to be content with the
        mange, learning to live with rather than against. You find that when you
        can be content with the mange, the mange disappears. Through craving
        you've known suffering. From fully seeing suffering you get revulsion.
        From revulsion comes dispassion <i>(viraga)</i>. Dispassion is the
        fading away of everything, things disappearing, going, ending. It is
        wonderful when you start to see things disappear, the whole world fading
        away and vanishing into emptiness. It's marvelous to know things
        vanishing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I remember as a young man travelling in
        the south of Mexico to a town called Oaxaca. It was the centre of the
        mushroom culture, but I wasn't interested in mushrooms and I wasn't
        taking them either, because I was already a Buddhist by that time. I
        remember getting a mental image <i>(nimitta) </i>while in a room and
        seeing the walls and the ceiling become like butter and just melt and
        disappear into nothingness. That was quite scary at the time. But it was
        just a sign that I was beginning to understand what perception is all
        about and allowing things to disappear, fade, and go empty.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">All of this which you take to be real is
        an illusion. As the Lord Buddha said, this body of yours is just like
        froth on the river Ganges (SN,22,95). You poke it and there's nothing
        really there. It's not yours, it's just a body. Just blood and bones
        made up of food. You look at feeling, and it's just like a raindrop
        hitting a puddle. During my retreat - during one of the rainstorms -
        when I came to the end of my walking path under my verandah, there was
        heavy rain. There was a puddle there and there was froth on one side and
        little bubbles coming from the drips in the gutter. I thought to myself
        that this froth is just like my body, and the little bubbles caused by
        the drops of water hitting the puddle is all feeling is. Happy feeling<i>,
        </i>unhappy feeling, in between, pop! - and it's gone; another one, and
        another one, and another one, completely uncertain and beyond my
        control. You know that sometimes you will feel happy and that sometimes
        unhappy, and there's nothing you can do about it in this life. It's just
        nature.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Joy at last to know there's no
        happiness in the world.&quot; That means there is nothing wrong with
        you. When you actually understand this, you can let go of this building
        up of more worlds. When you understand it, then, in meditation, you make
        the world more and more simple. And how much more simple can you make it
        than by getting into a deep meditation where there's hardly anything
        left? Sometimes you can get to the point where there's only the breath
        left, and that's the only thing left in the whole world. That's pretty
        neat! Sometimes you can let go of the breath, and you've only got a
        mental image left, just a beautiful 'light' in the mind. It's not going
        away and it's completely stable. That's beautiful! That's probably the
        best bliss you've ever experienced. But go deeper and you get into <i>Jhana
        </i>which is complete, unchanging, completely satisfying, very simple,
        and really blissful.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's great to be able to reflect on the <i>Jhanas</i>.
        First <i>Jhana </i>is so much less than you had before. You've given up
        so much. There's hardly anything of existence left, just this small
        little blip called First <i>Jhana</i>. You enter into Second <i>Jhana, </i>and
        there's only half a blip left. You're hardly there, and you can hardly
        say that you exist. You're not doing anything. You're like a rock,
        stable, still. There's nothing much going on because you've given up so
        much. There's just this last little vestige of consciousness remaining.
        You find that's the most blissful experience so far. When you get into
        Third <i>Jhana </i>you've given up even more. You really get into this
        giving up business. You really get off on it. You really get off on
        renunciation <i>(nekkhamma)</i>. You can't wait to give up more:
        &quot;How much more can I give up?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You realise this is the path to
        liberation from suffering - letting go. You understand why - because
        deep down there is no one in here. When there is no owner, your
        possessions are free for anyone to take. When there is no owner nature
        can go right ahead and take your happiness and give you suffering,
        because you know it's going to take your suffering and give you
        happiness later on. These things don't belong to you.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">All of our joys and depressions, our
        wisdom and craziness, don't belong to anybody - it's all just nature.
        That's all there is. So we can let go and learn to live with it, because
        we know it's going to change. Every time we get down, we know we're
        going to get up again soon. Every time we get up, we know we're going to
        get down again. It's just the nature of us. That's why we can smile when
        we're down because we know it's not going to last. That's why we can be
        peaceful when we're up because we know that's not going to last either.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is how to deal with suffering and
        to learn to let go of things - understanding that the more you give up,
        the more happiness you have. It takes time though; you've got to give
        yourself time to be able to do these things, you have to be patient.
        It's a natural process and each one of you already has enough of a
        start. You've experienced enough suffering in this world; so don't go
        looking for happiness in the wrong places, otherwise you will just find
        more suffering. Don't be like the mangy dog. Just sit down and stay in
        one place, and watch the suffering just disappear all by itself without
        you doing anything. The best thing to do when you go through
        difficulties as a monk, as a nun, or as an <i>anagarika,</i> is just to
        stay still and not move.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Do as the Lord Buddha in the <i>Bhayabherava
        Sutta</i> (MN,4). If he was walking and fear came, he would carry on
        walking until the fear left and only then would he change to another
        posture. If he was sitting he wouldn't get up, he would just stay there
        until the fear subsided. If he was lying or standing, it was the same.
        Let it be the same when you get any suffering in your life. Don't change
        your position. What I am talking about here is don't do anything
        different, just carry on, and I guarantee whatever suffering you
        experience will just disappear. You'll find that suffering has got
        nothing to do with how you try and manipulate it. It's got nothing to do
        with the monastery, with your body, with your health, with your age, or
        with whatever. That's just what suffering does, it comes and goes all by
        itself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whatever you are, whatever you do, it's
        the nature of suffering - it just comes when it wants to. Uninvited it
        comes, and it leaves without permission. It will go when it wants to go,
        not when you want it to go. In fact, the more you want it to go, the
        longer it will stay. It's perverse like that. Actually, if you invite it
        in and allow it to stay, it can't stand you any longer and it goes away.
        That's the nature of suffering.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But it's particularly important to know
        deeply that the five aggregates of themselves, even consciousness, are
        suffering. The less you are conscious of, the more peaceful you are. <i>Jhanas
        </i>are the highest happinesses you can experience until you let go
        completely and reach the attainment of cessation <i>(nirodha samapatti)</i>
        where there is no consciousness at all. The five aggregates just stop
        for a while. Once those five aggregates have stopped and you come out
        afterwards, you have to know - there's no other way - that consciousness
        is suffering, perception is suffering, feeling is suffering, the body is
        suffering, mental formations are suffering, birth is suffering, and life
        is suffering. So when you suffer it just proves the Buddha was right.
        Also, you know that the more you can let go, the less suffering you
        have. That too just proves the Buddha was right again. If you can let go
        completely, you know the cause of all future suffering is finally
        overcome.</font></p>

        </font></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <i>Anattalakkhana Sutta</i>
        (Mv,I,6,38-47) the Lord Buddha says that from revulsion comes dispassion
        - when you get fed up with these five aggregates they start to fade. And
        from dispassion comes freedom <i>(vimutti)</i>. You know from that
        freedom that you're not building any more houses. You have completely
        abandoned everything. You know that birth is destroyed. You've just this
        life to live. You're like a workman waiting for his wages (see
        Thag,1003). You've done your work, and you know there is no more
        existence in the future for you. That in itself is great happiness - to
        know that whatever suffering you have to experience between now and the
        dissolution of the aggregates <i>(parinibbana)</i> is just that much,
        and that's the last of the suffering that you have to experience in <i>samsara</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you haven't attained that or if you
        haven't entered the stream, it means the suffering ahead of you in <i>samsara</i>
        is endless - life after life of going through the same old thing. But
        don't blame anyone else for your suffering, and don't blame yourself.
        It's the very nature of existence. Just apply the Third Noble Truth of
        letting go or the Fourth Noble Truth of the practices of morality <i>(sila),
        </i>sustained attention <i>(samadhi)</i> and wisdom <i>(pañña)</i>.
        Keep precepts and you lessen suffering. Develop sustained attention,
        gentleness, persistence and stability of mind and you lessen suffering
        even more. Develop wisdom and you end suffering.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">[1] It is important to realise that
        although one speaks about the alternation of happiness and suffering in
        life, ultimately its all suffering. An experience you now perceive as
        happiness due to some previous suffering, may be perceived as suffering
        later on in comparison to an even greater happiness. Thus, in the
        broadest sense, all experience is suffering.</font></p>

        'tempter' - He appears in the texts both as a real person (ie. as a
        deity) and as the personification of evil and passions, of the totality
        of worldly existence and of death.&quot; See: Nyanatiloka Thera,
        Buddhist Dictionary (4th Rev. Ed.), (Kandy, Sri Lanka, Buddhist
