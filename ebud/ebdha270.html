      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">Q</FONT>uite contradictory views have been 
      expressed in Western literature on the attitude of Buddhism toward the 
      concept of God and gods. From a study of the discourses of the Buddha 
      preserved in the Pali Canon, it will be seen that the idea of a //personal 
      diety//, a creator god conceived to be eternal and omnipotent, is 
      incompatible with the Buddha's teachings. On the other hand, conceptions 
      of an //impersonal godhead// of any description, such as world-soul, etc., 
      are excluded by the Buddha's teachings on Anatta, non-self or 
      unsubstantiality.<P>In Buddhist literature, the belief in a creator god 
      (//issara-nimmana-vada//) is frequently mentioned and rejected, along with 
      other causes wrongly adduced to explain the origin of the world; as, for 
      instance, world-soul, time, nature, etc. God-belief, however, is placed in 
      the same category as those morally destructive wrong views which deny the 
      kammic results of action, assume a fortuitous origin of man and nature, or 
      teach absolute determinism. These views are said to be altogether 
      pernicious, having definite bad results due to their effect on ethical 
      conduct.</P>
      <P>Theism, however, is regarded as a kind of kamma-teaching in so far as 
      it upholds the moral efficacy of actions. Hence a theist who leads a moral 
      life may, like anyone else doing so, expect a favourable rebirth. He may 
      possibly even be reborn in a heavenly world that resembles his own 
      conception of it, though it will not be of eternal duration as he may have 
      expected. If, however, fanaticism induces him to persecute those who do 
      not share his beliefs, this will have grave consequences for his future 
      destiny. For fanatical attitudes, intolerance, and violence against others 
      create unwholesome kamma leading to moral degeneration and to an unhappy 
      rebirth.</P>
      <P>Although belief in God does not exclude a favourable rebirth, it is a 
      variety of eternalism, a false affirmation of permanence rooted in the 
      craving for existence, and as such an obstacle to final deliverance.</P>
      <P>Among the fetters (//samyojana//) that bind to existence, theism is 
      particularly subject to those of personality-belief, attachment to rites 
      and rituals, and desire for fine-material existence or for a &quot;heaven of 
      the sense sphere,&quot; as the case may be.</P>
      <P>As an attempt at explaining the universe, its origin, and man's 
      situation in his world, the God-idea was found entirely unconvincing by 
      the Buddhist thinkers of old. Through the centuries, Buddhist philosophers 
      have formulated detailed arguments refuting the doctrine of a creator god. 
      It should be of interest to compare these with the ways in which Western 
      philosophers have refuted the theological proofs of the existence of God.</P>
      <P>But for an earnest believer, the God-idea is more than a mere device 
      for explaining external facts like the origin of the world. For him it is 
      an object of faith that can bestow a strong feeling of certainty, not only 
      as to God's existence &quot;somewhere out there,&quot; but as to God's consoling 
      presence and closeness to himself. This feeling of certainty requires 
      close scrutiny. Such scrutiny will reveal that in most cases the God-idea 
      is only the devotee's projection of his ideal - generally a noble one - 
      and of his fervent wish and deeply felt need to believe. These projections 
      are largely conditioned by external influences, such as childhood 
      impressions, education, tradition and social environment. Charged with a 
      strong emotional emphasis, brought to life by man's powerful capacity for 
      image-formation, visualization and the creation of myth, they then come to 
      be identified with the images and concepts of whatever religion the 
      devotee follows. In the case of many of the most sincere believers, a 
      searching analysis would show that their &quot;God-experience&quot; has no more 
      specific content than this.</P>
      <P>Yet the range and significance of God-belief and God-experience are not 
      fully exhausted by the preceding remarks. The lives and writings of the 
      mystics of all great religions bear witness to religious experiences of 
      great intensity, in which considerable changes are effected in the quality 
      of consciousness. Profound absorption in prayer or meditation can bring 
      about a deepening and widening, a brightening and intensifying of 
      consciousness, accompanied by a transporting feeling of rapture and bliss. 
      The contrast between these states and normal conscious awareness is so 
      great that the mystic believes his experience to be manifestations of the 
      divine; and given the contrast, this assumption is quite understandable. 
      Mystical experiences are also characterised by a marked reduction or 
      temporary exclusion of the multiplicity of sense-perceptions and restless 
      thoughts, and this relative unification of mind is then interpreted as a 
      union or communion with the One God. All these deeply moving impressions 
      and the first spontaneous interpretations the mystic subsequently 
      identifies with his particular theology. It is interesting to note, 
      however, that the attempts of most great Western mystics to relate their 
      mystical experiences to the official dogmas of their respective churches 
      often resulted in teachings which were often looked upon askance by the 
      orthodox, if not considered downright heretical.</P>
      <P>The psychological facts underlying those religious experiences are 
      accepted by the Buddhist and well-known to him; but he carefully 
      distinguishes the experiences themselves from the theological 
      interpretations imposed upon them. After rising from deep meditative 
      absorption (//jhana//), the Buddhist meditator is advised to view the 
      physical and mental factors constituting his experience in the light of 
      the three characteristics of all conditioned existence: impermanency, 
      liability to suffering, and absence of an abiding ego or eternal 
      substance. This is done primarily in order to utilize the meditative 
      purity and strength of consciousness for the highest purpose: liberating 
      insight. But this procedure also has a very important side-effect which 
      concerns us here: the meditator will not be overwhelmed by any 
      uncontrolled emotions and thoughts evoked by his singular experience, and 
      will thus be able to avoid interpretations of that experience not 
      warranted by the facts.</P>
      <P>Hence a Buddhist meditator, while benefiting by the refinement of 
      consciousness he has achieved, will be able to see these meditative 
      experiences for what they are; and he will further know that they are 
      without any abiding substance that could be attributed to a deity 
      manifesting itself to the mind. Therefore, the Buddhist's conclusion must 
      be that the highest mystic states do not provide evidence for the 
      existence of a personal God or an impersonal godhead.</P>
      <P>Buddhism has sometimes been called an atheistic teaching, either in an 
      approving sense by freethinkers and rationalists, or in a derogatory sense 
      by people of theistic persuasion. Only in one way can Buddhism be 
      described as atheistic, namely, in so far as it denies the existence of an 
      eternal, omnipotent God or godhead who is the creator and ordainer of the 
      world. The word &quot;atheism,&quot; however, like the word &quot;godless,&quot; frequently 
      carries a number of disparaging overtones or implications, which in no way 
      apply to the Buddha's teaching.</P>
      <P>Those who use the word &quot;atheism&quot; often associate it with a 
      materialistic doctrine that knows nothing higher than this world of the 
      senses and the slight happiness it can bestow. Buddhism is nothing of that 
      sort. In this respect it agrees with the teachings of other religions, 
      that true lasting happiness cannot be found in this world; nor, the Buddha 
      adds, can it be found on any higher plane of existence, conceived as a 
      heavenly or divine world, since all planes of existence are impermanent 
      and thus incapable of giving lasting bliss. The spiritual values advocated 
      by Buddhism are directed, not towards a new life in some higher world, but 
      towards a state utterly transcending the world, namely, Nibbana. In making 
      this statement, however, we must point out that Buddhist spiritual calues 
      do not draw an absolute separation between the beyond and the here and 
      now. They have firm roots in the world itself for they aim at the highest 
      realization in this present existence. Along with such spiritual 
      aspirations, Buddhism encourages earnest endeavor to make this world a 
      better place to live in.</P>
      <P>The materialistic philosophy of annihilationism (//ucchedavada//) is 
      emphatically rejected by the Buddha as a false doctrine. The doctrine of 
      kamma is sufficient to prove that Buddhism does not teach annihilation 
      after death. It accepts survival, not of an eternal soul, but of a mental 
      process subject to renewed becoming; thus it teaches rebirth without 
      transmigration. Again, the Buddha's teaching is not a nihilism that gives 
      suffering humanity no better hope than a final cold nothingness. On the 
      contrary, it is a teaching of salvation (//niyyanika-dhamma//) or 
      deliverance (//vimutti//) which attributes to man the faculty to realize 
      by his own efforts the highest goal, Nibbana, the ultimate cessation of 
      suffering and the final eradication of greed, hatred and delusion. Nibbana 
      is far from being the blank zero of annihilation; yet it also cannot be 
      identified with any form of God-idea, as it is neither the origin nor the 
      immanent ground or essence of the world.</P>
      <P>Buddhism is not an enemy of religion as atheism is believed to be. 
      Buddhism, indeed, is the enemy of none. A Buddhist will recognize and 
      appreciate whatever ethical, spiritual and cultural values have been 
      created by God-belief in its long and chequered history. We cannot, 
      however, close our eyes to the fact that the God-concept has served too 
      often as a cloak for man's will to power, and the reckless and cruel use 
      of that power, thus adding considerably to the ample measure of misery in 
      this world supposed to be an all-loving God's creation. For centuries free 
      thought, free research and the expression of dissident views were 
      obstructed and stifled in the name of service to God. And alas, these and 
      other negative consequences are not yet entirely things of the past.</P>
      <P>The word &quot;atheism&quot; also carries the innuendo of an attitude 
      countenancing moral laxity, or a belief that man-made ethics, having no 
      divine sanction, rest on shaky foundations. For Buddhism, however, the 
      basic moral law is inherent in life itself. It is a special case of the 
      law of cause and effect, needing neither a divine law-giver nor depending 
      upon the fluctuating human conceptions of socially conditioned minor 
      moralities and conventions. For an increasing section of humanity, the 
      belief in God is breaking down rapidly, as well as the accustomed 
      motivations for moral conduct. This shows the risk of basing moral 
      postulates on divine commandments, when their alleged source rapidly loses 
      credence and authority. There is a need for an autonomous foundation for 
      ethics, one that has deeper roots than a social contract and is capable of 
      protecting the security of the individual and of human institutions. 
      Buddhism offers such a foundation for ethics.</P>
      <P>Buddhism does not deny that there are in the universe planes of 
      existence and levels of consciousness which in some ways may be superior 
      to our terrestrial world and to average human consciousness. To deny this 
      would indeed be provincial in this age of space travel. Bertrand Russell 
      rightly says: &quot;It is improbable that the universe contains nothing better 
      than ourselves.&quot;</P>
      <P>Yet, according to Buddhist teachings, such higher planes of existence, 
      like our familiar world, are subject to the law of impermanence and 
      change. The inhabitants of such worlds may well be, in different degrees, 
      more powerful than human beings, happier and longer-lived. Whether we call 
      those superior beings gods, deities, devas or angels is of little 
      importance, since it is improbable that they call themselves by any of 
      those names. They are inhabitants of this universe, fellow-wanderers in 
      this round of existence; and though more powerful, they need not be wiser 
      than man. Further, it need not be denied that such worlds and such beings 
      may have their lord and ruler. In all probability they do. But like any 
      human ruler, a divine ruler too might be inclined to misjudge his own 
      status and power, until a greater one comes along and points out to him 
      his error, as our texts report of the Buddha.</P>
      <P>These, however, are largely matters beyond the range and concern of 
      average human experience. They have been mentioned here chiefly for the 
      purpose of defining the Buddhist position, and not to serve as a topic of 
      speculation and argument. Such involvement can only divert attention and 
      effort from what ought to be our principal object: the overcoming of 
      greed, hatred and delusion where they are found in the here nad now.</P>

      Milinda&quot; says:</P>
