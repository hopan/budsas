      <P ALIGN="center"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>In 2002, Adrian Cambden 
      ordained as an anagarika for a year. <BR>
      This is an extract of his writings.</I></FONT> </P>
      <P ALIGN="center"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">*</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Just outside my village there is a track 
      that leads up into the fields; it is a popular spot for people walking 
      their dogs. I used to regularly pass the track whilst driving to the 
      school at which I taught. Seeing people walking there always made me 
      envious. I thought how happy I would be if I too could be walking freely 
      whilst the rest of the country was going to work.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A year later, under perfect conditions, I 
      was in the monastery. I had breakfasted, it was a glorious day, and I was 
      striding across the fields, whilst the rest of the country was going to 
      work. Observing my feelings, I realised that I felt no different to how I 
      felt at any other time. I didn&#39;t feel excited; I didn&#39;t feel blissful; in 
      fact, if anything, I was in a slightly bad mood. Not at all what I had 
      expected. My fortunate situation had made no difference to how I was 
      feeling. Going for a walk was merely that; it wasn&#39;t the great pleasure 
      that I had anticipated when driving my car to school, an anticipation that 
      had to some extent propelled me from that car into the monastery. And that 
      is what the monastery has taught me - a hard lesson to learn - that 
      outside circumstances don&#39;t necessarily make a difference to how we are 
      feeling. What we carry around inside ourselves dictates how we feel.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When I was a teacher, I was aware that my 
      feelings of unhappiness made everything around me seem cold and gloomy. I 
      had supposed that leaving my job and living a life free of pressure would 
      bring a sense of calm and peace to my mind, but I was wrong. The emotions 
      that arise in us are beyond our control. They have a life of their own. 
      Our internal experience is not what we expect it to be. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The most powerful experience I had in the 
      monastery occurred at this time last year. I had been living there for a 
      year, and had come home for ten days to visit my son Aaron and my ex-wife. 
      It was a confusing time: there were the tugs and pulls from seeing my 
      ex-wife, the house was in a mess, I had financial worries, and Aaron had 
      just received the results of his GCSE&#39;s. He had done so badly that we 
      wondered if he would be able to enter the sixth form. He was frantic, and 
      I got upset while telephoning around to get him onto the courses that he 
      wanted. I put my feelings down to the domestic situation I was in, and 
      assumed that all would be well as soon as I returned to the monastery, 
      where I could breathe a sigh of relief and sink once again into peace and 
      contentment. This was not to be. Terrible confusion reigned, and the pain 
      of the visit home grew into an intense stomach pain, which prevented me 
      from eating properly. I consumed various medications, and although these 
      gave some relief, the deep pain remained. It seemed to go on and on.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After returning to the monastery, Aaron&#39;s 
      housemaster and I remained in email contact. This was not pleasant, 
      because, in spite of all my efforts to get Aaron onto the right courses, 
      and in spite of all his assertions that he had done badly at the exams 
      because the questions &#39;had not been the right ones&#39;, the housemaster told 
      me that he was in fact putting in no effort at all. This from an education 
      that was costing me Â£13,000 per year. Was I angry? Yes, very. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One day, I was sitting in the monk&#39;s 
      common room feeling very uncomfortable, when Ajahn Vajiro walked in. He 
      asked me how my son was getting on, and I let it all pour out. I told him 
      how upset I was. When I had finished, I asked him how this could happen to 
      someone who was well versed in the practice of watching the mind and the 
      emotions. He said that we can&#39;t control our thoughts or feelings. They 
      come into our minds or bodies of their own volition. We don&#39;t choose to 
      have them, they appear by themselves. The only choice we have is whether 
      or not to hold onto them. By observing them but not following them, we can 
      just let them be; we don&#39;t have to add to or empower them.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So, by being angry I had added to the 
      pain: angry about Aaron, and angry that I should still get hurt after 
      having lived so long in the monastery. I had assumed that such emotions 
      would drop away with practice, after so much peace and quiet. Yet it was 
      the same as it used to be; in fact, if anything, it was worse. I wondered 
      if I was wasting my time in the monastery, or if perhaps the problem was 
      me. Either way, I still had a very long way to go.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In 2003 the problems at home meant I had 
      to return to lay life, to the life of a teacher. I was offered a job in a 
      well-disciplined and well organised school, with few difficult students, 
      and in which I would earn good, steady money. Of course, there would 
      occasionally be a challenging class, but that is part of the great 
      discipline of teaching. I was fresh out of the monastery; I wasn&#39;t tired 
      and jaded like some of those I saw around me. I was enthusiastic. But 
      fairly soon, I was back to feeling how I used to feel: bad. Being a 
      57-year-old man, what could I do? I had no qualifications to pursue 
      another career. I would have liked a simpler job, but simpler jobs pay 
      badly. To add to this was an emotion that I had not expected. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I am a mature adult with a liberal 
      understanding of the world, and do not care about social status - or so I 
      thought. But when I decided that I was no longer going to be a teacher, 
      the anticipation of a fall in status hit me hard. If anyone asked me what 
      my job was, I replied that I had just stopped being a teacher, and was 
      looking for something else. A sense of inferiority swept over me. One day 
      Aaron said that he didn&#39;t care whether I was a teacher or not. He said 
      that whatever job I took was okay. I remember how relieved I felt when he 
      said this. I was surprised at how much I had looked for his support. It 
      wasn&#39;t so much my job status that was important, as others&#39; acceptance of 
      my job status.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I am now reasonably settled into two jobs; 
      neither is terribly demanding, and, to put it simply, I am quite enjoying 
      them. And I can&#39;t (if I am honest) put the blame on them for any pressure 
      or fear that I feel inside me. When I was a teacher I often used to wake 
      up at four thirty in the morning and worry about my job and then not get 
      back to sleep again. This made me more and more tired - an affliction that 
      I blamed on my job. But nowadays I still wake up at four thirty in the 
      morning and guess what, I start to worry about my job! I think, &#39;Whoa! 
      Hang on! What have I got to worry about?&#39; And I lie there and watch my 
      mind hunting for something. I would like to offer you a poem that I wrote 
      at the monastery. At that time I was doing the early morning unlocking 
      duty. It&#39;s called Morning Frost:</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Was it the wind or the eye that caused 
        the tear <BR>
        to flow with a sigh down my cold and frosted face?<BR>
        Or was it the still warm memory of yesterday&#39;s call <BR>
        to my son that caused the fall <BR>
        of a liquid memory across the cheek?<BR>
        The key slides into the lock on the dot of four <BR>
        (as the full moon clear beams down upon the monastery floor) <BR>
        and I move quickly from place to place <BR>
        opening to the world this spiritual space.<BR>
        But as I do, my mind is caught twixt night and day <BR>
        as I ponder again what his housemaster had to say <BR>
        and the heat of thought shimmers with the cold of dawn<BR>
        and between these two, slides a tear <BR>
        and I am torn.</FONT> </P>
