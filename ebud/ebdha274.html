      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Ukiah, Calif. (USA) --
      </B>Ajahn Pasanno appears out of the woods, walks up a few steps and 
      plunks himself down in a comfortable wicker chair on the front porch of 
      Abhayagiri &quot;Fearless Mountain&quot; Monastery in Redwood Valley.</FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The day is coming to a close and the peace 
      and the quiet of the place is what is noticeable. The only noise is the 
      distant sound of a lawnmower, which almost seems to come from some other 
      world, a world different from this one. Ajahn, means teacher and is used 
      in place of a first name for the abbot of the monastery. Pasanno means 
      &quot;one having faith and joy,&quot; the name his teacher bestowed on him when he 
      was still a novice.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is difficult to imagine Ajahn as a 
      young man in a secular sense, now that he is of middle age, with a shaved 
      head and clothed in a simple mustard-colored robe. It seems he was always 
      this person he is now. But Ajahn's journey began in the 1970s as a young 
      man when he left his home in Manitoba, Canada after finishing his 
      university studies to travel the far reaches of the world. He rambled 
      through Europe, Afghanistan and India, not seeking to become a Buddhist 
      monk but visiting various holy places along the way.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It wasn't until he arrived in the north of 
      Thailand that he began to feel a sense of belonging. In order to learn 
      more about Buddhism, he attended some classes at a monastery called Wat 
      Nong Bah north of Chiang Mai. &quot;I was just passing through, but the Thai 
      society seemed to have a whole different value system. I felt at home,&quot; he 
      said.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After a month-long stay, the Abbot of the 
      monastery suggested the young man consider ordination with an initial goal 
      of remaining three or four months. Although he was not yet sure what he 
      was getting into, he was willing to give it a try. He took on the robes of 
      a forest dwelling monk thinking it would be only for a short time that was 
      the beginning of the life he still lives now, more than 30 years later.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;You are not required to make a life-long 
      commitment,&quot; Ajahn says, &quot;It just happened.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The monk says he didn't have any intuition 
      that he would lead a monastic life.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;When I began it was to learn how to 
      meditate.&quot; But, he says, &quot;at one point, it didn't seem possible to go 
      back.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus the young monk began a practice where 
      monks wear plain robes and shave their heads in an effort to let go of 
      their own personal preferences.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Doing this, is about simplification,&quot; 
      Ajahn says. &quot;We renounce the world because of the peace that comes from 
      it. The quality of peace we can access and dwell in is deeply satisfying.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;I encourage people that peace and 
      well-being are a possibility for your life - to explore that for your 
      life. I encourage people to use the tools of a virtuous life.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">An Abhayagiri pamphlet lists the &quot;The 
      Eight Precepts&quot; for leading such a life: 1. Harmlessness: not 
      intentionally taking the life of any living creature. 2. Trustworthiness: 
      not taking anything which is not given. 3. Celibacy: refraining from any 
      sexual activity. 4. Right Speech: avoiding false, abusive or malicious 
      speech. 5. Sobriety: not taking any intoxicating drink or drugs. 6. 
      Renunciation: not eating after mid-day. 7. Restraint: Not seeking 
      entertainment, playing radios or musical instruments. Dressing in a 
      modest, unadorned way that does not attract attention. 8. Alertness: 
      refraining from over-indulgence in sleep.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Choosing to live amidst the beauty that 
      surrounds Fearless Mountain may not seem to be renouncing the world at 
      all, but Ajahn Pasanno says, &quot;we even try to renounce the beauty. Most 
      people try to get more of everything. Then when they get more they feel a 
      loss when they lose it and don't have it anymore. Then they lament the 
      separation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;A monk gets to the place of stillness. It 
      is not rejecting anything - it's another aspect of life that most people 
      don't pay attention to.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A gift of land</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are eight monks who live at 
      Abhayagiri, plus one novice and one postulate in training, all living on 
      250 acres of almost untouched forest land, originally a gift from the late 
      abbot of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in Ukiah - Master Hsuan Hua. 
      Master Hua dreamed of bringing the Northern and Southern Traditions of 
      Buddhism together again where they could relate in an atmosphere of mutual 
      respect and harmony.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The monastery was founded by two teachers, 
      Ajahn Sumedho, and Ajahn Amaro after they developed a devoted following in 
      Northern California in the1980s. The original Abhayagiri was in ancient 
      Sri Lanka at Anuradhapura and although it follows the Theravada branch of 
      Buddhism, the monastery was known for accepting both teachers and 
      practitioners from many different Buddhist traditions.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;The monastery currently has more people 
      who want to come here and be monks than the facility can handle,&quot; Ajahn 
      says.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A monk named Sudanto, meaning &quot;one who 
      trains himself well&quot; calls Abhayagiri, &quot;a zone of peace people can use as 
      a community resource.&quot; He explains the monastery's connection with the 
      community as, &quot;an interrelationship that keeps us (the monks) relevant, as 
      a peaceful presence - people with deep knowledge and experience of the 
      Buddhist teachings of peace and wholeness.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A day in the life of a monk</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The day on Fearless Mountain begins at 4 
      a.m. Then from 5-6 a.m. they begin their spiritual practice with 
      meditation and chanting. These reflections set a tone of the mind during 
      the day. 6:30-7 a.m. there are some general chores, cleaning up and a 
      light breakfast. At 7:30 a.m. the monks meet to delegate chores - 
      maintenance, cooking, office tasks and the job of maintaining the miles of 
      trails which circle through the forests. After chores, the monks have 
      their main meal from 10:30-11 a.m.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When it comes to food, the forest dwelling 
      monks are alms mendicants. Not allowed to plant or pick their own food, 
      they rely on gifts. The monks can be seen on Fridays walking through the 
      center of town collecting gifts of food.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;This creates interdependence with the lay 
      community. We don't want to be completely cut off,&quot;Ajahn said.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He explains this synergistic relationship. 
      &quot;People from the community come to the monastery to gain more simplicity, 
      more well being. We give the opportunity for people to have the way of 
      living, which is more peaceful, more fulfilling. Sharing our life is sort 
      of the by-product. If one's goal is to teach, it can be distorted. Refocus 
      on the quality of our lives and that becomes an example to others.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Ajahn is suddenly explaining some of the 
      core elements of a monastic life. &quot;The more the I' can get out of the way, 
      the more peaceful things become. The monks spend the remainder of the 
      daylight hours in their cabins where they do various forms of meditation - 
      both traditional sitting, and walking. Ajahn explains: &quot;Outside each cabin 
      is a level 50-foot path where the monks develop sustaining attention on 
      the walking - recognition of words and mental states. &quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At 5:30 in the afternoon the community 
      gathers once again for tea. This is the time for guidance by the teacher. 
      Help also comes from the community at large - mental support from other 
      monks. Even monks learn from each other's foibles. Asked if monks maintain 
      personality traits like senses of humor, Ajahn says that even ascetic 
      monks remain individuals and some are known for their enlightened sense of 
      humor.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At 6:30 p.m. there is a reading where 
      monks can ask questions, then from 7:30 to 8:30 p.m., evening chanting and 
      meditation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Many questions, of course, will arise even 
      in those experiencing blissful states of mind. Ajahn explains, &quot;of course 
      there is a longing to repeat that experience. We don't want to be 
      dependent on anything. The enlightened are not dependent on anything for 
      their happiness. Although,&quot;he is quick to add, &quot;there is a quality of 
      compassion. But we strive for separation from attachments that create 
      entanglements. We are conditioned to think we need certain things for our 
      well-being.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Too much eating or sleeping creates 
      complications in life. Ajahn laughs as he mentions just how much of 
      everything people seem to need to be happy. And then, he asks, are they 
      ever really happy?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As the sun is ready to drop behind the 
      mountains to the west, Ajahn Pasanno is eager to show a &quot;walking 
      meditation.&quot; High up on the mountainside at the end of a path curving 
      between the manzanita trees, is a small cabin where the monk spends most 
      of his time in meditation. Beside the cabin is a 50-foot dirt path where 
      he thoughtfully, mindfully walks with his eyes sometimes closed, sometimes 
      open.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A gift from Thailand</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">During one evening recently, the 
      Abhayagiri Monastery held a ceremony for the installation of a statue of 
      the Buddha, a gift from a Thai donor. After the sun had set and the moon 
      had risen, a delegation of monks - both resident and visiting but of the 
      same forest tradition - sat on a wooden platform amongst the trees, 
      chanting at the base of the statue. The scene was magical, with a hundred 
      or more devotees from all parts of the country in attendance.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As the mountaintop had grown colder as the 
      night grew later, the visiting abbot Ajahn Liam spoke in his native Pali, 
      translated by Ajahn Pasanno for the western guests in attendance. &quot;We 
      might feel it is a bit cold - but nature is just being natural, natural to 
      the climate and the season. It is just liking it or not liking it.&quot; He 
      went on to say, &quot;Nobody wants to suffer, to experience discomfort.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The moon was half full, sitting in the sky 
      above the mountaintop, giving a golden glow to the resplendent life-size 
      statue of a sitting Buddha. The breeze rushed through the trees making a 
      sound much like ocean waves breaking on a shore. The monk's point was that 
      nature is always in the business of just being nature and it is up to 
      humans not to be disturbed by the world around them. Then, only then, when 
      we accept the world for what it truly is, are we able to see ourselves as 
      we truly are - perfect, divine, awakened individuals - happy to be who we 
      are. </FONT></P>
