      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In Sri Lanka the followers of 
      the four great world religions Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam 
      -- have lived together for many centuries in perfect peace and harmony. 
      Many sacred shrines, for example the shrine at the top of Adam&#39;s Peak 
      (also called Sri Pada), are shared by the adherents of all four Faiths. 
      During the pilgrim season, they went their way to the summit of the holy 
      mountain, bringing various offerings, and there carry out their devotions 
      with amity and concord. Of the over fourteen million people who constitute 
      the population of Sri Lanka, 67 percent are Buddhists, and it is with 
      their religion, Buddhism, that this brochure is concerned.&nbsp; </FONT>
      </P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Buddhism is not merely a 
      religion, it is also a whole civilization with its historical background, 
      its literature, art and philosophy, its institutions, social, political 
      and ethical and its code of moral conduct.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It had its origin, in the 
      sixth century before Christ, in the Valley of the Ganges. From there, it 
      spread throughout India. Two centuries later, a royal missionary Mahinda, 
      son of the famous emperor Asoka (who renounced his conquests in order to 
      follow the Buddhist way of life), brought Buddhism to Sri Lanka. Here it 
      flourishes up to this day, its purity hardly affected by the vicissitudes 
      of twenty-five centuries.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">From the very outset Buddhism 
      appealed most strongly to the cultivated and the intellectual.&nbsp;
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddhist monastery was 
      everywhere the centre of education and learning. wherever it went, 
      Buddhism enriched the language of the people among whom it spread and 
      produced great works of literature, both of prose and poetry. Its 
      achievements in the fine arts have been no less significant. It was 
      Buddhism that first called architecture to the cause of religion. The 
      paintings and sculptures in the cave-temples of Ajanta and Ellora command 
      our awe and admiration. Some of the Buddhist statues, for example those in 
      Nara and Kamekura (both in Japan), are unrivalled in their majesty. There 
      are also numerous statues of the Buddha in our own beautiful Island, for 
      instance the well known &quot;Samadhi&quot; statue in Anuradhapura (for long the 
      capital of Sri Lanka) which so truly symbolises the central theme of 
      Buddhism -- the spiritural calm that comes from perfect knowledge and the 
      subjugation of the senses.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But greater than all these 
      triumphs was the influence Buddhism exercised in moulding the character of 
      the people who became its followers. It instilled into them its noble 
      ideals of peace and gentleness, tolerance, kindness and hospitality, the 
      care for the sick, the pursuit of the good and beautiful, and compassion 
      towards all that lives and breathes. It is Buddhism&#39;s proud boast that not 
      a single drop of blood has ever been shed in its name.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>The Buddha</B> </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Founder of this great 
      movement was the Buddha, or Sakyamuni (the Sage of the Sakya Clan), or to 
      give him his family name, Gotama (Gautama). We are told that his personal 
      name was Siddhartha. The Buddha generally spoke of himself as the 
      Tathagata, the One who had found the Truth. His father was Suddhodhana, 
      the ruler of his people, and his mother Mahamaya. The pious delight to 
      speak of the marvels that heralded his advent into the world of men and 
      his birth in a grove of woodland.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The young prince was brought 
      up in the lap of luxury; his education consisted not only of knowledge of 
      the the wisdom which the great men of his time taught but also of skill in 
      all the manly arts. At sixteen he married Yasodhara having won her favour 
      by a display of his prowess.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Though he had every reason to 
      be happy, the sorrows of the world around him filled his sensitive soul 
      with restlessness and the more he pondered on the cruel realities of life, 
      the more determined he became to find a way of escape from them.&nbsp;
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;There is a getting born and 
      a growing old, a dying and a being re-born. And from this suffering alas, 
      an escape is not known, even from old age and death. When shall such 
      escape be revealed?&quot; And then he thought further. &quot;Surely there must be a 
      way out of this ill? Just as there is warmth as opposed to cold and light 
      as against darkness, there must likewise be happiness as opposed to 
      sorrow?&quot; Thus he pondered, till one day, when he was twenty nine, soon 
      after the birth of his only son, Rahula, he left home and family resolving 
      not to return till he had succeeded in his search. For six long and weary 
      years he wandered seeking knowledge from the famous philosophies of his 
      day, going through innumerable experiences, that imposed severe strain on 
      both body and mind. He was faced with numerous temptations but he overcame 
      them all.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then on a full-moon night in 
      the flowering month of May, while seated under a <I>peepul</I>-tree, at 
      the spot now known as Buddhagaya, he put forth a supreme struggle. the 
      forces of Evil opposed him in vain. He rent asunder the veil of Ignorance 
      and saw the Truth and thus became the Buddha, which means the Enlightened 
      One. The word for enlightenment is bodhi and the tree under which the 
      Buddha won Enlightenment came thereafter to be called the Bodhi-tree. The 
      Sinlalese name for the month of May is Vesak. According to Buddhist 
      tradition, three important events in the Buddha&#39;s life happened on the 
      full-moon day of Vesak -- his birth, his enlightenment and his final 
      passing away. Festivals are held to mark these events and are known as 
      Vesak celebrations.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha attained 
      Enlightenment at the age of thirty five; thence-forth for 45 years till he 
      passed away at Kusinara at the age of 80, he lived in unceasing activity, 
      teaching and preaching. It is said that he slept but two hours at night. 
      He travelled far and wide, except during the three rainy months, carrying 
      the good news, the message of hope and happiness to all that would care to 
      hear.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The being who thus became the 
      Buddha was indeed yet a man though endowed with what we may call a 
      heavenly humanity. In fact it is his essential humanity that shines out 
      most brilliantly through the canonical records of his life and activities. 
      He moved amongst men and women, not as superman or an incarnation of a 
      god, but as very man himself, preaching to others that what he had become 
      they could, everyone of them, become themselves; that we all of us are 
      potential Buddhas.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">His humanity and his great 
      earnestness are the most striking thing about the Buddha. He was most 
      anxious to tell the truth whether others liked it or not, though he chose 
      his appropriate time and place to do so. It is said about his speech that 
      it was always truthful, spoken at the proper season, purposeful and 
      profitable and in exact accord with his own actions.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He was very quick to 
      recognise the infinite variety of men&#39;s dispositions; he could feel the 
      real need in each man&#39;s heart. The needs of men called forth in him an 
      instant wish to help. His teachings were homely, yet full of wisdom. The 
      stories he so often used to illustrate his teachings, the similes and 
      metaphors that abound in his sermons, show how intimate was his knowledge 
      of all classes of people, their customs and manners and their ways of 
      life. He spared no pains to make men and women not just good but better, 
      to help them become their best. His love was not limited to human beings, 
      his kindness to animals, too, was profound. When the Buddha had attained 
      Enlightenment, he proclaimed his realisation in no uncertain terms. &quot;Wide 
      open are the portals of immortality&quot;, he announced, &quot;let those who have 
      faith and courage, come and share therein&quot;. But it was not till seven 
      weeks later that the Buddha decided to preach his first sermon. The scene 
      was the Deer Park at Isipatana (Morden Saranath) near Benares. He selected 
      as his audience five ascetics, who had been his erstwhile colleagues in 
      the practice of asceticism. It is said that they were at fire reluctant to 
      listen to him but so great was the force of the Buddh&#39;s personality that 
      their reluctance was overcome and they became eager listeners.&nbsp;
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>The First Sermon</B>
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This first sermon is 
      generally accepted as containing a resume of the Buddha&#39;s teachings. In it 
      the Buddha declares that those who wish to lead a spiritual life should 
      avoid the two extremes of self-indulgence and self-torture. 
      Self-indulgence is low and self-mortification crazy; both are profitless. 
      There is a middle way -- which leads to insight and wisdom; its fruit is 
      serenity, knowledge, enlightenment, Nibbana, perfect peace.&nbsp; </FONT>
      </P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The teaching is summed up in 
      what came to be known as the Four Noble Truths, four facts which cannot be 
      denied -- the fact that there is suffering in the world, the further fact 
      that this suffering has its cause in the craving for personal 
      satisfaction; the third fact that this suffering will cease when such 
      craving is stilled, and fourthly, that that result can be achieved by 
      following the Middle way, otherwise described as the Noble Eightfold Path, 
      consisting of right views, right thought, right speech, right action, 
      right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right rapture.&nbsp;
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As will be seen, the motive 
      of first sermon is eminently practical. Its purpose was to awaken 
      recognition of the universality of suffering inherent in existence, to 
      indicate its fundamental cause and to teach a way of deliverance through 
      rightness in thought conduct and inner discipline.&nbsp; The description 
      of the Path covers the whole training of the discipline.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Once deliverance is obtained 
      from suffering, such freedom cannot ever be lost. There will be for those 
      who have won it no more voyaging through continued existence, no more 
      birth and no more death. The fundamental principle of all reality is that 
      whatever has a beginning must in due course also have an end, and 
      suffering is no exception to this rule. Herein lies the core of truth -- 
      the impermanency of everything in this world of time and space. The 
      recognition of this fact provides the means for removing this ill. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This first sermon contains 
      all the essentials of the Buddha&#39;s teaching and the elements of the 
      Buddhist ideal. It is founded on an understanding of the ultimate facts of 
      life. When this understanding is attained the passions of sense are 
      subdued, all ill-will disappears and conflict ceases. The winner of the 
      goal no longer demands that the world shall minister to his gratification; 
      he is delivered from the arrogance of claming the recognition of his own 
      individuality. The cravings, on which his being had earlier been brought 
      up, have died away and in the resultant calm there is intense but tranquil 
      Joy.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha&#39;s teaching is 
      fundamentally a teaching of emancipation. Just as the water of the sea has 
      but one taste, the taste of salt, so has the Buddha&#39;s doctrine one taste, 
      the taste of freedom.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The first sermon is also 
      significant for what it does not contain: it gives no account of the 
      creation of the world nor a history of the process by which sin and death 
      came to beset mankind. It contains no promise of exemption from pain and 
      evil in return for prayer or ritual or sacrifice, nor any support or 
      favourable intercession by the divine powers. The Buddha does not call 
      himself a saviour willing and able to take upon himself the sins of 
      mankind. On the contrary, he declares that each man and woman must bear 
      the burden of their own sins and seek emancipation therefore through their 
      own efforts.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha asserts that no 
      god can do for any man that work of self-conquest and self-emancipation 
      which in the teaching of the Buddha, stands for &quot;salvation&quot;. The Buddha 
      claims only to be a guide, a teacher of the way, who having gained 
      deliverance from suffering, declares that spiritual emancipation is no 
      divine gift of grace but a conquest won by man&#39;s intellect and will, 
      rightly ruled and directed by man himself.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The goal and reward of the 
      higher life is not in any external state but in the attainment of perfect 
      and tranquil mind. Nibbana (or nirvana) is the name givens to that goal. 
      Peace and happiness are its synonyms.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Happy is solitude of him who 
      is full of joy, who has learnt the truth, who sees the truth. Happy is 
      freedom from malice in this world, self-restraint toward all beings that 
      have life. Happy is freedom from lust in this world, getting beyond all 
      desires; the putting away of that pride which comes from the thought &#39;I 
      am.&#39;&quot; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The first requisite for 
      leading the good life is a realization that all conscious existence is 
      enveloped in suffering. The world is on fire, burning with lust, ill-will 
      and stupidity: how can there be laughter and joy? This body of ours is 
      sickly frail; in a few years it breaks into pieces and ends in death.&nbsp;
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The maladies of the body are 
      only too well-matched by the ills of the mind. What anguish of mind there 
      is in a single life-time what grief and dejection, what lamentation and 
      despair. Not all the waters of the four great oceans can equal the tears 
      shed by a single being in his long pilgrimage through the innumerable ages 
      of his past. The scene of our days and years in full of change; all our 
      pleasure must end, too brief is their satisfaction. Early and late Death 
      goes his rounds, mowing down high and low, rich and poor, young and old, 
      the mighty and the meek.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Other religions, too, have 
      described man as a pilgrim through a vale of tears, called the world a 
      bubble, the life of man but a span, full of sorrow from womb to tomb. But 
      these religions also assure us that behind this transitory show lies God&#39;s 
      eternity and that therein is security for those who do God&#39;s will. God, 
      they say, has revealed in his commandments the conduct which enables men 
      to share in his heaven. He is our Father and even though we must humble 
      ourselves before his holiness, we may yet trust his mercy to forgive. 
      Buddhism has no such consolation of possible mercy to offer. The laws that 
      govern life are merciless and the Buddha refuses to be mealy-mouthed in 
      his exposition of them. All existence without exception, is sorrow, he 
      declared.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">That this was an unattractive 
      doctrine the Buddha himself realised, and we are told that for a brief 
      moment after his Enlightenment he wondered whether it would be worthwhile 
      carrying such a message to men who were blinded by passion and wrapped in 
      the darkness of ignorance. But then he recalled that it was for this very 
      purpose that he had laboured throughout countless lives. He knew that 
      among men there were many whose minds were comparatively free from lust 
      and ill-will and they would understand. In the world were men of many 
      dispositions and capabilities, like lotuses in al pool, some blooming 
      under the water, some on its surface, some emerging out of it.&nbsp;
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha considered himself 
      a physician; the illness of the world was desperate and a desperate remedy 
      was required, nothing less would suffice. If by the sacrifice of his own 
      life he could assure happiness to the world&#39;s creatures, he would have 
      gladly laid it down. Many times, in his previous existences, while 
      preparing for Buddhahood, he had given his life for others and one more 
      life would have meant nothing to him. But, in the destruction of 
      suffering, as the Buddha saw it, the shepherd laying down his life for his 
      flock had no meaning.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Though he thus declared the 
      world and all in it a mass of suffering the Buddha never showed any 
      impatience with it; he was never angry with the world nor did he curse it. 
      He thought of it as unsatisfactory and transitory rather than as wicked, 
      as ignorant rather than rebellious. In his life there is no idea of 
      suicidal sacrifice, no element of the tragic, no nervous irritability. He 
      is never described as a man of sorrows; the cares of the world did not 
      weigh him down. He did not consider himself as belonging to a race whose 
      first pair had drawn upon themselves a sentence of labour and pain and 
      involved their descendants in corruption. There was no need to call for 
      repentence to escape an impending doom.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha was, therefore, 
      always happy; representation of him whether in word or stone or painting 
      always depicts him with a countenance of serene joy. &quot;Happy I seek my 
      rest,&quot; he declared over and over again, &quot;happy I rise; happy I pass the 
      day, escaped from snare of evil&quot;. He described his teaching as &quot;lovely in 
      its origin, lovely in its progress and lovely in its consummation.&quot; One 
      has only to read the outpourings of the hearts of his disciples as 
      contained in the records to realise that their lives were irradiated with 
      joy, with bliss ineffable.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This was because the Buddha 
      had not only the recognition of the existence of suffering but also the 
      sure knowledge of the way out of it.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">While it is true that we do 
      not find in Buddhism the consolation of a saviour willing and able to 
      fight on our behalf, we do find in it the encouraging and enabling faith 
      that man has within himself the strength and virtue that render him 
      independent of all such consolation. It is the one religion that bids man, 
      in no uncertain terms, to trust himself, that calls upon him to raise 
      himself by his own exertion, to govern and control and form himself.&nbsp;
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus was the clarion-call 
      sounded of human liberty; &quot;Be ye refuges unto yourselves; be ye your own 
      salvation. With earnestness and high resolve, work out your salvation with 
      diligence.&quot; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Law of Kamma</B> </FONT>
      </P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Just as man could work out 
      his own salvation, he it was who had created his problems. It was not mere 
      chance or an impersonal power that was responsible for the inequalities 
      amongst men.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Nothing happened by chance, 
      said the Buddha. He then proceeded to formulate the doctrine which came to 
      be known as the Law of Kamma (Karma) which forms one of the most 
      fundamental of his teachings. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Kamma (Karma) means action, 
      doing work, business; and the Law of Kamma may be described as the Law of 
      Cause and Effect. Very briefly stated it is this: everything that happens 
      does so only by reason of some earlier cause and when that stops so does 
      the result. Everything is the effect of some cause and is itself the cause 
      of some other effect. This law, the Buddha declares, holds true this in 
      every department of the universe. As far as man is concerned, this is the 
      law that affects his happiness or sorrow. It has no origin in time; it is 
      not a &quot;command,&quot; therefore it cannot be broken. Thus, in Buddhism, there 
      is no such thing as sin in the sense of a violation of God&#39;s &quot;command.&quot;
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">No one can, however, 
      disregard the law of Kamma without paying the penalty. It cannot be 
      altered by beseeching, by self-torture or by offerings. No God can 
      interfere with it. Gone therefore is the need for payers, ceremonies and 
      rites, and the priesthood required for their celebration.&nbsp; </FONT>
      </P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus for the role of God (or 
      Creator) the Buddha substituted the rule of the Law of Kamma. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With the doctrine of Kamma is 
      also connected that other teaching of the Buddha which speaks of man as 
      wandering about in <I>Samsara</I>, continued existence, birth after birth. 
      Before and behind us there stretches a vista of lives, past, present and 
      to come, impermanent and unsatisfying, involving <I>dukkha</I> or 
      suffering until by our own efforts we put an end to the process. This <I>
      samsara</I> too has a cause. It is the result of craving (<I>tanha</I>), 
      the thirst for life in its widest sense -- the craving for pleasures which 
      creates life, the craving for existence in the dying man which brings 
      about another rebirth, the craving for power, for wealth, for pre-eminence 
      within the limits of the present life. Once this fact is realised, that 
      our suffering has a cause, men can break the bonds and escape from 
      Samsara. They remain in bondage only because of their ignorance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddhist conception of 
      Kamma has nothing to do with predestination. That which we have done in 
      the past has made us what we are now; that which we are in the process of 
      doing now is making what we shall be in the future. The future will be a 
      process of becoming largely what we make it. It is always being shaped, 
      but not finished. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Just as we have been making 
      ourselves in all our previous lives, so now it lies within us to determine 
      our future; there is no God that can stop our doing so. That past gives us 
      certain tendencies and possibilities; it is for us to fashion them how we 
      will. We are our creators, as well as our own enemies.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Evil Kamma can be overcome by 
      the guidance of far reaching knowledge and of penetrating insight and it 
      is here that the services of a good friend, a <I>kalyanamitta</I> become 
      valuable, nay essential. A <I>kalyanamitta</I> is a good man who, having 
      won knowledge, shows the path to others. The Buddha is regarded as the 
      greatest of such <I>kalyanamittas</I>.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are two observations 
      commonly made regarding the Doctrine of Kamma. One is the question, can it 
      be proved? The answer is No, not by ordinarily accepted canons of proof. 
      But the Buddha says that looking back on his many lives and those of 
      others he saw the workings of the law clearly and unmistakably. This 
      knowledge was not his special prerogative but could be acquired and 
      verified, by anyone willing to take the trouble. Till such time time the 
      word of Master has to be believed.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The other observation is that 
      it is &quot;unjust&quot; to suffer for ill deeds that are forgotten. Kamma is not 
      concerned with &quot;Justice.&quot; This observation is coloured by our conception 
      of the law as being laid down by somebody and the penalty as being 
      inflicted for a purpose.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>The Doctrine of Anatta</B>
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One doctrine in Buddhism 
      which separates it from all other creeds is its denial of any real 
      permanent Soul or Self. This doctrine of No-Soul or Anatta as it is 
      called, is the bedrock of Buddhism.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now, what is this Soul the 
      existence of which the Buddha denies? Briefly stated, the &quot;Soul&quot; is the 
      abiding, separate, constantly existing and indestructible entity which is 
      generally believe to be found in man from the moment of his birth up to 
      the time of his death, and to exist after his death in some other place, 
      either heaven or hell, for all eternity. This soul is regarded as being 
      separate for each individual; it is a bit of the divine, a spark from God, 
      implanted within each human being and destined, ultimately, to return to 
      its Maker. As long as the &quot;Soul&quot; resides in man, it is the thinker of all 
      his thoughts, the doer of his deeds and the director of the organism 
      generally. It is the lord not only of the body but also of the mind; it 
      gathers its knowledge through the gateways of the senses. Though it cannot 
      be seen by the eye, nor reached by speech, nor apprehended by the mind, 
      yet its existence is to be accepted on faith. Without immortality 
      hereafter, so runs the argument, this life would not be worth living. The 
      existence of a soul alone can ensure for each individual the fruits of his 
      actions. Without it there can be no reward in heaven or punishment in 
      hell, no recompense for one&#39;s deeds.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Such, generally speaking is 
      the teaching of other religions, with a few minor differences in detail. 
      Buddhism, on the contrary, denies all this and asserts that this belief in 
      a permanent and a divine soul is the most dangerous and pernicious of all 
      errors, the most deceitful of illusions, that it will inevitably mislead 
      its victims into the deepest pit of sorrow and suffering. It is, in fact, 
      says the Buddha, the root-cause of all suffering, because the belief in an 
      separate self breeds egotism and selfishness; selfishness produces craving 
      for life and life&#39;s pleasures -- <I>tanha</I> which plunges beings into 
      the ocean of <I>Samsara</I> -- continued existence. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This doctrine of the denial 
      of the Soul the Buddha arrives at by analysis; Buddhism is, for this 
      reason chiefly, called the <I>Vibhajjavada</I>, the Religion of Analytical 
      Knowledge. Man, says the Buddha, is composed of two chief parts, the 
      physical body and the mind.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let us analyse these two 
      components and see if we can find anything permanent or divine them. The 
      body seems to be our own and yet we cannot control it. It grows old and is 
      subject to disease and finally it dies. What of the mind? It is even less 
      permanent, for while the body lasts a while, at least in appearance, the 
      mind or what is called the mind -- keeps perishing day and night, always 
      changing. A man&#39;s mind, his character and aspirations must change and they 
      do, or there would be no possibility of his higher development, progress 
      and improvement. The same can be said of reasoning, the powers of 
      discrimination and judgement, the will and the memory.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It may be argued, thus, -- 
      &quot;Yes, we agree that the Soul is not to be found in any of the parts of our 
      body and mind but we say that the whole of our being is the Soul.&quot; This 
      seems to be begging the question because the appearance of a whole is 
      merely a delusion; what &quot;whole&quot; can there be in something in which every 
      particle is constantly, continually changing? We cling to ourselves, 
      hoping to find something immortal in them, like children who would wish to 
      clasp a rainbow. Like the rainbow are all things; there is a process; a 
      conditioning, but nowhere the least trace of anything permanent.&nbsp;
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Life is thus merely a 
      phenomenon or rather a succession of phenomena, produced by the law of 
      cause and effect. An individual existence is to be looked upon not as 
      something permanent but as a succession of changes, as something that is 
      always passing away. Each of us is merely a combination of material and 
      mental qualities; every person or thing or god is thus a &quot;putting 
      together,&quot; a compound. And this compound, this individual, remains 
      separate as long as it persists in Samsara or existence as we know it. It 
      is this separation which is the cause of life and, therefore, of sorrow. 
      Life will continue as long as there is craving. It is Kamma, our actions, 
      our thoughts and words produced by this craving, that keeps the process 
      going.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If at death the craving for 
      life has not been completely destroyed then this craving gathers fresh 
      life, body and mind. The result is a new individual, but new only in a 
      sense. There is nothing that passes from one life to another. It is the 
      Kamma produced by us in our previous lives and in this life that brings 
      about the new life. The new body and mind is merely the result of the 
      previous body and mind. Just as this life is the result of the Kamma of 
      past lives, so our next life is the product of that Kamma plus the Kamma 
      of the present life.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What is important to the 
      Buddhist is not death or rebirth, for these processes are always taking 
      place even in our present life, but the fact that the life-quality which 
      succeeds death is entirely in his own power, and that his future 
      environment will depend entirely on him. Though the tendencies of a past 
      birth influence the trend of mind-processes in a subsequent life, yet the 
      mind has the power inherent in it of overcoming, at least very largely, 
      the evil that might be transmitted.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Must this process of life 
      after life always continue? It need not, says the Buddha; it is the 
      purpose of the Buddha&#39;s teaching to tell us how it can be completely 
      destroyed. And with the destruction of the process we reach Nibbana, a 
      word better known in its Sanskrit form of Nirvana. It is the cessation of 
      life as we know it; in a sense it is annihilation, but not the 
      annihilation of self, for there is no self to annihilate. The fire has 
      gone out because there is no more fuel to feed it. It is the annihilation 
      of the illusion of self, of separateness. The whole of the clingings, 
      affections for oneself, the desires, the appetites, the thirst, <I>tanha</I>, 
      which surround or support this illusion are all destroyed together with 
      the evil, the ignorance, the hatred and greed and the lust which accompany 
      it. They die for lack of the nourishment that sustained them, never more 
      to return. Nirvana is not merely a negative condition but a very positive 
      state of bliss ineffable, of unbounded peace and joy, as is testified by 
      the countless utterances of those that have attained it. &quot;Aho sukham, aho 
      sukham,&quot; they exclaim, &quot;ah, what happiness, what bliss&quot;; cooled are life&#39;s 
      sorrows, gone all fear and they are joyful with much joy.&nbsp; </FONT>
      </P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When the Arahant, the Perfect 
      One, who has attained Nirvana, dies he is not reborn anywhere, for he is 
      no longer subject to any of the laws that govern life and death. What 
      exactly happens to him we cannot say, for all our thoughts, terms and 
      modes of speech are bound up with the illusion of self and are therefore 
      incapable of describing the state which the Arahant attains after death, a 
      state which is the very antithesis of life as known to us. It is an 
      experience, not speculation. All we can say about it is that is beyond and 
      outside all conditionings. A well-known passage in the books describes it 
      as a state &quot;where there is neither solid nor liquid, neither heat nor air, 
      neither this world nor any other, neither sun nor moon, arising nor 
      passing away nor standing still, neither a being born nor a dying, neither 
      substance nor development nor any basis for substance.&quot; It is the end of 
      sorrow, to be known by freedom from distress and danger, by confidence, by 
      peace and calm, by bliss and happiness, by purity and freshness. There is 
      no particular spot where it is to be found, nothing to define it by. Such 
      is the goal of the Buddhist, the attainment of which the Buddha taught to 
      beings, the doctrine of the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold 
      Path.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>The Noble Eightfold Path</B>
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This Path has already been 
      referred to but a fuller explanation would be desirable. The Path consists 
      of eight factors as follows:&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. Right view is 
      understanding the Four Truths.<BR CLEAR="all">
      2. Right thought is free from lust, ill will, cruelty and untruthfulness.<BR CLEAR="all">
      3. Right speech is abstaining from lying, talebearing, harsh language and 
      vain talk.<BR CLEAR="all">
      4. Right action is abstaining from killing, stealing and sexual 
      misconduct.&nbsp;<BR CLEAR="all">
      5. Right livelihood is earning a living in a way not harmful to any living 
      thing.<BR CLEAR="all">
      6. Right effort is to avoid evil thoughts and overcome them, to arouse 
      good thoughts and maintain them.&nbsp;<BR CLEAR="all">
      7. Right mindfulness is to pay vigilant attention to every state of the 
      body, feeling, mind.&nbsp;<BR CLEAR="all">
      8. Right concentration is concentration on a single object so as to induce 
      certain special states of consciousness in deep meditation. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha&#39;s teachings were 
      not recorded at the time of their promulgation. Writing was then 
      practically unknown and all learning was handed down from teacher to pupil 
      by word of mouth. Tradition has it that three months after the Buddha&#39;s 
      death five hundred of his immediate and pre-eminent disciples gathered 
      together in convocation and agree upon what they considered were his most 
      important utterances. They claimed to have remembered the Buddha&#39;s exact 
      words, mostly in prose but some of them in the form of verses too.&nbsp;
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These were later committed to 
      writing but not till several centuries afterwards, when the original 
      community of Buddhist disciples had split up into several sects. Each such 
      important sect had its own collection of the scriptures. Only one of these 
      collections is now to be found in any degree of completeness. This is the 
      Canon of the School of Elders, known as the Theravada and written in an 
      ancient India language called Pali. This Canon is regarded as sacred by 
      the Buddhists of Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos.&nbsp;
      </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Tradition has it that it was 
      brought to Sri Lanka by Mahinda when he introduced Buddhism into the 
      Island. Mahinda is also credited with having taught the commentaries to 
      the Canon to the Sinhalese monks when he established the Order at the Maha 
      Vihara (the Great Minster) at Anuradhapura under royal auspices. Both 
      Canon and commentaries were handed down orally. The Canon was committed to 
      writing in Sri Lanka in the first century before Christ. The Theravada 
      Canon (called the Tipitaka, Tripitaka) consists of three sections, named 
      Pitakas (Baskets). The first is the Vinaya Pitaka, a collection of 227 
      rules of Vinaya (or discipline) which is binding on monks and nuns. The 
      second is the Sutta Pitaka, arranged in five groups (Nikayas), and 
      consists of suttas (or discourses) which contain the basic doctrine of 
      Buddhism. Generally speaking, a sutta purports to be the verbatim report 
      of a discourse of the Buddha and contains particulars of the circumstances 
      in which the discourse came to be preached.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The third collection is the 
      Abhidhamma Pitaka, consisting of treatises of the &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;further&quot; 
      doctrines (<I>abhidhamma</I>), philosophical and psychological in 
      character and containing developments of terms and ideas found in the two 
      other Pitakas. It is generally accepted that the Abhidhamma Pitaka is of 
      somewhat later growth than the other two.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The custody of his teaching 
      and its propagation was made, by the Buddha, the obligation of the members 
      of the Order in the Sangha which he founded quite early in his career. It 
      grew up to a well organised community, following democratic practices in 
      its procedure, arriving at decisions by discussion and consensus. 
      Membership of Order was open to all, regardless of caste or race or 
      colour, except for persons suffering from infectious diseases and certain 
      physical and mental disabilities, conscripted soldiers, debtors, slaves 
      who had run away from their masters and minors, who had first to get the 
      permission of their parents or guardians. &quot;Just as rivers that flow into 
      the ocean leave their various identities therein, so do various classes of 
      people form a single community when they join the order.&quot; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Order consisted at first 
      only of men. Women were admitted later at the request of the Buddha&#39;s 
      foster-mother and in deference to strong public opinion; in all matters of 
      discipline monks were given priority over the nuns. This did not, however, 
      imply that women were in any way inferior to men. What men could do, 
      declared the Buddha quite emphatically, women could do equally well, 
      sometimes even better. But, in some Buddhist countries including Sri 
      Lanka, the Order of nuns did not last very long, for a variety of reasons. 
      Attempts are being made to revive it. Elsewhere it has come down to the 
      present day, though not large in numbers.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The rules of the Order are 
      simple, the chief vows being those of celibacy and non-possession of 
      worldly wealth. Abstinence from eating after mid-day and avoidance of all 
      kinds of luxury are also required. A monk&#39;s equipment consists only of 
      basic needs such as two sets of robes, a begging bowl, a razor, needle and 
      thread. He is expected to spend his time in study and meditation, in 
      recitation of sacred texts and listening to such recitation by others. He 
      would preach on &quot;sabbath&quot; days or whenever there was need to do so. In 
      earlier days the monastery was also the school and the monks were its 
      teachers.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Twice a month the monks of a 
      given area would gather together for a general ceremony of confession at 
      which the prescribed rules, 227 in number, contained in a very old text, 
      were recited.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At the inception of the Order 
      and for quite some time afterwards, members of the Order would travel from 
      place to place, except during the rainy season, and they had no permanent 
      abode. They would subsist on alms which they would get when they went on 
      their alms-rounds in whatever locality they happened to be.&nbsp; </FONT>
      </P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But, in the course of time, 
      as their numbers increased, there came into existence settled monastic 
      establishments, and the corporate Order of the Sangha often received gifts 
      of lands and buildings and various amenities were provided by rulers and 
      other wealthy patrons.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Monasteries (and nunneries) 
      have certain basic features common to most of them. There would generally 
      be a residence for the monks (or nuns), a shrine-room, containing one or 
      more statues of the Buddha, usually in the sitting posture, a stupa (also 
      known as thupa, dagaba or pagoda) and, more often than not, a Bodhi-tree 
      claiming descent from the tree under which the Buddha attained 
      Enlightenment. The stupa can be of various shapes and sizes; in Sri Lanka 
      the main part of the stupa is a hemispherical dome of solid masonry. 
      Devotees would like to believe that every stupa contains some relic of the 
      Buddha, usually a microscopic piece of bone, and those who erect stupas 
      would go through a great deal of trouble and expense in order to obtain 
      such a relic.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddhist ceremony of 
      worship normally follows a simple pattern and can be performed either at 
      home (with members of one&#39;s family) or in a temple in groups, large or 
      small. Flowers are offered at the stupa, the vihara and the Bodhi-tree; 
      lamps (usually of clay) are lit and sweet-smelling incense is burnt in or 
      near the shrines. In the temple, community worship is often led by a monk 
      or one of the older members of the gathering. The worshippers recite a 
      formula which indicates that the devotee &quot;seeks refuge&quot; in the Buddha, his 
      teaching and order of the Sangha. This is followed by the Five Precepts 
      whereby the devotee taken upon himself five vows -- to abstain from 
      hunting life, from taking without the owner&#39;s consent what belongs to 
      another, from wrongful indulgence in the senses, from speech which is 
      false, slanderous, harsh or profitless, and from intoxicating drinks and 
      drugs.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddhists do not &quot;pray&quot; 
      to the Buddha but in the ceremony of worship they usually chant various 
      stanzas or formulas extolling the virtue of the Buddha, his teaching and 
      the noble band of his disciples who have attained sainthood by following 
      that teaching.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The object of this exercise 
      is partly to render homage to those to whom homage is due and partly to 
      stimulate in the devotee&#39;s mind a desire to cultivate similar qualities in 
      his own person. Offerings of flowers etc. are symbolic gestures of honour 
      and gratitude. No animal sacrifices have ever formed a part of Buddhist 
      ceremonial anywhere and it is Buddhism&#39;s proud boast that not a single 
      droop of blood has been shed in its name. &nbsp;</FONT></P>
