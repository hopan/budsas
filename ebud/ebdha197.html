        we have been engaged in a series of programme that are part of Kathina
        robe-offering ceremony. It is important that we understand about what we
        are doing -- in this particular case, about Kathina ceremony; to be
        aware of some thing we are undertaking is Buddhist way of doing things
        which is technically called Right Understanding. There is more chance
        for Right Understanding when Right Mindfulness is present.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So today it is nothing but appropriate
        for us to reflect on the practice of Kathina -- the Theravada
        traditional robe-offering ceremony.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The word <strong>'Kathina' </strong>is
        Pali in origin. It means a frame used in sewing robes those days in
        India. However, before we talk about this Kathina let us look at some
        other monastic practices related to it so that we can understand Kathina
        ceremony in a broader perspective.</font></p>
        <p align="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><strong>PRACTICE
        OF RETREAT</strong></font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Kathina ceremony is
        necessarily a monastic one, supported by the generous devotees. It is
        essentially connected to the three months retreat that ends on 16th this
        month (October, 1997).</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">We need to discuss about
        Buddhist Monastic Retreat as a background before we actually take on
        Kathina issue. Buddhist retreat came into existence as a result of
        complaint made by the people. Jaina monastic order was already
        practising this Vassana Retreat practice before the Buddha made His
        follower Bhikkhus do the same. The people expected monks, both Buddhist
        and non Buddhist, to stay in one place at least for a certain period.
        They complained that the monks were moving from place to place all the
        time without a permanent dwelling. During rainy season, the monks did
        damage the plants and crops. The Jaina monks and other mendicants
        observed a treat during rainy season staying in one place for a period.
        People were wondering why the disciples of the Gautama Buddha did not do
        so.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">This prompted the Buddha
        to lay down a rule that Buddhist monks should observe Retreat and stay
        in one place for three months. People wanted them to do that during
        rainy season and it became known as Rainy Retreat (<strong>Vassana</strong>).
        But strictly speaking the three months retreat can now take place at any
        season -- maybe in winter or summer, although almost all have been
        observed during rainy season according to meteoric calendar in India.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The period is the same
        -- three months. This practice has been mostly observed during rainy
        season because the people wanted the monks to do so in ancient India --
        that is mainly, as I said earlier, for agricultural reason.[1] There
        were no high ways during the Buddha's time. One had to across farm lands
        to travel. Therefore, this practice has its relevance in that 6th
        century BC Indian society.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Nevertheless, even in
        India at that time the approval of the three months retreat practice was
        by no means limited to the agriculturists. It was seen as a means to
        spiritual progress as well. That was why during the time of the Buddha
        itself, Bimbisara, the King of Magadha sent an envoy to the monks asking
        them to come and observe a retreat in his kingdom. But it happened to be
        in summer and the monks first didn't accept it. Instead they referred it
        to the Buddha, who then relaxed the rule by adding that a monk could
        make a retreat during summer provided it is the wish of the ruler of the
        land. Therefore, the monks can also observe this practice of retreat in
        any other seasons other than rainy one if there are circumstances we
        have just described.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Before this rule was
        there, the monks including the Buddha Himself travelled around the year
        and they still did so for nine months after the rule was laid down.
        Travelling and meeting people at different places is a kind of
        missionary life that the Buddha envisaged. It helps the monks not to be
        attached to dwelling places and people. It enables them to render their
        service to as many as possible. It frees them from a huge burden of
        constructing, maintaining and developing a big temple or monastery. It
        helps the teachings to spread everywhere as they travel. Travelling made
        them encounter with different cultures. It gave them an understanding of
        real nature of life. Roaming around empowers them to endure hard life.
        When you have to move from one place to another almost all the time, you
        do not gather things. You start gathering things only when you have the
        idea to settle. Since they wander most of the time their way of
        thinking, their attitude towards life and their spiritual practices are
        very pragmatic, realistic and are based on facts.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">You can see now some
        development was taking place in monastic life. With this Rainy Retreat
        (Vassana) practice coming along, the monks got a bit comfortable
        shelter. The devotees who approach them can enjoy the opportunity of
        learning the Dhamma from the monks: they have regular and appropriate
        receivers in performing their act of generosity. Therefore, the benefit
        of the three months retreat is mutual. (Samyutta Nikaya)</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">I think that with the
        introduction of this Vassana practice, Buddhist monastic life came to
        balance its way of life. Brahmanism has secular lay life as its core
        while Jaina monastic life encouraged no shelter whatsoever such as a
        place for three months retreat. Buddhist Vassana practice could be
        viewed as middle way in this context.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">A monk can choose his
        own time to start Rainy Retreat. There are two commencing dates
        different from one another exactly a month. But he is entitled to
        receive Kathina-civara (Kathina-robe) only if he starts his retreat with
        an earlier date -- not the later one. This is quite important condition
        required of a monk to be entitled to Kathina-robe. Within three months
        retreat he must not break the rule of retreat by spending nights
        somewhere else without a valid reason consented in the Vinaya (Buddhist
        Monastic Disciplinary Rules). If there is emergency reason to travel, he
        can do so even during the retreat.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">To make the offering of
        robe especially valid as Kathina-civara these rules are much essential.
        Failing to comply with either of the two conditions will affect the
        validity of Kathina-robe. Invalid Kathina-robe, of course has more to do
        with the monks than the devotees. Though the devotees got the same
        merits whether the Kathina-robe is considered valid or not, the monks
        will lose the advantages associated with Kathina.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">It means they will get
        the robe but he can not enjoy five relaxations on Vinaya that come
        necessarily with the validity of Kathina procedure. Once being offered a
        valid Kathina-robe in this way during this particular one month's time
        the monks can remain without following five of the 220 disciplines --
        known as 'Vinaya Sikkhapada' for four months starting exactly a month
        after the end of the retreat. This is something about Retreat which is a
        precondition to Kathina-robe offering.</font></p>
        <p align="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><strong>INVITATION
        CEREMONY</strong></font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The second important
        procedure that must be done before Kathina ceremony is Invitation
        Ceremony (Pavarana). This is again purely monastic practice.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Invitation means at the
        end of retreat the monks must get together and invite one another to
        point out at one's fault if they have seen it themselves or have heard
        from some one or are just in doubt. This would help them in purifying
        themselves. A Bhikkhu has to be open to any criticism from his
        colleagues regarding his behaviour. He can not say, &quot;Is it your
        business?&quot; or &quot;This is my life&quot;.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Being open was a way of
        life the Lord Buddha led. The monks have to be sensitive to a complaint
        made by the people in order to win their respect and in order to
        encourage them to learn the Dhamma. They have to be sensitive towards
        the remarks made by their fellow monks. This, according to the Buddha,
        could maintain both unity and purity in the Buddhist Monastic Order. It
        could also help keep the Monastic Rules and Regulations (Vinaya) alive.
        It is a kind of check-and-balance system between individual Bhikkhus as
        well as between the seniors and the juniors. This is exactly the core of
        Monastic Discipline as much as of the Teachings.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Every fortnight there
        has to be a meeting between the higher ordained ones, known as Bhikkhu
        (monks) or Bhikkhuni (nuns) in the case of ordained female. In that kind
        of assembly, a learned monk recites the 220 rules to the monks. Before
        he recites there has to be a procedure of confession, which means every
        individual has to inform the Sangha of the offense he has committed.
        This kind of confession can clear him from 203 kinds of offenses out of
        220. Confession can psychologically relieve someone who has committed a
        grave evil like patricide. The story of King Ajatasattu who killed his
        father is an example. He could not sleep until he confessed his sin to
        the Buddha. Confession did not put his sin away but practically relieved
        him from psychological burden.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In being open to others
        the Buddha Himself was the best example. At every fortnight meeting the
        Lord Buddha would start inviting anyone present there to point out His
        fault if any. He encouraged people to be open making Himself the subject
        of openness. That must be the reason why people felt so close to Him.
        They did respect Him for a reason. They spoke so openly their opinion to
        the Buddha. They knew well that the Buddha did not take their offense.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Venerable Sariputta, the
        most important figure apart from the Buddha would ask the monks to point
        out his fault too. In this way, the invitation was to be offered by any
        monk present. Actually, what we call Arahat means the one who has no
        longer secret. He is perfectly open to anyone especially regarding his
        behaviour.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha wanted His disciples, at
        least those who have been ordained, to be as close as possible in their
        spiritual quest helping one another along the way. The only way of doing
        it and maintaining it is to practice to become increasingly open to each
        other that we no longer have anything to hide. Public morality can be
        maintained in this way. Therefore, we can say that monastic life is
        where one has least privacy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This Invitation Ceremony is so important
        ceremonially as well as spiritually. Without this there can not be a
        proper Kathina robe-offering -- it may become only ordinary
        robe-offering with whatsoever no advantage on the part of the monks
        themselves.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The two ceremonies -- the Ceremony of
        Invitation and that of Offering Robe -- mark the termination of the
        Retreat.</font></p>
        <p align="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><strong>KATHINA
        CEREMONY</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now let us pick up our main topic
        'Kathina'. We may well imagine a situation during 6th BC where any
        advanced textile technology hardly known to the people. The monks had no
        choice but to do the sewing the robe and giving it a dye themselves. The
        Buddha asked them to help one another using the best technique then
        available. Some made a frame while some went out in search of needle and
        thread. Some sew pieces of clothe to make it a robe while others
        prepared for another process of making fire and getting a suitable
        colour ready. Dying a robe was extremely difficult because they had to
        boil the bark of the tree to get the colour they wanted. Just imagine
        how the monks were busy to get a robe done. It was a hard life
        collecting pieces of cloth from different places such as rubbish-heap,
        cemetery, and streets to get it sufficient for a robe. Ordinary life was
        at that time reasonably hard especially regarding clothes; the monks
        were no exception; they had to struggle for a robe.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But this became a kind of practice that
        trained monks to depend on themselves, to live in simple way creating no
        burden to the lay community and to be content with basic needs.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Though we could say that this practice
        would reflect the economic reality in India those days, when the Lord
        Buddha declared this practice it was automatically adopted as a social
        norm among the followers. Those monks with well-to-do family and royal
        family background were no exception. They all adopted the practice. As
        we all know the majority of the immediate disciples of the Buddha came
        from either royal families or families of noble background They were in
        comfort to ignore this practice of making a robe in such a difficult
        process. Instead, they took it as a way of life with a great honour.
        This humbleness and contentment clearly indicate high spiritual
        achievement.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha recommended
        this practice to be observed at the end of the Retreat because monks can
        still be found in a large number in one place at this time and they
        could help one another.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Once entitled to
        Kathina-robe, a Bhikkhu is permitted to ignore some five minor rules.
        The relaxation is mainly felt on travel and invitation for alms-giving.
        Normally a Bhikkhu, senior or junior has to inform his fellow Bhikkhu
        living in the same temple before he goes out. He can choose not to do it
        when he has received Kathina-robe. Usually he has to carry all the three
        pieces of robe wherever he goes. He can now leave one behind if he
        wishes after he has been offered Kathina-robe. He certainly has less
        restriction on travel. He can also accept as many robes if offered
        during the period of four months. Monks on the usual occasions are not
        supposed to accept food offered by someone using the terms of layman
        culture, the words normally employed by people in their social
        interaction. But once offered Kathina-robe(s) a Bhikkhu can receive such
        food given to him in that way.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">This Kathina ceremony
        is, as far as I can see, recommended by the Lord Buddha mainly for the
        welfare of the Sangha (the Community of monks). The Lord Buddha did take
        into consideration how the Order He founded could survive. After the
        Mahaparinibbana (the Great Passing Away) of the Buddha Himself, the
        whole responsibility of both perpetuation and propagation of His
        Teachings would certainly fall on the Sangha. Therefore, the continuity
        of the Sangha means the continuity of the Dhamma itself. Moreover, after
        His Mahaparinibbana, we could see the Buddha Himself only once we see,
        understand and realise the Dhamma. This was the case even when the
        Buddha was still alive for He declared that one really sees Him only
        once one sees the Dhamma. Now we can see the logic behind the
        recommendation of this Kathina ceremony -- how it is important for the
        cause of Buddhism itself.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha did not start
        preaching to every one before He had had the Monastic Order well
        established. After His Enlightenment, He made a long journey to Benares
        -- a journey that took Him more than a week -- just to convert a group
        of five ascetics and made them a monk. He knew very well that all the
        five had a very high possibility of becoming a monk and forming the
        Order.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">He continued focusing on
        establishing the Order until He became confident that the Order has been
        well established and was capable of helping Him to propagate the Dhamma.
        His teachings spread far and wide after He passed away. Despite the fact
        that the Buddha was no longer with us, the geographical expansion still
        took place in a greater scale. The Buddha Himself would have definitely
        foreseen this great service of His disciples that He put a lot of effort
        to establish the Monastic Order (Sangha).</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The Monastic Order was
        firmly established when the Buddha had ordained sixty men -- all of whom
        came from either royal family or that of nobility. Missionary work in
        its true sense started only then with sixty deputies, despatching them
        to different directions asking two not to go in the same way.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The implication here is
        that the existence of the well-established monastic order is extremely
        essential if we are about to get the teachings of the Buddha across the
        people. The Arahat Mahinda simply had this in mind when he told King
        Devanam Piyatissa of Sri Lanka (3rd BC) that the Sasana (Buddha's
        Dispensation) will get rooted on Sri Lankan soil only when a Sri Lankan
        native monk has become well versed in Monastic Rules (Vinaya).[2]</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">There was a time in the
        West when European Buddhists used to consider that monkhood is nothing
        more than to set an exemplary life and to spread the words of the Buddha
        does not depend on the existence of Monastic Order.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Let us look at this
        attitude carefully from Buddhist History. Let us not forget to use our
        common sense. History always shows that the Buddhist Monastic Order was
        at the core of the matter -- whether Buddhism was on the decline or
        progress. The monks have to share more responsibility -- sometime for
        the degeneration and sometime for the growth. It is in the best interest
        of the whole Buddha's Sasana that Buddhist Monastic Order is properly
        maintained, purified and well supported. The Bhikkhus dedicate their
        whole life to the cause of Sasana -- studying, training, meditating,
        preaching, and writing about the Buddha's Dhamma.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In this respect, we
        should be encouraged to see the Amaravati Monastery (Theravada Forest
        Tradition) and its branches doing very well with the sons and daughters
        of the United Kingdoms at the helm. In other European countries, the
        natives have not been very successful in furthering the Dhamma despite
        having produced several distinguished Buddhist scholars.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In contrast, if I
        understand the situation correctly, the United Kingdom has been well
        ahead of other European countries in both academic field and monastic
        life. We owe a lot to the most venerable monks of true missionary spirit
        from Sri Lanka, Thailand, Burma and other countries that we have made
        our way far in this new land. I am speaking about this just to remind
        ourselves that the Sangha of 19th and 20th century also deserve to be
        called a devout and true follower of the Lord Buddha. They -- like the
        late Venerable Narada of Vajirarama, Colombo and Venerable Dr. H.
        Saddhatissa -- should be credited for what we are here now. Venerable U
        Setthila (Thittila) of Burma who arrived here in England during World
        War II and Venerable Ajahn Chah, Thailand's best know meditation master
        of our time must not be forgotten for their great service rendered to
        the cause of Buddha Sasana in this United Kingdom.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Together with ceaseless
        support on the part of the devotees, the successive Kathina ceremonies
        held every year in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand and other countries have
        enabled the monks to carry on their missionary work far and wide. The
        Kathina ceremony we are celebrating today will have the effect just as
        well like that./.</font></p>
