  <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Preface to the Third Edition</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first edition of this booklet appeared in November
  1982 under the title <em>Basic Buddhism: an Outline of the Buddha's Teaching</em>. It was
  published by the Buddhist Society of Queensland to commemorate the centenary of the
  arrival of Theravada immigrants to Queensland. It grew out of a lecture given to teachers
  of religion in Secondary Schools in October 1980. The following is an extract from the
  original Preface:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This introductory essay is confined to the <em>basic</em>
    doctrines propounded by the Buddha over 2500 years ago. This message is surprisingly
    modern, and more in keeping with the rational-scientific temper of our age than the
    various theistic systems to which most of the people of the world owe formal allegiance. A
    widespread interest in Buddhism in Australia is relatively recent. It is important that
    the original doctrine of the Buddha, divested of the cultural trappings and metaphysical
    speculations that has gathered around it during its long sojourn in a dozen Asian lands,
    is placed before the public. This booklet is written with that aim in mind.&quot; </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A second edition of this publication appeared in 1994. It
  made no changes to the main text of the first edition, except for some minor corrections.
  However some new material, intended to amplify some of the comments in the original text,
  were added as footnotes. Two Appendices were also added. The first gave information for
  those who want to call themselves Buddhists, and gives the basic precepts lay Buddhists
  are expected to observe. The second identifies three main tendencies in Pali Buddhism in
  the West.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The present edition is a revision of the second edition.
  Some new sections have been added. Some of this material first appeared as articles
  published by the author in BSQ publications.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the first edition of this booklet in 1982 Buddhism
  has greatly expanded in Australia. However most of recent Buddhism has been ethnically
  oriented associated with the activity of migrants from Buddhist Asian countries. Much of
  the recent literature on Buddhism in Australia has also been from this perspective. The
  need for a statement of Buddhism divested of cultural trappings is thus still as urgent as
  it was in 1982. There is therefore a need for a publication like the present one giving
  access to the authentic message of the Buddha freed from cultural encumbrances and other
  innovations.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The objective of the present work is still to introduce
  the central principles of Buddhism to the modern reader in the Western world in a modern
  idiom. Buddhism has been well established in several Asian countries for many centuries,
  but its expansion to other parts of the world has been comparatively recent. As far as the
  West is concerned in the ancient Hellenic world there was some contact with Buddhist
  thinking mainly due to Alexander's expedition to Asia and Asoka's missions, some of which
  are said to have been to the West. It has even been speculated that the ethical teaching
  of Christianity may have some Buddhist links. But after the conversion of Constantine to
  Christianity the hitherto open attitude to religions was subverted and other religions
  like Buddhism were barred.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The relative isolation of Buddhism to specific cultures,
  with very little interaction even between countries which professed in varying ways the
  Buddha's message, has led to the development of particular ethnic traits in the national
  forms of Buddhism practised in these countries. It is true that for the most part these
  ethnic influences have affected only relative minor aspects of the practice of the
  Buddha's teaching, but it has nonetheless been an impediment to the expansion of Buddhism
  to new areas. It is important to divest Buddhism of its national peculiarities, and to
  seek the essence of Buddhism, which is a message for all people irrespective of time and
  place. It is this &quot;original Buddhism&quot; that we have termed <strong><em>Basic
  Buddhism</em></strong>. Chapter 1 looks at this concept in more detail, but it should be
  remembered that the term &quot;basic&quot; does not imply that Buddhism has been
  simplified in any way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A restatement of Basic Buddhism is necessary if the
  Buddha's teaching is to be of use to those people who for historical reasons have not had
  access to it. Only a small proportion of the world's population are officially counted as
  professing Buddhism. This is partly due to the way in which people are classed into
  religious groupings. Buddhism in its original form does not fall into the conventional
  category of religion, and trying to count the number of Buddhists is somewhat futile. But
  it is true that a large number of people have scarcely heard of the Buddha, and many of
  those who have done so have a very incorrect view of Buddhism. This is very often
  deliberately propagated by the media and by other religions.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even though the basic teaching of the Buddha has been
  known in the modern West for over a century, most of this knowledge was confined to
  academic circles. The widespread practice of Buddhism is relatively recent, and now
  several Buddhist centres have sprung up in the West. In the last three decades many
  traditional Buddhists from Asia have migrated to the West, bringing with them ethnic forms
  of Buddhism. This has made Buddhism more visible but it has also obscured to some extent
  the central message of the Buddha. All these reasons make it necessary to give a clear
  statement of the fundamental teaching of the Buddha to readers in the West. This is the
  task that is attempted in this short booklet.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is not possible to avoid Pali terms in an exposition of
  Buddhism. A glossary of all Pali words used in this work is given in Appendix F. If the
  meaning of a Pali word used in the text is not given in the context the glossary should be
  consulted.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>CHAPTER 1</strong> </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Introduction to
  Basic Buddhism </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The term <strong><em>Buddhism</em></strong> is now used to
  denote the teaching of the Buddha, a historical person who flourished some 25 centuries
  ago on the Indian subcontinent. This teaching has been described variously as a religion,
  a philosophy, a psychological system, an ethico-moral code, a socio-economic blue-print,
  and so on. No doubt all these aspects could be discerned in different parts of the
  Buddha's teaching, but the teaching is itself something more than all these combined. The
  term which Buddhists use to designate the teaching is <strong><em>Dhamma</em></strong> or <em>Dharma</em><a
  href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> . This term comes from a root term meaning &quot;to
  uphold&quot;, and means the basic law which &quot;upholds&quot; the universe. It is
  therefore sometimes translated simply as Law or Norm. It conveys some idea of the unity
  that informs the whole body of the Buddha's teaching. We shall use the words <em>dhamma</em>
  and Buddhism as synonyms.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The term &quot;Basic Buddhism&quot; is used in this work
  to denote those elements of Buddhism as currently propagated which could be attributed
  fairly unambiguously to the Buddha himself. It is a basic argument here that this teaching
  can not only be practised effectively in the modern world but also conforms to the modern
  scientific view of the world<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> . In seeking to establish
  the content of Basic Buddhism we have to start with a consideration of the different
  schools of Buddhism that have arisen in the course of history. The Buddha did not leave
  written records, and his disciples transmitted his teaching initially as an oral
  tradition. Quite early in its history several distinct schools of Buddhism arose based
  partly on the interpretation of common discourses, and partly on differing texts of the
  discourses themselves. There is a substantial degree of agreement between these diverse
  schools, and they have never exhibited an animosity towards each other comparable to the
  schisms that have characterised many other religions.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> It
  is from the scriptures of these various schools of Buddhism, particularly from the Pali
  Canon, that the original message of the Buddha, which we term Basic Buddhism, has to be
  reconstructed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">About three centuries after the death of the Buddha
  several different schools of Buddhism emerged, but the differences between them were
  slight and related to minor points. However towards the beginning of the Common Era (CE)<a
  href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> some of these groups gave a new interpretation to the
  Buddha's teaching and called themselves the Mah�y�na (&quot;Greater Vehicle&quot;)
  School. They called the earlier schools the &quot;Hinay�na&quot; (Lesser Vehicle) school.
  However this term was never accepted by the schools who were designated by it. Of these
  schools only one survives today<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> . This is the Therav�da
  (&quot;Doctrine of the Elders&quot;) school which claims to carry on the Buddhism of the
  early followers of the Buddha. This view is now generally accepted and the Mah�y�na is
  seen as a new innovation in Buddhism but still containing some of the essence of the
  original teaching. These two traditions have also been termed the Southern and Northern
  schools of Buddhism because of the geographical areas in which each prevailed. Each of
  these traditions has its own versions of the Buddhist scriptures. All Theravada groups
  subscribe to a common set of basic books (called the Pali Canon after the language, Pali,
  in which it is recorded). We shall however refer to the original Buddhism as Pali Buddhism
  rather than Theravada Buddhism.<a href="#N_6_"> <sup>(6)</sup></a> Amongst the Mah�y�na
  there is a much greater diversity of schools, doctrines, languages and texts. Initially
  Sanskrit was the language of the Indian Mahay�na schools, but many of these were later
  translated to Chinese and China soon became the centre of Mahay�na Buddhism. From there
  it spread to many other countries including Korea, Japan (where the best known school of
  Buddhism is Zen) and Tibet (where a distinct variety of Mah�y�na Buddhism called the
  Vajray�na or the &quot;Diamond Vehicle&quot; developed). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In its fundamental doctrines basic Buddhism is closer to
  Pali Buddhism than to the Mah�y�na schools. This is because the Pali Canon is the oldest
  compilation of the Buddha's teaching, and closest to the actual words of the Buddha. Its
  present form was settled at the Third Council of Buddhists held during the reign of King
  Asoka of Ancient India about 250 BCE. The Pali Canon was thus systemised quite early, and
  has changed very little, indeed if at all, since then. It was committed to writing in the
  first century BCE, and this preserved the texts from possible further verbal corruption.
  The Pali Canon (like some other Buddhist canons) consists of three sections (called <em>Piakas</em>
  or baskets) dealing with the <strong><em>Vinaya</em></strong> (monastic discipline), <strong><em>Sutta</em></strong>
  (doctrines) and the <strong><em>Abhidhamma</em></strong> (the analysis of the Dhamma).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">While the principles and practice of basic Buddhism has to
  be sought in the Pali Canon (especially in the <em>Vinaya</em> and the <em>Sutta</em>
  piakas), actual Therav�da theory shows some development from early Buddhism. This took
  three directions: </font><ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Some of the material in the third section of the Canon, the
      Abhidhamma Pitaka, was composed at a later date, and employed a didactic and taxonomic
      method in analysing the psychological and philosophical concepts introduced by the Buddha.
      The empirical method it employed to verify the Buddha's teaching was meditative
      contemplation (especially insight meditation), and it excluded the use of other empirical
      methods such as those employed by modern science. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The commentatorial efforts of the great medieval
      scholastics like Buddhaghosa and Dharmap�la tended to ossify the meaning and
      interpretation of the Buddha's discourses, which was taken to be authoritative
      interpretations of the Dhamma. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Some contemporary developments in the Mahay�na came to
      influence not only the practices of Therav�da, but also some aspects of Therav�da
      doctrine as well. These developments must be taken into account in the reconstruction of
      the original message of the Buddha. </font></li>
  </ol>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It must not be thought that Basic Buddhism should exclude
  everything found in the Mahayana teachings. While Mahayana has little to contribute to the
  reconstruction of the theory of early Buddhism, it did retain some early Buddhist
  practices which play a subordinate role in Pali Buddhism but could play a useful role in
  modern Buddhist practice. Mahayana Buddhism shifted the Buddhist ideal from the Arahant of
  Theravada Buddhism to the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva was seen as a being who while being
  capable of enlightenment and release from sams�ra, wilfully postpones becoming fully
  liberated in order to help others. A natural consequence of this view was that the primary
  Buddhist virtue was compassion (karun�). In contrast to this Theravada had regarded <em>mett�</em>
  (loving-kindness) as the dominant virtue. There is a need to reinstate compassion in
  Buddhist practice at least to an extent equal to that given to mett�.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another aspect of Mah�y�na that is important is the
  greater role given to the lay community in contrast to that of monks. Early Buddhism had
  denoted by the Sangha the community of all Buddhists who had made some progress in the
  Dhamma. This Sangha included both monks and lay persons, but Theravada Buddhism tended to
  be excessively centred on the monastic orders, and included in the Sangha only ordained
  monks, and sometimes reserved for them the exclusive role as teachers of the Dhamma.
  Mah�y�na took a more flexible attitude. While the role of monks in Buddhism cannot be
  underrated, and they will continue to play an important part in contemporary Buddhism, it
  is clear that basic Buddhism should reinstate the role of the lay community<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>
  .</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Basic Buddhism should not be seen as an innovation in
  Buddhism but rather as an attempt to go back to the roots of Buddhism, to what would have
  been the actual doctrines preached originally by the Buddha. <a href="#cont">Go to

  <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Life of the
  Buddha</strong> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The founder of Buddhism was an historical person,
  Siddhatta Gtama who lived in North India from 563 BCE to 483 BCE.<a href="#N_8_"> <sup>(8)</sup></a>
  His father was Suddhodana the ruler of the S�kyas a people inhabiting a country which lay
  on the border between modern Nepal and India. At the time of his birth his mother
  Mah�m�y� was on a journey and he was born in a park at Lumbini on the full moon day of
  the month of April-May in the year 563 BCE. A commemorative pillar was erected on the spot
  by King Asoka some three centuries later. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Several legends are attached to the birth of Sidhatta,
  including a prophecy by the brahmin Asita that he would either be a great
  (&quot;universal&quot;) ruler or a fully enlightened teacher. It is said that Suddhodana
  wanted his son to become a monarch rather than a great religious teacher, and accordingly
  brought him up in the lap of luxury with the training befitting a future king. But very
  little is known of the early life of Sidhatta. No indication of his future destiny is
  recorded other than a reference to an incident when as a child he went into a meditative
  trance while seated in an open field watching an agricultural festival. When he was
  sixteen Sidhatta was married to Bhaddakacc�n� (also known as Yasodar�).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The events that forced his decision to renounce the life
  of luxury he was leading and take to the religious life occurred when he was about 29
  years of age. It is claimed that at this time he encountered the famous four signs, that
  of an old man, of a sick man, of a corpse and of a religious recluse, and that these led
  him to question the unsatisfactoriness of life and the need to find a way of escape from
  its travails. The misery and brevity of human existence struck him with force, and also
  the desire to find a solution to the problems of life. But the critical event was the
  birth of his first child, a son who was named R�hula. When the child was born Gotama
  realised that if he were to assume the role of a parent he would never leave the household
  life in this quest for the meaning of life, and accordingly he decided to renounce the
  household life. Fearing that a public announcement would bring pressure to change his
  mind, he left his palace with only his charioteer accompanying him, donned the garments of
  a recluse and went into the homeless life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Gotama thus became a <em>samana [sramana]</em> or
  religious mendicant. The samanas were people who devoted their entire time to the search
  for religious truth. They did not adhere to the prevailing religious orthodoxy of the day,
  the Brahmanical religion based on the ancient Vedas. They were highly individualistic and
  engaged in a variety of practices. The next seven years of Gotama's life were devoted to
  his quest. He became the pupils of the leading religious teachers of his day, such as
  �l�ra K�l�ma and Uddaka R�maputta. They were the leading exponents of meditation of
  the day, and Gotama mastered all the meditation techniques they could teach including the
  development of the <em>jh�nas</em>. Since these did not provide the solution he was
  seeking he continued in his search.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By this time his wandering had taken him south of the
  Ganges river. He now formed an association with five other samanas, who were more inclined
  to the practice of austerities. But even these did not satisfy Gotama. He now continued
  his search alone. His search finally ended on the full moon day in the month of Ves�kha
  (April-May) in the year 528 BCE when he meditating under an Asattha or Pippala tree (<em>ficus
  religiosa</em>) near Uruvel� (now known as Buddha-Gay�). He had become the Buddha (a
  term meaning the &quot;Enlightened One&quot;), by which title he was henceforth to be
  universally known. The tree has come to be known as the Bodhi (or Bo) tree, and is
  regarded as a symbol of the Buddha's enlightenment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After considerable thought he decided to proclaim his
  discovery for the benefit of mankind. His hesitation arose from the complexity of the
  system he had discovered, and its opposition to the comfortable beliefs which then as now
  appeared to offer an easier solution to the spiritual needs of people. The first
  proclamation of the Dhamma took place at the deer-park in Isipatana close to the city of
  Sarnath (near modern Benares) to the five former ascetic companions, who became the
  Buddha's first disciples. From that day on until his death some 45 years later the Buddha
  travelled around Northern India tirelessly proclaiming his message. The five ascetics
  became the first members of the Buddhist Sangha (or Community of disciples) which has
  survived to this day in unbroken succession.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The exact chronology of the Buddha's ministry has not been
  recorded and cannot be reconstructed. His more important discourses are preserved, but
  while they indicate the circumstances leading to each discourse, and often the place of
  its delivery, there is generally no indication of the date or even year of the discourse.
  From the places mentioned in the discourses it is possible to reconstruct the area of the
  Buddha's travels. This was confined mainly to the middle Gangetic plain with Kapilavatthu
  to the North, Uruvel� to the South, and Campa to the East. The Western extent is not
  certain, some suttas being delivered not far from the modern Delhi. This area straddled
  the Ganges river, and included parts of two important kingdoms in the Buddha's time. These
  were Kosala which was located North of the river Ganges with S�vatthi as its capital, and
  Magadha which was to the South of Kosala with Rajagaha as its capital. The Buddha became
  well known in both these kingdoms and their capital cities. There are legendary accounts
  of visits of the Buddha to places as far away as Sri Lanka, and even to heavenly domains,
  but these have no historical basis.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha and his followers initially followed the
  wandering life of the <em>samanas</em>, but soon developed the habit of staying at least
  part of the year in a monastery. The period of monastic sojourn came to be known as the
  &quot;rains retreat&quot; <em>(vas)</em> because it coincided with the Indian monsoon. The
  monasteries were donated by wealthy lay followers. In the early years the Buddha spent his
  rains retreats south of the Ganges river mainly at R�jagaha, but gradually moved north.
  In the later years the most frequently visited location was S�vatthi, where the Buddha
  spent 23 of the last 25 rains retreats. The very last rains retreat was spent at Vesali
  when the Buddha was on his last journey from R�jagaha to S�vatthi.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>
  The Buddha's death (<em>parinibb�na</em>) took place at a place called Kusin�ra mid-way
  between Ves�li and S�vatthi.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">While some debate may attach to the exact dates of the
  Buddha's life there can be no doubt about the historicity of the Buddha<a href="#N_10_"> <sup>(10)</sup></a>.
  The Buddha's teaching, unlike that of many other founders of religious systems, was so
  unique, original and consistent that it could only have been the work of a single person.
  The Buddha did not appropriate on himself the role of a God or of a prophet of God, in
  order to validate his teachings. His teachings were derived from his own unaided efforts.<a
  href="#N_11_"> <sup>(11)</sup></a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Recently discovered archaeological evidence corroborate
  the accounts in the texts. These include the discovery of urns with inscriptions
  indicating that they were the receptacle for the relics of the Buddha. King Asoka's
  pillars, though a few centuries after the death of the Buddha also identify the places
  associated with the life story of the Buddha. The most recent discoveries have been
  archaeological remains authenticating the birthplace of the Buddha as Lumbini.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a detailed account of the last days of the Buddha
  in the Mah�parinibb�na sutta, but no such detailed information is available for any
  other part of his life. After his death the relics of the Buddha was distributed and
  stupas were built over them.<a href="#cont">Go to Contents</a> </font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism recognises no creeds whose uncritical acceptance
  is expected of its followers. Instead the Buddha enunciated certain basic laws and truths
  whose veracity he invited his followers to test for themselves. One of the traditional
  epithets of the Dhamma is &quot;ehipassiko&quot; (meaning literally &quot;come and
  see&quot;) which is an appeal to the empirical verification of the Dhamma.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In his very first discourse the Buddha identified Four
  Noble Truths as forming the core of the Dhamma. These four Truths have since become a
  convenient way of stating the fundamentals of the Dhamma. They are often regarded as the
  most basic teaching of the Buddha. The Buddha also identified three fundamental
  characteristics (<em>tilakkhana</em>) of the Dhamma. These basic tenets the Buddha
  presented in several ways. Two such presentations have become well known. These are the
  Three Signata (tilakkhana), perhaps better rendered as the three basic laws, and the Four
  Noble Truths. The acceptance of the validity of these laws and truths, if only in the
  first instance as a working hypothesis, is the <em>sin qua non</em> of a Buddhist. In
  addition the Buddha proclaimed several other doctrines, the most important being those of
  karma and re-birth. The validity of such doctrines is more difficult for an ordinary
  person to verify, but their dogmatic acceptance is not expected as a fundamental
  requirement of those who go for refuge to the &quot;Three Gems&quot; of Buddhism<a
  href="#N_12_"> <sup>(12)</sup></a>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The three signata and the four truths form the core of the
  Dhamma. They are at the same time both alternatives and complements to each other. It may
  however be appropriate to consider them separately.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Three Fundamental Laws of the Buddha</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The three signata refer to the three essential marks or
  characteristics of all &quot;compounded&quot; things, animate or inanimate, microscopic or
  macroscopic. Because of the universality of their applicability they could be considered
  as having the force of universal laws. These characteristics are impermanence (anicca),
  unsatisfactoriness (dukkha), and insubstantiality (anatta). As these translations of the
  basic P�li terms are only approximate, a further elaboration of these basic concepts of
  the Dhamma is necessary.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) <strong>Anicca</strong>. The law of impermanence
  asserts that all phenomena are subject to constant change, to rise and fall, and no
  permanent states, either physical or animate, exists. The dynamic nature of phenomena is
  today a commonplace of science. But until quite recently many physical features of the
  universe were considered immutable, and in the human plane the belief in enduring states
  or characteristics is still an article of faith in many religious systems. The law of
  anicca establishes impermanence as the basic universal law.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) <strong>Dukkha</strong>. The law of dukkha states that
  all complexes of phenomena, are in the final analysis unsatisfactory. It means that no
  compounded thing or state could be considered as a universal norm of goodness or beauty.
  It imparts the normative dimension into the consideration of objective reality which is
  the hallmark of the Dhamma. The law of dukkha is usually considered in relation to the
  human situation, and here unsatisfactoriness manifests itself as &quot;suffering&quot;,
  which is the popular rendition of the term. It is in this sense that it constitutes the
  first of the four Noble Truths.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) <strong>Anatta</strong>. The third law states that
  there is no permanent essence, &quot;self&quot;, ego, or soul in phenomena. The term
  originates as the negation of the concept of <em>atta</em> (�tman) which was the
  equivalent in the old Brahmanical religion of the Buddha's day to what other religions
  have called the &quot;soul&quot;. The Buddha advanced psycho-physical explanation of the
  individual which leaves no room for a soul. The Buddha recognised that the delusion of
  self or ego was one of the most powerful of human instincts, and at the same time one of
  the most potent sources of ignorance and wrong action. In applying the anatta doctrine to
  the phenomena of the external world some care mush be exercised. Early Buddhism did not
  deny the reality of the external world. It argued that the phenomena of the external world
  could be broken down into its constituent components, and that nothing else other than
  these components existed. It was only in this sense that the phenomena of the external
  world were declared to be empty (su��a). Some schools of Mahay�na Buddhism have taken
  the doctrine of emptiness (su���t�) to imply a denial of the reality of the external
  world. This interpretation is foreign to early Buddhism. Early Buddhism only asserts that
  there is no fixed essence or being in phenomena, but only a process of becoming (bh�va).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Four Noble Truths</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The four noble truths result from the application of the
  three basic laws to the human condition. The Buddha frequently asserted that he was
  interested in the problem of the alleviation of human suffering: &quot;Only one thing do I
  teach, suffering, and how to end it&quot;. His approach to the problem of suffering was
  similar to that of the physician to his patient. He first diagnoses the malady, then seeks
  the cause of the malady, next finds out whether a cure is possible. Finally he prescribes
  the medicine. The four truths correspond to the four steps of this diagnostic-curative
  procedure.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) <strong>The Truth of Suffering</strong>. </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This truth affirms that the law of dukkha is applicable to
    the human condition:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Birth is suffering, decay is suffering, death is
      suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are suffering. To be separated
      from the pleasant is suffering; to be in contact with the unpleasant is suffering; in
      short the five aggregates of existence connected with attachment are all suffering&quot;.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The validity of the truth of suffering need not be
    belaboured here; it is essentially a matter for personal verification. The truth of dukkha
    refers not to the on-existence of the pleasurable and the joyful, but to the very
    incompleteness and finitude of that enjoyment. The imputation of pessimism sometimes made
    of early Buddhism is without foundation; suffering in the Buddhist sense encompasses what
    is usually termed &quot;evil&quot; in other religo-philosophical systems, and the
    existence of evil, caused either by chance events or by deliberate ill-will is not
    seriously denied.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) <strong>The Truth of the Cause of Suffering</strong>. </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The proximate cause of suffering is craving (tanh�), but
    the root cause of ignorance (avijj�). The objects of craving are manifold: sensual
    pleasure, material possessions, glory, power, fame, ego, craving for re-birth, even
    craving for nibb�na (nirv�na). There are various degrees of craving from a mild wish to
    an acute grasping (up�d�na). Craving is the proximate cause of suffering and is itself
    caused by other conditioning factors. The full formula of causation is contained in the
    Buddhist formula of dependent origination, where the causes for existence and suffering
    are traced back through a chain of twelve links, back to ignorance.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) <strong>The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering</strong>.
  </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This growth constitutes the &quot;good news&quot; of
    Buddhism. The cause of suffering could be counteracted. This truth affirms that a way out
    of suffering exists, which if followed will lead the individual to a state of
    non-suffering called nibb�na, perhaps better known by the Sanskrit form of the term,
    Nirv�na. If the first truth could be considered to have a taint of &quot;pessimism&quot;,
    this truth has the full flavour of &quot;optimism&quot;.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(4) <strong>The Truth of the Path to Enlightenment.</strong>
  </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist path to enlightenment is that discovered by
    the Buddha through his own personal effort and practice. It has been called the Middle
    Path (majjima paipad�) because it is a <em>via media</em> between the extremes of
    self-indulgence and self-mortification. Both extremes of practice were common in the
    Buddha's day (as indeed they are in out own). The Buddha calls such extremes vain,
    profitless and ignoble. The path of the Buddha avoids two kinds of activity usually
    considered essential for salvation by many religious systems. These are: (1) prayer to
    supra human powers and agencies, and (2) elaborate rites and rituals. On the contrary
    these are considered as being positive impediments on the path to the cessation of
    suffering and the gaining of insight and wisdom.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">While the Four Noble Truths and the Three Laws of
  Existence contain the kernel of the Buddha's teaching, and were proclaimed by the Buddha
  in his very first discourse, there are many other doctrines that are central to a
  philosophical system which is as deep as that of Buddhism. A few of these aspects of the
  teaching will be mentioned here and a few of these will be considered in detail elsewhere.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Goal of Buddhism and the Meaning of Life</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist goal is the achievement of human perfection,
  which should be the real purpose of life. It is in this sense that life has meaning, and
  which should inform the most salient aspects of human activity. A person who has made good
  progress along the Buddhist path would have reached a high degree of happiness,
  contentment and freedom from fear. Sometimes material affluence is seen as the goal of
  many persons, but these do not necessarily bring about the happiness which the Buddha
  sought to promote.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many religions look upon the present life as a ground for
  laying the foundation in a future life after physical death. Some Buddhists also adopt
  this attitude and try to secure a good rebirth or even Nibb�na without residue.
  Exhortations from the Buddha could be produced to this effect. But the Buddha also affirms
  that we must make use of the present life, of which we are sure, and that the pursuit of
  the Noble Eightfold Path is the best way of doing so regardless of any consequences that
  may happen after death.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Theory of Causality</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the central doctrines of Buddhism is that all
  phenomena owe their origin and existence to pre-conditioning factors. Everything is the
  result of a some cause or other working on the thing concerned. This is a view that is
  also shared by modern science, for without the operation of systematic causes much of the
  achievement of modern science may not be possible. But whereas science generally restricts
  this principle to physical phenomena and events, in Buddhism the theory of causation
  considers causation as a central characteristic of all phenomena, even non-physical ones
  which do not form the subject matter of scientific enquiry.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist theory of causation should be distinguished
  from the theory of the &quot;First Cause&quot; which is often used by theists to prove the
  existence of God. The theory of the first cause asserts that since God is identified as
  the first cause (all others being &quot;created&quot; by God) there is no need to explain
  the existence of God. Buddhism does not agree with this position and considers it as
  another instance of sophistry (&quot;eel-wriggling&quot;) to which theists resort to
  sustain their absurd views.<a href="#N_13_"> <sup>(13)</sup></a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Doctrine of Dependent Origination</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is one of the cardinal discoveries of the Buddha
  during his enlightenment. It is presented as a list of twelve bases which are causally
  linked to each other. Since the links from a closed circle we can break into the chain at
  any point. The order in the traditional list is as follows: (1) Ignorance, (2) Volitional
  formations (<em>sankh�ra), </em>(3) consciousness, (4) mind-and-form, (5) sense-bases,
  (6) contact, (7) feeling, (8) craving, (9) clinging, (10) becoming, (11) birth, (12)
  old-age-and-death.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are various ways of interpreting this chain, but we
  shall not deal with them here. The traditional interpretation of this is that it
  represents three phases often interpreted as lifetimes. The first phase (the past) is
  comprised of links 1 and 2; the second (the present) of links 3 to 10, and the third (the
  future) of links 11 and 12. In the ongoing process what if the present becomes and past
  and what is the future becomes the present. A detailed explication of this famous formula
  is not attempted here.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Emptiness and non-Self</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The doctrine of &quot;emptiness&quot; (uny�t�) is more
  associated with Mahayana than with Theravada. If it represents another term for the anatta
  doctrine described earlier it presents no new problem. However some Mahayana
  interpretations tend towards philosophical idealism and towards the Hindu notion that the
  world is an illusion (m�y�) but such an interpretation cannot be entertained by Basic
  Buddhism.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Humanism and Rationalism</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Basic Buddhism has some affinity with Western notions of
  humanism and rationalism. However these terms are used in a variety of contexts, with
  humanism associated with theistic notions on the one hand and extreme secular-materialist
  notions on the other. But if humanism means what it should mean, that is the primacy of
  the human as against the Divine, then it conforms to the Buddhist approach.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With rationalism as the application of reason and the
  scientific method to investigation there is much in common. One of the basic sutta of the
  Buddha, the K�l�ma Sutta given in the Anguttara Nik�ya is rightly regarded as the
  Buddhist charter for free inquiry.<a href="#cont">Go to Contents</a> </font></p>

  4</strong> </font></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Buddhist Path</strong>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's path of practice is called the Noble
  Eightfold path. The eight components of this path, as presented in traditional order,
  could be briefly described as follows:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>1. Right View (Understanding).</strong> </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the right way of interpreting and viewing the
    world. It involves the realisation of the three signata in all phenomena, and of the Four
    Noble Truths as being applicable to the human condition. More generally it involves the
    abandonment of all dogmatically held wrong views.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>2. Right Intention (Thought).</strong> </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha argued that all human thought and action spring
    from basic &quot;intentions&quot;, &quot;dispositions&quot;, or &quot;roots&quot;, which
    are capable of deliberate cultivation, training and control. The three roots of wrong,
    unwholesome or &quot;unskilful&quot; action are: Greed, Aversion and Delusion. The right
    intention which the Buddhist path requires, is an intention which is free from these
    roots. The Buddha called the intention &quot;that is free from greed and lust, free from
    ill-will, free from cruelty&quot;.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>3. Right Speech.</strong> </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since speech is the most powerful means of communication,
    the Buddha emphasises the cultivation of right modes of speech. These have been described
    as avoiding falsehood and adhering to the truth; abstaining from tale-bearing and instead
    promoting harmony; refraining from harsh language and cultivating gentle and courteous
    speech; avoiding vain, irresponsible and foolish talk, and speaking in reasoned terms on
    subjects of value. Naturally right speech includes in the modern context right ways of
    communication whatever the medium used.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>4. Right Action.</strong> </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This refers to wilful acts done by a person, whether by
    body or mind. Under the former it involves such forms of ethical conduct as not killing
    (or harming) living beings, theft, sexual wrong-doing, etc.<a href="#N_14_"> <sup>(14)</sup></a>
    On the positive side right action, also called wholesome deeds (<em>kusalakamma</em>),
    involves acts of loving-kindness (<em>mett�</em>), compassion (<em>karun�</em>),
    sympathetic joy (<em>mudita</em>), generosity (<em>c�ga</em>), etc.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>5. Right Livelihood.</strong> </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This involves not choosing an occupation that brings
    suffering to others, e.g. trading in living beings (including humans), arms, drugs,
    poisons, etc.; slaughtering, fishing, soldiering, sooth-saying, trickery, usury, etc. This
    provides the economic blueprint for a truly Buddhist society.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>6. Right Effort.</strong> </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This has been described as &quot;the effort of avoiding or
    overcoming evil and unwholesome things, and of developing and maintaining wholesome
    things&quot; (�y�n�tiloka). Right effort enables an individual to cultivate the right
    frame of mind in order to accomplish the ethical requirements under right speech, right
    action and right livelihood. It is generally presented as a factor of mental training,
    enabling individuals to develop the sublime states of loving-kindness (<em>mett�</em>)
    compassion (<em>karun�</em>), sympathetic joy (<em>mudita</em>), and equanimity (<em>upekkha</em>).
    However it has a general applicability and the effort could be directed to all wholesome
    activities.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>7. Right Mindfulness.</strong> </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the basic Buddhist technique of cultivating
    awareness. The classic sutta on the subject is the satipah�na sutta which will be
    considered briefly in the next chapter. Although viewed as a meditation component in fact
    right awareness has a wider applicability.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>8. Right Concentration.</strong> </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the concentration of mind associated with
    wholesome consciousness which could be achieved through the systematic cultivation of
    meditation. Progress along this line is indicated by the achievement of the different
    levels of &quot;absorption&quot; (<em>jh�nas</em>).<a href="#N_15_"> <sup>(15)</sup></a></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of these eight components of the Path, the first two have
  usually been grouped under wisdom (<em>pa���</em>), the next three under morality (<em>s�la</em>),
  and the last three under mental development (<em>bh�van�</em>). This classification is
  not quite satisfactory, but it does present a broad grouping that is useful in many
  contexts.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first of these components (right view) is generally
  considered the most important, but there is no particular order of importance when it
  comes to the others. However different traditions and exponents have put different degrees
  of stress on the different components. It will be seen that there is no single component
  of the path that can be called &quot;meditation&quot;. However in course of time the
  component of mental development came to be regarded as meditation. In view of the
  importance attached to meditation, particularly in Western practice it is necessary to
  examine this subject in the special subsection. This is done in the following section.<a
  href="#cont">Go to Contents</a> </font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="ch5"></a><font color="#000080"><strong>CHAPTER
  5</strong> </font></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Role of
  Meditation</strong> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have seen that the Buddhist path consists of
  wisdom/knowledge, ethical conduct, and mental development. Some teachers put an almost
  exclusive emphasis on the last of these (calling it &quot;meditation&quot;) as the route
  to the other two. Because of the widespread propagation of this view in the West it is
  worth considering it in some detail<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a> .</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The widely held picture of meditation in the West is one
  where the meditator sits in silent company, usually in the &quot;lotus position&quot;, and
  is engaged in inward contemplation. The session may last from a half-hour to several
  hours. It is generally a congregational activity but it is usually presided over by a
  teacher who determines the duration of the session and may give directions as to how the
  activity is to proceed. Practitioners are encouraged to engage in the activity
  individually at home if congregational meditation is not possible. Often special
  meditation retreats are held lasting from 3 to 14 days in which up to 12 hours a day may
  be devoted to meditation activities. Because of the long periods involved sitting
  meditation is alternated with &quot;walking meditation&quot;, sometimes also with yogic
  exercises. Often silence is enforced during the retreat (called the Rule of Golden
  Silence), and the teacher has individual meetings with each participant during which the
  individual practitioner's &quot;progress&quot; is probed and special instructions given.
  The teacher is very often looked upon as a &quot;guru&quot; as in the Hindu tradition.
  This type of meditative exercise is often represented as the exclusive way to
  &quot;practice&quot; Buddhism. We shall use the term &quot;stylised meditation&quot;<a
  href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> to designate this kind of meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation on the other hand has always been a valid part
  of Buddhist practice (note however that is a part, nor the whole of it). The task is then
  to differentiate genuine Buddhist meditation from stylised meditation. Buddhist mediation
  is the practice of the last two components of the eightfold path (<em>sati</em> and <em>sam�dhi</em>)
  in the &quot;right&quot;(<em>samm�</em>) manner. The Pali term that is used to denote
  stylised meditation is <em>bhavan�</em>. This term is not used with great frequency in
  the Pali Canon and when used is associated with mental development from whatever kind of
  activity that will improve the mind.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Stylised meditation is derived from meditation practices
  in the principal Asian Theravada countries, viz. Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand each of
  which has developed their own meditation traditions. In spite of the diversity within each
  country a few broad generalisation may be possible. In Sri Lanka the primary focus of
  Buddhist practice has been on the cultivation of <em>pa���</em> and in the development
  of ethical practice (<em>s�la</em>). Meditation has not occupied great prominence and has
  been undertaken on an individual basis, rarely performed in a congregational setting. In
  this the Sri Lankan Buddhists have generally followed the instructions on meditation given
  in the Visuddhimagga of Buddhaghosa which was composed in that country. Where meditation
  has been used as the principal focus in Sri Lanka it has been practised by reclusive
  forest monks with little contact with the rest of the Bhikkhu-sangha or the laity. The
  country from where stylised meditation was introduced into the West is Thailand. Here the
  &quot;forest&quot; orders have enjoyed much more status than elsewhere. They tend to look
  on stylised meditation as the key to the entire Buddhist practice including the
  achievement of wisdom and morality. This system attaches much importance to the <em>jh�nas</em>
  which is considered almost indispensable to enlightenment. There is little attempt at
  sutta-study except those relating to meditation. While this kind of meditation may suit
  the lifestyle of forest monks it is their importation into the general community,
  especially of lay persons, that is questionable. If the Sri Lankan and Thai modes of
  meditation can be taken as occupying two ends of a spectrum the meditation practice of
  Burma occupies an intermediate position. Here meditation is taken more seriously than in
  the Sri Lankan tradition but some of the excesses of the Thai forest tradition are avoided<a
  href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> .</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist meditation of whatever type takes two principal
  forms - the cultivation of calm and tranquillity (<em>samatha bh�van�</em>) and the
  cultivation of insight (<em>vipassan� bh�van�</em>). The efficacy of meditation in
  promoting calm and tranquillity is indisputable. In fact it is for this reason that it is
  also adopted by some non-Buddhist schemes such as Hinduism and &quot;transcendental
  meditation&quot;. But its use as a method of achieving insight into reality it may be
  questioned. True insight comes only we understand that the three signata underlie all
  phenomena. In meditation one may come to the realise this within in the ambit of ones own
  experience, but it will not lead one understand the universality of these traits. Thus
  meditation has to be supplemented by other methods such as the first two components of the
  Buddhist path.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The classic discourse on which the theory of meditation is
  based is the Satipah�na Sutta, which occurs twice in the Canon. Here the Buddha
  identifies four methods (or foundations) of meditation. These are the contemplation of the
  body (<em>k�y�nupassan�</em>), of feeling (<em>vedan�nupassan�</em>), of the mind (<em>citt�nupassan�</em>)
  and finally that of the dhammas (<em>dhamm�nupassan�</em>). Some preconditions are laid
  down in the Sutta before these contemplations are attempted. One is that the practitioner
  should have &quot;overcome in this world covetousness and discontent&quot; (<em>vineyya
  loke abhijj� domanassa</em>). In the case of lay persons this does not require complete
  withdrawal from the world, but the development of a sufficient degree of detachment from
  it. The Satipah�na cannot be attempted by those completely given to greed. The second is
  that the contemplations should be done in an empty room (<em>su���g�ra</em>) or if
  outdoors at the root of a tree. This rules out the congregational sessions in which
  stylised meditation takes place.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The contemplation of the body, with the initial focus on
  the breath, is the initial contemplation that is taught by most teachers. The Buddha used
  it purely as the starting point of his sequence of contemplations, and he even recommends
  the &quot;lotus position&quot; in which to undertake the contemplations, which is a
  classic yogic stance. The Buddha extended the traditional Vedic meditation concerns by
  extending the contemplation to other physical postures and awareness of other bodily
  actions, and finally to the contemplation of the foulness of the body. The progress of the
  meditation from the body to feelings is also relatively easy for many practitioners. The
  next stage of the contemplation of the mind is relatively more difficult. The objective
  here is to achieve one-pointedness of mind. This is relatively difficult because of the
  propensity of the mind to shift quite fast.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last one requires contemplation of the Dhammas. In the
  Buddha's time when the corpus of dhamma was memorised, this contemplation was the only way
  of acquiring the knowledge of the dhamma. Today the situation is somewhat different and
  this particular foundation of mindfulness could be acquired by discursive study. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The view that the awakening of wisdom can only come
  through intense meditation is not only found in schools like Zen but is also held by some
  teachers of Therav�da<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a> . However meditation in
  Buddhism is primarily a method of mental training. It could be used to calm the mind, to
  instil tranquillity, and to set the stage for the realisation of true insight. In fact
  fascination with meditation can be a distraction from the true path. A capable exponent of
  early Buddhism David Maurice puts this quite well: &quot;There is meditation at the very
  beginning of the practice but the practice is to get away from meditation&quot;<a
  href="#N_20_"> <sup>(20)</sup></a> .</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even though stylised meditation may not be necessary it is
  necessarily harmful. It could suit the temperament of some people, especially those who
  desire a strict discipline. On the other hand what we have termed Buddhist meditation is
  something that anyone can do with profit. It may not lead to the final goal in itself, but
  it could be a great help in the fulfilment of the other components of the path. <br>

  6</strong> </font></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Buddhist
  Attitude to God</strong> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is first of all necessary to establish what is meant by
  the term &quot;God&quot;. This term is used to designate a Supreme Being endowed with the
  qualities of omnipotence and omniscience, who is the creator of the universe with all its
  contents, and the chief law-giver for humans. God is generally considered as being
  concerned with the welfare of his human creatures, and the ultimate salvation of those who
  follow his dictates. God is therefore a person of some kind, and the question whether such
  an entity exists or not is fundamental to all theistic systems.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In contrast to this notion of a personal God some modern
  theologians have interpreted the term &quot;God&quot; as representing some kind of
  abstract principle of good (or &quot;ground of being&quot;). This view was first developed
  in the ancient Indian <em>Upanishads</em> where God is equated with an abstract principle
  (<em>Brahman</em>). The ancient Indian philosophers could entertain such a view because
  they also had a theory of karma which really does away with the need for a personal God.
  Buddhists too have a theory of karma, which is different from that of the Hindus, and
  which even more unequivocally dispenses with the need for a Deity. The use of the term
  &quot;God' to denote an abstract reality by monotheistic theologians who have no theory of
  karma is difficult to justify; one suspects that this is merely a device to explain away
  the contradictions that arise from the notion of a personal God. In fact the actual
  practice of theistic religion proceeds as if God is a real person of some kind or other. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as Buddhism rejects the notion of a Supreme God it
  also rejects the notion of an abstract God-principle operating in the universe. The notion
  of <em>Brahman</em> (in the neuter) is not discussed at all in the Buddhist texts, and
  even in India it may well be a post-Buddhist development resulting from the attempt to
  reconcile the belief in God(s) with the powerful critique of the Buddha. It is therefore
  the attitude of Buddhism to the notion of a supreme personal God animating the Universe
  that we must consider.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One popular misconception of Buddhism must be dismissed at
  this point. This is view that the Buddha is some kind of God figure. In the Theravada
  tradition the Buddha is regarded as a supremely enlightened human teacher who has come to
  his last birth in samsra (the Buddhist cycle of existence). Even Mahayana traditions which
  tend to think in terms of transcendental Buddhas do not directly make a claim for Buddha
  as God. Thus the Buddha cannot be considered as playing a God-like role in Buddhism.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Buddhist texts Mah� Brahm� is the equivalent of
  God and is represented as claiming the following attributes for himself: &quot;I am
  Brahm�, the Great Brahm�, the Supreme One, the Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the
  Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of all appointing to each his place, the
  Ancient of days, the Father of all that is and will be.&quot; (<em>Dgha Nikya</em>, II,
  263).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha dismisses all these claims of Mah� Brahm� as
  being due to his own delusions brought about by ignorance. Mah�-Brahm� is seen simply a <em>deva</em>
  unenlightened and subject to the samsric process as determined by his kamma (cf the
  Brahmajla and the Agga��a Suttas). In the Khevadda Sutta he is forced to admit to an
  inquiring monk that he is unable to answer a question that is posed to him, and advises
  the monk to consult the Buddha. This clearly shows the Brahm acknowledges the superiority
  of the Buddha.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the West a number of &quot;arguments&quot; have been
  adduced to prove or disprove the existence of God. Some of these were anticipated by the
  Buddha. One of the most popular is the &quot;first cause&quot; argument according to which
  everything must have a cause, and God is considered the first cause of the Universe. The
  Buddhist theory of causation says that every thing must have preconditions for its
  existence, and this law must also extend to &quot;God&quot; should such an entity exist.
  But while the &quot;first cause&quot; claims that God creates everything, it exempts God
  from the ambit of this law. However if exemptions are made with respect to God such
  exemptions could be made with respect to other things also hereby contradicting the
  principle of the first cause.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the argument which the Buddha most frequently uses is
  what is now called the &quot;argument from evil&quot; which in the Buddhist sense could be
  stated as the argument from <em>dukkha</em> (suffering or unsatisfactoriness). This states
  that the empirical fact of the existence of <em>dukkha</em> cannot be reconciled with the
  existence of an omnipotent and omniscient being who is also all good. The following verses
  from the Bh�ridatta Jataka bring this out clearly:</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Buddhist
  Attitude to Man</strong> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In considering the Buddhist view of man we are essentially
  looking at the psychological postulates of Buddhism which has sometimes been described as
  a psychological system. Given the meaning normally attached to Psychology this is too
  narrow a description of psychology. Buddhism deals with many other matters which are not
  normally included in psychology.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But there is a psychological dimension to Buddhism. This
  is because of the great concern which Buddhism has with the mind and with the training of
  the mind. In this sense Buddhism is unique amongst the world religions. The first stanza
  of the well-known book of Buddhist aphorisms the <em>Dhammapada</em> sums up very well the
  primacy that Buddhism gives to the mind:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
<MULTICOL COLS="2" GUTTER="9">
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>monopubbagam� dhamm� manoseh� manomay�</em><br>
    <em>manas� ce paduhena bh�sati v� karoti v�</em> <em>Tato na dukkhamanvet cakka va
    vahato pada</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mind is the forerunner of all states, mind-based and
    mind-made are they</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one speaks or acts with an evil mind</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suffering results, just as the wagon wheel follows the ox
    drawing it</MULTICOL> Similarly good thoughts lead to good actions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most religious systems decompose the individual into a
    body and a soul. In this division the body includes what Buddhists (and modern
    psychologists) would regard as the mind. Very often in this scheme the mind is located in
    the heart. There is no location given for the soul. It is in fact a mysterious entity
    created by God. While the physical body perishes at death the soul goes either to Heaven
    or to Hell where it is reunited with a body (perhaps similar to the old one) and continues
    its existence as one of sensuous conform or of torment depending on the destination. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha dispensed with this scheme which was similar to
    the system advocated in the old Vedas<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a> . Instead the
    Buddha identified five constituents of the empirical person, the first of which (<em>r�pa</em>)
    was physical and the last four (collectively called <em>n�ma</em>) were mind components.
    These five components have been called Groups of existence or Five Aggregates (<em>pa�cakkhand�</em>).
    These are:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. <strong>Corporeality</strong> (<em>r�pa</em>). This is
    the physical basis of existence. The five sense organs (eye, ear, nose, tongue and body)
    are especially important in generating the various signals which are processed by the mind
    (which is also recognised as an organ in is own right).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. <strong>Feeling</strong> (<em>vedan�</em>). Feelings
    are a by-product of the contact between the organs of the physical body and the external
    world. They are classified in various ways - wholesome and unwholesome, gross and subtle,
    painful and pailful, etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. <strong>Perception</strong> (<em>sa���</em>). This
    is how the mind processes the feelings that its sense organs transmit. No two individuals
    have the same perception of the same feelings they may experience.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. <strong>Formations</strong> (<em>sankh�r�</em>). The
    formations are the deliberative acts of the individuals. it is often referred to as karmic
    formations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. <strong>Consciousness</strong> (<em>vi���na</em>).
    This is the condition of being aware of the environment in which the individual exists.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While corporeality is readily understood the other four
    components are more subtle. Three of these, viz. feeling, perception and consciousness,
    are known to modern psychological science, and the Buddhist interpretation does not differ
    substantially from the scientific one. But the concept of &quot;formations&quot; is not
    known to modern psychology. At the same time there is nothing in conventional psychology
    that denies its existence. Here the Buddhist view transcends that of the conventional
    analysis of mental components. <a href="#cont">Go to Contents</a> </font></p>

    8</strong> </font></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Knowledge, Wisdom
    and Enlightenment</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha traced the root cause of suffering to
    ignorance; so the search for enlightenment is the supreme activity for the Buddhist<a
    href="#N_23_"> <sup>(23)</sup></a>. The activity proceeds at both the intellectual and the
    intuitive levels. Pure intellectual understanding is not sufficient, although it is often
    a very good starting point. When enlightenment is attained pure intellectual understanding
    is transcended by an intuitive grasp of the truths of the Universe.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If knowledge is the outcome of &quot;intellectual&quot;
    activity, a person's fund of knowledge at any moment of time is made up of a number of
    beliefs that he considers valid. The Buddha was quite clear on what he considered
    legitimate to believe in. In his discourse to the K�l�mas (a people who were confused by
    the diversity of viewpoints they were confronted with) the Buddha said:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Come, O K�l�mas, do not accept anything from mere
    hearsay, or from what you have been told, or because it is mentioned in sacred teachings,
    or because of logic merely, or because of its methods, or in consideration of plausible
    reasoning, or by tolerating views based on speculation, or because of its appearance of
    its possibility and because `your teacher is venerable'. But when you, K�l�mas, realize
    by yourself that views are unwholesome, faulty, condemned by the wise, and that they lead
    to harm and misery when practised and observed, then K�l�mas, you should reject
    them&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the criterion of acceptability which the Buddha
    wanted to apply to all claims, including his own. In Buddhism there cannot be room for
    blind faith, and all propositions, religious or otherwise should be subjected to analysis
    and practice. The reference to &quot;mere logic&quot; and &quot;plausible reasoning&quot;
    in the quotation given serves as a caution concerning some extreme forms of
    &quot;rationalism&quot; which argue that &quot;pure reason&quot; is sufficient to
    establish the truth of metaphysical propositions (like that of the existence of God).
    Deductive methods are useful, but as they can only bring out what is already contained in
    the premises of the argument, they cannot be used as a vehicle for the discovery of <em>new</em>
    truths. Rightly has the K�l�masutta been termed the Buddhist charter of free enquiry.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a result of the Buddha's rational and tolerant attitude
    early Buddhism never had concepts like heresy, apostasy and blasphemy (and this is true of
    all subsequent Buddhist schools). In many theistic systems imprisonment, torture and death
    have been inflicted on people who have refused to bow before dogma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhist epistemology three levels of understanding are
    recognised. These are (using the Pali terminology): <em>dii</em> (&quot;views&quot;), <em>��na</em>
    (&quot;science&quot;), and <em>bodhi</em> (&quot;wisdom&quot;). <em>Dii</em> refers to
    views accepted more or less dogmatically. Not all such beliefs are necessarily harmful,
    because some people could be motivated to act wholesomely even though motivated by
    incorrect views. But more usually such &quot;views&quot; can be extremely harmful<a
    href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> . The Buddha did not consider knowledge consisting of <em>dii</em>
    to be useful in the longer term. <em>Dii</em> is often contrasted with scientifically
    based knowledge, which results from thinking, from learning and from mental development.
    This is usually terms <em>��na</em> or <em>pa���</em>. The acquisition of this kind
    of knowledge is useful, and is not discouraged; but it alone will not lead to
    enlightenment. This is clearly seen in the case of many eminent scientists, who have
    progressed far in the acquisition of particular kinds of knowledge, but have not been able
    to outgrow the dogmatic views inculcated in early childhood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">P&gt;True enlightenment can arise out of the third kind of
    knowledge, consisting of wisdom (<em>bodhi</em>) and insight (<em>vipassan�</em>). This
    results from the intuitive realisation of the Buddhist laws and truths after the
    successful traverse of the Middle Path. The enlightenment process involves the breaking of
    the ten fetters (<em>sayojan�</em>) that bind people to the phenomenal world. These are
    the five lower fetters of personality belief, sceptical doubt, clinging to rite and
    ritual, sensuous craving and ill-will, and the five higher fetters of craving for
    &quot;fine material&quot; existence, craving for &quot;immaterial existence&quot;,
    conceit, restlessness, and ignorance.<a href="#N_25_"> <sup>(25)</sup></a> <br>

    9</strong> </font></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Doctrines of
    Karma and Rebirth</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist doctrine of kamma [karma] (&quot;deeds&quot;,
    &quot;actions&quot;), and the closely related doctrine of rebirth, are perhaps the best
    known, and often the least understood, of Buddhist doctrines. The matter is complicated by
    the fact that the other Indian religious traditions of Hinduism and Jainism have their own
    theories of Karma and Reincarnation. It is in fact the Hindu versions that are better
    known in the West. The Buddhist theory of <em>kamma</em> (to give the Pali word) and
    rebirth are quite distinct from their other Indian counterparts.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhism the law of kamma is the moral law of causation
    - good actions give good results and vice versa. It is the quality of an act which
    determines its consequences. But what determines the karmic quality of a deed? In Hinduism
    it is the correct performance of a person's &quot;duty&quot;, especially his caste duties
    that counts. Early Buddhism, which recognised no caste distinctions, evaluates the karmic
    quality of an act in terms of moral and ethical criteria. In particular it is the mental
    factors which accompany the commission of deed that determines its consequences or
    &quot;fruits&quot; (<em>vip�ka</em>). All negative kamma (i.e. those leading to bad
    consequences) arise from the three roots of unwholesomeness. These are greed (<em>lobha</em>),
    aversion (<em>dosa</em>), and delusion (<em>moha</em>). Accordingly good kammic results
    follow from deeds that spring from generosity (<em>caga</em>), loving-kindness (<em>mett�</em>)
    and wisdom (<em>vijj�</em>). The Buddha emphasised that it is the mental factors
    involved, rather than the deeds themselves, that determine future consequences. Thus the
    same deed committed with different mental factors will have different consequences.
    Likewise purely accidental deeds <em>may</em> have neutral consequences; however if the
    accident occurred because insufficient mindfulness was exercised it could have adverse
    results for the person responsible for it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The theory of kamma presupposes that individuals have
    &quot;free will&quot;. Everything that happens to an individual is not the fruit of some
    past kamma. In fact the experiences that involve an individual may be of three kinds: some
    are the result of past action, some are deliberately committed free acts; and the
    remainder could be due to chance factors operating in the environment. The doctrine of
    kamma is not a theory of predestination of any kind. One common misunderstanding is not to
    distinguish between the action and its results - between <em>kamma</em> and <em>vip�ka</em>.
    It must also be mentioned that the fruiting of an act may be postponed, and that it is
    possible to reach enlightenment - the goal of the Buddha's path - before all the previous
    kammas have yielded their results.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist theory of rebirth asserts that the fruits of
    some kamma may manifest themselves in &quot;future lives&quot;. This brings us to the
    Buddhist theory of rebirth. Similar concepts occur in other religious systems - e.g. the
    Platonic theory of the &quot;pre-existence of the soul&quot; and the Hindu-Jain theory of
    re-incarnation. Such reincarnation theory involves the transmigration of a soul. In
    Buddhism, however, it is the unripened karmic acts outstanding at the death of an
    individual which conditions a new birth. The last moment of consciousness too is also a
    conditioning factor, but it is the store of unripened kamma generated by volitional acts
    (the <em>sankh�ras</em>) of previous existences which generates the destiny of the new
    individual. A newly born individual needs not only the genetic blueprint derived from the
    genes of the natural parents, but also a kammic blueprint derived from the volitional acts
    of a deceased person.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The question has been posed whether the new individual is
    the same as the old individual whose kamma it has inherited. The Buddha's answer to this
    question was somewhat enigmatic: &quot;It is not the same, yet it is not another&quot; (<em>na
    ca so, na ca a��o</em>). To understand the Buddha's reply we have to investigate the
    criteria which establish personal identity. Is the child the same as the adult it later
    becomes? In the Buddhist sense we are making two observations at two points of time in a
    constantly changing psycho-physical entity. For legal and conventional purposes some
    arbitrary criteria are used, such as physical continuity over time, or the retention of
    memory. These define only a conventional person. Just as it is a conventional or
    &quot;fictional&quot; persons who lasts continuously from birth to death, so it is just
    such a conventional person who persists from one life to another. In the Buddhist view of
    rebirth the only links between two successive lives is the karmic residue carried over and
    an element of consciousness, called the re-linking consciousness: (<em>paisandhi
    vi���na</em>), which momentarily links the two lives. In Buddhism there is no
    conception of a transmigrating soul which inhabits successive material bodies until it
    unites with God.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism uses the Pali term <em>sas�ra</em> to denote the
    &quot;round of births&quot; in various planes of existence governed by the law of kamma.
    The acceptance of the validity of the hypothesis of sas�ra is very difficult for some
    people, while for others it is the most natural of hypotheses. Some features of the
    observable world suggests it. In the Culakammavibhanga Sutta the Buddha is asked:
    &quot;What is the reason and the cause for the inequality amongst human beings despite
    their being human?&quot; (the context making it clear that it is inequality at birth that
    is meant). The Buddha answered: &quot;Beings inherit their kamma, and it is kamma which
    divides beings in terms of their inequality&quot;. The theistic hypothesis cannot give a
    rational answer, except in terms of an iniquitous and unjust &quot;God&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some support for the theory of rebirth comes from reports
    of recollections of past lives, whether spontaneously or under hypnosis, which have been
    reported from all parts of the world. While many such reports may be mistaken or even
    fraudulent, some are undoubtedly genuine. According to Buddhism individuals can develop
    the power of &quot;retrocognition&quot; (i.e. the ability to recall past lives), but the
    development of such supernormal powers is usually the accompaniment of progress along the
    spiritual path of enlightenment. IT may be possible that some karmic factors may
    predispose some individuals towards such experiences. However parapsychological
    experimentation is still in its early stages, and many people have no personal
    recollection of their own previous lives. For such individuals the dogmatic acceptance of
    the doctrines of kamma and rebirth is not expected.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The central tenets of Buddhism relate not to any abstract
    theories about rebirth or karma but to the interpretation of human experience which is
    within the capacity of every person to verify. This verification can be undertaken, not in
    terms of an abstract cycle of lives, but also in terms of the one life we are all familiar
    with. The Buddhist <em>sas�ra</em> is to be seen in every moment of existence, as well as
    the whole &quot;cycle of births&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One would expect that in the K�l�ma Sutta, the discourse
    in which the Buddha decries the acceptance of theories on the basis of authority (which
    was quoted earlier), that he would address himself to the question of belief in the
    doctrine of kamma and rebirth. This he does. Referring to the &quot;four-fold
    confidences&quot; which the &quot;noble person&quot; (<em>�riya puggala</em>), i.e. the
    person who follows the path of the Buddha, attains to, the Buddha states:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; `If there is the other world and if there is the
    fruit and result of good and bad deeds, then there is reason that I shall be reborn into
    the state of bliss, the celestial world, on the dissolution of the body, after death.'
    This is the first confidence that he attains.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; `If, however, there is no other world and if there
    is no fruit and no result of good and bad deeds, then I shall myself lead he a happy life,
    free from enmity, malice and suffering in this very life'. This is the second confidence
    that he attains.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus even the extreme rationalist who would suspend
    judgement on the truth of the sas�ric hypothesis (i.e. the doctrines of karma and
    rebirth) would find that the Buddha-Dhamma would not have lost its rationale. He can
    aspire to the second confidence of the &quot;noble person&quot; and make the one life that
    he is sure of, a happy one.<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a> <br>

    10</strong> </font></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Buddhist Cosmology
    and Nibb�na</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist scriptures contain a cosmology of the
    Universe which provide an interesting contrast to the cosmologies of other religions (e.g.
    that of the Bible) and even the modern scientific cosmology (on which there is no complete
    agreement). The cosmological claims in the Buddhist scriptures should not be seen as an
    accurate description of the physical universe, but as establishing the stage on which the
    great sas�ric drama is enacted. While considering this cosmology we may also consider the
    important concept of <em>Nibb�na</em> which is the state of final release. The latter
    term is better known in its Sanskrit version as &quot;Nirvana&quot;. We shall use the Pali
    term because the concept of Nirvana is also used in other Indian religions notably
    Jainism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We may first consider the planes of existence which form
    the arenas for samsaric existence. The number of planes recognised depends on the fineness
    with which they are classified. In the earlier more succinct listing only 3 states of
    existence are mentioned. These are:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. <strong>The sensuous realm</strong> (<em>k�ma l�ka</em>).
    This is the physical world as accessible to be person who entirely on the physical
    stimuli, without subjecting these stimuli to a refined degree of conscious mental
    processing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. <strong>The fine-material realm</strong> (rpa l�ka).
    This is the same physical world as it is perceived by the active meditator. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. <strong>The immaterial world</strong> (�rpa l�ka). Is
    the physical world as it is apprehended by the advanced meditator who realises the
    &quot;emptiness&quot; of the phenomena that assail the senses of the ordinary person.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last two realms of existence are meditative stages. In
    the Buddhist literature there are other ways of classifying meditative states, including
    some such as those that are induced by <em>vipassan�</em> (insight) meditation which
    differ is some details from the <em>�rpa-l�ka</em>, but we need not be concerned here;
    they are dealt with fully in manuals dealing with Buddhist meditation. The two
    contemplative states of existence are subjective and would not fall into what is
    considered by cosmology in the modern scientific sense. Some consider the realm of <em>Nibb�na</em>
    as also falling into the &quot;meditative states&quot;, but this is regarded as something
    completely outside all planes of existence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first realm, the <em>k�ma-l�ka</em>, clearly deals
    with actual realms of existence, which is the only realm for those not subject to some
    degree of enlightenment, and even in the case of the latter still provides the physical
    dimension of existence. It is this realm that could be compared to other cosmologies,
    whether held by scientists or religionists or ordinary people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A word may be said about the Buddhist views on the
    phenomenal worlds which constitute the arenas of sas�ric existence, and of the concept of
    nibb�na [Nirv�na] (the state of final release) which is the antithesis of sas�ra. These
    views contained in early Buddhist writings should not be looked upon as dogmas whose
    acceptance is expected of Buddhists. Many of them are beyond the capacity of unenlightened
    people to verify. Some of them are burrowed from the prevailing cosmological views in the
    India of the Buddha's time, and would have been used by the Buddha as illustrations to
    clarify his own theories.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Pali literature five &quot;planes of
    existence&quot; characterised in varying degrees of unsatisfactoriness are recognised.
    These are (in increasing order of &quot;suffering&quot;): (1) the sphere of the plane of
    the <em>devas</em> (&quot;shining beings&quot; often translated as &quot;gods&quot;); (2)
    humans; (3) The spirit world; (4) the animal world; (5) the lower world (duggati, niraya)
    often translated as &quot;hells&quot;. According to the law of kamma beings could be born
    into any of these planes of existence, but the sojourn in any of these destinations is
    never permanent. There is no necessary &quot;progression&quot; from the lower to the
    higher levels. The cycle of rebirth in these various states of existence could be
    terminated only on the achievement of nibb�na (which itself is not included in the
    sas�ric planes). Nibb�na, the final liberation, can only be achieved by beings in the
    first two planes of existence, but more usually only by humans.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In some of the earliest strata in the Pali Canon only
    three spheres of existence are recognised. These are: (1) the sensuous world (<em>k�ma
    loka</em>); (2) the fine material world (<em>r�pa loka</em>); and (3) the immaterial
    world (<em>�r�pa loka</em>). Here the &quot;sensuous world&quot; comprise all the realms
    of physical existence, and the other two correspond to states of meditation. In the later
    literature (especially in the Abhidhamma), the &quot;planes of existence&quot; are further
    subdivided, and some 32 planes of existence are recognised. There are three ways of
    interpreting these &quot;planes of existence&quot;:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) They could be actual physical locations somewhere in
    the physical universe.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) They could be forms of psycho-physical existence which
    could be reached from any given physical location depending on mental disciplines
    exercised.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) Some states belong to the first type, and others to
    the second type.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The earliest interpretation leans towards the second given
    above<a href="#N_27_"> <sup>(27)</sup></a>, but the 32-fold classification favoured by
    many modern exponents of Buddhism leans towards the third, which of course implies that
    some states must correspond to the first. This raises the question of Buddhist cosmology
    on which something needs to be said.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In terms of physical location the planes of existence
    could be located anywhere in the Universe. That the Buddhist view of the physical world is
    not much different from that of modern science is brought out clearly in this quotation:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;As far as these suns and moons revolve shedding
    their light in space, so far extends the thousand-fold universe. In it there are thousands
    of suns, thousands of moons, thousands of inhabited worlds of varying sorts. ... This is
    the thousand-fold minor world system (<em>culanika lokadh�tu</em>). Thousands of times
    the size of the thousand-fold minor world system is the twice-a-thousand Middling World
    System (<em>Majjima lokadh�tu</em>). Thousands of times the size of the Middling World
    System is the thrice-a-thousand Great Cosmos (<em>mah� lokadh�tu</em>).&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With such a multiplicity of inhabited worlds it is
    possible to interpret the planes of existence in realistic terms. But the interpretation
    in terms of psychological and meditation states may be the more appropriate. Heavens and
    hells are not specific locations with pleasant or unpleasant experiences, but they could
    be experienced even in the human earthly form.<a href="#N_28_"> <sup>(28)</sup></a></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The claim that &quot;devas&quot; exist should not be taken
    as a concession to theism. Even though this term is commonly translated as
    &quot;gods&quot; it does not imply the existence of divine authority. The devas are a
    category of beings, subject to their own kammas formations and reverting to human or other
    form after the expiry of their kammas, and quite incapable of granting concessionary
    prayers addressed to them. In the Buddhist scheme all of the leading deities of the Hindu
    pantheon, including Mah� Brahm�, the &quot;creator&quot; of the universe in the Hindu
    scheme, are reduced to the status of devas with only a transient existence in the
    deva-sphere. This treatment of the powerful Gods of the Brahmanical system, to whom the
    sacrifices and prayers of the system were directed, instead of being a support of theism
    was a powerful critique of this system.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As against the varied planes of sas�ric existence the
    Buddha postulated the existence of a state called nibb�na [nirv�na] which serves as the <em>summum
    bnonum </em>of Buddhism. This, the most difficult of Buddhist concepts, cannot really be
    grasped unless some considerable progress has been made on the Buddhist path. It is
    usually described in negative terms. It is the &quot;Unborn, Unoriginated, Uncreated,
    Unformed&quot;; it is the complete annihilation of all defilement; it is the complete
    destruction of the five components of beings; it is a situation where no kammas are being
    formed or previous kammas fruited; it is the extinction of the three roots of unwholesome
    action (greed, aversion and delusion); it is the end of rebirth itself. Two misconceptions
    of nirv�na may be mentioned - one, entertained by the materialist, is that it implies
    nothingness; the other, entertained by the theist, is that it involves merger with a
    higher entity. The Buddha answered both questions &quot;Does the arahant exist after
    death?&quot; and &quot;Does the arahant not exist after death?&quot; (where an arahant is
    a person who had attained to the status of Nibb�na) in the negative. It is only the
    limitation of our conceptualisation process that leads us to pose such questions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes a distinction is made between &quot;sas�ric
    Buddhism&quot; and &quot;nibb�nic Buddhism&quot;<a href="#N_30_"> <sup>(30)</sup></a> .
    It is claimed that in the former the aim is improvement in sas�ra, while in the latter it
    is the attainment of nibb�na. It is also claimed that the former should be the aim of the
    lay Buddhist and the latter that of the Buddhist monk. However even in the Buddha's day
    many monks did not attain nibb�na, while there was never advanced the claim that a lay
    person could not attain to the nibb�nic state. The true position is that each person
    should proceed along the Buddhist path according to his own capacities and priorities. The
    lay person is neither at a disadvantage nor at an advantage relative to the monk (Bhikkhu)
    when it comes to the question of progress along the path. The lay Buddhist and the
    Bhikkhu, because of their differing life styles, will apply the Dhamma to different areas.
    In particular the lay person can engage in activity aimed at the social and economic
    upliftment of suffering humanity to a greater extent than the Bhikkhu, while the latter
    will concentrate more on personal advancement through the development of meditation and
    the keeping of the strict moral code expected of the Bhikkhu Sangha. <br>

    11</strong> </font></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Buddhism and the
    Modern World</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha delivered the fundamental principles of Dhamma
    some 2500 years ago. Initially it spread over most of Asia in some form or other, but
    since then it has been declining until it now has much less adherents than the other main
    religions<a href="#N_31_"> <sup>(31)</sup></a> . There has also been many changes in
    several other areas and it might to appropriate to consider the Buddhist position with
    regard to some of them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Dhamma and Theistic Religion</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Theism essentially means the service of an unseen God.
    Since this God never addresses individuals directly, but through &quot;prophets&quot;
    there has never been a shortage of the latter. And when the rival prophets make
    irreconcilable and conflicting claims, and impose mutually inconsistent rites, rituals,
    and codes of behaviour on their followers, it is not difficult to see in these a potent
    cause of conflict. Indeed a large part of the violence and crimes we see in history has
    been caused by the attempt of the followers of one &quot;prophet of God&quot; to impose
    dominion over those of another.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the modern world the bulk of the people owe formal
    allegiance to Christianity and Islam, religions which arose long after the death of the
    Buddha. They are offshoots of another religion Judaism which has remained confined to a
    small ethnic group. All three religions affirm the existence of an all-powerful creator
    God . The Buddha had long ago repudiated the notion of a supreme creator God. The Buddhist
    views of the subject of God has already been dealt with in an earlier chapter. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Both Christianity and Islam have been fundamentally
    intolerant religions dedicated to the goal of converting others, and persecuting those of
    different faiths. In the last century or so Christianity has been forced to give up some
    of its traditional methods of persecution, but it has not abandoned its evangelical zeal.
    Islam continues very much in the way it has even though conquest by the sword is becoming
    less easy. As a result of these attitudes Buddhism has not been able to penetrate into
    those countries where Christianity and Islam have established themselves historically.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists should seek to spread its message of religious
    tolerance and the peaceful dialogue between religions. Whether it will succeed in this has
    still to be seen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Dhamma and Materialism</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The great development in the last century has been the
    rise of materialism. Quite apart from philosophical system that have extolled materialism
    there has also been a growth of materialist objectives in many people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Philosophical materialism may not be very detrimental to
    Buddhism because much of the argument which materialists have directed at religion have
    been against theistic religion. However political movements which have formally proclaimed
    materialism as their creed have acted against religions, and Buddhism has suffered perhaps
    relatively more from such movements. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is unsatisfactory if philosophical materialism is
    that it often denies the existence of absolute, objective moral standards. Buddhism of
    course insists on the existence of such a moral code. The failure of materialism is been
    mainly due to its lack of a universal norm of goodness, truth and justice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The increase in the materialist motivation of people has
    been seen even in people who would consider themselves as being religious. Where this
    leads to an increase in greed it would reduce the ability of these people to practice
    Buddhist values. However Buddhism is not against the growth of material affluence provided
    that it results from the pursuit of right livelihood. But much of the pressures that
    result from the scamble to reach the top of the economic pile often lead to an abandonment
    of the principles of right livelihood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The growing conflicts of the modern world arise from a
    continuous proliferation of greed and craving. The ethical systems of both the leading
    forms of theism and materialism encourage and endorse this tendency by giving a license to
    humans to prevail over other forms of life, and encouraging the &quot;prudent&quot; and
    ceaseless accumulation of material wealth as an individual and social blessing. While such
    ethical systems may have given a measure of material affluence to their followers, this
    material gain has been at the cost of seriously heightening conflict within these
    societies as well as in the world at large, even endangering the very future of mankind
    itself. The Buddhist ethic, which involves the pursuit of a middle policy, by dampening
    the acquisitive instinct, could offer mankind with a viable and more appropriate
    alternative.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Dhamma and Science</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhamma is closely related to what is understood by
    Science or Philosophy. Science investigates the nature of phenomena, and some of the
    latest discoveries in the areas of the physical and the psychological sciences are in
    conformity with Buddhist principles. However Science has a self-imposed limitation - it
    has no procedure to move from the positive to the normative. The Dhamma can make this
    transition, and thus has the ability to transcend Science. It is also in this sense that
    the Dhamma can be considered a Philosophy. However a substantial part of philosophy in the
    west since the time of Aristotle has been concerned with metaphysical speculation. The
    Buddha however looked on most such metaphysical speculations as being baseless and
    unprofitable, and very often a cloak for ignorance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">An outstanding feature of the modern world has been the
    triumph of science and the explosion of knowledge. These have posed a serious challenge to
    theistic religion. Many of the dogmas that lie at the basis of revelatory religions have
    been exploded by scientific developments. While one section of theists have been busy in
    reinterpreting the old dogmas in &quot;metaphysical&quot; terms (a hopeless task as it has
    proven to be), and other group of &quot;fundamentalists&quot; have turned their backs on
    scientific discovery and by boldly using modern methods of propaganda and psychological
    conditioning have tried to reassert the old dogmas in all their simplicity. These
    developments have raised the real possibility of a return to the &quot;dark ages&quot;.
    Materialism seems to have been better in coping with scientific discovery, but has been
    totally helpless in evaluating correctly the uses to which such discovery has to be put.
    Buddhism on the other hand has been able to reconcile scientific discovery with its basic
    laws, and the path of practice that Buddhism proclaims has provided a norm for the optimal
    use of man's ever increasing knowledge. For the Buddhist there is no conflict between the
    claims of science and religion (as there is for the theist), nor a quandary as to how
    knowledge could be applied for the betterment of man (as it is for both the materialist
    and the theist).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Buddhism and Humanism</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The primary appeal of Buddhism was to the dignity of man,
    not the glory of God. In this sense the Dhamma is primarily a humanistic philosophy. In
    describing Buddhism as a humanism some care must be taken in defining the latter term.
    Theists have defined humanism broadly as embracing &quot;any attitude exalting man's
    relationship to God, his free will, and his superiority over nature&quot;. Such
    definitions leave out an essential quality of humanism, viz. the primacy of man and the
    inconsequence of God. There is no implication in Buddhism that human beings have some
    prior claim over other forms of living beings, or for that matter over &quot;nature&quot;,
    as is implied in the definition of humanism quoted. Buddhists however hold that of all
    forms of existence possible, the human form is the one most conducive to deliverance.
    These aspects of Buddhist humanism make the Dhamma once again unique.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another aspect of Buddhist humanism is that it makes an
    individual the master of his own destiny. On his death-bed when asked by his followers as
    to whom they should follow when he was gone, the Buddha replied: &quot;Be ye a lamp (<em>d�pa</em>)
    unto yourselves; work out your own salvation with diligence&quot;. The Pali word <em>d�pa</em>
    also means an island, and the Buddha's final exhortation could also be rendered as
    &quot;Be ye an island unto yourselves...&quot; etc. In either case the fundamental idea is
    that of self-reliance rather than reliance on an external agency. The Dhamma, as could be
    reconstructed from the Pali Canon remains the source of the Buddha-word. The follower of
    the Buddha would need to understand this, if need be with the help of a teacher but be
    alone has to practice it. In this respect it may be mentioned that the Mah�y�na Schools
    of Buddhism have introduced the notion of salvation by the grace of beings called
    &quot;Bodhisattvas&quot;, i.e. beings who have achieved enlightenment but postponed their
    entry into Nirv�na in order to help others to get there through their grace. This notion
    is foreign to early Buddhism or to present-day Theravada Buddhism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Relevance of Buddhism</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the modern world Buddhism has to contend with two broad
    alternatives to itself. These are theism and materialism. Paradoxically the Buddha had to
    contend with the very same ideologies in his own day. And now as then Buddhism offers the
    better alternative for the realisation of the greater happiness of all beings inhabiting
    the world (and not just humans alone).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The relevance of Buddhism for the contemporary era would
    depend on its ability to meet the challenges posed by the contemporary world better than
    the rival ideologies of theism and materialism and very often a combination of the two.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The unbridled exploitation of the earth's resources,
    almost amounting to a rape of these resources, has been another example of this greed.
    Buddhism teaches that man should live in harmony with the Universe. We have seen the
    extinction of many species of birds, animals and fish, and the threat of extermination of
    many more, because of the dominance of theistic and materialistic ethics, which have
    consistently refused to conceded the &quot;right to life&quot; to non-human forms of
    existence. It is only a step from this position to the exploitation of natural resources
    to the extent that eco-systems have been destroyed beyond repair, and has put into
    question the long-term possibility of survival.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The lack of tolerance of diverging viewpoints has been one
    of the most potent causes of misery and war. Even though we would like to think that the
    worst excesses of sectarian conflict are behind us, we have no real ground to such
    optimism. The world meeds a measure of Buddhist tolerance. It has been said that the
    flavour of the Dhamma is the flavour of freedom (vimutti). The freedom that is meant here
    is primarily the freedom of the mind unburdened by crippling dogma (be they of ego or of
    God); but such mental freedom is the basis of all other freedom, even those of the more
    &quot;worldly&quot; kind, like political, social or economic freedom. In a world where
    freedom is constrained in many ways the liberating effect of the Dhamma is sorely needed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">True freedom cannot be attained until the mind is set
    free. The Dhamma actually provides a therapy for the freeing of the mind from mental
    defilement. Modern society seems to have aggravated rather than lessened the need for
    mental purification and calm. The pace of change has quickened, and external pressure on
    individuals increased. A balanced mind, created by a true understanding of the world and
    man's place in it, coupled with the practice of the Buddha's path, could serve as a
    radical new therapy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The importance of the Buddhist principle that a person
    should be free to believe according to one's freely formed and informed opinions, can
    hardly be overstated. The current practice of indoctrinating children with the religious
    views of their parents is one that comes to mind. Many religious organisations carry this
    process into formal schooling, and reinforce it later by using the latest technology of
    the information revolution. It then becomes a veritable &quot;brain-washing&quot; no less
    insidious because it has the full approval of the establishment. The right of a child to
    have its mind free of religious indoctrination until it can made a decision on this vital
    matter in full maturity with all the information at its command, is a right that is rarely
    mentioned, but one in which Buddhists can take a lead.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Basic Buddhism is relevant for the problems of modern
    society in several other ways. But it must be remembered that the traditional practices of
    Buddhism in several of its schools, including to some extent in the Therav�da tradition,
    departs considerably from the principles enunciated by the Buddha. Here too what is needed
    is a return to the principles and practice of basic Buddhism. </font></p>

    the Threefold Refuge (tisarana gamana) <a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a></em> This

    could be a self-administered declaration. The person making this choice should have a
    clear understanding of what the Dhamma of the Buddha is. This booklet is meant to provide
    such an understanding.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists repeat this formula periodically, as occasion
    permits, in order to re-dedicate themselves to the Buddhist goal.<a name="appb"></a></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Appendix B: The
    Five Precepts</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Going for Refuge formula is very often followed by the
    formula of <em>Taking of the Five Precepts (pa�ca s�la)</em>. These precepts constitute
    the basic ethical norms Buddhists hope to follow, i.e. forms the layman's code of conduct.
    They define the ethical rules which a lay Buddhist must follow in daily life. They are not
    commandments but &quot;rules of training&quot; (<em>sikkh�pada</em>). It is customary to
    formally state these rules either daily or on formal occasions but it is not the
    recitation of the rules that matter but their observance. In many Buddhist countries the
    precepts are &quot;administered&quot; formally by monks, but this is not necessary.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the following we give the precept in Pali, its
    approximate translation, and a few explanatory comments:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>1. <em>Non-Destruction of life</em></strong>. <em>p�n�tip�th�
    veraman� sikkh� pada sam�diy�mi</em> (I agree to follow the precept of abstaining from
    the taking of life). This involves not contributing to the death of any living being. This
    means not only the actual killing but also &quot;causing to kill&quot;. However this rule
    does not require one to be a vegetarian, only that meat consumed should not have been
    &quot;specially killed&quot; for direct, personal consumption. Meat purchased in the
    market does not come under the &quot;specially killed&quot; category.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>2. <em>Abstention from Theft</em>.</strong> <em>adinn�d�n�
    veraman� sikkh� pada sam�diy�mi</em> (I agree to follow the precept of not taking that
    which is not given). Theft is interpreted widely as taking that which is not given. It
    includes fraudulent behaviour generally.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>3. <em>Avoidance of Sexual Misconduct</em>.</strong>
    <em>k�mesu micc�c�r� veraman� sikkh� pada sam�diy�mi</em> (I agree to follow the
    precept of abstaining from sexual wrongdoing). Misconduct here means not only overt acts
    of sexual violence like rape, but also adultery in general. It must be remembered that
    Buddhism does not endorse any particular kind of marriage, so this precept requires that
    sexual relations should be confined to what is socially and legally acceptable as a
    marriage relationship. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>4. <em>Abstention from Wrong Speech</em></strong>.
    <em>mus�v�d� veraman� sikkh� pada sam�diy�mi</em> (I agree to follow the precept of
    abstaining from wrong speech). Wrong speech involves a great many things apart from
    uttering falsehoods. It includes insulting speech, malicious speech, even gossip.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>5. <em>Refraining from Intoxicants.</strong>
    sur�meraya majja pam� dah�n� veraman� sikkh� pada sam�diy�mi</em> (I agree to
    follow the precept of abstaining from the liquor and spirits that cause inattention). This
    is generally taken to mean avoiding alcohol, drugs, etc. which tend to &quot;confuse the
    mind&quot;. Some people interpret this precept not as an absolute prohibition of alcohol
    (as in Islam) but only against intoxication and inebriation through the use of alcohol or
    drugs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While the five precepts are usually stated in negative
    terms they have their positive counterparts (e.g. the principles of non-injury and
    loving-kindness, honesty, sexual propriety, truthfulness and sobriety. <a name="appc"></a></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Appendix C: Higher
    Precepts and Meditation</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some Buddhists observe the Eight Precepts once a month
    (usually on the Full Moon Day, which has traditionally been a day of religious observance
    amongst Buddhists). The three additional precepts are: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. Abstaining from eating after mid-day</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. Abstaining from dancing, singing, music and shows</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. Abstaining from garlands, scents, cosmetics and
    adornment</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It will be seen that these three additional precepts do
    not involve weighty moral principles like the 5 basic precepts. They are of use for those
    who are desire some degree of withdrawal from lay life but are not prepared to make a
    full-time commitment. A further step in this direction is to take two additional precepts
    making 10 in all, which are often taken for a longer time than the once-a-month practice
    of the eight precepts. These two additional precepts are:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">9. Abstaining from luxurious beds</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">10. Abstaining from accepting gold and silver</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third precept is also expanded to a rule enjoining
    chastity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The extreme step along this line of renunciation is to
    become a Buddhist monk (which involves following some 220 rules). This will suit only a
    very few persons in any given Buddhist community. Since monks live on the charity of lay
    Buddhists only a very small proportion of Buddhists can be monks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For lay Buddhists the keeping of the five basic moral
    precepts of Buddhism, is quite adequate. It must however be kept in mind that keeping
    these precepts in their totality is quite demanding, but it is a goal that lay Buddhists
    should aspire to.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists should also seek to engage in short periods of
    meditation as a regular activity (e.g. 15 - 30 minutes every day). Chapter V has given
    some information about the types of Therav�da meditation that are available in the West.<a
    name="appd"></a></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Appendix D: The
    Three Gems of Buddhism</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The formula for Going for Refuge involves the recognition
    of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha as the three highest entities in Buddhism often
    referred to as the Three Gems (<em>tiratana</em>) of Buddhism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Salutation to the three gems could be turned into a
    formula for meditation. Many Buddhists perform this meditation, either in their own home,
    or in visits to Buddhist temples and monasteries. Three standard stanzas is often used in
    this meditation. These stanzas enumerate the qualities of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
    Sangha. The stanzas are given below, both in Pali and in English. (It must be remembered
    that the English translation is only approximate and each term could be discussed at
    length).<a name="appe"></a></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Appendix E: Main
    Buddhist Tendencies in the West</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the West there are several modes of Buddhism. The main
    distinction is still between Pali Buddhism and the Mahayana. This booklet is written from
    the Pali Buddhist perspective which is closest to Basic Buddhism. But it is always
    advisable to study other Buddhist tendencies which may contain useful insights.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even amongst those drawing inspiration from the Pali
    sources there are several practical orientations, three main orientations may be
    identified: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>1. Ethnic Buddhism.</strong> This is practised by
    migrants from Asian countries. There is a heavy admixture of cultural practices associated
    with Buddhism in the native countries and these are imported along with the Dhamma. This
    stream of Buddhism gives great emphasis to faith, worship, rite and ritual. This is seen
    in such practices as the <em>Buddha-puj�s</em> (ritual offering of food and other things
    before statues of the Buddha), worship of relics, chanting of suttas as magic
    incantations, transference of merit to deceased persons, etc. Such Buddhism is usually
    practised in Temples set up according to Asian cultural archetypes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>2. Meditational Buddhism.</strong> This is the
    kind of meditation that we have called stylised meditation in Chapter 5. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>3. Rationalist-Humanist Buddhism.</strong> Here
    the Buddha's message is seen as being in conformity with the scientific-humanistic spirit
    of the West. This sprit had a long struggle to liberate itself from the anti-scientific
    attitude of Christianity and its subordination of man to God. Until Buddhism arrived in
    the West there was no framework within which these Western tendencies could be
    rationalised. An important focus of this kind of Buddhism is its secularism and ethical
    orientation. Monks are seen as Buddhist professionals who could devote their time to the
    intellectual and moral uplift of people and to advance Buddhist thinking into new areas
    not considered traditionally. But lay persons can play an equally (or even more) active
    role. This kind of Buddhism is usually practised in secular Buddhist Societies in the West
    and dispenses with the need for temples and ritual.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of these three tendencies Basic Buddhism is most at home
    with the last mentioned, i.e. the ethico-rationalist-humanist tendency. But the essence of
    Buddhism is that it is a middle path, not advocating unthinking adherence to any
    particular extreme. While Basic Buddhism in the West should emphasis the ethical,
    scientific, and humanistic aspects it should not neglect anything that is good and useful
    in other tendencies. It is for the individual groups to strike the right balance keeping
    in mind that the essence of Buddhism is the search for enlightenment and with it the
    elimination of the roots of unwholesome action.<a name="appf"></a></font></p>

    Pronounciation</strong></font>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vowels and consonants are pronouned as in English with the
    following exceptions. The vowel u is like `oo' in look. Long vowels are �, � and �; e
    is intermediate; the other vowels are short. Consonants and are dentals (tongue touching
    the teeth); d and t are palatals (tongue touching palate). is nasalised and � is
    pronounced as in Spanish. c is like `ch' in child. h after a constant aspirates that
    consonant.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_1_">1. </a>The earliest Indian Buddhist texts
    were maintained in the Pali language, and these now constitute the authoritative texts of
    the Theravada school of Buddhism. Subsequently Buddhist texts were composed in the
    Sanskrit language, these being favoured by the non-Theravada schools of Buddhism. Most
    Buddhist terms thus have a Pali and a Sanskrit form. In this work the Pali form will be
    used unless the Sanskrit form is better known. A glossary of the principal Pali terms used
    is given in Appendix F. The Sanskrit term <em>dharma</em> is also used to denote Hindu and
    Jain scriptures. The Pali term <em>dhamma</em> is used only in Theravada Buddhist
    teachings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_2_">2. </a>Note that &quot;scientific
    view&quot; does not necessarily mean the view of people generally considered to be
    scientists. There is a tendency now current for certain scientists to propagate
    metaphysical views which are contrary to the methodology of classical science. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_3_">3. </a>No Buddhist has been killed,
    tortured, or imprisoned by another on account of his interpretation of Buddhism. This
    tolerance has been extended to other religions and philosophical system as well. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_4_">4. </a>The Common Era is the era now in
    general use. Dates before its commencement will be referred to as B.C.E. (Before the
    Common Era. The terms B.C. (Before Christ) and A.D. (Anno Domini) are specific to
    Christianity and should not be used to refer to historical dates generally. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_5_">5. </a>The Hinay�na term is now used only
    by some unrepentant Mahayanists and by some Buddhist scholars who want to refer to the
    early schools. There were many non-Mahayana schools (such as Sarv�stiv�da,
    Dharmaguptikas, etc) in the early centuries of the Buddhist era. Their scriptures were
    composed in the Sanskrit language and are now lost in their original form. Some of these
    were translated into Chinese and Tibetan and some of it is still available. But these
    schools are distinctly later than the Therav�da school. In fact they dissented in some
    areas from the Therav�da position and composed their scriptures in Sanskrit translating
    the parts of the Pali Canon they agreed with and introducing their own innovations. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_6_">6. </a>This is because some Theravadins
    regard not only the Pali Canon as authoritative but also later works composed in the Pali
    Language like the Commentaries and work of the great medieval scholar Buddhaghosa. We
    shall use the term Pali Buddhism to refer to the Buddhism contained in the Pali Canon. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_7_">7. </a>The classic Mahay�na text extolling
    the position of the layman vis-a-vis the Bhikkhu is the Vimalakirthinirdesha Sutra. Here a
    layman Vimalakirthi is seen as expounding the Dhamma even to S�riputta the famous arahant
    who in Therav�da is considered a foremost exponent of the doctrine. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_8_">8. </a>There is considerable debate on the
    actual dates of the Buddha. It is generally accepted that the Buddha's death occurred some
    180 years before the coronation of King Asoka. The traditional dates, based on the Sri
    Lankan chronicles dates Asoka's coronation at 363 BCE and therefore the Buddha's death at
    543 BCE, which is 60 years earlier than the date given in the text. However modern
    historians place the coronation at 303 BCE, and the dates given in the text are based on
    this. There are some Western scholars that puts the dates about a century later. However
    the evidence for this is not convincing, and we shall use the dates given in the text as
    the approximate dates of the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_9_">9. </a>The other cities where the Buddha is
    recorded to have spent the rains retreat include Ves�li, Kosamb�, P�rileyya, N�l�,
    Vera�ja, Kapitalvatthu, and Al�vi. He also spent rains retreats in mountainous areas
    such as C�lika and Mankula. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_10_">10. </a>Some early writers, mainly
    Christian, have cast doubt on the historicity of the Buddha. They were no doubt trying to
    extend to the Buddha the doubts that have been raised about the historicity of Jesus. It
    is well-known that contemporary records are silent about Jesus, and some references have
    been shown to be later forgeries. But while we have only details of a only a couple of
    years of the life of Jesus there is much fuller information on the career of the Buddha.
    While it may be possible to manufacture what would have occurred on a couple of years of a
    person's life it is more difficult to do so where an extended period of time is involved. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_11_">11. </a>Most other religious teachers
    (including Jesus and Mohammad) gave teachings which were substantially similar to what
    others had given, validating them by claiming that they had a special relationship with
    God. The charge that the Buddha merely reformed the Vedic religion of his day cannot be
    maintained because of the fundamental differences with the Vedic religion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_12_">12. </a>The three gems or jewels are the
    Buddha (the discoverer), the Doctrine (the content of the discovery) and the Sangha (the
    community of followers). A formal affirmation of &quot;going for refuge&quot; is generally
    taken as a formal mark of adherence to Buddhism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_13_">13. </a>The so-called &quot;proof&quot; of
    the existence of God based on the first cause runs as follows: everything must have a
    cause, therefore there must be a cause for the origin of the world, and this cause is God.
    However if everything must have a cause then God also must have a cause. The question
    immediately arises: Who created God? Naturally theists are incapable of answering this
    question; in effect they abandon their own premise that &quot;everything&quot; must have a
    cause. This is not the case with the Buddhist theory or causation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_14_">14. </a>These are usually detailed in the
    &quot;precepts&quot; of Buddhism. See the Appendix B for the layman's code of ethics. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_15_">15. </a>The term <em>jh�na</em> is often
    translated as &quot;trance&quot;, and might indicate some kind of hypnotic state. While
    accomplished meditators may be able to reach such psychic stages they are neither
    necessary nor sufficient to reach enlightenment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_16_">16. </a>Our comments will be confined to
    meditation related to the Pali Buddhism. In Mahayana too some schools have laid a great
    deal of emphasis on it. The best known of these are Zen and Tibetan Buddhism. We shall not
    be considering these forms of Mahayana meditation here. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_17_">17. </a>Alternative terms that could be
    used are &quot;ritualised meditation&quot; and even &quot;meditationism&quot;. None of
    these is suitable, including the one used in the text. But at the same time there is a
    need to distinguish this practice from what we shall refer to as Buddhist meditation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_18_">18. </a>Amongst contemporary teachers of
    these Asian meditation traditions in the West we may mention, for the Sri Lankan
    tradition, Bhante Henepola Gunaratana in America; for the Burmese tradition Goenka who has
    established centres in many countries; and for the Thai tradition the pupils of Ajahn Chah
    and others who established centres in the U.K. (Chithurst, Amarawati) and later in other
    countries. Of all these the present writer considers Bhante Gunaratana to be the most
    suited to a Western audience. He has written an excellent monograph on his technique <em>Mindfulness
    in Daily Practice.</em> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_19_">19. </a>The &quot;exclusive
    meditation&quot; school of Therav�da belongs to the so-called &quot;forest
    tradition&quot;. This may suit the temperament of a small number of recluses, but it is
    not the normal way to practice the Dhamma which could be adequately done by lay persons
    living ordinary lives in the real world. The personal example of the Buddha is very
    relevant here; he was no mere forest recluse but lived and taught in the great urban
    environments of his day. The real author of the forest tradition with its associated
    austerities (<em>dhut�ngas</em>) was Devadatta, the Buddha's schismatic cousin, whose
    views were rejected by the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_20_">20. </a>See his work <em>What the Buddha
    Really Taught</em>. Maurice was a westerner who developed a profound understanding of
    Buddhism, and the work mentioned here is a very good resume of Buddhism for Westerners
    (and indeed others). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_21_">21. </a>The stock answer to this is that
    man's &quot;free will&quot; leads him to disobey God and bring down disaster. But if man
    is complete creature of God then the grant of free will too is the responsibility of God,
    as his &quot;omniscience&quot; would have told him that free-will would be abused. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_22_">22. </a>The Hindu notion of the soul going
    through several incarnations inhabiting different kinds of bodies until it finally reaches
    Moksha is actually a later development in Hinduism and is not seen in the early Vedic
    texts. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_23_">23. </a>In Buddhism we can distinguish two
    meanings of the term &quot;enlightenment&quot;. The lower one is replacing ignorance (in
    the more prosaic sense) with knowledge. The higher one is the supreme enlightenment
    associated with the realisation of <em>nibb�na</em> through the extinction of craving and
    other roots of unwholesome action. It is possible to be enlightened in the second sense
    without being enlightened in the first sense. A supreme Buddha (<em>samm�-sambuddha</em>)
    of course is enlightened in both senses of the term. In this section the word is used
    sometimes in the one and sometimes in the other sense. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_24_">24. </a>Harmful views are called <em>micc�-dii</em>
    (&quot;wrong view&quot;) in contrast to which the correct Dhamma view is called <em>samm�-dii</em>
    (&quot;right view&quot;). In the modern world the fundamentals of the mono-theistic
    religions, as well as extreme forms of materialism would fall into the wrong category. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_25_">25. </a>The enlightenment resulting from
    the elimination of the fetters is the enlightenment in the higher sense identified in the
    previous note. The Pali terms for the 10 fetters and a brief description of them are as
    follows: (1) <em>sakk�ya-dii</em>, elimination of the ego-belief and realisation of the
    third law of <em>anatta</em>; (2) <em>vicikicc�</em>, development of total confidence in
    the accuracy of the Buddhist analysis of reality; (3) <em>s�labbata-par�m�sa</em>, not
    performing ritual and rite and a method of spiritual activity; (4) <em>k�ma-r�ga</em>,
    liberating oneself from sensuality; (5) <em>vy�p�da</em>, elimination of animosity
    towards others, (6) <em>r�pa r�ga</em>, not seeking rebirth material realms; (7) <em>ar�pa-r�ga</em>,
    not seeking rebirth in &quot;immaterial&quot; realms; (8) <em>m�na</em>, elimination of
    conceit in oneself, (9) <em>uddhacca</em>, developing full control over one's actions, and
    (10) <em>avijj�</em>, the final elimination of residual ignorance. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_26_">26. </a>Strictly speaking the Buddha
    claims that knowledge of the working of kamma can only be got by an enlightened person.
    Hence all opinions expressed on this subject will have to be tentative. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_27_">27. </a>This is the interpretation which
    most Buddhists in the West will be comfortable with. It takes the problem of cosmology out
    of the concern of the religionist and places it on the lap of the scientist where it
    should properly rest. Also the view that suffering is the creation of our own mind is well
    established in some schools of modern psychology. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_28_">28. </a>Care must be taken in interpreting
    Buddhism in terms of Buddhist cosmology. The dominant theory amongst cosmologists today is
    the &quot;Big Bang&quot; theory. Against this are ranged the theories of the oscillating
    universe (Hubble, James-Jeans) and the steady-state universe (Hoyle). The support for the
    Big Bang theory comes from those who are biased towards the Christian theory of creation
    (e.g. Paul Davies). Buddhists should contest this interpretation of the Big Bang theory
    which asserts a definite beginning to the universe, a proposition which the Buddha
    contested. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_29_">29. </a>The best way of interpreting <em>devas</em>
    in modern terms is to view them as extra-terrestrial beings. While this is a common view
    especially in science fiction the current scientific views of the formation of life on the
    planet is that it is not a unique process (as religions like Christianity would have it)
    by a physical process that could go on in the billions of stellar systems which comprise
    the universe. Furthermore life need follow the same evolutionary pattern that has taken
    place on the earth. Thus beings in these other planets could be considered <em>devas</em>,
    having a different physical appearance to humans. The Buddhist theory of karma would add a
    further dimension that might give them different psycho-physical powers to humans. But
    such speculations are not really necessary because of the inconsequence of the <em>devas</em>
    to human existence even if they exist at all. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_30_">30. </a>These terms are new but the idea
    is quite old. There is a tradition that the Buddha spoke in terms of heavens and hells
    when preaching to ordinary people (who in the Buddha's time would have had little
    education) and spoke in the more abstract terminology of nibb�na only in discourse with
    more learned persons. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_31_">31. </a>The <em>Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>
    claims that about half of the world's 5 billion people adhere to the main religions. Of
    this 40% are Christians and 20% are Muslims. Buddhists number about 247 million (9.6%)
    almost all of them in Asia. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_32_">32. </a>&quot;Refuge&quot; in this context
    means with respect to the Buddha the acceptance of the Buddha as a supremely enlightened
    teacher, with respect to the Dhamma that the teaching is fundamentally correct, and with
    respect to the Sangha the recognition that one is a part of a wider community seeking to
    practice the Buddha's teaching. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="N_33_">33. </a>The word &quot;Sangha&quot; has
    different connotations. In its original meaning, and the one used in this formula, it
    means those persons who have made some progress on the Buddhist path (at least to the
    level of <em>s�tapanna</em> or &quot;stream winner&quot;). It is also used in two other
    meanings: (1) the body of ordained persons and (2) the body of Buddhist disciples both
    monk and lay irrespective of actual level of accomplishment. </font></p>
