For most people meditation practice doesn't "do it all." At best, it's
one important piece of a complex path of opening and awakening. 
<P>
In spiritual life I see great importance in bringing attention to our
shadow side, those aspects of ourselves and our practice where we have
remained unconscious. As a teacher of the Buddhist mindfulness practice
known as <B>"vipassana"</B>, I naturally have a firm belief in the value of
meditation. Intensive retreats can help us dissolve our illusion of
separateness and can bring about compelling insights and certain kinds
of deep healing. 
<P>
Yet intensive mediation practice has its limitations. In talking about
these limitations, I want to speak not theoretically, but directly from
my own experience, and from my heart. 
<P>
Some people have come to meditation after working with traditional
psychotherapy. Although they found therapy to be of value, its
limitations led them to seek a spiritual practice. For me it was the
opposite. While I benefited enormously from the training offered in the
Thai and Burmese monasteries where I practised, I noticed two striking
things. First, there were major areas of difficulty in my life, such as
loneliness, intimate relationships, work, childhood wounds, and patterns
of fear, that even very deep meditation didn't touch. Second, among the
several dozen Western monks (and lots of Asian meditators) I met during
my time in Asia, with a few notable exceptions, most were not helped by
meditation in big areas of their lives. Many were deeply wounded,
neurotic, frightened, grieving, and often used spiritual practice to
hide and avoid problematic parts of themselves. 
<P>
When I returned to the West to study clinical psychology and then began
to teach meditation, I observed a similar phenomenon. At least half the
students who came to three-month retreats couldn't do the simple "bare
attention" practices because they were holding a great deal of
unresolved grief, fear, woundedness, and unfinished business from the
past. I also had an opportunity to observe the most successful group of
meditators -- including experienced students of Zen and Tibetan Buddhism
-- who had developed strong <B>samadhi</B> and deep <B>insight</B> into impermanence
and selflessness. Even after many intensive retreats, most of the
meditators continued to experience great difficulties and significant
areas of attachment and unconsciousness in their lives, including fear,
difficulty with work, relationships wounds, and closed hearts. They kept
asking how to live the Dharma and kept returning to meditation retreats
looking for help and healing. But the sitting practice itself, with its
emphasis on concentration and detachment, often provided a way to hide,
a way toctually separate the mind from difficult areas of heart and
body. 
<P>
These problems exist for most vipassana teachers as well. Many of us
have led very unintegrated lives, and even after deep practice and
initial "enlightenment experiences," our sitting practice has left major
areas of our beings unconscious, fearful, or disconnected. Many American
vipassana teachers are now, or have recently been, in psychotherapy in
order to deal with these issues. 
<P>
It should also be noted that a majority of the 20 or more largest
centers of Zen, Tibetan, Hindu, and vipassana practice in America have
witnessed major upheavals, centering on the teachers themselves (both
Asian and Western), related to issues of power, sex, honesty, and
intoxication. Something is asking to be noticed here. If we want to find
true liberation and compassion what can we learn? 
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#800080><B>Some Helpful Conclusions for Our Practice</B> </FONT>
<P>

1. For most people, meditation practice doesn't "do it all". At best,
it's one important piece of a complex path of opening and awakening. I
used to believe that meditation led to the higher, more universal
truths, and that psychology, personality, and our own "little dramas"
were a separate, lower realm. I wish it worked that way, but experience
and the non-dual nature of reality don't bear it out. If we are to end
suffering and final freedom, we can't keep these two levels of our lives
separate. 
<P>
2. The various compartments of our minds and bodies are only
semi-permeable to awareness. Awareness of certain aspects does not
automatically carry over to the other aspect, especially when our fear
and woundedness are deep. This is true for all of us, teachers as well
as students. Thus, we frequently find meditators who are deeply aware of
breath or body but are almost totally unaware of feelings and others who
understand the mind but have no wise relation to the body. 
<P>
Mindfulness works only when we are willing to direct attention to every
area of our suffering. This doesn't mean getting caught in our personal
histories, as many people fear, but learning how to address them so that
we can actually free ourselves from the big and painful "blocks" of our
past. Such healing work is often best done in a therapeutic relationship
with another person. 
<P>
3. Meditation and spiritual practice can easily be used to suppress and
avoid feeling or to escape from difficult areas of our lives. Our
sorrows are hard to touch. Many people resist the personal and
psychological roots of their suffering; there is so much pain in truly
experiencing our bodies, our personal histories, our limitations. It can
even be harder than facing the universal suffering that surfaces in
sitting. We fear the personal and its sorrow because we have not learned
how it can serve as our practice and open our hearts. 
<P>
We need to look at our whole life and ask ourselves. "Where am I awake,
and what am I avoiding ? Do I use my practice to hide ? In what areas am
I conscious, and where am I fearful, caught, or unfree ?" 
<P>
4. There are many areas of growth (grief and other unfinished business,
communication and maturing of relationships, sexuality and intimacy,
career and work issues, certain fears and phobias, early wounds, and
more) where good Western therapy is on the whole much quicker and more
successful than meditation. These crucial aspects of our being can't
just be written off as "personality stuff." Freud said he wanted to help
people to love and work. If we can't love well and give meaningful work
to the Earth, then what is our spiritual practice for ? Meditation can
help in these areas. But if, after sitting for a while, you discover
that you still have work to do, find a good therapist or some other way
to effectively address these issues. 
<P>
Of course, there are many mediocre therapists and many limited kinds of
therapy. Just as in meditation, you should look for the best. Beyond the
traditional psychotherapies of the '40s and '50s, many new therapists
have been developed with a strong spiritual basis such as
psychosynthesis. Reichian breath work, sand play, and whole array of
transpersonal psychologies. The best therapy, like the best meditation
practice, uses awareness to heal the heart and is concerned not so much
with our stories, as with fear and attachment and their release, and
with bringing mindfulness to areas of delusion, grasping and unnecessary
suffering. One can, at times, find the deepest realizations of
selflessness and non-attachment through some of the methods of
transpersonal psychology. 
<P>
5. Does this mean we should trade meditation for psychotherapy ? Not at
all. Therapy isn't the solution neither. Consciousness is ! And
consciousness grows in spirals. If you seek freedom, the most important
thing I can tell you is that spiritual practice always develops in
cycles. 
<P>
There are inner times when silence is necessary, followed by outer times
for living and integrating the silent realizations, as well as times to
get help from a deep and therapeutic relationship with another person.
These are equally important phases of practice. It is not a question of
first developing a self and then letting go of it. Both go on all the
time. Any period of practice may include samadhi and stillness, followed
by new levels of experiencing wounds and family history, followed by
great letting go, followed by more personal problems. It is possible to
work with all of these levels in the context of a spiritual practice.
What is required is the courage to face the totality of what arises.
Only then can we find the deep healing we seek - for ourselves and for
our planet. 
<P>
In short, we have to expand our notion of practice to include all of
life. Like the Zen ox-herding pictures, the spiritual journey takes us
deep into the forest and leads us back to the market place again and
again, until we are able to find compassion and the sure heart's release
in every realm.
