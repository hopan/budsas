        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is a great
        religion which enlightened humanity twenty-five centuries ago and
        released from all bondages, superstitious practices. It is a scientific
        religion. Gotama the Buddha is honoured today by every cultured and
        intelectual man irrespective of whatever religion he may profess, while
        the founders of most of the other religions are honoured only by their
        followers. Not only those who belong to some religions but also
        so-called free thinkers respect this world honoured Supreme Enlightened
        One. From the historical point of view there never lived any other
        Teacher who has ever given so much religious freedom as well as due
        credit to humanity. Before the advent of the Buddha, religion had been
        owned and monopolised only by a certain section of the society. The
        Buddha was the Teacher in history who indiscriminately opened the gate
        of religion to each and every man society. The Buddha has advised his
        followers to cultivate and develop the latent power of man and showed
        him how to make the best use of his willpower and intelligance without
        being a slave to an unknown being to find eternal hapiness which He
        proclaimed to the world through His own experience but not through
        therories, mere beliefs and traditional practices. His teaching is such
        that anyone can practise it without having any religious brand.</font></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">To compile this book I
        have selected various statements made by eminent philosophers, scholars,
        historians, scientists, writers, religious dignitaries, social reformers
        and politicians who are well-known to the modern-world as most
        intellectual people. Among them many are non-Buddhist and free thinkers.
        According to them, Buddhism is the most practical and rational religion
        which will apeal to scientific knowledge and which really can do a
        better service to mankind if the followers practise this religion
        properly.</font></p>

        great pleasure to present these valuable quotations extracted from
        various books and articles. Whatever may be the opinion of those who
        have given Buddhism the topmost place in the religious field, the
        compiler by quoting them, does not mean to belittle other religious
        beliefs, for the idea of publishing this book is not to show the

        reflect the unbiased views expressed by various intellectuals.</font></p>

        was a man. He too, gave a message to mankind universal in its character.
        Many of our best modern ideas are in closest harmony with it. All the
        miseries and discontents of life are due, he taught, to selfishness.
        Selfishness takes three forms � one, the desire to satisfy the senses;
        second, the craving for immortality; and the third the desire for
        prosperity and worldliness. Before a man can become serene he must cease
        to live for his senses or himself.</font></p>
