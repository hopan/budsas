I think that all of us here this
evening would share, with every other human being, the aspiration
to happiness. Even a masochist wants to be happy - it's just that
his or her idea of happiness is rather different. But how difficult
it is for us to <B><I>achieve</I></B> happiness!
<P>
We have moments of happiness - or
at least we think we do. We associate happiness with the feeling
we have when everything is going well - when everything is going
our way. Then we think &quot;Well, <B><I>this</I></B> is the way to happiness;
just make sure that everything goes my way, make sure I get everything
right, then I can be happy&quot;. But of course we all realise
that such an attitude is not practical. We can move towards the
goal, but never achieve it. Yet we all yearn for, and desire,
happiness.
<P>
One of the most interesting statements
the Buddha made about happiness was with regard to <B><I>Nibbana</I></B>
- the goal of Buddhism. He described <B><I>Nibbana</I></B> as the highest
happiness. He also described <B><I>Nibbana</I></B> as the highest peace;
the giving up of all desire and aversion; the relinquishment and
abandonment of any form of personal, separate entity. This description
does not fit our usual concept of happiness. When we think of
happiness, we don't usually think of peace. Happiness is usually
associated with a sense of excitement, like joyfulness, exhilaration
or exuberance. 
<P>
So we may be a little perplexed as
to what the Buddha meant by the statement that Nibbana is both
the highest happiness, and peace. If, by simple logic, peace is
the highest happiness, that's not very acceptable according to
our normal understanding. It's nice to be peaceful, but it gets
rather boring, doesn't it? How do we come to terms with this?
Why should the goal of Buddhism be peace? If the Buddha had said
that the goal of his teaching was love or compassion, this would
have sounded more inspiring, but he made peace the goal. Whether
peace can really be happiness is something for each of us to contemplate.
<P>
To understand <B><I>Dhamma</I></B> - to
see and understand the way things are - we must use our reflective
ability to look and know directly, with a bright, reflective mind;
with bare awareness. We can use this quality of awareness to observe
that which arises, that which happens around us, when we just
stop and <B><I>be</I></B>, rather than <B><I>become</I></B>. We practise meditation
in order to abide in this awareness so that we can contemplate
and reflect.
<P>
When you feel happy, what is that
feeling? If we look at happiness, we will clearly see that within
it are the seeds of unhappiness. Every happy state depends on
this or that; on this person or that person. With reflective awareness
we can look at our experiences and see that even when we get what
we want, we are still not completely happy - just a bit more happy.
How can we reach the goal of complete happiness? Can the mind
<B><I>be</I></B> completely happy? This is why the Buddha said &quot;the
mind can be perfectly peaceful&quot;. For it is in this perfectly
peaceful state that the mind is perfectly happy.
<P>
There are different types of peace.
Living in a quiet, secluded environment gives you a sense of tranquillity,
a sense of peace. Making the mind concentrated and withdrawing
from the complexity of the sensory world, as in meditation, can
also give you a sense of peace. But these are very conditioned
and vulnerable states. The peace that the Buddha was referring
to as <B><I>Nibbana</I></B>, is the peace of the mind that has given
up preference, liking and disliking, chasing and fighting, desire
and aversion and duality. It is the peace of the mind which needs
nothing and lacks nothing.
<P>
Of course, this is a great mystery
to us. The only way to find out what it is like is to <B><I>realise</I></B>
it. Before you will strive to realise it, you must consider whether
or not it is a worthwhile cause. Is the peaceful state of mind
really happiness - ultimate happiness? Or is it just a dull and
boring state of mind? I think that most people are not convinced
that peace is happiness. 
<P>
If we contemplate, we can see that
the Buddha pointed to peace, rather than love or compassion, because
if the mind is not at peace, then those qualities cannot bring
us true happiness. If the mind is clinging, chasing, fighting
and biased, then love and compassion will lead only to suffering.
<P>
Why, if love is such a happy state,
does so much pain arise from it? Could it be because that kind
of love is not the love of a peaceful mind? The Buddha pointed
to the peaceful mind because, if one achieves it, the rest comes
automatically, spontaneously and naturally. Love and compassion
are natural expressions of the peaceful mind; they are pure and
result in no suffering.
<P>
When we are not peaceful we see the
mind moving, chasing something, because we need to be reassured
and loved. We need to have and achieve and be successful. We need
praise and recognition. We need all of this because we feel insecure.
When we are not peaceful, the mind is generally fighting. It fights
that which threatens our self, our self-esteem, our pride or our
ego. And what's the response? The need to conquer, to defeat,
to annihilate. This is not a peaceful existence. When we live
this way we are living in hell - in a constant war zone.
<P>
One of the realms of existence in
Buddhist cosmology is that of the Hungry Ghosts, the Petas. Symbolically
they are represented as gigantic, bloated bodies with very small
mouths. They can never get enough of any food or liquid to feed
themselves and are always hungry, always thirsty. We may not look
like them, but quite often - to a lesser degree - we live that
way. In another realm are the Green Giants which, unsurprisingly,
are green and giant-size. They have fangs and big eyes, like Titans
- big, ugly, monstrous, warrior types of beings.
<P>
Hungry Ghosts and Green Giants symbolise
the two realms of desire and aversion, those movements of the
mind that fight, chase, want and need. Of course you have to eat,
you need clothing, medicine and shelter, but a lot of our chasing
is not for these basic needs, but from an emotional need; from
a lack of peace. We chase things for reassurance. People find
reassurance in many different areas - food, for example. Eating
sweets is emotionally reassuring. It appeases our insecurity.
We seek after praise, too. Why? Again, reassurance. To be attractive
is reassuring because <B><I>I</I></B> am then worth something. <B><I>I</I></B>
need this reassurance continuously because <I>I</I> am a separate
entity - a little <B><I>me</I></B> who feels vulnerable. This process
drives the movement of the mind. You must contemplate for yourself
just how much of the lust for power, gratification, praise and
position comes from this process. Each person must discover the
answer alone.
<P>
This process sets up an opposite
one. With the movement to chase and seek because of inner insecurity,
there also comes, automatically, the fighting tendency. Anything
that threatens me, or tends to increase my insecurity, is my enemy.
If someone challenges you, what is your response? If they say
&quot;I don't agree with that... I think that is wrong... I don't
think that's a good way to do it...&quot; - what happens in that
moment? The mind goes into an alert, defensive posture. What are
we defending - the view? Most of us don't really care so much
about the view. What we are really defending is the self - <B><I>myself</I></B>,
and the more insecure we are, the more strongly we react to any
challenge. That is why people who are very aggressive are quite
often the most insecure, because they are the ones who feel the
greatest threat from any challenge.
<P>
That's the Titan, the green colour,
with the fangs and bloated eyes. Notice how that image makes us
very aware of how we feel when challenged. We start to get very
hot, our eyes begin to bulge and we grit our teeth, ready for
a fight. This is suffering - it is not peaceful. Whether we win
or lose, it's suffering. This is why the Buddha said &quot;<I><B>The
victor only gains enmity, the longer he dwells in his hatred.
Happy live the peaceful, for they have given up victory and defeat</B></I>&quot;.
<P>
To get an idea of this peacefulness,
we practise meditation. We begin to see that the peaceful mind
is actually a very, very happy mind. The mind that is not chasing
or fighting is self-sufficient and free from fear. It is both
peaceful and happy. This does not mean that it is passive or dull,
only that it is no longer under a state of seige. Now there can
be <B><I>real</I></B> love and compassion - the natural expression of
the mind when there is no self to get in the way.
<P>
Now one begins to think that peace
is a desirable thing, a worthwhile goal to strive for. It seems
so far away - how do we get there? Life seems so complex, it seems
to demand that we chase and fight. Is the attainment of peace
really possible for a human being, or is it just a fantasy that
will remain forever unrealised?
<P>
Well, why not try it and see what
happens? How much peace can you bring into your life? Whatever
extra peace one can bring in must be worthwhile. You can see the
peacefulness of the mind right now, when you stop chasing and
fighting. You are not dead - just peaceful. And if you can do
it for this moment, you can do it for every moment.
<P>
We have to develop this practice
of remembering to be peaceful in the moment, by remembering that
being peaceful simply means not chasing, not fighting; being <B><I>aware</I></B>
in this moment, so that our natural wisdom can operate. Then our
natural wisdom, our natural love, our natural compassion, can
all arise spontaneously. It is greed for self that makes us go
around chasing and fighting; that makes us into Hungry Ghosts
and Titans; that makes us unpeaceful.
<P>
Try to remember, do it now and do
it every moment. This is the goal, the purpose of the spiritual
life - to be peaceful. It's enough that conditions can make you
uncomfortable, why allow them to make you miserable? Why should
you allow so many things to have power over your heart?
<P>
How many things cause the mind to
race out and become this craving and wanting Hungry Ghost? What
trivial, useless things? And why should some other trivial thing
cause you to become a Titan, this aggressive person caught in
a battle to prove that you are right and you are better? And when
you win, what do you win? The enmity of the other. And what do
you feel when you win? Quite often you feel sorry that you were
so harsh, so cruel, that you beat somebody. It is not a very joyful
or happy feeling, especially if  you beat somebody you care for
- and they are so often the people with whom we have most of our
arguments. The person who has been defeated feels hurt and resentful.
Is all that worthwhile? Why do we allow that to happen when we
could live so much more peacefully? It is because we <B><I>forget</I></B>
to be <B><I>peaceful</I></B>. It is because we <B><I>forget</I></B> to be <B><I>awake</I></B>.
It is because the mind clings; the mind gets lost chasing and
fighting because of its insecurity.
<P>
We need to understand this whole
process by observing ourselves. It's not just a matter of <B><I>wanting</I></B>
to be happy or <B><I>wanting</I></B> to be peaceful. We have got to see
<B><I>why</I></B> we are not happy, <B><I>why</I></B> we are not peaceful. The
more we see it, of course, the more we can solve the problem.
And solving the problem doesn't necessarily mean going anywhere
or doing anything very special, other than remembering to be <B><I>peaceful</I></B>.

<P>
This is why the practice of meditation
is so important. It is a training of the mind to be awake, to
see clearly, and to have the wisdom that enables us to be peaceful.
Every meditation is a training. You sit there, you have pain in
your legs, is that peaceful? Is that suffering? Normally, if there
is pain in the legs, we try to get away from it - we either move
or do something, because it is annoying. But in meditation, we
don't do that immediately. If one is able to remember, to abide
in mindfulness, then it's just pain in the legs. We experiment
with developing peace by not chasing and not fighting for a pleasant,
comfortable posture. Can the mind be peaceful while the pain is
still there? Experiment. Just stop and be awake, and don't chase
or fight, or dwell on aversion. Then the mind remains peaceful.
Extend this to more and more opportunities that arise during the
day. 
<P>
In Thailand, if they really want
to insult somebody, they call him a dog. Ajahn Chah used to say
&quot;If somebody calls you a dog, you just look around and see
if you have a tail. If you have got a tail, then you know they
are right. If you can't see a tail, then don't worry about it.
You are not a dog, so what's the problem?&quot;. Normally, if
somebody insults us, we have to fight to reassert ourselves. We
dwell on the aversion and spend a lot of time building anger,
preparing for war. You have got to get all your ammunition ready
if you are going to war. We start thinking negative, aggressive
thoughts and shoot our mouths off with aggressive, hurtful words.
And this is not at all peaceful - nothing is achieved, no peace.
Dwelling on anger not only creates more anger within yourself,
but in the other person as well.
<P>
Stop the mind from dwelling on anger
and negative thoughts. Allow the mind to be peaceful and not to
fight. From a peaceful mind there may be something to say - but
not in anger or hatred.
<P>
There are many opportunities to be
peaceful in our lives. It is only required of us that we remember
to be peaceful. It's not a secret, it's just this much: remembering,
and being awake enough, to be peaceful; not allowing the things
around us to have power over our hearts. If the mind abides in
this peacefulness, it will begin to experience the happiness resulting
from being free; the happiness that has no blemish because it
has no fear.
<P>
I would like to encourage all of
you to try to begin each day by making the mind peaceful. The
meditation exercise that we do is just a skilful means for getting
to know the peaceful mind. The peaceful mind is sensitive to the
moment. Get a feel for that in the morning, say, when you practise
meditation. Get a feel for the mind that is quiet, that is not
chasing, is not fighting, is not anxious, is not frightened. Get
a feel for the mind that is just peaceful, awake and sensitive.
<P>
Try to maintain that awareness during
the day. Of course, you will forget, but try to remember again,
and centre yourself in this peacefulness. Don't worry that you
won't be able to deal with life, that you won't be able to do
the things that you have to do. You will do everything, and you
will do it better. The more we do this practice, the more skilled
we become; the more peaceful and happy our lives become. The happier
our lives become, the more peaceful and happy become the lives
of everyone around us. Have you noticed how people respond to
you when you feel peaceful and happy? But if you feel happy in
an unpeaceful way, how do people respond to you then? Just notice
it. Sometimes, people who are very happy but are not peaceful
are very irritating. And, if they are miserable and not happy,
then they are even more irritating. But, if they are peaceful
and happy, other people have quite a good response. They are positively
affected because a peaceful and happy person is also a very sensitive,
balanced person. The excited, exuberant, over-active, happy-go-lucky,
party behaviour which we commonly associate with happiness, quite
often comes from insecurity. It is a movement of the mind that
attempts to reassure oneself that one is a particular type of
person, and it comes from insecurity, not peace. That is why it
irritates so many people.
<P>
When we are peaceful and happy we
can live our lives fruitfully. Don't think you won't be able to
do anything. You can do everything quite well, everything that
is worthwhile doing, anyway. Maybe you won't be able to get into
those heated arguments and fighting confrontations, but do you
really need that? When we are peaceful, we are happy, and when
we are happy and peaceful, the people around us will benefit from
our happiness and peacefulness.
<P>
So try to establish this state of
peace from the very beginning of your day. Try to sustain it throughout
the day. Try to end the day in this way. And, every day, take
one more step, and cultivate this path - the path to peace and
happiness. Don't be disappointed by failure. Don't be disappointed
by forgetfulness. Just remember, and start again.
<P>
I offer these reflections and contemplations
for you this evening, just as a suggestion, so that you may consider
it and do as you think fit.
