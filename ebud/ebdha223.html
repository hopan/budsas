      <td width="100%" align="left"><b><font size="4" color="#990099" face="Times New Roman">The
        Third Millenium</font></b>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This year we, the members
        of the Human Race entered into what has been termed by the largely
        Western-dominated international media as the Third Millennium or Y2K for
        short. We have been subjected to an enormous amount of hype by
        commercial interest groups and some religious enthusiasts who promised
        us that the world would surely end. The ignorant, the superstitious and
        the fearful were especially a target for these groups. New cults sprang
        up threatening the wrath of a frustrated God on humanity that has
        consistently refused to believe in him or obey his unrealistic commands.
        The gullible were persuaded to part from their material wealth and even
        kill themselves to escape the ultimate, final, holocaust of the end of
        the world. Then of course, there were those who made loud and strident
        calls to warn us of the horrors of the &quot;millennium bug&quot; which
        would wipe out modern civilization at midnight on the last day of 1999.
        Computers were supposed to erase information relating to when we had
        been insured, when we were last inoculated, that our fixed deposits
        interest rates would have to be renewed... the prospects were simply
        horrifying! Then came the great anti-climax.&nbsp; nothing happened!
        There were many shame-faced religionists who had to run to their holy
        books and interpret them - once again.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Now, what was the Buddhist
        attitude to all of this? We did not join the mad crowd and view this
        whole situation calmly and rationally. To begin with, we remembered that
        we reached our second millennium five hundred years ago and we are
        already half way into our third millennium. That certainly gave us some
        greater seniority and maturity with which to view the universe and to
        advise our fellow beings on how to conduct ourselves in the pursuit of
        ultimate happiness. Perhaps we could now prevail on our younger brothers
        and sisters with different world views that their perspectives have
        motivated them to act in ways dangerous not only to the human race but
        to all inhabitants on this lovely planet, including plants and animals.
        Before we become too smug and divide the human race into &quot;us&quot;
        Buddhists and &quot;them&quot;, the rest, let me hasten to remind
        ourselves that all of us have been guilty of joining the same rat race
        and those who call themselves &quot;Buddhists&quot; have just as happily
        trod the &quot;primrose path&quot; of sensuality, materialism and greed
        like almost everyone else in the 20th Century. What I will proceed to
        discuss in the rest of this essay is how the Sublime Teachings of the
        Buddha, if rightly understood and correctly followed by everyone can
        save the human race from ultimate disaster.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We need not think that the
        beginning of the 21st Century had any particular, or cosmic significance
        in the supramudane sense. Time is a human invention and a human being is
        no different today from what his ancestor was two or three thousand
        years ago. We humans have the same propensity for good or evil as our
        forebears, did during the time of the Buddha. The difference may be that
        today, given our vast technological advances and education, we are in a
        better position to develop our good or evil natures. If we have the good
        sense to slow down and look at the Teachings without bias and practice
        them sincerely, we can raise the human race to high levels of divinity.
        If we persist in ignoring the precious teaching we will continue to give
        in to the beast in us. The choice is ours. The Buddha taught for all
        mankind. If this message can be brought to all human beings, if we can
        persuade all human beings and their governments that the Buddha was not
        bound by narrow sectarian interests, but that he was concerned with all
        sentient beings, we would have gone a long way towards making this world
        a better place for all its inhabitants.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To effectively promote social harmony
        and universal peace through Buddhism we have some serious thinking to
        do. We should seriously consider what our attitude to the Buddha's
        message is; we must be united and not waste precious energy and
        resources arguing about the superiority of any particular school of
        Buddhism, we must recognize the rights of our fellow inhabitants on
        earth (including plants and animals); we must recognize the equality of
        all members of humanity, (including women and children). Once we have
        set our own house in order, so to speak, we will be in a better position
        to work for the happiness and welfare of everyone just as the Buddha
        intended.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="4" color="#990099" face="Times New Roman">Social
        Concerns</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">A great deal has been
        spoken and written about the Buddha's concern for the well-being of all
        living beings and humankind in particular. While the greater part of his
        ministry was devoted to the edification of those who renounced the
        worldly life, he was most free with his advice to uplift the condition
        of the householder. Some of the best known Sutras are devoted to the
        development of social harmony and are addressed to royalty as well as
        common folk. In the Agganna Sutra for example the Buddha speaks in
        mythical terms about the origin of society and the causes of inequality;
        in the Kasibharadvaja Sutra he distinguishes between labour for
        spiritual progress and labour to gain material wealth. In the Sigalovada
        Sutra he explains the duties and responsibilities of the different
        groups which comprise society - parents, children, husbands, wives,
        employers, employees, teachers and religious persons. He speaks of the
        benefits to be derived when every member of a community knows what is
        expected of him or her and sincerely fulfills his or her obligations. In
        the Parabhava Sutra he enumerates the various forms of antisocial
        behaviour which cause personal and social loss. In the Vyagghapajja
        Sutra he describes the benefits that can be gained by the householder
        even without &quot;going forth&quot;. In one section of the
        Mahaparinibbana Sutra the Buddha explains the government and national
        unity. In the Mangala Sutra he enumerates good social behaviour which
        obstructs misery and woe to the individual and thereby the community.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Beside these sutras, there
        are of course the numerous stories and legends recorded in the
        Dhammapada and the Jataka which again emphasize the factors which
        promote social harmony and universal peace. The question now remains to
        be asked, how practical are these admonitions in modern times? It has
        often been suggested that the Buddhist formulae for social well being
        are rather idealistic. They may have worked when governments exerted far
        more power over their subjects in ancient India than they do today.
        Today's citizens are too independent and selfish to be ruled with gloved
        hands. This need not be so. People can still be treated humanely and we
        can still follow the principle that if you treat people well, they will
        behave well. Part of the reason why governments are so harsh today is
        that they operate from a point of view that the world is finite and that
        everything is real. We must remember that all the Buddha's advice was
        given against a world view which is totally different from the world
        view of a vast majority of humans today. If we want to effectively make
        use of the Buddha's Teaching to promote social harmony and universal
        peace we must begin to see the world as the Buddha did. We must
        &quot;see the world as it really is&quot;. We must use all our efforts
        to give an understanding of the three characteristics of <b>Anicca</b>
        (impermanence), <b>Dukkha</b> (unsatisfactoriness) and <b>Anatta</b>
        (non self). Admittedly this is a huge task. We have to overcome two
        millennia of propaganda which spread the false notion that the world and
        its creatures were specially created for the selfish pleasure of man. We
        have to counter the Renaissance notion that &quot;man is the measure of
        all things.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Surely it is a difficult
        task, but certainly it is not impossible. More and more people in
        developed countries are waking up to the obvious fact that the world was
        NOT made for man's pleasure, and that it was not created in one glorious
        moment but that everything that exists is an illusion and dependent on
        everything else, that man's ultimate happiness lies in his working not
        for himself alone but for the safety and happiness of others. This is
        exactly the Buddha's view and a large number of people, weary of past
        excesses and fearful of impending disaster are ready to give heed to the
        Buddha's advice on peaceful co-existence where duties and
        responsibilities take precedence over rights.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The time is therefore ripe
        for Buddhists all over the world to explain the message of the Buddha in
        modern terms, to help people understand the REAL nature of existence.
        Once there is Right (or Perfect) Understanding then naturally all other
        aspects of the teaching will not seem so naive and impractical after
        all. Already many education systems in the west are paying due attention
        to the development of a culture where man is taught to put the concerns
        of others before his own needs. Increasingly the innate goodness of
        beings is fostered through proper education and understanding. Yes, the
        Buddha's model for a Perfect Society can work, but we must work
        intelligently and ceaselessly to make it work. A Buddhist value system
        is already recognizable in many organizations such as UNESCO, WHO, FAO
        and so on. It is of no concern to us whether or not every human being is
        converted to Buddhism. The Buddha has declared that we can respect any
        system which contains aspects of the <b>FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS</b> which
        obviously these organisations do. Our concern is only for the happiness
        of humanity, both material and spiritual. Greater awareness of the
        Buddha's teachings will make his principles universally accepted.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="4" color="#990099" face="Times New Roman">Unity
        in Buddhist Schools of Thought</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">To create this awareness
        Buddhists must adopt a two fold strategy. First we must put our own
        house in order. Two millennia of dissension within ourselves and
        aggression from outside have weakened our practice. We must look at
        ourselves clearly and examine what are our inner weaknesses which reduce
        our ability to truly practise the Buddha's message to help our fellow
        beings. Ever since the First Council following the passing away of the
        Buddha we Buddhists have expended enormous amounts of energy to develop
        different schools or traditions within Buddhism. Of course this
        development of our divergent views took place with a degree of brotherly
        feeling which is unique in the history of religion. We can proudly
        assert again and again that we have practiced a path of peace which is
        unique. We can proudly assert again and again that guided by the
        Master's Teachings in the Kalama Sutra (and reiterated in the edicts of
        Asoka) we have never shed a drop of blood or raised a single whip to
        spread our beliefs or to defend them. This record alone gives us a
        greater credibility over others. We have the blueprint to create
        universal peace.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">However, let's be
        realistic. While we can go on forever patting ourselves on our backs for
        our tolerance, the fact remains that we have gone in different
        directions and that we have tended to consider &quot;our&quot; school
        superior to that of others. The Buddha taught only one Path to
        Perfection. Our imperfections gave rise to the different schools. The
        time has come for us to transcend our narrow sectarian views and look
        forward to developing an understanding of what has been, described as
        &quot;Transcendental Buddhism&quot;. This pooling of our resources, and
        leaving behind our culture-bound approach to the teachings, has become
        absolutely necessary, given the fact that the world has shrunk so much
        and so many people with such diverse languages, beliefs, cultures and
        attitudes are taking an interest in the Buddha and his teachings. All of
        us, who have inherited this rich treasure from various sources, must
        come together to help all of mankind gain ultimate happiness.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This does not mean of
        course that we must abandon the indescribable richness and variety of
        our different traditions. The world would be so much poorer if we lost
        the invaluable treasures of Sri Lankan, Japanese, Korean Chinese,
        Tibetan and South East Asian Buddhist way of life. No, what I mean is,
        while we continue to foster the mundane manifestations of the teachings
        within our own cultures, we must vigorously make efforts to let the
        world hear the Buddha's voice. This will reduce the confusion regarding
        the Teachings especially among people who hear it for the first time.
        After all, we must never lose sight of the Buddha's first injunction to
        spread the Dharma for &quot;the happiness and welfare of sentient
        beings&quot;. This clearly altruistic motive for our missionary efforts
        must never be forgotten. To realize this ideal we must be humble and be
        prepared to look at the teachings of the other schools without
        discrimination. Members of the Sangha particularly must highlight the
        areas of agreement amongst the various schools so that the younger
        generation is helped to view Buddhism as a perfect, harmonious whole
        that evolved from a single teaching.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">One way of doing this of
        course is to encourage more dialogue amongst the different traditions.
        The &quot;First World Buddhist Propagation Conference&quot; organized by
        the Nembutsu Sect of Japan, in Kyoto in 1998 is an excellent example of
        such a successful meeting of Buddhist minds. Such gatherings of
        prominent Buddhists from different traditions, meeting amicably, serve
        to remind the world that Buddhists are really united and do share
        identical views on such issues as enlightenment and service to mankind.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">An obvious area where
        Buddhists can promote cooperation effectively is in the dissemination of
        the Dharma. Books, periodicals, magazines and m6re recently the Internet
        should all try to encourage inter-sectarian dialogue between schools of
        Buddhism so that readers begin to see the underlying unity of Buddhism
        in the apparent diversity of its practices.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="4" color="#990099" face="Times New Roman">Role
        of the Sangha</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Aside from making efforts
        to come together and fostering the acceptance of the concept of
        Transcendental Buddhism, one more area we must look at seriously to
        ensure our inner strength in the Buddhist world, is the Role of the
        Sangha. It is clear that the Buddha recognized the vital importance of
        the Sangha in keeping alive the purity of his Teaching. This. is
        evidenced by the fact that he included the Sangha as the third component
        of the Holy Triple Gem. The Sangha's important role then and now as the
        transmitter of the Dharma across time and space can never be
        underestimated. From the Buddha's time until now the history of Buddhism
        has been illuminated by such glorious names as Sariputta, Moggallana,
        Ananda, Mahinda, Sanghamitta, Nagarjuna, Vasubhandhu, Bodhidharma,
        Asvaghosa, Buddhaghosa, Yuan Chuan, Fa Hsien ... the list is endless.
        Philosophers, preachers, commentators, travellers ... they all had one
        thing in common. They were sons and daughters of the Buddha. Even in our
        own times there are so many names of members of the Sangha who keep the
        glorious flame of the Dharma alive, bringing the voice of the Buddha to
        every corner of the globe.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">From the time of the Buddha
        right up to our own times, the members of the Sangha have been the force
        which sustained and interpreted the Buddha-word so that it is kept ever
        alive and fresh in the hearts and minds of men and women. So much for
        their importance. Let us now look at their function in today's society
        and the challenges that they face.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Although there have been
        great monks who went far beyond the monasteries in which they first
        donned the mendicants' garb, the vast majority of monks never strayed
        beyond their monastery walls. They were content to live quiet secluded
        lives of contemplation avoiding as much as possible the turmoil of the
        outside world. But as we reach the end of the twentieth century we
        cannot ignore the fact that the world is indeed very different from what
        it was for centuries, particularly in Asia. The world is creeping very
        much into the monastery. The monk is increasingly called upon to serve
        the society which supports his material needs. It is no longer enough to
        conduct the occasional devotional practices for the lay person or teach
        the rudiments of reading and writing and calculation to his children.
        The world has shrunk. Events which occur in the US or Europe deeply
        affect the lives of everyone on the planet. The Buddhist monk is part of
        that global life. Social harmony and Universal Peace are the
        responsibility of everyone on this planet: the Buddhist monk must carry
        out his part of that responsibility. The obvious exception to this is of
        course, the Bhikkhu of the Forest tradition, who completely renounces
        all contact with society and seeks salvation for himself. The monastery
        monk does not fall into this category.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Not only in Asia, but in
        Europe, the Americas, Australia, and increasingly, even in Africa,
        Buddhism is playing a vital role in contributing to social harmony and
        universal peace. The Buddhist monks or nuns are the vital links between
        the Buddha's message of peace and harmony and the people of the world
        who so desperately need it.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Is the Sangha ready for
        the challenge?</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">My immediate and honest
        answer to that is &quot;No. At least not yet&quot;.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">To begin with, traditional
        life in rural Asia has changed very little over the centuries. But at
        the same time, technological and urban developments and westernisation
        have moved ahead at dizzying speeds. The result : the average Buddhist
        in a traditional Buddhist country (possibly with the exception of Japan)
        has become increasingly disoriented and there exists a vast gap within
        him, between his traditional values and his modern concept of the world
        with its banking systems, sensational entertainment, materialism,
        nuclear families and so on. He is torn between what he is
        &quot;told&quot; he should be as a model Buddhist parent, son, employee
        or citizen, and the demands made on him in the real world: the world of
        materialism, greed and selfishness. Too often, the Sangha is
        ill-equipped to help their lay supporters to bridge the gap between the
        modern and the traditional. The average modern monk in a Buddhist
        country is found to be woefully out of touch with the modern world. It
        is more likely he has not even seen a computer, let alone being
        proficient to operate one! He has very little contact with the outside
        world, so how can he help his fellow beings to cope with it?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">What is interesting to note
        here is that this has not always been so. Who can deny that a Buddhist
        monk has always been an agent of change for the better throughout
        history? Who can deny that it was the Buddhist monk who brought Art,
        Architecture, Technology, Music and Medicine to every country in Asia?
        It has even been suggested that the ancient Egyptian THERAPEUTAE who
        practised monasticism and specialized in healing (“therapeutic&quot;)
        were originally Buddhist monks, therapeutic being a corruption of
        THERAVADA! Be that as it may, the Sangha civilized the ancient world.
        But they can hardly be held up as role models for change today! What
        happened? Of course we can point a, finger at colonization, but blaming
        others for our shortcomings is a luxury we can ill afford. The only
        thing we can do is to ask ourselves how we can change the situation and
        once again make the Buddhist monk the leader of men and women in his
        society.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">I believe the key is in
        Education. Governments as well as social reformers in Buddhist countries
        must recognize the tremendous potential that members of the Sangha have
        to help their fellow beings. They are generally highly intelligent as
        can be seen by , their ability to memorize, understand, interpret and
        teach the Sublime Dhamma. While continuing to uphold these traditional
        forms of learning, we must give them additional skills -
        computer-literacy, farming techniques, counseling, engineering, nursing,
        teaching for example. They must not only be proficient in the Dharma,
        they must be practical in serving society's material needs. Over the
        centuries the Saffron robe has earned its wearer a high degree of
        respect. Today the Buddhist monk can make use of this psychological tool
        to help laymen become better people. It must never be forgotten that the
        Buddha never condemned material prosperity. There are enough Sutras in
        our scriptures to show that the Buddha even went to the extent of
        declaring that wealth, honestly earned, gave a person self esteem, human
        dignity and the power to do good. The Buddhist monk who helps his lay
        devotee to attain material success WITH RIGHT UNDERSTANDING is indeed
        following his Master's injunction to work for the benefit and welfare of
        humanity.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">All of this however could
        possibly lead to a further problem. And that is, we could have monks who
        are trained without understanding. They could go to the other extreme
        and cut off all links with the past. (It has happened!) No, monks have
        an all important role to uphold tradition. Tradition links us to the
        past. It gives us our roots, it helps us to remain steady against the
        onslaught of alien cultures, alien religious practices and alien values.
        The monk must be so steeped in and proud of his significant traditions
        that he imbues his devotees with that same love and pride in his own
        culture. Can it be done? Of course! Just look at Japan.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This is one area where the
        Sangha can perform a useful function as a factor in promoting harmony by
        contributing to the success of that society economically.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="4" color="#990099" face="Times New Roman">The
        Bhikkhuni Order</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Another area which is worth
        looking into is the Bhikkhuni Order. I am certainly aware that this is
        still a thorny issue among some quarters, but I am convinced that there
        are fewer people around who cannot see the importance of the Bhikkhuni
        Sangha. It is again a matter of great pride to us, that the Buddha was
        the first religious teacher to constitute the component of female
        monasticism. While it cannot be denied that he had some well-founded
        initial reservations, he did give in to Ananda. What is generally
        (conveniently?) overlooked is that the organization spread like
        wildfire, almost literally, as soon as it was instituted, showing the
        tremendous spiritual need women had for upliftment. It is also a matter
        of record (to the eternal credit of the Buddha) that once accepted,
        women had no difficulty whatsoever in achieving the highest pinnacles of
        spiritual achievements human beings are capable of: Patacara, Khema,
        Kisagotami, Dhammadinna, Uppalavanna, Visakha ... need one continue?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Today, women have proven
        that they are capable of becoming Presidents, Prime Ministers and
        Scientists as well as teachers and nurses, women are equal partners in
        every field of human endeavour. It is time, therefore that Buddhists
        recognize the tremendous contributions women can make to the promotion
        of Social Harmony and Universal Peace. In fact, women have made
        contributions to both these areas and they can do so today. It is of
        course a credit to the Buddha's Teaching on this matter that the first
        woman prime minister of the world was a Buddhist woman from Sri Lanka.
        Buddhist women have an undeniable role to play especially in harnessing
        the female workforce and playing an efficient and intelligent part in
        human development. Their contribution can be invaluable as teachers,
        nurses, counselors, in fact, as anything, to effect social change. The
        voice of the women can no longer be ignored as a voice to seek and
        promote International Peace. As mothers they are better qualified than
        anybody else to speak against the sacrifice of sons and husbands on the
        altars of war.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Sangha male and female,
        if properly trained and conversant in many languages and skilled in many
        disciplines, can be a powerful force in the development of peace. Thanks
        to world leaders like H.H. the Dalai Lama, the Buddhist monk has always
        been a symbol of peace even among non-Buddhists. What is necessary now
        is for Buddhist monks and nuns the world over to equip themselves with
        the skills needed to spread the Buddha's message of peace to all
        mankind. Given our past history of nonviolence, we are better qualified
        than anyone else to encourage everyone to practice the &quot;love thy
        neighbour&quot; policy.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="4" color="#990099" face="Times New Roman">The Lay
        Person</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In a wider sense the Sangha
        comprises not only Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis but Upasakas and Upasikas
        (male and female lay devotees) as well. Given the admirable spirit of
        democracy proclaimed and practised by the Buddha, the members of the
        Sangha as well as lay people have duties and responsibilities towards
        the development of Social Harmony and Universal Peace. There are today
        upasakas and upasikas who are performing an invaluable service in
        spreading the Buddha's message in the world. This is especially true in
        non-traditional Buddhist countries like Malaysia and Singapore where lay
        devotees are leading their friends to practice the noble Teachings by
        leading fellow buddhists along the Path. They even build and run
        Viharas, Orphanages, Old Folks Homes, Clinics to serve the community.
        Also in the West and developed countries, lay Buddhists will play an
        increasingly important role to promote International Peace in the world,
        although perhaps they may not be needed as much in areas of social
        development. This does not mean however that the Sangha will be replaced
        by lay workers in the cause of Buddhism either in the near or distant
        future. The Sangha will and must continue to play an important role not
        only as guardians of the Dharma but also as a role models and teachers
        of the lay people in matters pertaining to Buddhism. This of course
        further emphasizes the point that the Sangha must be capable of taking
        on this added responsibility of training lay people for Dhammaduta work.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="4" color="#990099" face="Times New Roman">Buddhism
        as a force against war</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Still on the theme of
        International Peace, religious leaders have an increasingly important
        role to play in teaching their followers to walk in the path of peace.
        Sadly however, the history of mankind is replete with examples of so
        called religious people who waged war in the name of religion. Buddhism
        never has and never can ever condone war even if it is disguised as a
        &quot;just&quot; or &quot;holy&quot; war. The Buddha condemned violence
        of any kind for whatever reason. He repeatedly declared that the only
        victory is the conquest of self and the only miracle is the conversion
        from evil to good. Buddhists therefore, Sangha and lay people alike, are
        bound by precedent and precept never to wage war but to persuade all
        people to walk the path of Peace. It, is certainly not an accident
        therefore that the UNESCO Charter begins with the preamble : &quot;Since
        it is in the minds of men that wars are created, it is in the minds of
        men that the fortresses against war must be erected&quot;. This is
        almost exactly like the very first verse of the Dhammapada which states:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left"><i><b><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Mind precedes
          all wholesome and unwholesome states and is their chief; <br>
          they are all mind wrought. <br>
          If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts, <br>
          misery follows him <br>
          like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox&quot;.</font></b></i></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><i><b>&quot;If one speaks
          or acts with pure mind, <br>
          because of that, happiness follows one, <br>
          even as one's shadow that never leaves.&quot; </b></i></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The teaching of the Buddha,
        if inculcated in the young mind from the beginning, will no doubt be a
        powerful civilizing factor that will turn humanity from violence to
        compassion. One of our tasks therefore is to make available the
        teachings of Buddha in more languages and through various media,
        including the Internet.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Although the human race has
        made such tremendous progress in almost every field of endeavour,
        warfare is one area in which we have behaved no better than animals. In
        fact one might even say that we have even descended lower than animals
        because given our higher intelligence we should know better than to
        succumb to our lower instincts of lust, anger, hatred and delusion. It
        has been said that man's worst characteristic is his ability to inflict
        pain - mental and physical - on his fellow beings. The worst
        manifestation of this irrational behaviour is man's tendency to wage war
        on the flimsiest of excuses. Ever since man learnt to hold a weapon he
        has waged war against his fellow beings, aro., any student of history
        will readily agree that there never has been such a thing as a
        &quot;just war&quot;. And wars get from bad to worse. At least in the
        past, wars were only waged between men silly enough to get involved on
        the battlefields. But today whole hordes of innocent men, women,
        children and even animals suffer indescribable privations as a result of
        war. Mothers are separated from children, husbands are separated from
        wives, brothers are separated from sisters - there is no end.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Some people argue
        that conflict and war cannot be avoided because they are expressions of
        human nature. I am realistic enough to realize that it would be
        foolhardy to sit down and do nothing when aggressors are brutally
        destroying innocent lives on the basis of unrealistic and unfounded
        claims, but we must always bear in mind that war is at best a last
        resort to maintain peace. However, if we believe that war is inevitable,
        then we will wage war. But if, like the great emperor Asoka, we have the
        spiritual development and the wisdom to see the folly of war we can
        certainly avoid it. Buddhists can be very proud of the fact that in our
        own times the greatest advocate of peace is His Holiness the Dalai Lama
        of Tibet. For nearly half a century this great Buddhist leader has
        worked tirelessly to regain his homeland, without once uttering a
        malicious word against those who occupy his land. He has never condemned
        them but treated them as fellow-beings. On the other hand, he has not
        been a coward either. He has fearlessly spoken against the ill-treatment
        of his subjects and the lies spread against him. But he has not chosen
        to take arms against his people's aggressors. This is because he lives
        by the advice of the Buddha given in the Dhammapada,</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left"><i><b><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Hatred does
          not end by hatred <br>
          By love alone it is quelled&quot;.</font></b></i></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">A struggle which is ended
        by force is no victory. Real victory can only be attained by a true
        change of heart founded on understanding on the part of the aggressor.
        His Holiness the Dalai Lama truly believes in inculcating peace through
        non violence.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We are all familiar with
        the story of how during the time of the Buddha a prince called Vidudabha
        annihilated the entire Sakya clan simply because he harboured a grudge
        against them for a slight insult. We have to learn from that example and
        seek rather to follow in the footsteps of the great king whose name was
        changed from Chanda (cruel) Asoka to Dhamma (righteous) Asoka because he
        had the wisdom to walk the path shown by the Buddha. Let us also recall
        the Buddha's declaration that the people of a certain kingdom could not
        be overcome by force because they followed the seven conditions for the
        progress of a nation. These examples show that war is avoidable if we
        truly wish it. There is a principle of Modern Management today which
        declares that if we expect Zero Defects in our operations we will
        achieve them. Similarly if we envisage a society without war, we will
        achieve peace. Unfortunately we have been so indoctrinated to believe
        that war is the only way to get what we want, that we will continue to
        wage war. The most horrible irony of it is that people even wage wars in
        the name of religions which teach the brotherhood of man.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore the greatest
        challenge facing us in the next millenium is to grow up, to stop
        fighting like small boys and heed the word of the Enlightened One :</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left"><b><i><font face="Times New Roman">All fear death, <br>
          All fear the rod, <br>
          Knowing this we should never strike <br>
          Nor cause to strike.</font></i></b></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b><font size="4" color="#CC00CC" face="Times New Roman">Proselitisation</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The world today is divided by many
        factors. Sad to say one of the most important of the organizations
        responsible for these many divisions is religion. Today, perhaps like at
        no other time in history, are the vast resources of certain religious
        organizations being exploited shamelessly in a mad scramble to win
        converts at any cost. These include the spreading of malicious lies
        against other religions like Buddhism. Young, innocent impressionable
        people are being lured away from their traditional religion through
        blatant false propaganda and even through bribes. There are instances of
        whole villages in certain countries being converted en masse through the
        promise of material gain. Conversion in itself may not be a bad thing,
        but when methods employed and the motives for converting are suspect
        then we must not stand idly by and do nothing about it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In many countries, conversions which are
        not accompanied by a full understanding of what is being accepted can
        lead to serious problems, often causing the breakup of marriages and
        families and other social problems. Therefore it is not conversion but
        buying people.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is therefore an urgent need for
        Buddhists to seek the dialogue with other religious groups to voice our
        dissatisfaction with their activities. There are genuine members of
        these faiths who are themselves embarrassed by the antics of their
        fellow religionists. They must speak against their own kind and
        Buddhists must make every effort to urge them to do so. In the past,
        traditional religions were the victims of colonial missionaries. Today,
        the problem is much more insidious - citizens of the same country are
        working to undermine the traditional cultures and practices of their
        forefathers and introducing alien ways to their people, separating
        parents and children, the old and the young.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="4" color="#990099" face="Times New Roman">Ecumenism</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">On a more positive note, however,
        Buddhists have always been encouraged, in the KALAMA SUTRA for example,
        to seek dialogue with others to show respect for other genuine seekers
        after the truth. We need to talk with other religionists formally and
        informally to know how they think, to show them how we think and to find
        common ground on which we can cooperate to work for the betterment of
        the human race. In some cases we must even be humble enough to admit
        that we can adopt their methods particularly in social and charity work
        and help the poor and the weak and helpless in every corner of the
        world.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="4" color="#990099" face="Times New Roman">Buddhist
        Values</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having examined some of the challenges
        facing Buddhists today and how we can help to promote peace and social
        harmony let us examine how we can identify some Buddhist values which we
        will need to achieve our goals.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It cannot be said that there are
        &quot;Buddhist Values&quot; which are unique to Buddhism and not to be
        found in other religious systems. The Buddha recognized this when he
        declared that we must accept and recognize the worth of any religion in
        so far as that religion contains the Four Noble Truths. What is unique
        about Buddhism is our<b> UNDERSTANDING</b> of the nature of these values
        and why we practice them. When the Bodhisatta practised the Ten Paramis,
        he was motivated in an entirely different way than any other follower of
        a spiritual path either in part or as a whole.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ten paramis - <b>dana</b>
        (generosity), <b>sila</b> (precept), <b>nekkhamma</b> (renunciation), <b>panna</b>
        (wisdom), <b>viriya</b> (energy), <b>khanti </b>(patience) <b>sacca</b>
        (truthfulness), <b>adhitthana</b> (determination), <b>metta</b> (loving
        kindness) and <b>upekkha</b> (equanimity) - can form a so. lid value
        system on which a Buddhist builds his or her personal spiritual life.
        This individual effort is then extended to members of the family, the
        community, the nation and finally the world as a whole. All Buddhists
        all over the world must consciously make the effort to understand the
        importance of practising these values, endeavour to practice them
        earnestly, and then explain them to others. Our education system and our
        media network must spread these values through every means possible so
        that our daily thinking is affected by them. We all know the famous
        Jataka tale in which the Bodhisatta advises his acrobat master. To
        ensure perfect safety each performer must be fully concerned about his
        own welfare and security first. In that way both parties will be safe.
        Therefore the implementing of a Buddhist value-system involves making
        each individual understand his responsibility towards the rest, to
        understand the inter-relatedness of all beings, to guard him or herself
        and thereby guard others.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The year 2001 holds many promises and
        challenges for all members of the human race. Buddhists are in a
        particularly strong position to help all human beings realize their full
        potential and live in peace and harmony not only with themselves but
        with others as well. It is our duty to help spread the Buddha's message
        by spreading it through the written and spoken word, but, far more
        importantly through the example of living noble lives in accordance with
        the Sacred Teachings.</font></p>
