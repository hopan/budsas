The Buddha was like a doctor, treating the spiritual ills of the human race.
The path of practice he taught was like a course of therapy for suffering
hearts and minds. This way of understanding the Buddha and his teachings dates
back to the earliest texts, and yet is also very current. Buddhist meditation
practice is often advertised as a form of healing, and quite a few
psychotherapists now recommend that their patients try meditation as part of
their treatment. 
<p>

After several years of teaching and practicing meditation as therapy, however,
many of us have found that meditation on its own is not enough. In my own
experience, I have found that Western meditators tend to be afflicted more with
a certain grimness and lack of self-esteem than any Asians I have ever taught.
Their psyches are so wounded by modern civilization that they lack the
resilience and persistence needed before concentration and insight practices
can be genuinely therapeutic. Other teachers have noted this problem as well
and, as a result, many of them have decided that the Buddhist path is
insufficient for our particular needs. To make up for this insufficiency they
have experimented with ways of supplementing meditation practice, combining it
with such things as myth, poetry, psychotherapy, social activism, sweat lodges,
mourning rituals, and even drumming. The problem, though, may not be that there
is anything lacking in the Buddhist path, but that we simply haven't been
following the Buddha's full course of therapy.
<p>

The Buddha's path consisted not only of mindfulness, concentration, and insight
practices, but also of virtue, beginning with the five precepts. In fact, the
precepts constitute the first step in the path. There is a tendency in the West
to dismiss the five precepts as Sunday-school rules bound to old cultural norms
that no longer apply to our modern society, but this misses the role that the
Buddha intended for them: They are part of a course of therapy for wounded
minds. In particular, they are aimed at curing two ailments that underlie low
self-esteem: regret and denial. 
<p>

When our actions don't measure up to certain standards of behavior, we either
(1) regret the actions or (2) engage in one of two kinds of denial, either (a)
denying that our actions did in fact happen or (b) denying that the standards
of measurement are really valid. These reactions are like wounds in the mind.
Regret is an open wound, tender to the touch, while denial is like hardened,
twisted scar tissue around a tender spot. When the mind is wounded in these
ways, it can't settle down comfortably in the present, for it finds itself
resting on raw, exposed flesh or calcified knots. Even when it's forced to stay
in the present, it's there only in a tensed, contorted and partial way, and so
the insights it gains tend to be contorted and partial as well.  Only if the
mind is free of wounds and scars can it be expected to settle down comfortably
and freely in the present, and to give rise to undistorted discernment.
<p>

This is where the five precepts come in: They are designed to heal these wounds
and scars. Healthy self-esteem comes from living up to a set of standards that
are practical, clear-cut, humane, and worthy of respect; the five precepts are
formulated in such a way that they provide just such a set of standards.
<p>

<B><i>Practical:</i></B> The standards set by the precepts are simple -- no
intentional killing, stealing, having illicit sex, lying, or taking
intoxicants. It's entirely possible to live in line with these standards. Not
always easy or convenient, but always possible. I have seen efforts to
translate the precepts into standards that sound more lofty or noble -- taking
the second precept, for example, to mean no abuse of the planet's resources --
but even the people who reformulate the precepts in this way admit that it is
impossible to live up to them. Anyone who has dealt with psychologically
damaged people knows that very often the damage comes from having been
presented with impossible standards to live by. If you can give people
standards that take a little effort and mindfulness, but are possible to meet,
their self-esteem soars dramatically as they discover that they are actually
capable of meeting those standards. They can then face more demanding tasks
with confidence.
<p>

<B><i>Clear-cut: </i></B> The precepts are formulated with no ifs, ands, or buts. This
means that they give very clear guidance, with no room for waffling or
less-than-honest rationalizations. An action either fits in with the precepts
or it doesn't. Again, standards of this sort are very healthy to live by.
Anyone who has raised children has found that, although they may complain about
hard and fast rules, they actually feel more secure with them than with rules
that are vague and always open to negotiation. Clear-cut rules don't allow for
unspoken agendas to come sneaking in the back door of the mind. If, for
example, the precept against killing allowed you to kill living beings when
their presence is inconvenient, that would place your convenience on a higher
level than your compassion for life. Convenience would become your unspoken
standard -- and as we all know, unspoken standards provide huge tracts of
fertile ground for hypocrisy and denial to grow. If, however, you stick by the
standards of the precepts, then as the Buddha says, you are providing unlimited
safety for the lives of all. There are no conditions under which you would take
the lives of any living beings, no matter how inconvenient they might be. In
terms of the other precepts, you are providing unlimited safety for their
possessions and sexuality, and unlimited truthfulness and mindfulness in your
communication with them. When you find that you can trust yourself in matters
like these, you gain an undeniably healthy sense of self-respect.
<p>

<B><i>Humane:</i></B> The precepts are humane both to the person who observes them and
to the people affected by his or her actions.  If you observe them, you are
aligning yourself with the doctrine of karma, which teaches that the most
important powers shaping your experience of the world are the intentional
thoughts, words, and deeds you chose in the present moment. This means that you
are not insignificant. Every time you take a choice -- at home, at work, at
play -- you are exercising your power in the on-going fashioning of the world.
At the same time, this principle allows you to measure yourself in terms that
are entirely under your control: your intentional actions in the present
moment. In other words, they don't force you to measure yourself in terms of
your looks, strength, brains, financial prowess, or any other criteria that
depend less on your present karma than they do on karma from the past. Also,
they don't play on feelings of guilt or force you to bemoan your past lapses.
Instead, they focus your attention on the ever-present possibility of living up
to your standards in the here and now. If you are living with people who
observe the precepts, you find that your dealings with them are not a cause for
mistrust or fear. They regard your desire for happiness as akin to theirs.
Their worth as individuals does not depend on situations in which there have to
be winners and losers. When they talk about developing lovingkindness and
mindfulness in their meditation, you see it reflected in their actions. In this
way the precepts foster not only healthy individuals, but also a healthy
society -- a society in which the self-respect and mutual respect are not at
odds. 
<p>

<B><i>Worthy of respect: </i> </B>When you adopt a set of standards, it is important to
know whose standards they are and to see where those standards come from, for
in effect you are joining their group, looking for their approval, and
accepting their criteria for right and wrong. In this case, you couldn't ask
for a better group to join: the Buddha and his noble disciples. The five
precepts are called "standards appealing to the noble ones." From what the
texts tell us of the noble ones, they are not people who accept standards
simply on the basis of popularity. They have put their lives on the line to see
what leads to true happiness, and have seen for themselves, for example, that
all lying is pathological, and that any sex outside of a stable, committed
relationship is unsafe at any speed. Other people may not respect you for
living by the five precepts, but noble ones do, and their respect is worth more
than that of anyone else in the world.
<p>

Now, many people find it cold comfort to join such an abstract group,
especially when they have not yet met any noble ones in person. It's hard to be
good-hearted and generous when the society immediately around you openly laughs
at those qualities and values such things as sexual prowess or predatory
business skills instead. This is where Buddhist communities can come in. It
would be very useful if Buddhist groups would openly part ways with the
prevailing amoral tenor of our culture and let it be known in a kindly way that
they value goodheartedness and restraint among their members. In doing so, they
would provide a healthy environment for the full-scale adoption of the Buddha's
course of therapy: the practice of concentration and discernment in a life of
virtuous action. Where we have such environments, we find that meditation needs
no myth or make-believe to support it, because it is based on the reality of a
well-lived life. You can look at the standards by which you live, and then
breathe in and out comfortably -- not as a flower or a mountain, but as a
full-fledged, responsible human being. For that's what you are.
