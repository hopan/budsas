      <H4>The Bhaddedkaratta Sutta</H4>
      <P>The Bhaddekaratta Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaaya (No. 131) consists of a 
      &quot;summary&quot; <I>(uddesa)</I> in four verses and an &quot;exposition&quot; <I>
      (vibha&quot;nga)</I> dealing with some doctrinal points of considerable 
      psychological and ethical import. The theme set out by the Buddha in this 
      discourse recurs in three others — AAnanda-bhaddekaratta Sutta, 
      Mahaakaccaana-bhaddekaratta Sutta, and Lomasaka&quot;ngiya-bhaddekaratta Sutta 
      — in which the disciples of these names figure prominently. These four 
      consecutive suttas (Nos. 131-34) are thus made conspicuous among the 
      discourses of the Majjhima Nikaaya and one can well infer that this 
      bespeaks of the importance attached to their theme. That the theme was 
      highly esteemed is clearly revealed by the framework of the two suttas, 
      Mahaakaccaana-bhaddekaratta and Lomasaka&quot;ngiya-bhaddekaratta. In both, one 
      finds a deity appearing before a monk and recommending to him the learning 
      of the summary and exposition of the Bhaddekaratta, as follows:</P>
      
        Monk, you learn the summary and exposition of the Bhaddekaratta. Monk, 
        you master the summary and exposition of the Bhaddekaratta. Monk, you 
        bear in mind the summary and exposition of the Bhaddekaratta. Monk, the 
        summary and exposition of the Bhaddekaratta is beneficial; it pertains 
        to the elements of the Holy Life.
      <H4>The title: a puzzle</H4>
      <P>Although the theme of these four discourses was thus held in high 
      esteem, there is, unfortunately, a formidable obstacle to a proper 
      appreciation of its significance. The title Bhaddekaratta, which is also 
      the main key-word, remains more or less a puzzle. In none of the four 
      suttas is the word commented upon, despite the fact that the venerables 
      AAnanda and Mahaakaccaana also contribute to the exposition of the theme. 
      This is probably because the early disciples were already familiar with 
      the expression as such. Even the two monks Samiddhi and Lomasaka&quot;ngiya, 
      who confessed their ignorance of the summary and exposition of the 
      Bhaddekaratta when questioned by the deities, have not thought it fit to 
      get this puzzling word clarified for us, when they later went to the 
      Buddha for instruction on the subject.</P>
      <P>In the commentaries there is an attempt to explain the meaning of <I>
      bhaddekaratta,</I> but some scholars have questioned the validity of the 
      interpretation given in them. What these interpretations are, and on what 
      grounds they are found to be inadequate, can be gleaned from the following 
      comments by I.B. Horner and the venerable Ñaa.namoli:</P>
      <OL TYPE="I">
        <LI>
      
          Suttas 131-34 all have the term <I>bhaddekaratta</I> as part of their 
          title; and this presents something of a puzzle. MA v.1 attempts an 
          explanation of this word by saying: <I>
          vipassanaanuyoga-samannaagatattaa bhaddakassa</I> (v.1, <I>bhaddassa) 
          ekarattasa,</I> &quot;of one who is happy (? auspicious) for one night 
          because he is possessed of intentness of insight.&quot; Neumann renders the 
          term by &quot;Glücksaligeinsam,&quot; lonely blissfulness. But <I>ekatta</I> is 
          loneliness; <I>ekaratta</I> usually means &quot;for one night.&quot; But the 
          Bhaddekaratta suttas do not appear to envisage withdrawal from 
          thoughts of the past, future, and present for so little as one night. 
          On the contrary, the verses that form the <I>maatikaa</I> say that the 
          person to be called <I>bhaddekaratta</I> is he who abides ardently and 
          unweariedly day and night, that is surely, for some consecutive time 
          lasting longer than &quot;one night.&quot; I thought it best to translate only 
          the first part of the baffling compound, and have rendered <I>bhadda</I> 
          by &quot;auspicious,&quot; not in its sense of betokening success but in that of 
          prosperous, prospering. For the sage who comes to be at peace has 
          prospered by not following after the past, by not desiring the future 
          to be such or so, and by cultivating a right attitude to present 
          things. His position is not due to luck, a happy chance, or fortune&#39;s 
          favors; it is due to his own successful efforts, determined 
          resolution, and shunning of indolence.

        <LI>&quot;One who has one fortunate attachment&quot;
      
          (Introductory note:) There are four consecutive suttas in the Majjhima 
          Nikaaya with the name Bhaddekaratta, each based on the same verse. 
          This term has elsewhere been translated by &quot;true saint&quot; and like 
          phrases, which, however, quite miss the point. The commentary says 
          only this: &quot;<I>Bhaddekarattassa</I> means &#39;of one who is fortunate <I>
          (bhadda)</I> in having one <I>(eka)</I> attachment <I>(ratta</I> or <I>
          ratti)&#39;;</I> this is because of his possessing application to 
          insight.&quot; The subcommentary resolves the compound <I>ekaratta</I> 
          (one-attachment) into <I>ekaa ratti,</I> and says only that &quot;<I>bhaddekaratta</I> 
          means one who has a fortunate single attachment <I>(bhaddo ekaratto 
          etassa);</I> it is a term for a person who is cultivating insight.&quot; 
          The Mahaa Niddesa (commentary on Sn v.964) alludes to these suttas 
          without throwing any light on them. There appears to be no other 
          mention of the term elsewhere in the Canon and its commentaries.<P>The 
          Paali word <I>ratta</I> (adj.) or <I>ratti</I> (n.) in this instance 
          is from the root <I>raj (ra~njati, rajjati:</I> &quot;to take pleasure in&quot;; 
          e.g., <I>ettha me ra~njati mano:</I> &quot;here my mind delights&quot; [Sn 
          v.424]). So the <I>bhaddekaratta</I> appears as one who is applying 
          himself <I>invincibly,</I> <I>unshakably to know and to study the 
          present state as it occurs</I> (see verse). This application or 
          attachment is <I>auspicious</I> or <I>fortunate</I> because it leads 
          to liberation. The much more common meaning of the Paali word <I>ratti</I>is 
          &quot;night&quot; (Skt. <I>raatra).</I> But (neither the commentary nor 
          subcommentary decides the point) if we attempt to interpret the term
          <I>bhaddekaratta</I> as &quot;one who has a single auspicious night&quot; and 
          the commentarial passages accordingly (...<I>[the word is 
          unintelligible in the ms.]</I>...grammatically possible), it is hard 
          to make satisfactory sense of the context. It might be supposed that 
          the expression &quot;<I>bhaddekaratta</I>&quot; was a popular phrase taken over 
          by the Buddha and given a special sense by him, as was not 
          infrequently done, but there seems no reason to do so and there is no 
          evidence for it in this case. It is more likely to be a term coined by 
          the Buddha himself to describe a certain aspect of development. Such 
          terms are <I>ukkhittapaligha</I> (&quot;one who has lifted the bar&quot; [M 
          22]), <I>di.t.thippatta</I> (&quot;one who has attained vision&quot; [M 70]), 
          and many more.

        <LI>
 
          It is not clear precisely what <I>bhaddekaratta</I> (the name of four 
          successive suttas in the Majjhima Nikaaya) means. NettiA (p.203) says
          <I>&quot;Eva.m patipannaattaa bhaddo ekaratto assaati bhaddekaratta&quot;</I> 
          (MA v.3). MAA adds <I>&quot;Ekaaratti ekaratto, bhaddo ekaratto etassaati 
          bhaddekaratta.m vipassana.m paribruuhento puggalo; etenaaha 
          &#39;vipas-sanaanuyogasamannaagatattaa&#39;</I> (MA v.1) <I>ta.m uddissa 
          pavattiyaa pana bhaddekarattasahacaranato bhaddekaratto; ten&#39;aaha 
          bhagavaa &#39;Bhaddekarattassa vo bhikkhave uddesa~nca vibha&quot;nga~nca 
          desissaami</I> (M III 187)<I> ti&#39;</I> (MAA 368). Netti .Tiikaa offers 
          nothing. The only other mention, referring to these four suttas, is at 
          Nd1 484, namely <I>&quot;bhaddekarattavihaara.m&quot;</I> in an explanation of
          <I>&quot;jaagariyaanuyoga-pariyanto.&quot;</I> The NdA has nothing enlightening.<P>
          All these comments seem to take the <I>ratt</I> element as 
          representing <I>ratti</I> (&quot;night&quot; = Skt. <I>raatri),</I> and so the 
          literal translation would then be &quot;one who has an auspicious one 
          (i.e., entire) night&quot; (i.e., &quot;the night spent as one entirely in 
          insight&quot;) and the Burmese transcript of the Majjhima Nikaaya gives the 
          same sense to <I>bhaddekaratta</I> as to <I>ahorattam</I> (&quot;by day, by 
          night&quot;) two lines higher. But these explanations are all grammatical 
          and avoid the meaning. The term might — it has been suggested, but 
          this is entirely speculative — have been a popular one for, say, the 
          Hindu <I>Sivoraatri</I> (the last night of waning moon, and devoted by 
          Brahmans to meditation), which was purposely given a new sense here by 
          the Buddha, as he did with many other current terms. <I>(Ekarattivaaso</I> 
          at Sn 19 has apparently no connection with this, being simply the 
          opposite of <I>samaanavaaso</I> at Sn 18.)</P>
          <P>An alternative derivation might be that <I>ratt</I> stands for <I>
          ratto</I> or <I>ratti</I> from <I>Vra~nj</I> &quot;to desire, to lust&quot;: cf.
          <I>dhamma-raaga</I> (A IV 423) or <I>tathaagatora~njita</I> (§ 59), of 
          the &quot;profitable craving&quot; and &quot;profitable conceit&quot; (§§ 506-7), though 
          there is apparently no example of <I>raatti</I> from this root in 
          Paali (cf. Skt. <I>rokti).</I> This interpretation has been adopted in 
          the translation here as more trenchant (i.e., &quot;attachment&quot; to insight, 
          which leads to nonattachment), though neither seems quite safe, and 
          the meaning remains unsettled.

      <H4>A possible solution</H4>
      <P>The Theranaamo Sutta of the Sa.myutta Nikaaya (S II 282f.) gives the 
      case of a monk who was a lone-dweller and who also recommended the same 
      mode of living to others. As the title of the sutta (&quot;The Elder-named&quot;) 
      suggests, he was known to his fellow monks simply as &quot;the Elder.&quot; Whether 
      this was in deference to his love of anonymity or whether it had any 
      pejorative associations for the more sociable of his fellow monks, we do 
      not know. Nevertheless, we seem to get a caricature of his character in 
      the following sentences of the sutta:</P>


          Tena kho pana samayena a~n~nataro bhikkhu Theranaamako ekavihaarii 
          ceva hoti ekavihaarassa ca va.n.navaadii. So eko gaamapi.n.daaya 
          pavisati, eko pa.tikkamati, eko raho nisiidati, eko ca&quot;nkama.m 
          adhi.t.thaati.
        <P>At that time a certain monk called &quot;The Elder&quot; was a lone-dweller and 
        he also spoke in praise of lone-dwelling. Alone he enters the village 
        for alms; alone he returns; alone he sits in seclusion; alone he paces 
        up and down.

          — S II 282 </P>

      <P>Some of his fellow monks who might have thought his behavior to be 
      rather peculiar report about him to the Buddha. The Buddha summons &quot;the 
      Thera&quot; who thereupon confirms that report about his partiality for 
      lone-dwelling. When questioned as to how exactly he upholds the precept 
      and practice of lone-dwelling, he explains to the Buddha his daily routine 
      after the manner given above:</P>

        Here, Lord, alone I enter the village for alms; alone I return; alone I 
        sit in seclusion and alone I pace up and down. It is thus, Lord, that I 
        am a lone-dweller and an exponent of lone-dwelling.
      <P>The Buddha&#39;s remarks in this instance were neither those of 
      condemnation nor of unqualified praise. He says: &quot;There is, Thera, this 
      type of lone-dwelling: I do not deny it. But, Thera, I shall tell you the 
      manner in which lone-dwelling is fulfilled in all its details. Listen 
      attentively to it.&quot; And then he goes on to explain it in the following 
      words:</P>


          Idha Thera ya.m atita.m ta.m pahiina.m, ya.m anaagata.m 
          pa.tinissattina.m. Paccuppannesu ca attabhaavapa.tilaabhesu 
          chandaraago suppa.tiviniito. Eva.m kho Thera ekavihaaro vitthaarena 
          paripu.n.no hoti.
        <P>Herein, Elder, whatever is past, that is abandoned. Whatever is 
        yet-to-come (i.e., future), that is relinquished. And the 
        desire-and-lust for the present modes of personality is well under 
        control. It is thus, Elder, that (the ideal of) lone-dwelling becomes 
        fulfilled in all its details.

          — S II 282 </P>

      <P>In order to make it clear that the ideal lone-dweller who fully 
      conforms to the above requirements is the arahant himself, the Buddha sums 
      up his discourse with this verse:</P>
     

          <BLOCKQUOTE>
     

          <P><I>Sabbaabhibhu.m sabbavidu.m sumedha.m<BR>

        <P><I>Surmounting all, knowing all,<BR>
        The wise-one, unsoiled in all,<BR>
        Is well-released renouncing all<BR>

        That man I would fain make known<BR>
        As &quot;One-who-dwells-all-alone.&quot;

          — S II 282 </I>
</P>

        </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>Now this ideal of lone-dwelling as set out in the Theranaama Sutta 
      seems to find an echo in the verses which make up the summary of the 
      Bhaddekaratta Sutta. One can compare the Buddha&#39;s definition of the 
      perfect lone-dweller in the former sutta with the following lines 
      occurring in the latter:</P>


          <BLOCKQUOTE>

        Or yearn for the future-yet-to-come<BR>
        That which is past is left behind<BR>

        And that which is present he discerns<BR>
        With insight as and when it comes.

          — M III 187 </I>

        </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>We saw above how the Theranaamo Sutta expounds the true ideal of 
      solitude <I>(ekavihaaro)</I> as against the popular and commonplace 
      concept of solitude. The true ideal is depicted as a &quot;solitude&quot; of mind, 
      gained by giving up everything belonging to the past and the future and by 
      disciplining well the desire-and-lust for one&#39;s present modes of 
      personality. The concluding verse makes it clear that the ideal 
      lone-dweller is unsoiled as to all phenomena and is &quot;well released, 
      renouncing all.&quot; This reminds us of the term <I>upadhiviveka</I> 
      (detachment from all assets or substrata) denoting Nibbaana, which is the 
      highest mental solitude <I>(cittaa vivekaa, cittaa vuupaakaasa)</I> to 
      which all attempts at physical solitude <I>(kaayaavivekaa, 
      kaayavuupakaasa)</I> should be properly harnessed. As for this latter, the 
      popular conception is always one of dwelling &quot;a-lone,&quot; all by oneself. It 
      conjures up in the ascetic mind the prospect of peace in being away from 
      the &quot;madding-crowd.&quot; No doubt, this physical solitude is often upheld by 
      the Buddha as an essential pre-requisite for detachment. Thus at the end 
      of one of the most forceful perorations in favor of this type of solitude, 
      he confesses to his attendant, the venerable Naagita, with remarkable 
      candor, that he is quite at ease even in answering calls of nature, when 
      he sees none in front of or behind him while journeying all alone. <I>
      Yasmaaha.m Naagita samaye addhaanamagga pa.tipanno na ka~nci passaami 
      purato vaa pacchato vaa, phaasu me Naagita tasmi.m samaye hoti, antamaso 
      uccaarapassaavakammaayaati</I> (A III 344), and we find in the 
      Theragaathaa a similar expression of the ease of solitude in the words of 
      Ekavihaariya Thera (The Elder &quot;Lone-dweller&quot;):</P>

            — Thag v.537
      <P>Just as much as the physical solitude is associated with the 
      satisfaction of not seeing anyone before or behind oneself, the mental 
      solitude too is characterized by the absence of anxious glances forward or 
      backward. Having abandoned everything past <I>(ya.m atiita.m ta.m 
      pahiina.m</I> [Theranaamo Sutta]; <I>yadatiita.m pahiina.m ta.m</I> 
      [Bhaddekaratta Sutta]), one does not trace back or relive the past <I>
      (atiita.m naanvaagameyya</I> [Bhaddekaratta]). Having given up what 
      pertains to the future <I>(ya.m anaagata.m ta.m pa.tinissa.t.tham</I> 
      [Theranaamo]), one is no longer anxious about the future <I>
      (nappa.tika&quot;nkhe anaagata.m</I> [Bhaddekaratta]). This concept of the past 
      and future brings spatial and temporal modes of thinking much closer to 
      each other — the &quot;before&quot; and the &quot;behind&quot; of physical solitude and the 
      &quot;past&quot; and the &quot;future&quot; of mental solitude. However, the freedom from 
      these two distracting elements in itself does not constitute the perfect 
      &quot;ease&quot; that is the ideal of solitude. There is also a third element of 
      distraction to be eliminated. One has to be &quot;care-free&quot; whether the 
      solitude aimed at is physical or mental. Hence any deep attachment to 
      one&#39;s &quot;belongings&quot; — be they material or mental — is the third element of 
      distraction. Having brought under complete control the &quot;desire-and-lust&quot; 
      regarding one&#39;s present modes of personality <I>(paccuppannesu ca 
      attabhaava-pa.tilaabhesu chandaraago suppa.tiviniito</I> [Theranaamo]), 
      one discerns what is present with penetrative insight <I>(paccuppanna~nca 
      yo dhamma.m tattha tattha vipassaati</I> [Bhaddekaratta]) as impermanent
      <I>(anicca),</I> sorrow-fraught <I>(dukkha)</I> and not one&#39;s own <I>
      (anattaa).</I></P>
      <P>The two suttas, Theranaamo and Bhaddekaratta, thus concur with each 
      other in pointing to a concept of &quot;solitude&quot; far transcending its popular 
      connotations. Nor are they without parallel in other portions of the Paali 
      canon, the following being a few of them:</P>

      <P>A comparative study of the two suttas in question would make it 
      abundantly clear that both deal with the same theme. But how are we to 
      bring into proper alignment the &quot;baffling compound&quot; — <I>bhaddekaratta?</I> 
      In the context of our discussion of the subject of solitude, the most 
      outstanding element of this compound appears to be the middle word <I>eka</I> 
      (one, alone, single). Owing to the rather generic character of the word, 
      its significance has often been underestimated — hence the tendency to 
      treat <I>bhaddekaratta</I> as an elliptical expression. The word <I>eka</I> 
      was more or less regarded as a blank check by some scholars, and resort 
      was had to companion words like &quot;night&quot; or &quot;attachment-to-solitude,&quot; in 
      order to give it its full value. But it may be pointed out that the word
      <I>eka</I> enjoyed a privileged position in the terminology of the Paali 
      canon as a symbol of great significance for those of an ascetic 
      temperament. It bore little ambiguity for them as it had all the 
      connotations that go with the ascetic idealization of solitude. For them, 
      apparently, there was no &quot;<I>mono</I>-tony&quot; in the word <I>eka</I> (see 
      above — &quot;caricature&quot; of the elder), and hence we find it ringing through 
      the Khaggavisaa.na Sutta (Sn vv.35-75) in the refrain: <I>eko care 
      khaggavisaa.nakappo</I> (&quot;wander alone — like the rhino horn&quot;). The Muni 
      Sutta, too, uses the word in connection with this &quot;faring-alone&quot;: <I>eka.m 
      caranta.m muni.m appamatta.m</I> (&quot;the diligent sage who wanders alone&quot; 
      [Sn v.215]). It also occurs as many as six times in the verses of the 
      venerable Ekavihaariya (Thag vv.537-546). To be &quot;alone without a second&quot;
      <I>(ekaakiyo adutiyo</I> [v.541]) in the depth of the forest, was the 
      longing of his heart, and for this, he had won the approbation of the 
      Buddha, in the following verse:</P>

      <P>The semantic difficulties in connection with the word <I>eka</I> having 
      been surmounted, we may now pass on to a discussion of its relation to the 
      following word <I>ratta.</I> The expression <I>ekaratta</I> was 
      traditionally interpreted to mean &quot;one night&quot; due to a rather superficial 
      connection with the compound <I>ahoratta.m,</I> as has been pointed out by 
      the Venerable Ñaa.namoli. Enough has been said by him and by I.B. Horner 
      to show that there is little justification for such an interpretation. 
      Venerable Ñaa.namoli rightly suggests, as an alternative, that <I>ratta</I> 
      might be a derivation from <I>Vra~nj</I> — to desire, to lust, to get 
      attached.<SPAN CLASS="note-tag"><A HREF="#n-2" NAME="t-2">2</A></SPAN> His 
      hesitation to follow up the full implications of his hypothesis might have 
      been due to the difficulties he encountered in regard to the word <I>eka.</I> 
      Now that this word has revealed its significance, we can proceed to 
      appreciate the clues he had given, at their full value. The 
      &quot;love-of-solitude&quot; (see verse above) was reckoned a type of &quot;profitable 
      craving&quot; — if one may use that expression prudently. For instance we get 
      an express sanction for such an &quot;attachment&quot; or &quot;delight&quot; in the Naalaka 
      Sutta (Sn):</P>

         
          <I>Ekaasanassa sikkhetha — sama.nupaasanassa ca ekatta.m monamakkhaata.m 
          — eko ce abhiramissati atha bhaasiti dasa disaa... </I> 
        <P>Let one train oneself in sitting alone and in the resort proper to a 
        recluse. &quot;One-ness&quot; (i.e., solitude) is called sageship, and if you will 
        delight in being alone, then you will illuminate the ten quarters...
         
          — Sn vv.718-719 </P>
         
      <P>Or again, we find in the Saariputta Sutta (Sn) the word <I>rati</I> 
      (delight, attachment, lust) used in the qualified sense referred to above, 
      in connection with the Buddha&#39;s love of solitude and renunciation:</P>
       
         
          <P><I>Sabba.m tama.m vinodetvaa, eko&#39;vaa ratimajjhagaa </I>
</P>
         
        <P><I>Having dispelled all darkness, he found delight in being alone
         
          — Sn v.956 </I>
</P>
         
      <P>All this evidence would go to show that <I>ekaratto</I> in <I>
      bhaddekaratto</I> meant &quot;the one attached to solitude,&quot; in other words, 
      the &quot;lover of solitude.&quot; We are now left with the adjective <I>bhadda</I> 
      (auspicious, good, lofty). As already mentioned in the discussion of the 
      Theranaamo Sutta, mere being &quot;a-lone&quot; physically is not the be-all of the 
      concept of solitude advocated by the Buddha. It may be recalled that he 
      was reserved in his remarks on the Thera&#39;s description of his daily 
      routine, and that he proceeded to teach him the manner in which 
      lone-dwelling is perfected in all its detail. One can also compare, in 
      this respect, the Migajaala Sutta (S IV 35f.), where he defines the two 
      terms <I>ekavihaari</I> and <I>sadutiyavihaarii:</I></P>
       
         
           
            There are, Migajaala, forms cognizable by the eye, desirable, 
            pleasant, agreeable, delightful, connected with sense-pleasures, and 
            alluring. Supposing a monk delights in them, asserts them, clings to 
            them; then, even as he delights in, asserts and clings to them, 
            there arises delight <I>(nandi).</I> When there is delight, he is 
            lustful, and when he is lustful there is bondage. A monk who is 
            fettered by the fetter of delight, Migajaala, is called 
            &quot;One-who-dwells-with-a-second&quot; <I>(sadutiyavihaari).</I> 
         
       
      <P>Having made a similar pronouncement in respect of the objects of the 
      other senses, he sums up in the following words:</P>
       
         
           
            A monk thus dwelling, Migajaala, even though he may resort to remote 
            lodgings in the forest, where there is little sound, little noise, 
            which are deserted of people and where one can remain undisturbed by 
            men — lodgings fit for meditative seclusion — still, he is called 
            &quot;one-who-dwells-with-a-second.&quot; And why so? Because craving is his 
            &quot;second&quot; (i.e., companion) and that is not abandoned by him. Hence 
            he is called &quot;one-who-dwells-with-a-second.&quot; 
         
       
      <P>The lone-dweller <I>(ekavihaari)</I> is then defined as the monk who 
      does not delight in, assert or cling to the objects of the six senses and 
      is thus free from bondage to the fetter of delight. The Buddha&#39;s 
      summing-up in this case is no less forceful than his concluding remark in 
      the Naagita Sutta — the contradiction between them being only apparent, 
      when examined within context:</P>
       
         
           
            A monk thus dwelling, Migajaala, even though he may be dwelling in 
            the village, in the midst of monks, nuns, male and female lay 
            followers, kings, royal ministers, teachers, and disciples of other 
            sects — still he is called a &quot;lone-dweller.&quot; And why so? Because 
            craving is his &quot;second,&quot; and that is abandoned by him. Hence is he 
            called &quot;lone-dweller.&quot; 
         
       
      <P>The ideal type of solitude advocated by the two suttas (Theranaamo and 
      Migajaala) is also the theme of the Bhaddekaratta suttas. There, the 
      summary and the exposition concern the <I>Bhaddekaratto,</I> whom we may 
      now identify as the &quot;ideal (lit. good) lover of solitude.&quot; The distinction 
      made by the Buddha between mere physical solitude and the ideal type of 
      spiritual solitude, would amply justify the use of the epithet <I>bhadda;</I><SPAN CLASS="note-tag"><A HREF="#n-3" NAME="t-3">3</A></SPAN> 
      in fact, the concluding verse of the summary attributes the compliment to 
      the Buddha himself:</P>

      Dhamma in all its depth and significance. There is, for instance, in the 
      summary, the pair of difficult terms <I>asa.mhira.m/asa.mkuppa.m</I> with 
      a significance of its own. But these points will be dealt with in the 
      Notes, since they could best be appreciated in the light of the sutta

              skilled in the Dhamma of the good men, trained in the Dhamma of

            understand the detailed meaning thus:<P>&quot;And how, friends, does one 
            trace back the past? He thinks: &#39;Such was my eye in the past, such 
            were forms&#39; and his consciousness is bound fast there by 
            desire-and-lust. Because his consciousness is bound fast with 
            desire-and-lust, he delights in it; delighting in it he traces back 
            the past. He thinks: &#39;Such was my ear in the past, such were 
            sounds... such was my nose in the past, such were smells... such was 
            my tongue in the past, such were flavors... such was my body in the 
            past, such were tangibles... such was my mind in the past, such were 
            ideas,&#39; and his consciousness is bound fast there by 
            desire-and-lust. Because his consciousness is bound fast by 
            desire-and-lust, he delights in it; delighting in it he traces back 
            the past. That is how, friends, one traces back the past.</P>
            <P>&quot;And how, friends, does one not trace back the past? He thinks: 
            &#39;Such was my eye in the past, such were forms&#39; but without his 
            consciousness being bound fast there by desire-and-lust. Because his 
            consciousness is not bound fast by desire-and-lust, he does not 
            delight in it; not delighting in it, he does not trace back the 
            past. He thinks: &#39;Such was my ear in the past, such were sounds&#39;... 
            &#39;...nose... smells&#39; ... &#39;... tongue... flavors&#39; ... &#39;...body... 
            tangibles&#39;... &#39;Such was my mind in the past, such were ideas&#39; but 
            without his consciousness being bound fast there by desire-and-lust. 
            Because his consciousness is not bound fast by desire-and-lust, he 
            does not delight in it; not delighting in it, he does not trace back 
            the past. That is how, friends, one does not trace back the past.</P>
            <P>&quot;And how, friends, does one yearn for the future? He thinks, &#39;My 
            eye may be such in the future, forms such&#39; and sets his heart on 
            obtaining what is not yet obtained; because he so sets his heart, he 
            delights in that; delighting in that, he yearns for the future. He 
            thinks: &#39;My ear may be such in the future, sounds such&#39;... &#39;My 
            nose...&#39; ... &#39;My tongue...&#39; ... &#39;My body...&#39; ... He thinks: &#39;My mind 
            may be such in the future, ideas such&#39; and sets his heart on 
            obtaining what is not yet obtained; because he so sets his heart, he 
            delights in that; delighting in that he yearns for the future. That 
            is how, friends, one yearns for the future.</P>
            <P>&quot;And how, friends, does one not yearn for the future? He thinks: 
            &#39;My eye may be such in the future, forms such&#39; but does not set his 
            heart on obtaining what is not yet obtained; because he does not so 
            set his heart, he does not delight in that; not delighting in that, 
            he does not yearn for the future. He thinks: &#39;My ear... My nose... 
            My tongue... My body... My mind may be such in the future, ideas 
            such&#39; but does not set his heart on obtaining what is not yet 
            obtained; because he does not so set his heart he does not delight 
            in that; not delighting in that, he does not yearn for the future. 
            That is how, friends, one does not yearn for the future.</P>
            <P>&quot;And how, friends, is one drawn into present things? Whatever eye 
            and forms there are, friends, both these are present; and to that 
            which is present his consciousness is bound fast by desire-and-lust; 
            because his consciousness is bound fast by desire-and-lust, he

          <B>III.
          Notes to the Bhaddekaratta Sutta </B> 
        <H4><A HREF="#t-sutta-a" NAME="n-sutta-a">a</A>. <I>Atita.m 
        naanvaagameyya</I></H4>
        <P>This phrase helps us to understand the significance of the Buddha&#39;s 
        constant advice to &quot;let-go&quot; the past. The exposition clearly reveals 
        that it is not so much the mere recollection of the past that is the 
        bondage, as the element of delight <I>(nandi)</I>or desire-and-lust <I>
        (chandaraaga)</I><SPAN CLASS="note-tag"><A HREF="#n-5" NAME="t-5">5</A></SPAN> 
        one finds therein. It is the tendency to retrace, revive, relive, and 
        relish the past that has to be eliminated and hence there comes in the 
        necessity of detachment even with regard to thought processes.<SPAN CLASS="note-tag"><A HREF="#n-6" NAME="t-6">6</A></SPAN></P>
        <P>There is, however, a notion in some philosophers — notably in 
        Krishnamurthy — that it is the faculty of memory as such, that is to be 
        blamed for man&#39;s psychological bondage.<SPAN CLASS="note-tag"><A HREF="#n-7" NAME="t-7">7</A></SPAN> 
        In an attempt to &quot;die to the past&quot; he seems to regard memory as the 
        villain-of-the-piece and advocate its obliteration while stressing the 
        necessity of awareness. This contrasts with the Buddhist approach 
        inasmuch as <I>sati,</I> which is a term for awareness or &quot;mindfulness,&quot;<SPAN CLASS="note-tag"><A HREF="#n-8" NAME="t-8">8</A></SPAN> 
        is also the usual term for &quot;memory.&quot; Thus, one comes across the 
        following standard definition of <I>satindriya</I> (the spiritual 
        faculty of mindfulness) in the Paali canon:</P>
         
           
             
              And what, monks, is the faculty of mindfulness? Herein, monks, a 
              noble disciple is mindful and is endowed with the highest prudence 
              in mindfulness; he is one who remembers and recollects even what 
              is done or said long ago. This, monks, is called the faculty of 
              mindfulness. 
                — S V 197 
             
           
         
        <P>This recognition of the essential relationship between mindfulness 
        and memory is understandable, since the keenness of the one naturally 
        leads to the clarity of the other. The denial of its rightful place to 
        the faculty of memory in the complex scheme of mental functions, might 
        even give rise to a schizophrenic condition. The noble disciple, 
        therefore, would not unscrupulously contradict himself or claim to have 
        &quot;forgotten&quot; what he has said and done earlier, on the flimsy ground of 
        his devotion to the practice of &quot;moment-to-moment awareness.&quot; On the 
        contrary, he might, without inhibition, even develop his faculty of 
        memory to such a degree that he could recollect his past lives and 
        experiences in all their major and minor details <I>(saakaara.m 
        sa-uddesa.m pubbenivaasa.m anussarati</I> [Saama~n~naaphala Sutta, D I 
        81]). What he aims at by his diligent practice of mindfulness is mastery 
        over the pathways of thought currents, as the concluding lines of 
        Vitakkasa.n.thaana Sutta (Discourse on the Adjustment of Thoughts) of 
        the Majjhima Nikaaya make it clear:</P>
         
           
             
              This monk is called, monks, &quot;a master of the pathways of thought 
              modes&quot; <I>(vasii vitakkapariyaayapathesu),</I> and whatever 
              thought he wishes to think, that he thinks; whatever thought he 
              does not wish to think, that he does not think. He has cut off 
              craving, turned back the fetter and by fully understanding 
              conceit, put an end to Ill. 
                — M I 122 
             
           
         
        <P>The most distinctive feature of the Buddha&#39;s solution to the 
        intricate problem of mindfulness and memory is the emphasis on 
        detachment. The elimination of the element of delight was the essential 
        condition to be fulfilled, and to this end he oriented his exhortations 
        to the monks so that often the finale turns out to be: &quot;Impermanent, O 
        monks, are formations. Unstable, O Monks, are formations. Unsatisfying, 
        O monks, are formations; so much so, monks, that this is enough for one 
        to turn away from all formations; enough to get detached from them; 
        enough to seek release from them.&quot;<SPAN CLASS="note-tag"><A HREF="#n-9" NAME="t-9">9</A></SPAN> 
        The theme of impermanence runs even through his contemplation of 
        mountains and rivers, which, for the average man, offer beautiful 
        landscapes and lasting landmarks. Indeed, this emphasis on utter 
        detachment based on the contemplation of universal impermanence is not 
        so marked in other systems of thought purporting to solve the above 
        problem; even in Krishnamurthy, too much stress is laid, for instance, 
        on the beauty of &quot;marvelous&quot; mountains, trees, rivers, and sunsets.<SPAN CLASS="note-tag"><A HREF="#n-10" NAME="t-10">10</A></SPAN></P>
        <P>It is also significant that the Buddhist scheme of mind-training, 
        while recognizing the role of mindfulness or awareness in the field of 
        sense-restraint, assigns the function of transcendence to the faculty of 
        wisdom <I>(pa~n~naa).</I> As such, it does not find itself in the 
        awkward position of being &quot;anti-memory&quot; and &quot;pro-awareness.&quot; Though <I>
        sati</I> is helpful in temporarily stemming the swift currents of 
        craving flowing in through the six sense-doors, the ultimate deliverance 
        of the mind is a matter for the penetrative faculty of <I>pa~n~naa</I> — 
        whetted, as it were, on the three signata. <I>Pa~n~naa</I> is the &quot;dam&quot; 
        wherefrom all currents turn back.</P>

        <P>As in case of the past, so with regard to future too, it is the 
        &quot;delight&quot; or &quot;desire-and-lust&quot; that gives rise to yearning or anxiety. 
        The aspiration for acquisition is the condition for delight in this 
        case, and in being delighted one is yearning for the future (see part 
        II). A simple expression of choice and wish in regard to future courses 
        of action in the everyday life of the arahant is not altogether denied. 
        But it is the attitude which makes all the difference between such 
        expressions and the hankerings and forebodings of a worldling relating 
        to an uncertain future. The arahant, as his epithet <I>taadi</I> 
        (such-like) suggests, is endowed with the highest adaptability and 
        resilience, due to his penetration into suchness <I>(tathataa).</I> For 
        him, anxiety and yearning with their corollaries vexation and 
        disappointment, simply do not exist.</P>

              If he does get anything (i.e., alms) he thinks: &quot;It is well,&quot; and 
              if he does not get anything, then also he thinks: &quot;It is good.&quot; In 
              both circumstances he is &quot;such&quot;; and he turns back like one who 
              went up to a tree (in search of fruits).

        particular. Though it does not occur in the canonical list of 33 
        epithets of Nibbaana (S IV 368 ff.), it is represented there by the term
        <I>dhuva.m</I> (the stable-state). Its significance, however lies mainly 
        in the nuances it conveys through the twin terms.</P>
        <P><I>Asa.mhiira</I> (grd. of <I>sa.m</I> + <I>vhr)</I> is a word often

        are some of the shades of meaning associated with the word. Hence <I>
        sa.mhiirati</I> (pass.) when used in the positive sense as in the prose 
        section of the sutta, would suggest the tendency to get attracted, 
        enticed or drawn into. In this specific context, the twenty types of 
        personality-view <I>(sakkaayadi.t.thi)</I> are interpreted as so many 
        ways of being drawn into involvement in regard to present phenomena. By 
        contrast, therefore, <I>asa.mhira.m,</I> in its reference to Nibbaana, 
        seems to emphasize the total absence of lust or attachment in that state 
        of supreme mental repose.</P>
        <P><I>Asa.mkuppa.m,</I> too, basically carries with it overtones of 
        stability, since the gerundive <I>kuppa</I> has such meanings as 
        &quot;movable; shakable; excitable; irritable.&quot; Not infrequently the verb <I>
        kuppati</I> is used with little or no emotional coloring, mostly with 
        reference to the behavior of inanimate things; and then it is simply 
        &quot;disturbance&quot; or &quot;shaking.&quot;<SPAN CLASS="note-tag"><A HREF="#n-16" NAME="t-16">16</A></SPAN> 
        But in the context of mental states, it is often associated with the 
        impulses of irritation or anger, particularly when prefixed with <I>
        sa.m.</I> And here, too, the same nuances are evident. The stability of 
        Nibbaana as a psychological state is as much due to the absence of 
        repulsion as to that of attraction.</P>
        <P>Out of the three roots of evil — greed <I>(lobha),</I> hate <I>
        (dosa),</I> and delusion <I>(moha)</I> — the first two indicate the 
        polarization of those psychological forces known as &quot;formations&quot; <I>
        (sankhaaraa).</I> Formations themselves spring from delusion or 
        ignorance<SPAN CLASS="note-tag"><A HREF="#n-17" NAME="t-17">17</A></SPAN> 
        which manifests itself primarily as personality-views. &quot;Herein, monks, 
        the uninstructed ordinary man... looks upon form as self. That very 
        &#39;looking upon&#39; <I>(samanupassanaa),</I> monks, is a formation <I>
        (sankhaaro)</I>&quot; (S III 96). In normal perception, it obtains as 
        &quot;attention&quot; <I>(manasikaara)</I> which, as a rule, is impelled by desire 
        or interest <I>(chanda).</I> The world of discrete objects over which 
        the range of perception extends, is the result of this beam of 
        attention, switched on, as it were, by interest. &quot;All phenomena, 
        friends, are rooted in desire (or interest); all phenomena are born of 
        attention; all phenomena arise from contact...&quot; (A V 106). The keener 
        the interest, the keener the attention; and both these factors introduce 
        a certain degree of tension into the perceptual situation, whereby all 
        other relative &quot;distractions&quot; are forcibly &quot;ignored.&quot; This tension, 
        force, stress, or strain involved in the process, renders all perception 
        more or less artificial and synthetic.<SPAN CLASS="note-tag"><A HREF="#n-18" NAME="t-18">18</A></SPAN> 
        Even in the most elementary form of perception, ignorance and craving 
        are already implicit. &quot;...But what is the cause, the arising, the origin 
        and the source of that formation? To the uninstructed ordinary man 
        touched by a feeling born of &#39;ignorance-contact,&#39; monks, there arises 
        craving; born thereof is that formation. Thus, monks, even that 
        formation is impermanent, compounded, dependently arisen. That feeling 
        too...That contact too... That ignorance too is impermanent, compounded, 
        dependently arisen&quot; (S III 96f.). In the very act of attending, 
        perception becomes blighted with an artificiality which estranges one 
        from reality.</P>
        <P>Since it is the formations themselves that are revealed in 
        sense-perception as attitudes of greed and hatred, delusion as the 
        seed-bed of formations, may rightly be regarded as the apex which 
        sustains both types of attitudes. This shows that in order to transcend 
        the above polarization, delusion too must be eliminated, together with 
        the formations springing therefrom. The two terms in our epithet 
        apparently do not say anything about this &quot;tertium-quid,&quot; but it is 
        already implicit in them as we have shown above. As such, the epithet 
        may be said to refer to that paradoxical <I>samaadhi</I> peculiar to 
        Buddhas and Arahants, which is known as <I>aanantarika</I><SPAN CLASS="note-tag"><A HREF="#n-19" NAME="t-19">19</A></SPAN> 
        (immediacy) or <I>arahattaphala samaadhi.</I> Some salient features of 
        this concentration find mention in the following canonical passages.</P>

        <P>One can form an idea of the range of meaning covered by the terms <I>
        asa.mhira.m</I> and <I>asa.mkuppam,</I> in the context of these two 
        passages. The reference to a non-establishment of consciousness inwardly
        <I>(ajjhatta.m asa.n.thita.m</I> — see <A HREF="#passage-a">A</A>) would 
        readily call to mind the definition of <I>sa.mhiirati</I> in the 
        Bhaddekaratta Sutta in terms of the twenty types of personality-views, 
        while the expression &quot;neither turned toward&quot; <I>(no ca abhinato</I> — 
        see <A HREF="#passage-b">B</A>) suggests the absence of an introvert 
        attitude which is not totally unrelated to the nuances of the term in 
        question. Similarly, the phrase &quot;... his consciousness will neither be 
        distracted or dissipated outwardly&quot; <I>(bahiddhaa cassa vi~n~naa.na.m 
        avikkhi.t.ta.m avisa.ta.m</I> — see <A HREF="#passage-a">A</A>) and the 
        expression &quot;nor turned outward&quot; <I>(na caapanato</I> — see
        <A HREF="#passage-b">B</A>) have much in common with <I>asa.mkuppa.m,</I> 
        though they stress, in particular, the absence of an extreme extrovert 
        attitude. The negation of the aforementioned &quot;tertium-quid,&quot; finds 
        expression in these two passages in the words: &quot;not grasping, he would 
        not be vexed <I>(anupaadaaya naparitasseyya</I> — see
        <A HREF="#passage-a">A</A>) and perhaps more clearly, in the rather 
        unwieldy compound which we sought to render by: &quot;...(that particular 
        concentration) which is not a form of restraint forcibly held in place 
        by formations&quot; <I>(na sasa&quot;nkhaaraniggayhavaaritavato</I> — see
        <A HREF="#passage-b">B</A>). This latter expression seems to suggest, by 
        contrast, that any makeshift compromise between the two extremes of 
        &quot;attraction&quot; and &quot;repulsion&quot;; of &quot;sympathy&quot; and &quot;antipathy&quot;; of 
        &quot;settling&quot; and &quot;distraction&quot; <I>(raaga-dosa;</I> <I>anunayapa.tigha;</I>
        <I>sa.mkhitta-vikkhitta)</I> — such as obtain in any worldly type of 
        concentration — is necessarily accompanied by mental synergies or 
        formations <I>(sankhaaraa).</I> These formations exercise such a 
        rigorous control over the concentration so much so that it might be 
        called a state of pent-up tension or stress, however subtle it may 
        appear. Hence, like all other phenomena which partake of a concocted and 
        compound character, worldly concentration, even at its best, can yield 
        only a &quot;peace-dependent-on-irritability&quot; <I>(kuppapa.ticcasanti;</I> Sn 
        v.784). That extraordinary concentration of the arahant, however, has 
        eliminated even this tertium-quid by the utter appeasement of all 
        formations <I>(sabbasa.mkharasamatha)</I> and is therefore known as the 
        &quot;unexcitable (or unshakable) deliverance of the mind&quot; <I>
        (aakuppaacetovimutti).</I> The appeasement of mental formations is 
        accompanied by the relinquishment of all &quot;assets&quot; or &quot;substrata&quot; <I>
        (sabbuupadhipa.tinissaggo)</I> which arrest and sustain attention. Yet 
        this paradoxical concentration does not lapse into a dull lethargy since 
        it has as its quasi-object of attention the very Nibbaanic peace of the 
        cessation of formations.<SPAN CLASS="note-tag"><A HREF="#n-20" NAME="t-20">20</A></SPAN> 
        For instance at A V 321 one finds the Buddha giving the following 
        explanation in response to Venerable AAnanda&#39;s query concerning the 
        possibility and nature of such a concentration:</P>
         
           
             
              Herein, AAnanda, a monk attends thus: &quot;This is peace, this is 
              excellent, that is to say, the appeasement of all formations, the 
              relinquishment of all assets (or substrata), the destruction of 
              craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbaana.&quot; Thus is it, AAnanda, 
              that there could be such an attainment of concentration for a 
              monk, in which he would not attend to the eye, nor to a form, nor 
              to the ear, nor to a sound, nor to the nose, nor to a smell, nor 
              to the tongue, nor to a flavor, nor to the body, nor to a 
              tangible, nor to earth, nor to water, nor to fire, nor to air, nor 
              to the sphere of infinity of space, nor to the sphere of infinity 
              of consciousness, nor to the sphere of nothingness, nor to the 
              sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, nor to this 
              world, nor to a world beyond. And whatever is seen, heard, sensed, 
              cognized, attained, sought after and traversed by the mind, even 
              to that he does not attend. But nevertheless, he does attend. 
                — A V 321
        <P>Transcending all polarities characteristic of the phenomenal 
        consciousness, the emancipated one thus attains to the highest possible

            him as a powerful paradox penetrating deep into his now-concentrated 
            mind, as he stood there precariously balanced on the bamboo-pole — a 
            question of life and death for him. No wonder that he attained

            perception is true of all &quot;formations&quot; born of ignorance. When the 
            scientist perceives of conceived matter as &quot;energy in a form of 
            stress,&quot; he is probably bringing out some shades of meaning of the 
            elusive term <I>sa.mkhaaraa.</I> But what is not so easily realized 
            is the fact that it is his own perception and conception — guided as 
            they are by interest and attention — which primarily accounts for 
            this &quot;energy&quot; and &quot;stress.&quot; At whatever level of perception he stops 
            to take his bearings and formulate his theory, it becomes for him 
            the &quot;point of contact&quot; <I>(phassa)</I> from which arises the &quot;thing&quot; 
            to be observed, while his interest and attention, design, 
            conglomerate, and agglutinate that &quot;thing&quot; under observation. It is 
            only when the beam of attention is switched off, as it were, by the 
            utter withdrawal of &quot;interest&quot; as in the case of the emancipated 
            ones, that the truth of voidness <I>(su~n~nataa)</I> will be 
            realized. </P>

              <P>Cf. Schopenhauer: &quot;The world can appear in its true color and 
              form, in its complete and correct significance, only when the 
              intellect, freed from willing, moves freely over objects, and yet 
              is energetically active without being spurred on by the will. This 
              is certainly contrary to the nature and destiny of the intellect; 
              thus it is to a certain extent unnatural and for this reason, 
              exceedingly rare. But it is precisely in this that the true nature 
              of genius lies; and in this alone does that stage occur in a high 
              degree and for some time, whereas in the rest it appears only 
              approximately and exceptionally...&quot;
