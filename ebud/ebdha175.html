    face="Times New Roman">uddhism is big news in America these days. Whether through a New
    York Times article carrying the Dalai Lama's latest remarks or a CNN spot on a political
    fund-raising scandal at a Taiwanese branch temple in Los Angeles, whether by seeing
    Bernardo Bertolucci's Little Buddha or following Tina Turner's life story in What Is Love
    Got to Do With It?, Americans have become more aware than ever before of something called
    &quot;Buddhism.&quot; But it is not only as interesting bits of cultural and political
    exotica that Buddhism has entered the American consciousness. Increasingly, Americans
    themselves are becoming Buddhists. Though precise statistics are impossible to come by,
    according to most estimates between one and two million Americans now consider themselves
    practicing Buddhists. American Buddhists are a far from homogeneous lot. The austere
    minimalism of a Zen meditation hall contrasts starkly with the riot of color in a Tibetan
    Buddhist center, and the mostly Caucasian crowd of baby boomers arriving for a talk on
    meditation at a Vipassana center outside San Francisco bears little resemblance to the
    multigenerational gathering of Thai Buddhists assembling in Chicago for a celebration of
    the Buddha's birth. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman">And there are conflicts, as
    well as contrasts, within Buddhist America. Like many other religious groups, Buddhists
    frequently find themselves divided by class, culture, or ethnicity. At an outdoor lecture
    by a famous Vietnamese monk, three Asian-American friends cluster together, feeling the
    not altogether friendly stares of the mostly Caucasian (and overwhelmingly vegetarian)
    crowd as they try to enjoy their hot dogs and potato chips. At a small Japanese-American
    Buddhist church, the parishioners chafe at the identity of the new minister appointed to
    serve them: a Caucasian man in his thirties, who converted to Buddhism only 10 years
    before. The differences can be fundamental. Writing in the Buddhist journal Tricycle,
    Victor Sogen Hori describes how, at the conclusion of a week-long Chinese-style Zen
    retreat he attended, the white American and ethnic Chinese Buddhists offered profoundly
    different views of their experience. One Chinese woman broke down in tears as she
    described the deep sense of shame and repentance she had felt over her selfishness. Her
    white American coreligionists were often impatient with such sentiments. These
    participants, Hori writes, &quot;spoke uniformly of how the long hours of meditation had
    helped them get in touch with themselves ... and assisted them in the process of
    self-realization.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">How, then, can we get our bearings in this new and
    confusing territory? For Americans, especially those raised as Christians, doctrine might
    seem the obvious place to start. Yet there are relatively few propositions that would be
    accepted by members of all Buddhist communities. That a person known as the Buddha had an
    experience of &quot;enlightenment,&quot; that we live not once but many times, and that
    our karma (which simply means &quot;actions&quot;) will have an effect on us in the
    future, are all ideas that would be accepted by most Buddhists. But beyond this minimal
    consensus, differences emerge almost immediately, including disagreements over such
    fundamental matters as which scriptures are really the word of the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist practices are diverse as well. While one group
    views meditation as essential, the next Insists that Buddhahood is accessible only through
    recitation of a certain mantra, and a third considers ritual empowerments by a guru to be
    required. Watching elderly Buddhists reverently offering small gifts of money or food to
    the Buddha in hopes of achieving a better rebirth, one realizes that in still other groups
    enlightenment, at least in this life, isn't the issue at all. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With some persistence, though, we can identify a few major
    fault lines within Buddhist America that can serve as basic points of orientation. First
    is the obvious distinction between those who were born into the faith and those who have
    become Buddhists by conversion. That the majority of &quot;hereditary Buddhists&quot; are
    Asian Americans is hardly surprising. Some observers have even argued that the fundamental
    divide within American Buddhism is a racial one, separating &quot;white&quot; and
    &quot;Asian&quot; practitioners. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The distinction is real, reflecting the perennial gap
    between the enthusiasm of the recent convert and the calm assurance of the hereditary
    believer as well as differences in cultural heritage. Yet recent converts to Buddhism are
    by no means all Caucasians. The membership rolls include African Americans and Latinos, as
    well as a few Asian-American &quot;re-converts&quot; who were raised in Christian or in
    nonreligious homes. To make sense of the landscape of Buddhist America, one must go beyond
    race and ethnicity to consider an entirely different factor: the ways in which these
    various forms of American Buddhism were transmitted to the United States. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>RELIGION TRANSMISSION</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Religions -- not just Buddhism -- travel in three major
    ways: as import, as export, and as &quot;baggage.&quot; (They may also be imposed by
    conquest, which, happily, is not a factor in this case.) Religions transmitted according
    to the &quot;import&quot; model are, so to speak, demand driven: the consumer (i.e., the
    potential convert) actively seeks out the faith. &quot;Export&quot; religions are
    disseminated through missionary activity, while &quot;baggage&quot; religions are
    transmitted whenever individuals or families bring their beliefs along when they move to a
    new place. It is these divergent styles of transmission, not matters of doctrine,
    practice, or national origin, that have shaped the most crucial differences within
    American Buddhism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To begin with the import type, consider a hypothetical
    example: a college student living in the Midwest in the 1950s finds a book on Zen Buddhism
    in the public library and thinks it's the greatest thing he's ever heard of. So he buys a
    plane ticket, heads off to Japan, and begins to study meditation in a Zen temple. After
    several years of practice and some firsthand experience of Buddhist &quot;awakening,&quot;
    he returns to the United States and establishes a Zen center, where he begins to teach
    this form of Buddhism to other Americans. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The important point to note here is that the importer (in
    this case, the college student) deliberately seeks out the product and takes the
    initiative to bring it home. But for this to happen, two crucial resources are required:
    money and leisure time. Buddhist groups of the import variety, in other words, can be
    launched only by those who have a certain degree of economic privilege. And not
    surprisingly, in these groups (as in other voluntary associations), like attracts like.
    Thus, the upper-middle-class status of the founders tends to be reflected in their
    followers, with such communities drawing a mostly well-educated, financially comfortable,
    and overwhelmingly European-American constituency. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A convenient label for the groups formed by the import
    process, then, would be &quot;Elite Buddhism.&quot; But this kind of Buddhism is more than
    a matter of socioeconomic background. At first glance, the groups belonging to this
    category would seem to span the full spectrum of Buddhist traditions: there are a number
    of schools of Tibetan Buddhism, various centers teaching meditation practices known as
    Vipassana (drawn primarily from Southeast Asia), and Japanese, Korean, and Chinese
    varieties of Zen. Yet a closer look reveals that what these groups all have in common is
    far more significant than the divergence in the sources of their inspiration. For the very
    names of two of these three types (Vipassana and Zen) mean &quot;meditation.&quot; On the
    level of practice, then, the most striking feature of Elite Buddhism in America is its
    emphasis on meditation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>MEDITATION</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation is, of course, part of the traditional
    repertoire of most (though not all) Asian Buddhist schools, at least for those who have
    undertaken a full-time monastic practice. What is distinctive about Elite Buddhism,
    however, is not its heavy emphasis on meditation but its scanting of other aspects of
    traditional Buddhism. For example, though monasticism has been the central Buddhist
    institution (and monastic life considered an essential prerequisite to enlightenment) in
    the vast majority of Buddhist countries, Elite Buddhists have been largely uninterested in
    becoming monks or nuns, preferring to see their Buddhist practice as a way of enhancing
    the quality of their lives as laypeople. While traditional Buddhists have spent a great
    deal of energy on activities that are best described as &quot;devotional,&quot; Elite
    Buddhists, many of them still fleeing the theistic traditions of their youth, have little
    patience with such practices. And while codes of ethics have played a central role in
    traditional Buddhist societies, they have had little appeal for Elite Buddhists, many of
    whom were drawn to Buddhism by what they saw as its promise of a more spontaneous life.
    Indeed, until fairly recently, when scandals involving sexual affairs and financial
    mismanagement in several American Tibetan and Zen communities forced some serious
    rethinking, ethical codes were given almost no attention in Elite Buddhist circles. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Elite Buddhism thus represents not simply an Asian
    religion transplanted to a new environment but a curious amalgamation of traditional
    Buddhist ideas and certain upper-middle-class American values--above all individualism,
    freedom of choice, and personal fulfillment. These &quot;nonnegotiable cultural
    demands&quot; have reshaped Buddhist ideas and practices in significant ways, yielding a
    genuinely new religious &quot;product&quot; uniquely adapted to certain segments of the
    American &quot;market.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The &quot;export&quot; process of transmission has
    produced American Buddhist groups of a strikingly different type. Because the transmission
    itself is underwritten by the home church, the potential convert does not need money,
    power, or time to come into contact with Buddhism of this sort, only a willingness to
    listen. Encounters with a missionary may take place on a street corner, in the subway, or
    even in one's home. Export religion is thus something of a wild card: it can attract a
    wide range of adherents, or it may appeal to no one at all. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>EVANGELICAL BUDDHISM</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since what fuels the formation of Buddhist groups of this
    type is energetic proselytizing, an appropriate label for such groups is &quot;Evangelical
    Buddhism.&quot; And one Buddhist organization in America, above all, fits this category:
    the Soka Gakkai International. This group (whose name means Value-Creating Study
    Association) began its life in Japan in the 1930s as a lay association devoted to
    spreading the teachings of the Nichiren Shoshu school. According to this school (one of
    the many strands of Mahayana Buddhism), all beings have the potential for Buddhahood, but
    this inherent Buddha-nature can only be made manifest through chanting of the mantra
    &quot;namu myoho renge kyo.&quot; These words--which literally mean &quot;homage to the
    Lotus Sutra,&quot; one of the most popular Buddhist scriptures in Japan--are believed to
    be powerful enough not just to change the practitioner's spiritual state but to improve
    his or her material circumstances as well. The Soka Gakkai, in other words, teaches a form
    of Buddhism in which both material and spiritual happiness can be attained not through
    many lifetimes of strenuous practice, or even weeks or months of meditation retreats, but
    through the daily recitation of a simple phrase. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Both the simplicity of the practice and the fact that this
    form of Buddhism addresses economic as well as spiritual needs has meant that the Soka
    Gakkai, from the time of its arrival in the United States during the 1950s, has had the
    potential to appeal to a very different, and far less privileged, audience than the Elite
    Buddhist traditions. Unlike the latter--most of whose members are college educated, with
    many holding graduate degrees--only about half of Soka Gakkai members have attended
    college, and barely a quarter hold bachelor's degrees. Statistics compiled by the Soka
    Gakkai itself show a wide range of educational levels and occupations; my own observations
    suggest a center of gravity in the lower-middle class. But it is in the ethnicity of its
    members that the distinctiveness of the Soka Gakkai is most obvious, for it has attracted
    a following that includes large numbers of Latinos, African Americans, and Asian Americans
    (not all of Japanese ancestry). According to a 1983 survey compiled by the organization
    itself, fully 55 percent of its members had non-European ethnic backgrounds. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fact that Evangelical Buddhism has undergone fewer
    changes in America than Elite Buddhism is the direct result of its mode of transmission.
    Because the Soka Gakkai was established by missionaries accountable to the home
    organization, its Japanese leadership has been able to limit the extent of its adaptation
    to American values. Indeed, one former member remarked that the only real difference
    between the American and the Japanese Soka Gakkai is that members in America usually sit
    on chairs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yet the remarkable success of the Soka Gakkai in the
    United States--at one point the organization claimed a membership of 500,000, though even
    Soka Gakkai officials now admit this figure was far too high--would not have been possible
    if its values had not harmonized with the aspirations of the audience it addressed. In
    particular, the Soka Gakkai has been able to tap into the &quot;American dream&quot; of
    upward mobility, a dream that has often been difficult to realize for those who find the
    obstacles of racism and exclusion in their path. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BAGGAGE BUDDHISTS</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally we come to the category of &quot;Baggage
    Buddhism&quot;--though perhaps we should have begun with this type, for here at last we
    meet with Buddhists who were simply born into the faith of their ancestors. Like Export
    Buddhism, this type involves travel to America by Buddhists from Asian countries, but the
    migration is not for religious purposes. Instead, these Buddhists (or their ancestors)
    came as immigrants to the United States to pursue economic opportunity, or, especially in
    the case of recent refugees from Southeast Asia, to escape persecution at home. Baggage
    Buddhists span the full range of schools and national origins, ranging from Theravadins
    from Cambodia to Mahayanists from Korea to Kalmyck Mongols of the Vajrayana school. But to
    the outsider, these organizations display remarkable similarities. Above all, they tend to
    be deliberately monoethnic in membership at the outset, for they serve not only religious
    purposes but operate as supportive community centers as well. Such temples may provide
    language lessons, a place to network for jobs, and above all a place to relax with others
    who share one's own cultural assumptions and to whom nothing needs to be explained. Though
    all Buddhists (of course) have their own ethnicity, it Is only in Buddhist groups of this
    type that ethnicity serves as the primary defining feature. This type can therefore be
    labeled &quot;Ethnic Buddhism.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism in America, at this stage in its history, thus
    includes participants of three quite different sorts. But though all would call themselves
    Buddhists, communication across (or even with in) these three categories is often
    difficult, even nonexistent. Within the Elite category we do find considerable exchange;
    it is not at all unusual for participants to move easily from Vipassana practice to
    Tibetan Buddhism to Zen. Yet Elite Buddhists do not accord the same acceptance to members
    of Evangelical and Ethnic Buddhist groups. Since they do not practice meditation -- so the
    reasoning goes -- members of these two latter groups cannot be considered
    &quot;genuine&quot; Buddhists. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such exclusion-by-definition has not, needless to say,
    been viewed kindly by those who are excluded--especially the Ethnic Buddhists, whose roots
    in the faith usually are many generations deep. But it is not only Elite Buddhists whose
    map of the Buddhist world renders other practitioners invisible. Evangelical Buddhists,
    too, operate on the basis of a narrow definition of &quot;true Buddhism&quot; (their
    expression), considering both Elite and Ethnic Buddhists to have missed something
    essential since they do not practice the chant taught by the Soka Gakkai. Ethnic Buddhists
    tend, in general, to be less critical of their coreligionists, in large part because they
    have not abbreviated the spectrum of &quot;real&quot; Buddhism so severely, retaining as
    they do a broad range of the moral, meditative, and ritual practices that have little
    incentive to communicate with other Ethnic Buddhist groups, precisely because part of
    their mission is to preserve their own distinctive culture. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even when attempts to cross the boundaries dividing these
    groups are made, the results can be discouraging. When Americans of non-Asian descent are
    drawn to Ethnic Buddhist temples, for example, the result is often what Paul Numrich of
    the University of Illinois calls, in Old Wisdom in the New World (1996), &quot;parallel
    congregations&quot;: rather than merging to form a single organization, Asian and
    non-Asian American Buddhists have often found their visions of Buddhism to be so
    incompatible that they simply meet at separate times in the same building. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Given these deep rifts within American Buddhism, we might
    well ask whether any of these subgroups will succeed in becoming a permanent part of the
    American religious landscape. For Ethnic Buddhists, the question is the one faced by all
    immigrants: will our children follow in our footsteps? For earlier generations of Asian
    immigrants, the value of remaining members of a religion viewed as &quot;deviant&quot; by
    mainstream society was not at all self-evident. Of the roughly 500,000 Japanese Americans
    in the United States today, for example, fewer than 20,000 are registered as members of
    the Buddhist Churches of America, the largest Japanese-American Buddhist organization in
    the country. The vast majority of Japanese Americans have either become Christians
    (virtually all of them Protestant) or claim no religious affiliation at all. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Things may be different today. Though Buddhists,
    especially Asian-American Buddhists, still encounter hostility and even violence in some
    parts of the country, the very fact that Buddhism is now relatively well known in the
    United States -- and even carries, in some circles, significant prestige -- may mean that
    more recent Asian Buddhist immigrants will view their ancestral religion as an asset, not
    a liability. So far, though, the evidence suggests that this may not be enough to stem the
    tide of religious assimilation. Ironically, recent Asian immigrants seem to be converting
    to Christianity (and increasingly its evangelical forms, as Stanford University religion
    professor Rudy Busto observed in Amerasia Journal last year) as rapidly as European
    Americans are becoming Buddhists. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For Evangelical Buddhists, the greatest challenge may
    arise not from circumstances in the United States but from events in Japan. In 1991, after
    years of wrangling between the Soka Gakkai and the Nichiren Shoshu priesthood, the Soka
    Gakkai was formally excommunicated by its parent organization. The real sources of the
    conflict appear to lie in a struggle between the priesthood and the lay organization for
    financial and political control, but each side has portrayed the dispute as resulting from
    the religious heresy and moral corruption of the other. The Soka Gakkai has attempted to
    take the rhetorical high road, likening its separation from the priesthood to the
    Protestant Reformation, but it remains to be seen whether its membership will find this
    representation convincing. While the American organization still seems viable, a serious
    decline in the number of subscribers to the organization's weekly newspaper (which in
    recent years has dipped below 40,000) suggests that the schism may have dealt it a painful
    blow. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Elite Buddhist groups, by contrast, would seem at
    first glance to be in good health: major bookstores offer entire shelves of publications
    on Tibetan Buddhism, Vipassana, and Zen, and mainstream newspapers and magazines
    frequently carry articles on the subject. So thoroughly do Elite Buddhist concerns (such
    as &quot;engaged Buddhism,&quot; much of it the result of Western social activism exported
    to Asia and subsequently re-exported to the West) dominate the media's picture of Buddhism
    that these groups often appear to be the only game in town. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yet Elite Buddhist groups have one striking demographic
    peculiarity: virtually all of the communities now in existence were formed by people who
    came of age during the late 1960s and early '70s, and members of succeeding age cohorts
    have joined in much smaller numbers. If such communities do not succeed in attracting
    younger members (and in retaining the children of the first-generation converts), they
    will soon fade from the American religious scene. History offers American Buddhists a
    chastening lesson. During the 1890s, the United States experienced a &quot;Buddhism
    boom&quot; not unlike that of today. The New York Journal reported that &quot;it is no
    uncommon thing to hear a New Yorker say he is a Buddhist nowadays,&quot; the historian
    Thomas Tweed writes in The American Encounter with Buddhism (1992). A number of Protestant
    ministers worried in print that their congregations might be attracted to this strange
    faith. Public interest was strong enough to provoke the Atlantic Monthly to run a feature
    article titled &quot;The Religion of Gotama Buddha.&quot; Yet by the early 1920s the boom
    was over, and Buddhism became all but invisible in American life save for a handful of
    Asian-American congregations. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If today's American Buddhists are to avoid the fate of
    their predecessors of a century ago, they must accomplish two things. First, they must
    move beyond the concept of Buddhism as a matter of individual &quot;religious
    preference,&quot; grounding it instead in the everyday practice of families and larger
    social networks. Second, they must create sturdy institutions to take the place of today's
    informal associations of like-minded practitioners. In dealing with the first necessity,
    Ethnic Buddhists, who have always seen their religion as a family affair, are clearly in
    the lead. The Evangelical Buddhists, with their ready-made organizational structures
    imported from Japan, may well have the edge in establishing institutions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ironically, it is the Buddhists we hear the most about in
    the American media--the Elite Buddhists--who have so far attracted the least diverse
    membership, and thus have the greatest challenges to overcome if they are to survive into
    the next generation. Yet each of the main branches of American Buddhism clearly has much
    to learn from the others if all three hope to continue to flourish on American soil./. </font></p>
