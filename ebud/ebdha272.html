      contemplate even a minute sector of life's vast range, we are faced with a 
      variety of living forms so tremendous that it defies all description. Yet 
      three basic features can be discerned as common to everything that has 
      animate existence, from the microbe to man, from the simplest sensations 
      to the thoughts of a creative genius:<BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>- impermanence or change (//anicca//);<BR>
        - suffering or unsatisfactoriness (//dukkha//);<BR>
        - non-self or insubstantiality (//anatta//).</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>These three basic facts were first found and formulated over 2,500 
      years ago by the Buddha, who was rightly called &quot;the Knower of the World&quot; 
      (//loka-vidu//). They are designated, in Buddhist terminology, the three 
      characteristics (ti-lakkhana) - the invariable marks or signs of 
      everything that springs into being, the &quot;signata&quot; stamped upon the very 
      face of life itself.</P>
      <P>Of the three, the first and third apply directly to inanimate existence 
      as well as to the animate, for every concrete entity by its very nature 
      undergoes change and is devoid of substance. The second feature, 
      suffering, is of course only an experience of the animate. But the Buddha 
      applies the characteristic of suffering to all conditioned things, in the 
      sense that, for living beings, everything conditioned is a potential cause 
      of experienced suffering and is at any rate incapable of giving lasting 
      satisfaction. Thus the three are truly universal marks pertaining even to 
      what is below or beyond our normal range of perception.</P>
      <P>The Buddha teaches that life can be correctly understood only if these 
      basic facts are understood. And this understanding must take place, not 
      only logically, but in confrontation with one's own experience. 
      Insight-wisdom, which is the ultimate liberating factor in Buddhism, 
      consists in just this experiential understanding of the three 
      characteristics as applied to one's own bodily and mental processes, and 
      deepened and matured in meditation.</P>
      <P>To see things as they really are means to see them consistently in the 
      light of the three characteristics. Not to see them in this way, or to 
      deceive oneself about their reality and range of application, is the 
      defining mark of ignorance, and ignorance is by itself a potent cause of 
      suffering, knitting the net in which man is caught - the net of false 
      hopes, of unrealistic and harmful desires, of delusive ideologies and of 
      perverted values and aims.</P>
      <P>Ignoring or distorting the three basic facts ultimately leads only to 
      frustration, disappointment and despair. But if we learn to see through 
      deceptive appearances, and discern the three characteristics, this will 
      yield immense benefits, both in our daily life and in our spiritual 
      striving. On the mundane level, the clear comprehension of impermanence, 
      suffering and non-self will bring us a saner outlook on life. It will free 
      us from unrealistic expectations, bestow a courageous acceptance of 
      suffering and failure, and protect us against the lure of deluded 
      assumptions and beliefs. In our quest for the supramundane, comprehension 
      of the three characteristics will be indispensable. The meditative 
      experience of all phenomena as inseparable from the three marks will 
      loosen, and finally cut, the bonds binding us to an existence falsely 
      imagined to be lasting, pleasurable and substantive. With growing clarity, 
      all things internal and external will be seen in their true nature: as 
      constantly changing, as bound up with suffering and as unsubstantial, 
      without an eternal soul or abiding essence. By seeing thus, detachment 
      will grow, bringing greater freedom from egoistic clinging and culminating 
      in Nibbana, mind's final liberation from suffering.</P>
