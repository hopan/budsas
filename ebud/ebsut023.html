<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
    What is the use of a raft? It is used for crossing over a
    vast expanse of water which is difficult otherwise to cross
    over. The close scrutiny of the application of this simile
    used by the Buddha in <b><i>Snake-simile (Alagaddupama) Sutta</i></b>,
    Discourse no. 22 in <b><i>Majjhima Nikaya</i></b> (The Middle
    Length Discourses), elucidates how skillfully he chose it to
    illustrate precisely what people, who don't fully comprehend
    the meaning of religions, have been doing throughout the
    history of religion. In this simile the Buddha pointed out
    that if a man who, after crossing over the vast expanse of
    water by a raft, were to determine to carry the raft over his
    shoulders, thinking by doing so he would show his gratitude
    to the raft for helping him to save his life, he would be
    foolish. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The simile of snake-catcher used by
    the Buddha in the aforementioned Sutta is also equally
    indispensable in illustrating the danger of the wrong grasp
    of a religion. If a man who does not know how to catch a
    poisonous snake were to hold the snake either by his body or
    by his tail he may get bitten by the snake and consequently
    suffer severe injury or death. The message in these two
    similes once realized fully would facilitate better
    understanding of the tension stems from the increase of
    violence and crime in the name of religion in modern society.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The wrong grasp of religion can
    lead man to justify his greed, hatred and foolishness. His
    distorted views, distorted perception and distorted
    consciousness force him to grasp a religion wrongly and
    undermine its very foundation, causing more pain and
    suffering -- as does the wrong grasp of the snake. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A wrong grasp of religion can
    always be a passageway to defeat the very purpose of religion
    and encourage people to commit atrocities in the name of
    one's faith. People sometimes not only cling to religions but
    naively obey any man or woman who, being a persuasive
    speaker, may promote and justify violence and unethical
    practices in the name of religion. By supporting such a
    person with their time, skill or wealth, they only increase
    his or her greed and hatred and ignorance. Blinded by
    religious beliefs they may even try over-zealously to protect
    their religions not only by inculcating hatred and fear in
    many of their gullible followers' minds, but also by
    advocating even murder in the name of their beliefs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If a man simply clings to the raft
    after using it to cross over the ocean, in stead of leaving
    it on the shore for someone else to use it, he will not do
    the wise thing either. He rather makes the raft a heavy
    burden on his shoulder. The raft is made out of reeds,
    sticks, branches and foliage. They are bound by a rope or
    bark of a tree. Similarly this body is made up of form,
    feeling, perception, mental formation and consciousness which
    are bound together by ignorance and desire to make body-mind
    complexity. Just as this man clings to the raft made up of
    reeds, sticks, branches and foliage we may cling to the body
    and mind made up of form, feeling, perception, mental
    formations and consciousness bound by craving and ignorance.
    The man clinging to the raft which helped him to cross over
    the vast expanse of water may continue to carry the burden of
    the very same raft. Similarly by clinging to our mind-body
    complexity and our religious beliefs we continue to carry
    their burden. He remains bound to his raft and we to the
    mind-body. He is on the shore and we are in Samsara. This
    body and mind, together with the feelings, perception and
    mental formations, exist not for clinging but only for
    gaining knowledge and insight necessary for attaining
    liberation from Samsara. &quot;Monks,&quot; said the Buddha,
    &quot;you should let go even (good) teaching, how much more
    false ones&quot;. Good teaching benefits us only if we use
    it, just like the raft. No teaching, however good it is, can
    help us if we simply cling to it. Clinging even to good
    teaching can cause pain and suffering. Just imagine how much
    more painful it could be when we cling to bad things! The man
    who uses a raft to cross over the body of water has to be
    wise. Similarly one who uses this body-mind complexity to
    cross over the ocean of Samsara has to be wise. Therefore he
    will not cling to this body-mind complexity at all. If he
    does he cannot attain enlightenment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Clinging to beliefs without
    practice can also easily make people religious fanatics who
    seek refuge in violence to resolve problems, for they are
    totally ignorant of what their religion teaches them. People
    who are unaware of the message of their religion may live in
    constant fear of criticism of their religion and wish to
    protect it by destroying people who have different beliefs.
    The fear of criticism arises in the mind ill-directed by the
    ambivalent belief system which cannot vouch for security and
    actuality. The Buddha said: &quot;Your ill-directed mind can
    do you more harm than all your enemies in the world together
    can do&quot;. Similarly, he said: &quot;A well directed mind
    can do you more good than all your parents, friends and
    relatives together can do for you&quot;. The real conqueror
    is not the one who conquers thousands upon thousands of
    people in a battle field but one who conquers himself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although Buddha never even implied
    causing harm to anybody, there are some even among the
    Buddhists who believe that they should protect their country,
    killing as many as they think necessary in order to protect
    Buddhism, the religion of peace, harmony, compassion and
    loving-kindness. Killing or even the thought of killing any
    living being, let alone human beings, is diametrically
    opposed to the teaching of the most compassionate and loving
    Buddha, who said: &quot;He is called virtuous and wise who,
    wishing success, does not commit crimes for the sake of
    oneself, for the sake of one's own children, for the sake of
    others, for the sake of wealth, or even for the sake of the
    country&quot; Buddha's teaching stands above all notions of
    countries, cultures, languages, ethnic affiliations and
    everything else, for he taught only the truth which is
    permanent, eternal and bound by nothing in the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you embark the raft you should
    check it very carefully to verify whether it is secure and
    properly put together, lest you may drown by using a
    defective raft. Similarly you should very carefully learn and
    critically examine any religion before accepting or rejecting
    it. Patient listening to someone criticizing the Buddha,
    Dhamma or the community of Sangha, is highly recommended in
    the teaching of the Buddha. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If for that others
        revile, abuse, scold and insult the Perfect One (Buddha),
        on that account, O monks, the Perfect One will not feel
        annoyance, nor dejection, nor displeasure in His heart.
        And if for that others respect, revere, honour and
        venerate the Perfect One, on that account the Perfect One
        will not feel delight, nor joy, nor elation in His heart.
        If for that other respect, revere, honour and venerate
        the Perfect One, He will think: 'It is towards this
        (mind-body aggregate) which was formerly fully
        comprehended, that they perform such acts. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, O monks, if you,
        too, are reviled, abused, scolded and insulted by others,
        you should on that account not entertain annoyance, nor
        dejection, nor displeasure in your hearts. And if others
        respect, revere, honour and venerate you, on that account
        you should not entertain delight nor joy nor elation in
        your hearts. If others respect, revere, honour and
        venerate you, you should think: 'It is towards this
        (mind-body aggregate) which was formerly comprehended,
        that they perform such acts'&quot;.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Analytical investigation and
    critical knowledge of Dhamma are essential factors of
    enlightenment in Buddhism. For if you know for sure that what
    you practice is true you should not be alarmed by criticism.
    You rather should be glad to welcome critical investigation
    of it so you can look at what you practice from different
    perspective. If you know gold as gold, for instance, you
    would without any hesitation let any well trained goldsmith
    test it by cutting, burning, rubbing and hammering it, for
    you are certain that he will not determine your gold to be
    copper. Only if you give him a gilded piece of lead saying
    that it is gold you would have reason to fear of his test. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha advised us not to be
    alarmed by criticism, but listen to criticism very carefully
    and mindfully without getting upset about what we hear and
    measure it by the text. After thorough investigation, we
    certainly find no fault in the Buddha, Dhamma or Sangha.
    However, we will find out that the criticism has come from
    anger, prejudice, frustration, fear, neuroses, paranoia, etc.
    Then, of course, instead of getting angry with the person who
    has all these problems, we should try to help him with
    loving-kindness. He deserves our loving-kindness and
    compassion rather than our hate. No hate is ever going to
    solve any problem in the world and it never did, for hate is
    never appeased by hatred in this world, but by love alone. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the teaching of the Buddha, one
    finds no room for resolving any problem through violent
    means. A Buddhist who is full of greed, hatred and delusion
    and unmindful of the Buddha's real message, exercising his
    total freedom of choice and responsibility guaranteed in
    Buddhism, may kill someone, but he can never quote any
    Buddhist text to justify and support his killing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We are supposed to use the Buddha
    Dhamma without clinging to it, but only to cross this cycle
    of birth and death -- Samsara. He advised us to use his
    teaching like a raft which is used only to cross a body of
    water not to cling to it. It is the passionate clinging to
    what we believe, rather than understanding how we should use
    it to guide our daily life in the right direction, that
    arouses our deeply rooted hatred which may force us to solve
    our problems through violent means. It is the passionate
    clinging to things that creates all kinds of problems. </font></p>
