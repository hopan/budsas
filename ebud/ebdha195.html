      <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>n the
        Yogacara (<em>Vijnanavada</em>) School of Buddhism, <em>alayavijnana</em>
        is one of the most important doctrines developed by Asanga (fourth
        century A.C.). He divides the <em>vijnanaskandha</em> (Aggregate of
        Conciousness) the fifth of the five <em>skandhas</em>, into three
        different aspects or layers, namely, <em>citta, manas </em>and <em>vijnana</em>.
        In the Theravada Tipitaka as well as in the Pali Commentaries, these
        three terms - <em>citta, manas, vijnana</em> - are considered as
        synonyms denoting the same thing. The <em>Sarvistivada</em> also takes
        them as synonyms. Even the <em>Lankavatarasutra</em>, which is purely a
        Mahayana text, calls them synonyms although their separate functions are
        mentioned elsewhere in the same sutra. Vasubandhu, too, in his <em>Vimsatikavijnapti-matratasiddhi</em>
        considers them as synonyms. Since any one of these three terms - <em>citta,
        manas, vijnanas</em> - represents some aspect, even though not all
        aspects, of the fifth Aggregate <em>vijnanaskandha</em>, they may
        roughly be considered as synonyms.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, for Asanga, <em>citta, manas</em>
        and <em>vijnana</em> are three different and distinct aspects of the <em>vyjnanaskandha</em>.
        He defines this Aggregate as follows:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">'What is the definition of the
          Aggregate of Consciousness (<em>vijnanaskandha</em>)? It is mind (<em>citta</em>),
          mental organ (<em>manas</em>) and also consciousness (<em>vijnana</em>).</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And there what is mind (<em>citta</em>)?
          It is <em>alayavijnana</em> (Store-Consciousness) containing all seeds
          (<em>sarvabijaka</em>), impregnated with the traces (impressions) (<em>vasanaparibhavita</em>)
          of Aggregates (<em>skandha</em>), Elements (<em>dhatu</em>) and
          Spheres (<em>ayatana</em>) ...</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">'What is mental organ (<em>manas</em>)?
          It is the object of <em>alayavijnana</em> always having the nature of
          self-notion (self-conceit) (<em>manyanatmaka</em>) associated with
          four defilements, viz. the false idea of self (<em>atmadrsti</em>),
          self-love (<em>atmasneha</em>), the conceit of 'I am' (<em>asmimana</em>)
          and ignorance (<em>avidya</em>) ...</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">'What is consciousness (<em>vijnana</em>)?
          It consists of the six groups of consciousness (<em>sad vijnanakayah</em>),
          viz. visual consciousness (<em>caksurvijnana</em>), auditory (<em>srotra</em>),
          olfactory (<em>ghrana</em>), gustatory (<em>jihva</em>), tactile (<em>kaya</em>),
          and mental consciousness (<em>manovijnana</em>) ...</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus we can see that <em>vijnana</em>
        represents the simple reaction or response of the sense-organs when they
        come in contact with external objects. This is the uppermost or
        superficial aspect or layer of the <em>vijnanaskandha</em>. <em>Manas</em>
        represents the aspect of its mental functioning, thinking, reasoning,
        conceiving ideas, etc. <em>Citta</em>, which is here called <em>alayavijnana</em>,
        represents the deepest, finest and subtlest aspect or layer of the
        Aggregate of Consciousness. It contains all the traces or impressions of
        the past actions and all good and bad future potentialities. The <em>Sandhinirmocana-sutra</em>
        also says that <em>alayavijnana</em> is called <em>citta </em>(Tibetan <em>sems</em>).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is generally believed that
        alayavijnana is purely a Mahayana doctrine and that nothing about it is
        found in Hinayana. But in the <em>Mahayanasangraha</em>, Asanga himself
        says that in the <em>Sravakayana</em> (= Hinayana) it is mentioned by
        synonyms (<em>paryaya</em>) and refers to a passage in the <em>Ekottaragama</em>
        which reads: <em>'People (praja) like the alaya (alayarata), are fond of
        the alaya (alayarama), are delighted in the alaya (alayasammudita), are
        attached to the alaya (alayabhirata). When the Dharma is preached for
        the destruction of the alaya, they wish to listen (susrusanti) and lend
        their ears (srotram avadadhanti), they put forth a will for the perfect
        knowledge (ajnacittam upasthapayanti) and follow the path of Truth
        (dharmanudharma-pratipanna). When the Tathagata appears in the world
        (pradurbhava), this marvellous (ascarya) and extraordinary (adbhuta)
        Dharma appears in the world.'</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lamotte identifies this <em>Ekottaragama</em>
        passage with the following passage in the Pali <em>Anguttaranikaya</em>
        (A II, p.131): <em>Alayarama bhikkhave paja alayarata alayasammudita, sa
        Tathagatena analaye dhamme desiyamane sussuyati sotam odahati annacittam
        upattapeti. Tathagatassa bhikkhave arahato sammasambuddhassa patubhava
        ayam pathamo acchariyo abbhuto dhammo patubhavat</em>i.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Besides this <em>Anguttara</em> passage,
        the term <em>alaya</em> in the same sense is found in several other
        places of the Pali Canon. The Pali Commentaries explain this term as
        'attachment to the five sense-pleasures&quot;, and do not go deeper than
        that. But this also is an aspect of the <em>alayavijnana</em>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <em>Lankavatarasutra</em> the
        term <em>tathagatagarbha</em> is used as a synonym for <em>alayavijnana</em>
        and is described as 'luminous by nature' (<em>prakrtiprabhasvara</em>)
        and 'pure by nature' (<em>prakrtiparisuddha</em>) but appearing as
        impure 'because it is sullied by adventitious defilements' (<em>agantuklesopaklistataya</em>).
        In the <em>Anguttaranikaya</em>, citta is described as 'luminous' (<em>pabhassara</em>),
        but it is 'sullied by adventitious minor defilements' (<em>agantukehi
        upakkilesehi upakkilittham</em>). One may notice here that <em>alaya-vijnana</em>
        (or <em>tathagatgarbha</em>) and <em>citta</em> are described almost by
        the same terms. We have seen earlier that the <em>Sandhi-nirmocana-sutra</em>
        says that <em>alayavijnana</em> is also called <em>citta</em>. Asanga
        too mentions that it is named <em>citta</em>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is this <em>alayavijnana</em> or <em>citta</em>
        that is considered by men as their &quot;Soul', 'Self', 'Ego' or
        'Atman'. It should be remembered as a concrete example, that <em>Sati</em>,
        one of the Buddha's disciples, took <em>vinnan</em> (<em>vijnana</em>)
        in this sense and that the Buddha reprimanded him for this wrong view.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The attainment of Nirvana is achieved by
        'the revolution of <em>alayavijnana</em>' which is called <em>asrayaparavrtti</em>.
        The same idea is conveyed by the expression <em>alayasamugghata</em> -
        'uprooting of alaya' - which is used in the Pali Canon as a synonym for
        Nirvana. Here it should be remembered, too, that <em>analaya</em>,
        'no-alaya', is another synonym for Nirvana.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <em>alayavijnanaparavrtti</em> is
        sometimes called <em>bijaparavrtti</em> - 'revolution of the seeds' - as
        well. <em>Bija</em> here signifies the 'seeds' of defilements (<em>samklesikadharmabija</em>)
        which cause the continuity of <em>samsara</em>. By the 'revolution of
        these seeds' one attains Nirvana. Again the Pali term <em>khinabija</em>,
        which is used to denote an arahant whose seeds of defilements are
        destroyed', expresses the same idea.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus one may see that, although not
        developed as in the Mahayana, the original idea of <em>alayavijnana</em>
        was already there in the Pali Canon of the Theravada./.</font></p>
