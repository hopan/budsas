    <p align="center"><strong><i>Homage to the Blessed One, <br>
    Accomplished and Fully Enlightened</i></strong> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><i>Anapana sati</i></strong><i>,</i> the
    meditation on in-and-out breathing, is the first subject of
    meditation expounded by the Buddha in the Maha Satipatthana
    Sutta, the Great Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness.
    The Buddha laid special stress on this meditation, for it is
    the gateway to enlightenment and Nibbana adopted by all the
    Buddhas of the past as the very basis for their attainment of
    Buddhahood. When the Blessed One sat at the foot of the Bodhi
    Tree and resolved not to rise until he had reached
    enlightenment, he took up anapana sati as his subject of
    meditation. On the basis of this, he attained the four
    jhanas, recollected his previous lives, fathomed the nature
    of samsara, aroused the succession of great insight
    knowledges, and at dawn, while 100,000 world systems
    trembled, he attained the limitless wisdom of a Fully
    Enlightened Buddha. </p>
    <p>Let us then offer our veneration to the Blessed One, who
    became a peerless world-transcending Buddha through this
    meditation of anapana sati. May we comprehend this subject of
    meditation fully, with wisdom resplendent like the sun and
    moon. Through its power may we attain the blissful peace of
    Nibbana. </p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">The Basic Text</font></h3>
    <p>Let us first examine the meaning of the text expounded by
    the Buddha on anapana sati. The text begins: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>&quot;Herein, monks, a monk who has gone
        to the forest, or to the foot of a tree, or to an empty
        place, sits down cross legged, holding his back erect,
        arousing mindfulness in front of him.&quot; </strong></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This means that any person belonging to the four types of
    individuals mentioned in this teaching -- namely, bhikkhu
    (monk), bhikkhuni (nun), upasaka (layman) or upasika
    (laywoman) -- desirous of practicing this meditation, should
    go either to a forest, to the foot of a secluded tree, or to
    a solitary dwelling. There he should sit down cross-legged,
    and keeping his body in an erect position, fix his
    mindfulness at the tip of his nose, the locus for his object
    of meditation. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>If he breathes in a long breath, he should
        comprehend this with full awareness. If he breathes out a
        long breath, he should comprehend this with full
        awareness. If he breathes in a short breath, he should
        comprehend this with full awareness. if he breathes out a
        short breath, he should comprehend this with full
        awareness. </strong></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>&quot;He breathes in experiencing the whole
    body, he breathes out experiencing the whole body&quot;</strong></em>:
    that is, with well-placed mindfulness, he sees the beginning,
    the middle and the end of the two phases, the in-breath and
    the out-breath. As he practices watching the in-breath and
    the out breath with mindfulness, he calms down and
    tranquilizes the two functions of in breathing and
    out-breathing. </p>
    <p>The Buddha illustrates this with a simile. When a clever
    turner or his apprentice works an object on his lathe, he
    attends to his task with fixed attention: in making a long
    turn or a short turn, he knows that he is making a long turn
    or a short turn. In the same manner if the practitioner of
    meditation breathes in a long breath he comprehends it as
    such; and if he breathes out a long breath, he comprehends it
    as such; if he breathes in a short breath, he comprehends it
    as such; and if he breathes out a short breath, he
    comprehends it as such. He exercises his awareness so as to
    see the beginning, the middle and the end of these two
    functions of breathing in and breathing out. He comprehends
    with wisdom the calming down of these two aspects of
    in-breathing and out-breathing. </p>
    <p>In this way he comprehends the two functions of
    in-breathing and out-breathing in himself, and the two
    functions of in breathing and out-breathing in other persons.
    He also comprehends the two functions of in-breathing and
    out-breathing in himself and in others in rapid alternation.
    He comprehends as well the cause for the arising of
    in-breathing and out-breathing, and the cause for the
    cessation of in breathing and out-breathing, and the
    moment-by-moment arising and cessation of in-breathing and
    out-breathing. </p>
    <p>He then realizes that this body which exercises the two
    functions of in-breathing and out-breathing is only a body,
    not an ego or &quot;I.&quot; This mindfulness and wisdom
    become helpful in developing greater and more profound
    mindfulness and wisdom, enabling him to discard the erroneous
    conceptions of things in terms of &quot;I&quot; and
    &quot;mine.&quot; He then becomes skilled in living with
    wisdom in respect of this body and he does not grasp anything
    in the world with craving, conceit or false views. Living
    unattached, the meditator treads the path to Nibbana by
    contemplating the nature of the body. </p>
    <p>This is an amplified paraphrase of the passage from the
    Maha Satipatthana Sutta on anapana sati. This meditation has
    been explained in sixteen different ways in various suttas.
    Of these sixteen, the first tetrad has been explained here.
    But these four are the foundation for all the sixteen ways in
    which anapana sati can be practiced. </p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">The Preliminaries of Practice</font></h3>
    <p>Now we should investigate the preliminary stages to
    practicing this meditation. In the first place the Buddha
    indicated a suitable dwelling for practicing anapana sati. In
    the sutta he has mentioned three places: the forest, the foot
    of a tree, or an isolated empty place. This last can be a
    quiet restful hut, or a dwelling place free from the presence
    of people. We may even consider a meditation hall an empty
    place. Although there may be a large collection of people in
    such a hall, if every one remains calm and silent it can be
    considered an empty place. </p>
    <p>The Buddha recommended such places because in order to
    practice anapana sati, silence is an essential factor. A
    beginning meditator will find it easier to develop mental
    concentration with anapana sati only if there is silence.
    Even if one cannot find complete silence, one should choose a
    quiet place where one will enjoy privacy. </p>
    <p>Next the Buddha explained the sitting posture. There are
    four postures which can be adopted for meditation: standing,
    sitting, reclining and walking. Of these the most suitable
    posture to practice anapana sati at the beginning is the
    seated posture. </p>
    <p>The person wishing to practice anapana sati should sit
    down cross-legged. For bhikkhus and laymen, the Buddha has
    recommended the cross-legged position. This is not an easy
    posture for everyone, but it can be gradually mastered. The
    half cross-legged position has been recommended for
    bhikkhunis and laywomen. This is the posture of sitting with
    one leg bent. It would be greatly beneficial if the cross
    legged posture recommended for bhikkhus and laymen could be
    adopted in the &quot;lotus&quot; pattern, with the feet
    turned up and resting on the opposite thighs. If that is
    inconvenient, one should sit with the two feet tucked
    underneath the body. </p>
    <p>In the practice of anapana sati, it is imperative to hold
    the body upright. The torso should be kept erect, though not
    strained and rigid. One can cultivate this meditation
    properly only if all the bones of the spine are linked
    together in an erect position. Therefore, this advice of the
    Buddha to keep the upper part of the body erect should be
    clearly comprehended and followed. </p>
    <p>The hands should be placed gently on the lap, the back of
    the right hand over the palm of the left. The eyes can be
    closed softly, or left half-closed, whichever is more
    comfortable. The head should be held straight, tilted a
    slight angle downwards, the nose perpendicular to the navel </p>
    <p>The next factor is the place for fixing the attention. To
    cultivate anapana sati one should be clearly mindful of the
    place where the incoming and outgoing breaths enter and leave
    the nostrils. This will be felt as a spot beneath the
    nostrils or on the upper lip, wherever the impact of the air
    coming in and out the nostrils can be felt most distinctly.
    On that spot the attention should be fixed, like a sentry
    watching a gate. </p>
    <p>Then the Buddha has explained the manner in which anapana
    sati has to be cultivated. One breathes in mindfully,
    breathes out mindfully. From birth to death this function of
    in-breathing and out-breathing continues without a break,
    without a stop, but since we do not consciously reflect on
    it, we do not even realize the presence of this breath. If we
    do so, we can derive much benefit by way of calm and insight.
    Thus the Buddha has advised us to be aware of the function of
    breathing. </p>
    <p>The practitioner of meditation who consciously watches the
    breath in this manner should never try to control his
    breathing or hold back his breath with effort. For if he
    controls his breath or holds back his breath with conscious
    effort, he will become fatigued and his mental concentration
    will be disturbed and broken. The key to the practice is to
    set up mindfulness naturally at the spot where the in-breaths
    and the out-breaths are felt entering and leaving the
    nostrils. Then the meditator has to maintain his awareness of
    the touch sensation of the breath, keeping the awareness as
    steady and consistent as possible. </p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">The Eight Steps</font></h3>
    <p>To help practitioners in developing this meditation, the
    commentators and meditation masters have indicated eight
    graduated steps in the practice. These eight steps will first
    be enumerated, and then they will be explained in relation to
    the actual meditative process. </p>
    <p>The eight steps are named: <strong>counting</strong> <i>(ganana)</i>;
    <strong>following</strong> <i>(anubandhana)</i>; <strong>contact</strong>
    <i>(phusana)</i>; <strong>fixing</strong> <i>(thapana)</i>; <strong>observing</strong>
    <i>(sallakkhana)</i>; <strong>turning away</strong> <i>(vivattana)</i>,
    <strong>purification</strong> <i>(parisuddhi)</i>; and <strong>retrospection</strong>
    <i>(patipassana)</i>. These eight cover the whole course of
    meditative development up to the attainment of arahatship. </p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>(i) Counting</b></font></p>
    <p>Counting is intended for those who have never before
    practiced anapana sati. It is not necessary for those who
    have practiced meditation for a considerable period of time.
    However, as it is expedient to have a knowledge of this,
    counting should be understood in the following manner. </p>
    <p>When the meditator sits down for meditation, he fixes his
    attention at the tip of his nose and consciously attends to
    the sequence of in-and-out breathing. He notes the breath as
    it enters, and notes the breath as it leaves, touching
    against the tip of the nose or the upper lip. At this time he
    begins to count these movements. </p>
    <p>There are a few methods of counting. The easiest is
    explained thus: The first breath felt is counted as
    &quot;one, one&quot;; the second as &quot;two, two&quot;; the
    third as &quot;three, three&quot;; the fourth as &quot;four,
    four&quot;; the fifth as &quot;five, five&quot; and so on up
    to the tenth breath which is counted as &quot;ten, ten.&quot;
    Then he returns to &quot;one, one&quot; and continues again
    up to &quot;ten, ten.&quot; This is repeated over and over
    from one to ten. </p>
    <p>The mere counting is not itself meditation, but the
    counting has become an essential aid to meditation. A person
    who has not practiced meditation before, finding it difficult
    to understand the nature of his mind, may think he is
    meditating while his mind runs helter skelter. Counting is an
    easy method to control the wandering mind. </p>
    <p>If a person fixes his mind well on his meditation, he can
    maintain this counting correctly. If the mind flees in all
    directions, and he misses the count, he becomes confused and
    thus can realize that his mind has wandered about. If the
    mind has lost track of the count, the meditator should begin
    the counting over again. In this way he should start the
    counting again from the beginning, even if he has gone wrong
    a thousand times. </p>
    <p>As the practice develops, there may come a time when the
    in-breathing and out breathing take a shorter course and it
    is not possible to count the same number many times. Then the
    meditator has to count quickly &quot;one,&quot;
    &quot;two,&quot; &quot;three,&quot; etc. When he counts in
    this manner he can comprehend the difference between a long
    in-breath and out-breath and a short in-breath and
    out-breath. </p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>(ii) Following</b></font></p>
    <p>&quot;Following&quot; means following the breath with the
    mind. When the mind has been subdued by counting and is fixed
    on the in-breathing and out-breathing, the counting is
    stopped and replaced by mentally keeping track of the course
    of the breath. This is explained by the Buddha in this
    manner: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>&quot;When the meditator breathes in a
        long breath, he comprehends that he is breathing in a
        long breath; and when he is breathing out a long breath,
        he comprehends that he is breathing out a long
        breath.&quot; </strong></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Herein, one does not deliberately take a long in-breath or
    a long out-breath. One simply comprehends what actually takes
    place. </p>
    <p>The Buddha has declared in the next passage that a
    meditator trains himself thinking: &quot;I shall breathe in
    experiencing the whole body, and I shall breath out
    experiencing the whole body.&quot; Here, what is meant as
    &quot;the whole body&quot; is the entire cycle of breathing
    in and breathing out. The meditator should fix his attention
    so as to see the beginning, the middle and the end of each
    cycle of in-breathing and out-breathing. It is this practice
    that is called &quot;experiencing the whole body.&quot; </p>
    <p>The beginning, middle and end of the breath must be
    correctly understood. It is incorrect to consider the tip of
    the nose to be the beginning of the breath, the chest to be
    the middle, and the navel to be the end. If one attempts to
    trace the breath from the nose through the chest to the
    belly, or to follow it out from the belly through the chest
    to the nose, one's concentration will be disrupted and one's
    mind will become agitated. The beginning of the in-breath,
    properly understood, is the start of the inhalation, the
    middle is continued inhalation, and the end is the completion
    of the inhalation. Likewise, in regard to the out breath, the
    beginning is the start of the exhalation, the middle is the
    continued exhalation, and the end is the completion of the
    exhalation. To &quot;experience the whole body&quot; means to
    be aware of the entire cycle of each inhalation and
    exhalation, keeping the mind fixed at the spot around the
    nostrils or on the upper lip where the breath is felt
    entering and leaving the nose. </p>
    <p>This work of contemplating the breath at the area around
    the nostrils, without following it inside and outside the
    body, is illustrated by the commentaries with the similes of
    the gatekeeper and the saw. </p>
    <p>Just as a gatekeeper examines each person entering and
    leaving the city only as he passes through the gate, without
    following him inside or outside the city, so the meditator
    should be aware of each breath only as it passes through the
    nostrils, without following it inside or outside the body. </p>
    <p>Just as a man sawing a log will keep his attention fixed
    on the spot where the teeth of the saw cut through the wood,
    without following the movement of the teeth back and forth,
    so the meditator should contemplate the breath as it swings
    back and forth around the nostrils, without letting his
    mindfulness be distracted by the breath's inward and outward
    passage through the body. </p>
    <p>When a person meditates earnestly in this manner, seeing
    the entire process, a joyous thrill pervades his mind. And
    since the mind does not wander about, the whole body becomes
    calm and composed, cool and comfortable. </p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>(iii) Contact and (iv) Fixing</b></font></p>
    <p>These two aspects of the practice indicate the development
    of stronger concentration. When the mindfulness of breathing
    is maintained, the breathing becomes more and more subtle and
    tranquil. As a result the body becomes calm and ceases to
    feel fatigued. Bodily pain and numbness disappear, and the
    body begins to feel an exhilarating comfort, as if it were
    being fanned with a cool gentle breeze. </p>
    <p>At that time, because of the tranquillity of the mind, the
    breathing becomes finer and finer until it seems that it has
    ceased. At times this condition lasts for many minutes. This
    is when breathing ceases to be &quot;felt&quot;. At this time
    some be come alarmed thinking the breathing has ceased, but
    it is not so. The breathing exists but in a very delicate and
    subtle form. No matter how subtle the breathing becomes, one
    must still keep mindful of the contact <i>(phusana)</i> of
    the breath in the area of the nostrils, without losing track
    of it. The mind then becomes free from the five hindrances --
    sensual desire, anger, drowsiness, restlessness and doubt. As
    a result one becomes calm and joyful. </p>
    <p>It is at this stage that the &quot;<strong>signs</strong>&quot;
    or mental images appear heralding the success of
    concentration. First comes the <strong>learning sign </strong><i>(uggaha-nimitta)</i>,
    then the <strong>counterpart sign</strong> <i>(patibhaga-nimitta)</i>.
    To some the sign appears like a wad of cotton, like an
    electric light, a sliver chain, a mist or a wheel. It
    appeared to the Buddha like the clear and bright midday sun. </p>
    <p>The learning sign is unsteady, it moves here and there, up
    and down. But the counterpart sign appearing at the end of
    the nostrils is steady, fixed and motionless. At this time
    there are no hindrances, the mind is most active and
    extremely tranquil. This stage is expounded by the Buddha
    when he states that one breathes in tranquilizing the
    activity of the body, one breathes out tranquilizing the
    activity of the body. </p>
    <p>The arising of the counterpart sign and the suppression of
    the five hindrances marks the attainment of <strong>access
    concentration</strong> <i>(upacara-samadhi)</i>. As
    concentration is further developed, the meditator attains <strong>full
    absorption</strong> <i>(appana-samadhi)</i> beginning with
    the first jhana. Four stages of absorption can be attained by
    the practice of anapana sati, namely, the first, second,
    third and fourth jhanas. These stages of deep concentration
    are called &quot;fixing&quot; <i>(thapana)</i>. </p>
    <p><font color="#800000"><b>(v) Observing -- (viii)
    Retrospection</b></font></p>
    <p>A person who has reached jhana should not stop there but
    should go on to develop insight meditation <i>(vipassana)</i>.
    The stages of insight are called &quot;observing&quot; <i>(sallakkhana)</i>.
    When insight reaches its climax, the meditator attains the
    supramundane paths, starting with the stage of stream entry.
    Because these paths turn away the fetters that bind one to
    the cycle of birth and death, they are called &quot;turning
    away&quot; <i>(vivattana)</i>. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The paths are followed by their respective fruitions; this
    stage is called &quot;<strong>purification</strong>&quot; <i>(parisuddhi)</i>
    because one has been cleansed of defilements. Thereafter one
    realizes the final stage, reviewing knowledge, called
    retrospection <i>(patipassana)</i> because one looks back
    upon one's entire path of progress and one's attainments.
    This is a brief overview of the main stages along the path to
    Nibbana, base on the meditation of anapana sati. Now let us
    examine the course of practice in terms of the seven stages
    of purification. </p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">The Seven Stages of Purification</font></h3>
    <p>The person who has taken up the practice begins by
    establishing himself in a fitting moral code. If he is a
    layman, he first establishes himself in the five precepts or
    the ten precepts. If he is a bhikkhu, he begins his
    meditation while scrupulously maintaining the moral code
    prescribed for him. The unbroken observance of his respective
    moral code constitutes <strong>purification of morality</strong>
    <i>(sila-visuddhi)</i>. </p>
    <p>Next, he applies himself to his topic of meditation, and
    as a result, the hindrances become subjugated and the mind
    becomes fixed in concentration. This is <strong>purification
    of mind</strong> <i>(citta-visuddhi)</i> -- the mind in which
    the hindrances have been fully suppressed -- and this
    includes both access concentration and the four jhanas. </p>
    <p>When the meditator becomes well established in
    concentration, he next turns his attention to insight
    meditation. To develop insight on the basis of anapana sati,
    the meditator first considers that this process of in-and-out
    breathing is only form, a series of bodily events -- not a
    self or ego. The mental factors that contemplate the
    breathing are in turn only mind, a series of mental events --
    not a self or ego. This discrimination of mind and matter <i>(nama-rupa)</i>
    is called <strong>purification of view</strong> <i>(ditthi-visuddhi)</i>.
    </p>
    <p>One who has reached this stage comprehends the process of
    in-and-out breathing by way of the conditions for the arising
    and cessation of the bodily and mental phenomena involved in
    the process of breathing. This knowledge, which becomes
    extended to all bodily and mental phenomena in terms of their
    dependent arising, is called the comprehension of conditions.
    As his understanding matures, all doubts conceived by him in
    respect of past, future and present times are dispelled. Thus
    this stage is called &quot;<strong>purification by the
    transcending of doubt</strong>.&quot; </p>
    <p>After having, understood the causal relations of mind and
    matter, the meditator proceeds further with insight
    meditation, and in time there arises the wisdom &quot;seeing
    the rise and fall of things.&quot; When he breathes in and
    out, he sees the bodily and mental states pass in and out of
    existence moment after moment. As this wisdom becomes
    clearer, the mind becomes illumined and happiness and
    tranquillity arise, along with faith, vigour, mindfulness,
    wisdom and equanimity. </p>
    <p>When these factors appear, he reflects on them, observing
    their three characteristics of impermanence, suffering and
    egolessness. The wisdom that distinguishes between the
    exhilarating results of the practice and the task of detached
    contemplation is called &quot;<strong>purification by
    knowledge and vision of the true path and the false path</strong>.&quot;
    His mind, so purified, sees very clearly the rise and
    cessation of mind and matter. </p>
    <p>He sees next, with each in-breath and out-breath, the
    breaking up of the concomitant mental and bodily phenomena,
    which appears just like the bursting of the bubbles seen in a
    pot of boiling rice, or like the breaking up of bubbles when
    rain falls on a pool of water, or like the cracking of
    sesamum or mustard seeds as they are put into a red-hot pan.
    This wisdom which sees the constant and instantaneous
    breaking up of mental and bodily phenomena is called &quot;<strong>the
    knowledge of dissolution.</strong>&quot; Through this wisdom
    he acquires the ability to see how all factors of mind and
    body throughout the world arise and disappear. </p>
    <p>Then there arises in him the wisdom that sees all of these
    phenomena as a fearsome spectacle. He sees that in none of
    the spheres of existence, not even in the heavenly planes, is
    there any genuine pleasure or happiness, and he comprehends
    misfortune and danger. </p>
    <p>Then he conceives a revulsion towards all conditioned
    existence. He arouses an urge to free himself from the world,
    an all consuming desire for deliverance. Then, by considering
    the means of releasing himself, there arises in him a state
    of wisdom which quickly reflects on impermanence, suffering
    and egolessness, and leads to subtle and deep levels of
    insight. </p>
    <p>Now there appears in him the comprehension that the
    aggregates of mind and body appearing in all the world
    systems are afflicted by suffering, and he realizes that the
    state of Nibbana, which transcends the world, is exceedingly
    peaceful and comforting. When he comprehends this situation,
    his mind attains the knowledge of equanimity about
    formations. This is the climax of insight meditation, called
    &quot;<strong>purification by knowledge and vision of progres</strong>s.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>As he becomes steadfast, his dexterity in meditation
    increases, and when his faculties are fully mature he enters
    upon the cognitive process of the path of <strong>stream-entry</strong>
    <i>(sotapatti)</i>. With the path of stream-entry he realizes
    Nibbana and comprehends directly the Four Noble Truths. The
    path is followed by two or three moments of the fruit of
    stream-entry, by which he enjoys the fruits of his
    attainment. Thereafter there arises reviewing knowledge by
    which he reflects on his progress and attainment. </p>
    <p>If one continues with the meditation with earnest
    aspiration, one will develop anew the stages of insight
    knowledge and realize the three higher paths and fruits:
    those of the once-returner, non-returner, and arahant. These
    attainments, together with stream-entry, form the seventh
    stage of purity, purification by knowledge and vision. With
    each of these attainments one realizes in full the Four Noble
    Truths , which had eluded one throughout one's long sojourn
    in the cycle of rebirths. As a result, all the defilements
    contained within the mind are uprooted and destroyed, and
    one's mind becomes fully pure and cleansed. One then realizes
    the state of Nibbana, wherein one is liberated from all the
    suffering of birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation,
    pain, grief and despair. </p>
    <h3><font color="#000080">Conclusion</font></h3>
    <p>Births like ours are rare in samsara. We have been
    fortunate to encounter the Buddha's message, to enjoy the
    association of good friends, to have the opportunity to
    listen to the Dhamma. As we have been endowed with all these
    blessings, if our aspirations are ripe, we can in this very
    life reach the final goal of Nibbana through its graduated
    stages of stream entry, once-returner, non-returner and
    arahatship. Therefore, let us make our life fruitful by
    developing regularly the meditation of anapana sati. Having
    received proper instructions on how to practice this method
    of meditation, one should purify one's moral virtue by
    observing the precepts and should surrender one's life to the
    Triple Gem. </p>
    <p>One should choose a convenient time for meditation and
    practice with utmost regularity, reserving the same period
    each day for one's practice. One may begin by briefly
    reflecting on the abundant virtues of the Buddha, extending
    loving-kindness towards all beings, pondering the
    repulsiveness of the body, and considering the inevitability
    of death. Then, arousing the confidence that one is walking
    the very road to Nibbana walked by all the enlightened ones
    of the past, one should proceed forth on the path of
    meditation and strive with diligent effort. </p>
