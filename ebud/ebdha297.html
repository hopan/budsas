        <P><I>Excerpts from an inspirational discourse by Ven. Ajahn Brahmavamso 
        (Abbot of Bodhinyana Monastry in Western Australia) at Maharagama 
        Vajiraghnana Dharmayathanaya on Sunday 13th February 2005. </I></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT SIZE="6">I </FONT>knew an American who wanted to become a 
      Buddhist monk. He heard that in Thailand he could get ordained. </P>
      <P>So he went to Thailand and put up in a small hotel in Bangkok. But he 
      did not know where to go to get the ordination. So he asked a person (a 
      helper) working in the hotel where to go to get ordained as a Buddhist 
      monk. </P>
      <P>The helper of the hotel told him to go to Wat Pho temple in Bangkok 
      (where men in Bangkok went to get temporary ordination). He told the 
      American &quot;go early in the morning and offer some fruits to a monk who will 
      come for morning alms and ask for ordination. Then he will ordain you&quot;.
      </P>
      <P>Accordingly the American went out early next morning to the temple with 
      some fruit to offer to the first monk who would come. In his haste he had 
      gone very early, at about 04.30 a.m. </P>
      <P>The gates of the temple were locked. So he started to pace up and down 
      near the entrance until the monks would come out from where they were 
      meditating in the forest nearby, for their morning alms. </P>
      <P>As he was pacing to and fro, a Thai man dressed in oriental attire came 
      up to him and asked him in perfect English what he was about. </P>
      <P>When he had said what he was about, the Thai man told him &quot;I will take 
      you inside and show you the inside of the temple&quot;. He then took a bunch of 
      large keys from his waist and opened the iron gate. Then asking the 
      American to follow him, he went up to the main door of the temple and 
      opened it with a key from the bundle he had. </P>
      <P>As he went in he switched on the lights, and the American saw a most 
      beautiful shrine room with very bright pictures adorning the walls. He 
      took the American to each one of the pictures and explained what each one 
      meant. </P>
      <P>After conducting him around the shrine room in this manner, he then 
      switched off the lights and locked up the door. After coming out he told 
      the American, now it is almost the time that the monks will come out for 
      their morning alms, offer your fruit and ask to be ordained. He then went 
      out of the temple and disappeared. </P>
      <P>After a while the American saw a monk appearing with a begging bowl. He 
      went up to the monk offered the fruit and asked to be ordained. The monk 
      accepted the fruit and the American was ordained. Unfortunately for the 
      American (who was now a monk) the Thai monks in the temple where he stayed 
      spoke very little or no English. </P>
      <P>After staying in the temple for a while, he one day asked leave of his 
      teacher to go to another monk who knew better English for instructions. 
      Then his teacher said that there was no other monk who could speak better 
      English. He himself spoke the best English in the place. </P>
      <P>Then the American monk remembered the Thai man whom he met before he 
      asked for ordination. He told his teacher &quot;There was a man I met here on 
      the day I asked to be ordained who spoke perfect English, could I not seek 
      his services as a translator?&quot;. The teacher was a bit surprised and asked 
      details of this man from his pupil. </P>
      <P>After listening to the story, he said &quot;That is impossible! only the 
      Sangha-Raja of Thailand has the keys to that shrine room. That is the 
      place where the kings come for temporary ordination.&quot; So the American monk 
      was taken to the Sangha-Raja of Thailand and asked to narrate the story 
      once again. When he described the pictures and the stories he heard 
      relating to the pictures inside the shrine room, the Sangha-Raja could not 
      doubt his story. He was taken inside the shrine room to narrate the story 
      and was asked how the Thai man had looked. </P>
      <P>On looking around the pictures on the wall once more, the American monk 
      saw to his surprise that the picture of the man he saw was adorning the 
      wall. He pointed to the picture and said &quot;that is the man&quot;. </P>
      <P>It was the picture of King Rama I who had passed away many years ago. 
      As such it was established that the American monk had met a God or Devatha 
      who was formerly the King Rama I of Thailand who had also built that 
      temple. </P>
      <P>I have known this American monk, and I know that this story is true. 
      Therefore it is true that there are Gods, It is true that they exist, even 
      today. Not only in Thailand, but in Sri Lanka as well, even in Australia 
      where I live presently. </P>
      <B>
      <P>A personal experience </P>
      </B>
      <P>I can tell you another story, a personal experience of mine in recent 
      times. The Buddhist Society of Western Australia was getting ready for 
      Vesak Celebrations one day. </P>
      <P>Preparations got underway to hold open air celebrations in the night on 
      Vesak day at a Central location in Perth. With just a few days to go we 
      got to hear that the weather forecast was not good for Vesak day and 
      night. It was forecasted that there would be severe storms. </P>
      <P>As the days closed in the people who got together to organize the show 
      were very doubtful of going ahead. Many requests came to me as president 
      of the Buddhist Society of Perth to cancel it. </P>
      <B>
      <P>Continued faith </P>
      </B>
      <P>We had invited the Prime Minister to come as a special invitee amongst 
      many other special guests. There were many calls asking me whether it 
      would not be cancelled. But I continued to have faith. </P>
      <P>Though people were surprised at my resolution, I decided to go ahead 
      with the celebration despite the requests to cancel it from many quarters.
      </P>
      <P>The day dawned with very cloudy skies. As the day advanced the 
      conditions did not improve. It started to rain heavily and continued on to 
      the evening. We heard over the news that the weather conditions were quite 
      bad in surrounding areas as well. </P>
      <P>It was worse than what the forecasts also predicted. However as night 
      time advanced, and it was approaching to the time that we wanted to 
      commence the celebrations the storm ceased and the sky cleared as if by 
      magic. The full moon came out in all its splendour and illuminated the 
      scene of the celebrations. </P>
      <B>
      <P>Vesak celebration </P>
      </B>
      <P>All those who gathered there that day had a most peaceful and serene 
      Vesak celebration. Perfect weather prevailed until the celebrations were 
      over and everyone went away to their homes. Thereafter the storm 
      recommenced. And we got to know that even during the time of the 
      celebration the storm had been raging in the surrounding areas. </P>
      <P>I know that this miracle was aided with the help of the Devathas, who 
      enabled us to have the Vesak Celebrations without any hindrance. </P>
      <P>Therefore it is not a lie that Gods do exist, and they do assist the 
      pure followers of the Dhamma. </P>
