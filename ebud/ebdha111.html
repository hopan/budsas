  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>And what are skillful intentions? Any that meet three criteria: they are free of
  sensual passion, free of ill will, and free of any desire to injure oneself or others. The
  inclusion of the first criterion means that intentions of this sort go beyond our generic
  idea of a good intention as simply harmless and well-meaning. This is why the Buddha gives
  them a special name: to show that they're a special class of good intention. He calls them
  &quot;skillful&quot; for three main reasons: (1) they lead to no damaging results in any
  given situation; (2) they have the potential to lead to the truest possible happiness; and
  (3) they have to be consciously fostered and perfected as a skill for that potential to be
  fulfilled. In other words, if we hope to attain true happiness, we can't simply trust all
  our good-hearted, spontaneous impulses, for many times a well-meaning impulse can be
  misguided and inappropriate for the occasion. We have to subject our intentions to the
  same qualities of mindfulness, persistence, and discernment that lie at the heart of
  developing any skill: only then will they put us on the right path. </p>
  <p>Why is that? Because the roots of skillful intentions are mingled with the roots of
  unskillful intentions in the soil of the untrained heart. Skillful roots are mental states
  in which qualities of greed, aversion, and delusion are absent. Unskillful roots are
  states in which these qualities are present. Even when a skillful intention seems foremost
  in the mind, the unskillful roots can quickly send up shoots that complicate the
  situation. Of these roots, delusion is the most insidious, for it can blind us to what's
  going on. When delusion is present, we allow other unskillful roots to develop, mistake
  unskillful intentions for skillful ones, and misread the results that our intentions
  produce. For example, we may mistake a mixed intention for a skillful one, and thus get
  disappointed when it gives mixed results. Or when the painful results of an unskillful
  intention in the past obscure the results of a skillful intention in the present, we may
  blame the pain on our present intention. As a result, we get disillusioned with the
  potential of good intentions and either grow cynical about them or simply abandon the care
  and patience needed to perfect them. </p>
  <p>There's an old saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, but that's
  not really the case. The road to hell is paved with mean, lustful, and harmful intentions,
  some of which may look good to a casual glance. Roads paved with skillful intentions,
  leading to heavens of pleasure, branch off on either side of the way, but all too often
  they get lost in an underbrush of unskillfulness, and we find ourselves back on the road
  to hell. The Buddha's discovery was that if we nourish the skillful roots, they can grow
  and effectively block the road to hell; if we cut away the underbrush of unskillful-ness
  and dig out its roots, we can develop our good intentions to higher and higher levels of
  skill until ultimately they bring us to a happiness totally unlimited, beyond any further
  need for a path. </p>
  <p>The most basic step in this process is to make sure that we stay off the road to hell.
  We do this through the practice of generosity and virtue, consciously replacing unskillful
  intentions with more skillful ones. We then refine our intentions even further through
  meditation, digging up the roots of greed, aversion, and delusion to prevent them from
  influencing the choices shaping our lives. Greed and anger are sometimes easy to detect,
  but delusion -- by its very nature -- is obscure. When we're deluded, we don't <i>know</i>
  we're deluded. That's why meditation has to focus on strengthening and quickening our
  powers of mindfulness and alertness: so that we can catch sight of delusion and uproot it
  before it takes over our minds. </p>
  <p>The Buddha's most basic meditation instructions for refining intention start, not on
  the cushion, but with the activity of daily life. They are contained in a discourse to his
  young son, Rahula, and attack the Catch-22 of delusion in two ways: first, through what
  the early Buddhist texts call &quot;appropriate attention&quot; -- the ability to ask
  yourself the right questions; and, second, through friendship with admirable people --
  that is, by associating with and learning from people who are virtuous, generous, and
  wise. These two factors, the Buddha said, are the most helpful internal and external aids
  for a person following the path. </p>
  <p>In essence, the Buddha told Rahula to use his actions as a mirror for reflecting the
  quality of his mind. Each time before he acted -- and here &quot;acting&quot; covers any
  action in thought, word, or deed -- he was to reflect on the result he expected from the
  action and ask himself: &quot;Is this going to lead to harm for myself and others, or
  not?&quot; If it was going to be harmful, he shouldn't do it. If it looked harmless, he
  could go ahead and act. However, the Buddha cautioned Rahula, he shouldn't blindly trust
  his expectations. While he was in the process of acting, he should ask himself if there
  were any unexpected bad consequences arising. If there were, he should stop. If there
  weren't, he could continue his action to the end. Even then, though, the job of reflection
  wasn't finished. He should also notice the actual short- and long-term consequences of the
  action. If an action in word or deed ended up causing harm, then he should inform a
  fellow-practitioner on the path and listen to that person's advice. If the mistaken action
  was purely an act of the mind, then he should develop a sense of shame and disgust toward
  that kind of thought. In both cases, he should resolve never to make the same mistake
  again. If, however, the long-term consequences of the original action were harmless, he
  should take joy in being on the right path and continue his training. </p>
  <p>From this we can see that the basic approach for uncovering delusion is the familiar
  principle of learning from our own mistakes. The way the Buddha formulates this principle,
  though, has important implications, for it demands qualities of self-honesty and maturity
  in areas where they are normally hard to find: our evaluation of our own intentions and of
  the results of our actions. </p>
  <p>As children we learn to be dishonest about our intentions simply as a matter of
  survival: &quot;I didn't mean to do it,&quot; &quot;I couldn't help it,&quot; &quot;I was
  just swinging my arm and he got in the way.&quot;&nbsp;After a while, we begin to believe
  our own excuses and don't like to admit to ourselves when our intentions are less than
  noble. Thus we get into the habit of not articulating our intentions when faced with a
  choice, of refusing to consider the consequences of our intentions, and -- in many cases
  -- of denying that we had a choice to begin with. This is how addictive behavior starts,
  and unskillful intentions are given free rein. </p>
  <p>A similar dynamic surrounds our reactions to the consequences of our actions. We start
  learning denial at an early age -- &quot;It wasn't my fault,&quot; &quot;It was already
  broken when I lay down on it&quot; -- and then internalize the process, as a way of
  preserving our self-image, to the point where it becomes our second nature to turn a blind
  eye to the impact of our mistakes. </p>
  <p>As the Buddha points out, the end of suffering requires that we abandon craving and
  ignorance, but if we can't be honest with ourselves about our intentions, how can we
  perceive craving in time to abandon it? If we can't face up to the principle of cause and
  effect in our actions, how will we ever overcome ignorance? Ignorance is caused less by a
  lack of information than by a lack of self-awareness and self-honesty. To understand the
  noble truths requires that we be truthful with ourselves in precisely the areas where
  self-honesty is most difficult. </p>
  <p>It also requires maturity. As we examine our intentions, we need to learn how to say no
  to unskillful motives in a way that's firm enough to keep them in check but not so firm
  that it drives them underground into subconscious repression. We can learn to see the mind
  as a committee: the fact that unworthy impulses are proposed by members of the committee
  doesn't mean that <i>we</i> are unworthy. We don't have to assume responsibility for
  everything that gets brought to the committee floor. Our responsibility lies instead in
  our power to adopt or veto the motion. </p>
  <p>At the same time, we should be adult enough to admit that our habitual or spontaneous
  impulses are not always trustworthy -- first thought is not always best thought -- and
  that what we feel like doing now may not give results that will be pleasant to feel at a
  later date. As the Buddha said, there are four courses of action that may be open to us at
  any particular time: one that we want to do and will give good results; one that we don't
  want to do and will give bad results; one that we want to do but will give bad results;
  and one that we don't want to do but will give good results. The first two are
  no-brainers. We don't need much intelligence to do the first and avoid the second. The
  measure of our true intelligence lies in how we handle the last two choices. </p>
  <p>Examining the results of our actions requires maturity as well: a mature realization
  that self-esteem can't be based on always being right, and that there's nothing demeaning
  or degrading in admitting a mistake. We all come from a state of delusion -- even the
  Buddha was coming from delusion as he sought Awakening -- so it's only natural that there
  will be mistakes. Our human dignity lies in our ability to recognize those mistakes, to
  resolve not to repeat them, and to stick to that resolution. This in turn requires that we
  not be debilitated by feelings of guilt or remorse over our errors. As the Buddha states,
  feelings of guilt can't undo a past error, and they can deprive the mind of the strength
  it needs to keep from repeating old mistakes. This is why he recommends an emotion
  different from guilt -- shame -- although his use of the word implies something totally
  different from the sense of unworthiness we often associate with the term. Remember that
  both the Buddha and Rahula were members of the noble warrior class, a class with a strong
  sense of its own honor and dignity. And notice that the Buddha tells Rahula to see his
  past mistakes, not himself, as shameful. This implies that it's beneath Rahula's dignity
  to act in ways that are less than honorable. The fact that he can see his actions as
  shameful is a sign of his honor -- and is also a sign that he'll be able not to repeat
  them. This sense of honor is what underlies a mature, healthy, and productive sense of
  shame. </p>
  <p>At first glance, we might think that continual self-reflection of this sort would add
  further complications to our lives life when they already seem more than complicated
  enough, but in fact the Buddha's instructions are an attempt to strip the questions in our
  minds down to the most useful essentials. He explicitly warns against taking on too many
  questions, particularly those that lead nowhere and tie us up in knots: &quot;Who am I? Am
  I basically a good person? An unworthy person?&quot; Instead, he tells us to focus on our
  intentions so that we can see how they shape our life, and to master the process of cause
  and effect so that they can shape our life in increasingly better ways. This is the way
  every great artist or craftsman develops mastery and skill. </p>
  <p>The emphasis on the intentions behind our actions and their resulting consequences also
  carries over from daily life onto the meditation seat, providing our meditation with the
  proper focus. In examining our actions in terms of cause and effect, skillful and
  unskillful, we are already beginning to look at experience in line with the two sets of
  variables that make up the four noble truths: the origination of stress (unskillful
  cause), the path to the cessation of stress (skillful cause), stress (unskillful effect),
  and the cessation of stress (skillful effect). The way the Buddha recommended that Rahula
  judge the results of his actions -- both while doing them and after they are done --
  echoes the insight that formed the heart of his Awakening: that intentions have results
  both in the immediate present and over time. </p>
  <p>When we look at the present moment from this perspective, we find that our experience
  of the present doesn't &quot;just happen.&quot; Instead, it's a product of our involvement
  -- in terms of present intentions, the results of present intentions, and the results of
  past intentions -- in which present intentions are the most important factor. The more we
  focus on that involvement, the more we can bring it out of the half-light of the
  subconscious and into the full light of awareness. There we can train our intentions,
  through conscious trial and error, to be even more skillful, enabling us to lessen our
  experience of suffering and pain in the present. This is how skillful intentions pave the
  road to mental health and well being in the ordinary world of our lives. </p>
  <p>As we work at developing our intentions to even higher levels of skill, we find that
  the most consummate intentions are those that center the mind securely in a clear
  awareness of the present. As we use them to become more and more familiar with the
  present, we come to see that <i>all</i> present intentions, no matter how skillful, are
  inherently burdensome. The only way out of this burden is to allow the unraveling of the
  intentions that provide the weave for our present experience. This provides an opening to
  the dimension of unlimited freedom that lies beyond them. That's how skillful intentions
  pave the road all the way to the edge of nirvana. And from there, the path -- &quot;like
  that of birds through space&quot; -- can't be traced. </p>
