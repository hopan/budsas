      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><I>1- Thus have I heard. On one 
      occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in the Eastern Park, in 
      the Palace of Migara&#39;s Mother, together with many very well-known elder 
      disciples -- the Venerable Sariputta, the Venerable Maha-Moggallana, the 
      Venerable Maha Kassapa, the Venerable Maha Kaccana, the Venerable Maha 
      Kotthita, the Venerable Maha Kappina, the Venerable Cunda, the Venerable 
      Anuruddha, the Venerable Revata, the Venerable Ananda, and other very well 
      known elder disciples.</I></B> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><I>2- Now on that occasion elder 
      Bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing new Bhikkhus; some elder 
      Bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing ten new Bhikkhus, some elder 
      Bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing twenty... thirty... forty new 
      Bhikkhus. And the new Bhikkhus, taught and instructed by the elder 
      Bhikkhus, had achieved successive stages of high distinction.</I></B>
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><I>3- On that occasion -- the Uposatha 
      day of the fifteenth, on the full-moon night of the Pavarana ceremony,</I></B><A HREF="#n9">[9]</A>
      <I><B>The Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by the Sangha of 
      Bhikkhus. Then, surveying the silent Sangha of Bhikkhus, he addressed them 
      thus:</B></I> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><I>4- &quot;Bhikkhus, I am content with this 
      progress. My mind is content with this progress. So arouse still more 
      energy to attain the unattained, to achieve the unachieved, to realize the 
      unrealized. I shall wait here at Sivatthi for the Komudi full moon of the 
      fourth month.&quot;</I></B> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Bhikkhus can still practice their 
      meditation or make new robes and prepare to go out wandering or teaching 
      the Dhamma to other monks and layperson during this extra month. The 
      Kathina Ceremony is also held during this month. This is the time for 
      laymen and laywomen to make extra merit by practicing their generosity by 
      giving robes and other requisites to the Sangha members. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><I>5- The Bhikkhus of the countryside 
      heard: &quot;The Blessed One will wait there at Savatthi for the Komudi full

      course for Savatthi to see the Blessed One.</I></B> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><I>6- And the elder Bhikkhus still more 
      intensively taught and instructed new Bhikkhus; some elder Bhikkhus taught 
      and instructed ten new Bhikkhus, some elder Bhikkhus taught and instructed 
      twenty... thirty... forty new Bhikkhus. And the new Bhikkhus, taught and 
      instructed by the elder Bhikkhus, achieved successive stages of high

      such is this assembly. Such an assembly as is worthy of gifts, worthy of 
      hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an 
      incomparable field of merit for the world -- Such is this assembly. Such 
      an assembly that a small gift given to it becomes great and a great gift 
      becomes greater -- such is this Sangha of Bhikkhus, such is this assembly. 
      Such an assembly as is rare for the world to see -- such is this Sangha of 
      Bhikkhus, such is this assembly. Such an assembly as would be worthy 
      journeying many leagues with a travel-bag to see -- such is this Sangha of 
      Bhikkhus, such is this assembly.</I></B> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><I>9- &quot;In this Sangha of Bhikkhus, 
      there are Bhikkhus who are arahats with taints destroyed, who have lived 
      the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached the 
      true goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and are completely liberated 
      through final knowledge -- such Bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of 
      Bhikkhus.</I></B> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is the stage where all of the fetters 
      are destroyed such that they will not even arise anymore. The ten fetters 
      are: 1. Belief in permanent self or soul, 2. doubt in the correct path, 3. 
      Belief that chanting, or rites and rituals lead one to Nibbana, 4. lust or 
      greed, 5. hatred or aversion, 6. greed for fine-material existence or 
      immaterial existence, 7. conceit or pride, 8. sloth and torpor or 
      sleepiness or dullness of mind, 9. restlessness or agitation of mind, 10. 
      ignorance. (In PaIi, they are 1. Sakkayaditthi, 2. Vicikiccha, 3. 
      Silabbataparamasa, 4. Kanasmaraga, 5. Patigha, 6. Ruparaga, Aruparaga, 7. 
      Mana, 8. Middha, 9. Uddhacca, 10. Avijja.) The final stage of Arahatta is 
      described as follows: &quot;They are the ones who have lived the Holy Life, 
      laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of 
      being, and are completely liberated through final knowledge, they have 
      done their work with diligence; they are no longer capable of being 
      negligent&quot; (Taken from the Majjhima Nikaya sutta number 70 section 12.)

      as ways to develop wholesome states. (This sutta describes the qualities 
      of Lord Buddha which his disciples honour, respect, revere and venerate 
      him and live in dependence on him.) We will now look into the meanings of 
      these terms. The four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Seven Enlightenment 
      Factors and the Noble Eightfold Path will be discussed later in the sutta.

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;Again Udayin, I have proclaimed to 
        my disciples the way to develop the four right kinds of striving. A 
        Bhikkhu awakens zeal, for the non-arising of unarisen evil unwholesome 
        states, and he makes effort, arouses energy, exerts his mind, and 
        strives.&quot;</I></FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Besides zeal, the Pali word <I>chanda</I> 
      also means joyful interest or enthusiasm. A mind which points towards a 
      wholesome object like joy has this quality of joyful interest. Thus, the 
      first right kind of striving is to cultivate a mind that has joyful 
      interest and enthusiasm so that the mind becomes clear and free from 
      unwholesome states. Joy grows when the mind is smiling and happy during 
      our daily life as well as during meditation. As a result, the mind will be 
      uplifted and wholesome at that time. Nowadays, these four kinds of 
      striving are usually called the four right efforts. Some meditation 
      teachers request the meditator to put out strenuous effort to note what is 
      happening in the present moment. But the sutta here clearly shows that 
      this is not that kind of mindfulness. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The mindfulness of joyful interest and 
      enthusiasm, i.e., having a smiling mind leads to a mind which is light, 
      open, accepting and without any tension. This is the proper definition of 
      right effort and according to the sutta, it actually has nothing to do 
      with noting phenomena until it goes away. </FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;He awakens zeal for the abandoning 
        of arisen evil unwholesome states, and he makes effort, arouses energy, 
        exerts his mind, and strives.&quot;</I></FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The second right kind of strivings teaches 
      one to abandon heavy emotional states like anger, sadness, jealousy, 
      anxiety, stress, depression, fear, etc., and replace them with a smiling 
      mind which relaxes away even the subtlest tension. This is the wholesome 
      state of joyful interest and enthusiasm. By cultivating such a smiling 
      mind, one overcomes the ego-identification with these states as being 
      &quot;Mine&quot;. A good sense of humor about oneself is a skillful tool to develop 
      when trodding the spiritual path. </FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;He awakens zeal for the arising of 
        unarisen wholesome states, and he makes effort, arouses energy, exerts 
        his mind, and strives.&quot;</I></FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This means seeing that the mind brings up 
      joyful interest and enthusiasm when these wholesome states are not in the 
      mind. In other words, the cultivation of mindfulness means cultivating joy 
      and a smiling mind. Even when there is a neutral mind that is merely 
      thinking this and that, this is the time to practice smiling in the mind 
      and experiencing joyful interest and enthusiasm. </FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;He awakens zeal for the continuous, 
        non-disappearance, strengthening, increase, and fulfillment by 
        development of arisen wholesome states, and he makes effort, arouses 
        energy, exerts his mind, and strives. And thereby many disciples of mine 
        abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct 
        knowledge.&quot;</I></FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The fourth right kind of striving refers 
      to a continuous practice, not only during the formal practice of 
      meditation but also during the daily activities. At one time the author 
      was approached by some students asking: &quot;How can one attain Nibbana by 
      practicing smiling and having joyful interest?&quot; They thought that they 
      have made a very profound statement because they thought Nibbana is 
      attained by looking at pain and suffering all of the time. These students 
      are not practicing how to be light and happy as taught by the Lord Buddha. 
      The author replied them by asking some cross questions: &quot;How can you get 
      to Nibbana without smiling and having joyful interest in your mind? Isn&#39;t 
      joy one of the enlightenment factors? Didn&#39;t the Lord Buddha said &#39;We are 
      the Happy Ones?&#39;&quot; </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Here one can see the importance of 
      developing a mind that smiles and has joyful interest. There arises a true 
      change of perspective in one&#39;s mind when they have joyful interest and a 
      smile. One is not so heavy and grumpy when things become difficult. This 
      is because there is not so much ego-attachment and the meditator can see a 
      situation clearly. When the mind do not smile and has no joyful interest, 
      everything becomes heavy and all mental states and thoughts becomes 
      depressing. The mind becomes over serious and takes everything negatively.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For example, let&#39;s say that you are very 
      happy and I come along and give you a rose. You might take that rose and 
      admire the color, the shape and the fragrance. You think, &quot;What a 
      beautiful flower! Just seeing it makes me even more happy&quot;. But, if you 
      are in a depressing or angry mood and I come along and give you that same 
      rose, your mind would see the thorns instead. You might even think, &quot;Ugh! 
      This rose is so ugly. I hate it!&quot; At that time, all that is seen is the 
      thorns. But, in actual fact, the rose is the same. The only difference is 
      your mood. Joyful interest and smiling helps to make the world around you 
      a better place to live. This, however, is not to say that we won&#39;t go 
      through trials and tribulations. We will! However, the perspective of 
      having joy in the mind changes a big problem into a small one. </FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to 
        my disciples the way to develop the four bases for spiritual power. Here 
        a Bhikkhu develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in composure 
        of mind, due to joy and determined striving.&quot;</I></FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The first spiritual power refers to joy. 
      It is as explained above. </FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;He develops the basis for spiritual 
        power consisting of concentration (here meaning stillness) due to energy 
        and determined striving.&quot;</I></FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is the second spiritual power energy. 
      One cannot slack or becomes lazy when they are on the Lord Buddha&#39;s Path. 
      It takes a lot of energy to stay on the path especially when one realizes 
      that this is a lifetime practice! This is talking about the energy that it 
      takes to recognize when one&#39;s mind is tight and tense, followed by the 
      energy to let go of the thinking and relax the tightness in the head and 
      mind, before coming back to the breath. </FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;He develops the basis for spiritual 
        power consisting of concentration (here meaning tranquility) due to 
        [purity of] mind and determined striving.&quot;</I></FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The third spiritual power refers to the 
      purity of mind which is developed when one stays on the object of 
      meditation as much as possible. Whenever a hindrance arises and knocks one 
      out of the meditation, then they simply allow the hindrance to be, without 
      getting involved with the thinking mind, relax the tightness in the head 
      caused by the hindrance, then gently redirect their attention back to the 
      meditation object i.e., the breath and tranquilizing and expanding the 
      mind. It doesn&#39;t matter how many times the mind goes back to that 
      distraction or hindrance. One simply repeats allowing, relaxing and coming 
      back to the breath. This is the method to purify the mind of all 
      defilements and hindrances. Remember, meditation is not about thinking, 
      but expanding one&#39;s mind and awareness into the present moment and then 
      going beyond that, to the true expression of loving acceptance. Meditation 
      is the silence when thoughts -- with all its images and words has entirely 
      ceased. But meditation is not &#39;concentration&#39;. &#39;Concentration&#39; contracts 
      the mind and is a form of exclusion, a type of cutting off, a suppression 
      of hindrances, a resistance. It is also a kind of conflict. A meditative 
      mind can be very still and composed, and yet, not have exclusion or 
      suppression, nor resistance in it. A concentrated mind cannot meditate 
      according to the Buddhist practice. </FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;He develops the basis for spiritual 
        power consisting in concentration (here meaning composure of mind) due 
        to investigation and determined striving.&quot;</I></FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The habit of investigating one&#39;s 
      experience is a very important aspect of one&#39;s spiritual growth. When one 
      is caught by a hindrance, or pain, or any distraction, they must he able 
      to see how the mind reacts to that particular situation. For example, 
      sleepiness arises while one is meditating. The way to overcome sleepiness 
      is by staying more attentively, with joyful interest, on the object of 
      meditation. One must try to see directly how their mind slips back to the 
      sleepiness. In other words, one must put more effort and energy into the 
      practice. When one notices how the mind first starts to be caught by the 
      hindrance, they will let go of it more quickly and not he caught for too 
      long a time. However, when one is totally caught by the sleepiness, it may 
      take a while to overcome this hindrance, because this is the last thing 
      the mind wants to do! Thus, the mind may &#39;ping pong&#39; back and forth from 
      the meditation object back to the sleepiness. The more light and joyful 
      interest towards how the mind works, the more quickly one will let go of 
      the hindrance and begin to meditate again. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Similarly, when pain arises, one does not 
      direct the mind into the pain. One can see how the mind has resistance to 
      that sensation only when their attention is pulled to the pain. If one 
      starts to think about the pain, it will get bigger and more intense. Thus, 
      one first lets go of the thinking mind, which verbalizes about these 
      distraction (pain, hindrance, heavy emotion etc.). Next, relaxes the mind 
      and releases the tight mental knot around the sensation, relaxes the 
      tightness in the head, calms the mind and then, redirect one&#39;s attention 
      back to the object of meditation. This is done continually until the pain 
      doesn&#39;t pull the mind to it again. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is decidedly different from some 
      other meditations instructions where the meditators put their attention 
      into the middle of the pain and note it as &#39;pain... pain... pain&#39;. All the 
      while, they are trying to see its true nature and watch its changes. But 
      pain by nature, is repulsive and thus, the meditators have the tendency to 
      tighten and harden the mind so that they can continue watching the pain. 
      The hardening of the mind is never noted by the meditators, nor is it ever 
      seen clearly whenever it arises. The meditators will eventually develop 
      enough concentration (fixed attention) to be able to overcome the pain. 
      However, this is achieved by repressing and tightening the mind. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One can clearly observe that the spiritual 
      base of investigation of one&#39;s experience is to purify the mind by 
      allowing everything that happens in the present moment to he there without 
      trying to fight, control, or even disturb it in any way. Loving-acceptance 
      and patience (which is defined in the English dictionary as meaning 
      non-aversion) of the present moment is the way to attain Nibbana. It is 
      not attained by concentration, tightness, suppression and repression.

      for a meditation teacher. If one is fortunate enough to learn from a 
      competent teacher, they will begin to see some slight changes in the way 
      they perceive the world. As one begins to see this through direct 
      practice, their confidence begin to grow. As a result, their enthusiasm

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When one&#39;s confidence grows, they will 
      naturally put more energy into their practice. One begins to sit a little 
      longer and the mind becomes a little clearer. For the beginner it is 
      recommended to sit not less than 45 minutes at a time. But when a sitting 
      is good, please stay with that sitting for as long as it lasts. A good 
      sifting might last for one hour or one hour-ten minutes, or longer. It is 
      good to sit for progressively longer periods of time and not worry about 
      becoming attached to the sitting. The only way one becomes attached is by 
      the thinking about and not doing the meditation in the correct manner. 
      There is nothing wrong in sitting for long periods of time as long as one 
      does not hurt themselves physically and they have enough exercise. Sitting 
      for one or two or three hours is fine only when one is ready to sit 
      comfortably for such long hours. If one sits in a same way which causes 
      pain to arise every time, then they are causing themselves unnecessary 
      physical discomfort. This is not a wise thing to do, because the sitting 
      posture should be comfortable. It is alright if the meditator uses a stool 
      or chair, as long as they do not lean on anything. Leaning is good for 
      sleeping and dullness, not meditating! </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And thus, the more confidence one has, the

        mindfulness which leads to peace, leads to enlightenment.&quot;</I></FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As one&#39;s energy improves, their awareness 
      and mindfulness will naturally become stronger. This is a very natural 
      &quot;non-forced&quot; process. Let&#39;s take a look at the mind of an ordinary person, 
      a person like you or me. What one finds is a grasshopper mind, a butterfly 
      mind, or one could also say, a mad monkey mind. It is ever-moving, 
      ever-jumping around. It changes its fantasies and impulses every moment. 
      The mind is a prey of stimuli and its own emotional reaction to them. This 
      is actually a reaction that is mostly <B>re-acting</B> to conditions the 
      way one always acts when a certain stimuli arises. It is a chain of linked 
      associations, hopes, fears, memories, fantasies, regrets, streaming 
      constantly through the mind, triggered by memories of the outside world. 
      The mind is blindly, never-stopping, never-satisfied in its search for 
      pleasure and satisfaction. It is no wonder that the mind becomes so crazy 
      and filled with unsatisfactoriness and was described as a restless mad 
      monkey swinging from branch to branch in the quest for satisfying fruit 
      through the endless jungle of conditional events. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus, when one first begins to meditate, 
      the mind naturally runs all over the place and stays away from the object 
      of meditation for a long time. Sometimes it even takes two or three 
      minutes before one is able to recognize, they then gently let it go, relax 
      the tension in the head, calm the mind and re-direct the attention back to 
      the breath. This is only natural, because the mind is used to running 
      wherever it likes. But as one&#39;s practice develops and they are able to 
      recognize and let go more quickly, their mindfulness gradually becomes 
      sharper. The mind might only stay away from the breath for one minute, 
      before recognizing that it is not on the breath. It then lets go, relaxes 
      the mind, and comes back to the breath. At this time the mind begins to 
      stay on the breath for longer periods of time, perhaps, as long as thirty 
      seconds, before it goes off again. However, one is now becoming better at 
      seeing when the mind goes away. Their mindfulness becomes sharper and they 
      are able to recognize what the mind is doing. Thus, when one&#39;s confidence 
      becomes better, their energy improves and as a result, the alertness of 
      mind naturally develops. </FONT></P>

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When one&#39;s mindfulness of the present 
      moment improves, the mind will naturally stay on the object of meditation 
      for much longer periods of time. Most people would describe this as 
      &#39;concentration&#39; but this is not an accurate description. The mind is not 
      absorbed into or fixed onto the object of meditation. Instead, it is very 
      still, relaxed, composed and stays on the breath very well. At this time a 
      strong feeling of joy arises and the body becomes very light and feels 
      like floating. When the joy fades away, a powerful feeling of tranquility, 
      equanimity and comfortableness arises. Due to one&#39;s sharp awareness, they 
      do not become involved with these feelings. But if one begins to think or 
      internally verbalize about how nice this state is and how much they like 
      it, they will lose that state and sleepiness very often comes into the 
      mind. This is because one is caught by the attachment to those feelings 
      and slip off without coming back to the breath. Mindfulness fades away 
      when one starts to think or internally verbalize about things and becomes 
      involved in wanting to control these things and thoughts. This also 
      happens when one craves for the experience of joy and tranquility to 
      arise. This desire makes the mind to try too hard and as a result 
      restlessness and dissatisfaction arise These combination of hindrances 
      will stop all spiritual practice from occurring because the wanting for 
      things to be in a particular way makes all the spiritual development fade 
      away. Therefore, one must be more mindful of the thoughts about these 
      pleasant abiding. And thus, as confidence increases, one&#39;s energy grows. 
      This improves our mindfulness which enables the composure and stillness of 
      mind to become stronger and lasts longer. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As one&#39;s mind becomes more calm and still, 
      they are able to see the true nature of things. This development of wisdom 
      or intelligence is gained by seeing things arise and pass away by 
      themselves. Even while one is sitting in a jhana [a meditation stage] they 
      see how, for instance, joy arises. It is there for a while then fades 
      away. They see how tranquility and happiness arise. They are there for a 
      while and then they fade away. One is able to see the true nature of 
      impermanence, even in the beginning of their practice, by observing 
      thoughts arising and passing away. One observes feelings and emotions 
      arising and passing away. They also notice that these things that arise 
      and pass away are unsatisfactory and these feelings and emotions are a 
      form of suffering, especially when they don&#39;t behave in the way one wants 
      them to. When one sees how truly unsatisfactory this process is, they 
      clearly see that it is an impersonal process. There is no one who can 
      control the appearance and disappearance of these things. Even while in 
      jhana [a meditation stage] one has no real control over the joy arising 
      because joy arises when the conditions are right for it to come up. At the 
      same time, one simply cannot force joy to stay because it will fade away 
      when the conditions are right. And this causes more unsatisfactoriness to 
      arise, because joy is such a nice feeling! Thus, one is able to see the 
      characteristics of existence very clearly, i.e. anicca (impermanence), 
      dukkha (suffering), and not-self (anatta). This is the way to develop 
      wisdom which gradually leads one to the seeing of Dependent Origination 
      both forwards and backwards (that is, seeing and realizing The Four Noble 
      Truths). An interesting observation is that one can see the three 
      characteristics of existence without ever seeing Dependent Origination, 
      but they can never see Dependent Origination without seeing the three 
      characteristics of existence (i.e., impermanence, suffering and not-self 
      nature) at the same time. We will discuss this in more detail at a later 
      time. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Loving-kindness, compassion, appreciative 
      joy and equanimity are known as the Four &quot;Brahma Viharas&quot; or the Four 
      Boundless states of mind, or the Limitless states of mind. This is because 
      there is no boundary or limitations to one&#39;s mind when they are in these 
      meditative states. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The meditation of foulness is suitable for 
      those who have a strong affinity for lust arising in their minds. It is 
      practiced by reflecting on the element and the disgusting nature of one&#39;s 
      body parts. For example, when one looks at a beautiful person and thoughts 
      of lust arise, they can imagine how desirable that person would be are if 
      all of their body parts where to be turned inside-out! Will one&#39;s mind 
      think, &quot;Oh! what a lovely intestine or liver !&quot; or &quot;Wow! What beautiful 
      bile, pus and phlegm that person has!&quot; How much lust is there in the mind 
      at that time? Thus, this meditation helps people with lustful personality 
      to he more in balance. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The perception of impermanence does not 
      actually refers to sitting down and thinking about how everything changes. 
      (Remember, &quot;Tranquil Wisdom Meditation&quot; is about seeing with a silent and 
      spacious mind.) It is referring to the meditation states of infinite space 
      and infinite consciousness where the mind sees just how fleeting these 
      mental and physical phenomenon truly are. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We will now proceed to the next section of

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><I>15- &quot;Bhikkhus, when mindfulness of 
      breathing is developed and cultivated, it is of great fruit and great 
      benefit. When Mindfulness of Breathing is developed and cultivated, it 
      fulfills the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. When&nbsp; the&nbsp; Four 
      Foundations of Mindfulness are developed and cultivated, they fulfill the 
      Seven Enlightenment Factors. When the Seven Enlightenment Factors are 
      developed and cultivated, they fulfill true knowledge and deliverance.</I></B>
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One observes that the Four Foundations of 
      Mindfulness is in this sutta and they are fulfilled through the practice 
      of jhana or tranquil and wise meditative states of mind. This is decidedly 
      different from the current theory that one can&#39;t attain the Four 
      Foundations of Mindfulness while experiencing jhanas [meditative stages]. 
      The Lord Buddha only taught one kind of meditation and that is samatha or 
      tranquility or one can say he taught samadhi -- tranquil &#39;wisdom 
      meditation. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><I>16- And how, Bhikkhus, is 
      mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated, so that it is of great 
      fruit and great benefit?</I></B> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><I>17- &quot;Here a Bhikkhu, gone to the 
      forest or to the root of a tree or an empty hut, sits down; having folded 
      his legs crosswise, set his body erect, and established mindfulness in 
      front of him, ever mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.</I></B>
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The phrase &quot;gone to the forest or to the 
      root of a tree or an empty hut&quot; means that one goes to a reasonably quiet 
      place where there will be few distractions. A suitable location will be 
      one that is away from road noises, loud and persistent music or sounds, 
      people as well as animals. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">During the time of the Lord Buddha most 
      people sat on floors. Hence, the phrase &quot;sits down; having folded his legs 
      crosswise, set his body erect&quot; But today, sifting on the floor can be a 
      very trying and painful experience as people mostly sit on chairs, stools, 
      or couches. If one wants to sit on floors, it may help if they sit on 
      cushions. In actual fact, it is far more important to observe what is 
      happening in the mind than to sit with uncomfortable or painful 
      sensations. Remember that there is no magic in sitting on the floor. The 
      magic comes from a clear, calm mind that is at ease, as much as possible. 
      Thus, if sitting on the floor is a very painful experience, then it is 
      alright to sit on a stool or a chair. There is however, an extremely 
      important factor if the meditator sits on a chair. They must sit without 
      leaning against the chair. Leaning is good for sleeping but not for 
      meditation! &quot;Set his body erect&quot; means sit with a nicely straight back 
      which is not rigid and uncomfortable. A nicely straight back has all of 
      the vertebrae stacked one upon another. This is to ensure that energy can 
      flow up and down the back without any blockages. Leaning stops the energy 
      flow and causes sleepiness to arise. Thus, please do not lean against 
      anything. When one first start out, their backs are not used to being 
      straight and some of the muscles can rebel and complain. However, with 
      patience and perseverance, these unused muscles will gradually adjust and 
      strengthen. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is another important aspect to 
      sitting meditation. One must sit without moving the body for any reason. 
      Please do not wriggle the toes or fingers or move the hands to rub or 
      scratch or change the posture in any way until after the sitting is over. 
      Any movement breaks the continuity of the practice and this causes the 
      meditator to start all over again. Some meditation teachers tell their 
      students that it is quite alright to move as long as they are &quot;mindful&quot;. 
      But if the students are truly mindful, they would be able to watch the 
      mind and its dislike of the sensations and then, relax the mind around 
      them. Thus, there would be no reason to move! Mindfulness means to 
      lovingly-accept what is happening in the present moment, without trying to 
      control, resist or change it. To be truly mindful means to open up and 
      allow whatever to present itself in the present moment. Moving while 
      sifting means that the meditator is not being mindful at all. The 
      meditator is giving in to the desire to move, and is identifying with that 
      desire. Thus, when one is ready and begins to meditate, they must remain 
      still and keep tranquilizing the mind whenever there is a distraction. To 
      sit as still as a Buddha image is the best! Actually the only allowable 
      movement during meditation is to straighten the back when it starts to 
      curve or slump, as long as it is not done too often. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The phrase <I>&quot;establishing mindfulness in 
      front of him&quot;</I> means that one puts aside all other worldly affairs and 
      involvement with sensual pleasures. One softly closes the eyes and 
      whenever there is a distracting sound, smell, taste or sensation, or 
      thought, they are aware of that and simply let it go. One then relaxes the 
      tightness in the head and redirects the attention back to the object of 
      meditation. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;Ever mindful he breathes in, mindful 
      he breathes out&quot;</I> tells us the way to practice mindfulness of 
      breathing. Being aware of the breath means to know when one is 
      experiencing the in-breath and to know when one is experiencing the 
      out-breath. It simply means to open up one&#39;s awareness and to be attentive 
      to the breath as much as possible and at the same time, relax the 
      tightness in the head (this will be explained more thoroughly in a little 
      while). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><I>18- &quot;Breathing in long, he 
      understands: &#39;I breathe in long&#39;; or breathing out long, he understands: 
      &#39;I breathe out long.&#39;&nbsp; Breathing in short, he understands: &#39;I breathe 
      in short&#39;; or breathing out short he understands &#39;I breathe out short&#39;.</I></B>
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The words <B>&quot;he understands&quot;</B> are 
      emphasized to show that one does not focus with strong attention on the 
      breath to the exclusion of everything else. One merely <B>understands</B> 
      what the breath is doing in the present moment. That&#39;s all there is to 
      this! One simply knows when they breathe in long or short! There is no 
      controlling of the breath at any time. Instead, there is only 
      understanding of what one is doing in the present moment. If one tries to 
      &quot;over-focus&quot; or &quot;concentrate&quot; on the breath to the exclusion of anything 
      else, they will develop a headache due to the &quot;wrong concentration&quot;. 
      Whenever a meditator holds tightly onto the meditation object and tries to 
      force the mind to &quot;concentrate&quot; or bumps any distractions away, the head 
      will develop a very tight and painful tension. This tightness or tension 
      on the head also occurs when the meditator attempts to control the sitting 
      by throwing down any distracting thoughts and feelings and quickly rush 
      back to the meditation object. This happens with &#39;momentary concentration&#39; 
      as well as any other kind of &#39;concentration&#39; technique. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Many meditation teachers tell their 
      students to put their attention right in the middle of the sensation and 
      see its true nature. This will cause a few different things to occur. 
      Firstly, the students will develop a stronger pain and this becomes a 
      distraction instead. It is because these meditation teachers tell their 
      students to stay with that pain until it goes away. Unfortunately, this 
      can take an unbelievably long time. In addition, the students need to 
      tighten and toughen the mind in order to observe the tension. Actually, 
      this tightening and toughening of the mind is not being mindful. The 
      students begins to develop a mind that hardens itself when pain arises. It 
      is only natural that this happens as it take a lot of courage and 
      fortitude to watch pain in this way. A type of aversion is naturally 
      developed at that time, and this hardening of mind is not being noticed as 
      anicca, dukkha, anatta. Consequently, even when one is not meditating, 
      this suppression can cause personality hardening, and that causes true 
      problems to arise. The mind has a tendency to become critical and 
      judgmental and the personality development of the meditator becomes hard. 
      Many people say they need to do a loving-kindness retreat after doing 
      other types of meditation because they discovered that they do and say 
      things which are not so nice to other people. When this happens, there 
      appears a question, &quot;Is this really a type of meditation technique which 
      leads to my happiness and to the happiness of others? If the answer is 
      yes, then why do I need to practice another form of meditation to balance 
      my thinking?&quot; </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Eventually one is able to suppress this 
      aversion by practicing &#39;concentration&#39;, which is taught to be the &quot;correct 
      method&quot; by most meditation teachers. But the method taught by the Lord 
      Buddha was to never suppress anything. His method was to open and expand 
      the mind and to allow everything that arises in the present moment. Thus, 
      whenever a pain arises in the body, one first recognizes that the mind has 
      gone to that sensation, lets go of any thoughts about that sensation, 
      opens the mind and lets go of the tight mental fist that is wrapped around 
      the sensation, or by letting the sensation be there by itself without any 
      mental resistance or aversion to it. This is done by telling themselves, 
      &quot;Never mind it is alright for this pain to be there.&quot; Next, relax the 
      tightness which is in the head ...&nbsp; feel the mind expand and become 
      calm ...&nbsp; then re-direct the attention back to the object of 
      meditation i.e. the breath. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If one gets caught in the thinking about 
      the sensation or pain, the sensation will get bigger and become more 
      intense. Eventually, they can&#39;t stand it any more and feel that they have 
      to move. This thinking or internally verbalizing about the sensation and 
      wishing it would go away, is the &#39;ego identification&#39; with the painful 
      sensation. This getting involved with, ...&nbsp; trying to control, ...&nbsp; 
      fighting with the sensation, ...&nbsp; resisting the sensation etc., is 
      only fighting with the Dhamma (Truth of the Present Moment). Whenever 
      anyone fights and tries to control or hardens the mind to the Dhamma of 
      the present moment, they cause themselves undue suffering and pain. 
      Another way of fighting the Dhamma is by taking the sensation personally. 
      This worsens the pain and as a result, it hurts even more. Thus, one must 
      learn to open and lovingly-accept the present moment without that 
      &#39;ego-identification&#39; and the thinking or internally verbalization about, 
      or taking it as &quot;I am that&quot;. This is how one gains calmness and composure 
      of mind, as well as, equanimity, full awareness, and mindfulness. </FONT>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Lord Buddha taught us three kinds of 
      actions while meditating or during our daily activities. They are, <I>
      &quot;Love Where We Are At, Love What We Are Doing in the Present Moment, and 
      Love Who We Are With&quot;</I>. These simple explanations allow one to be 
      completely accepting of the present moment. <I>&quot;To Love where We Are At&quot;</I> 
      means to accept the fact that when one is sifting in meditation, things 
      are not always like they want them to he. <I>&quot;To Love What We Are Doing&quot;</I> 
      means to open up the mind and allow whatever arises in the present moment, 
      to present itself without our getting attached to it. A good acronym for 
      this is <B>&quot;DROPS&quot;</B> which means <B>&quot;Don&#39;t Resist Or Push. Soften&quot;</B>. 
      Whatever arises, one does not resist or push. Just soften into it, open 
      the mind and accept it. In other words to <I>&quot;Love What We Are Doing&quot;. &quot;To 
      Love Who We Are With&quot;</I>, means to love oneself enough so that they see 
      and let go of all kinds of attachments which causes pain to arise in their 
      body and mind. The recognition that one causes their own suffering is a 
      major realization. When one truly loves themselves, they will see the pain 
      and sorrow and lovingly let it go. This is done by letting go of the 
      thinking about. Thus, they let go of the attachment and the ego 
      identification with it. </FONT></P>

      breath, or take this breathing as the object of extreme concentration&#39;. 
      One simply <B><I>knows</I></B> what the breath is doing in the present

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This simple statement is the <B><I>most 
      important part</I></B> of the meditation instructions. It instructs one to 
      notice the tightness which arises in the head with every arising of a 
      consciousness, and let that tightness go, while on the in-breath and 
      out-breath. Then one feels their mind open up, expand, relax and become 
      tranquil. Everytime they see that the mind is distracted away from the 
      breath, they simply let go of the distraction, relax the tightness in the 
      head by letting go of the tightness, feel the mind become open, expanded, 
      relaxed, calm and clean. Next, one softly re-directs the mind back to the 
      breath, on the in-breath relaxes, expands and calms the tightness in the 
      head and mind ...&nbsp; on the out-breath relaxes, expands and calms the 
      tension in the head and mind. For example, when a thought arises, just let 
      the thought go. Don&#39;t continue thinking, even if one is in mid-sentence. 
      Just softly let the thought go. If the distraction is a sensation, firstly 
      open the mind and let go of the aversion to the sensation, then open and 
      expand the mind before re-directing one&#39;s attention back to the breath.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This opening up, expanding and letting go 
      of the tightness in the head is actually letting go of the subtle &#39;ego 
      identification&#39; which attaches itself to everything as it arises. Thus, 
      when one lets go of this tension, they are actually letting go of all 
      ignorance which causes rebirth. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When the meditation instructions here are 
      followed closely, there will be no &#39;sign or nimitta&#39; arising in the mind 
      (i.e., no lights or other kinds of mind-made objects, which arise in the 
      mind when one is practicing &#39;concentration meditation&#39;). The mind 
      naturally becomes calm and tranquil. One need not try to force the mind to 
      stay on the object of meditation through strong concentration&#39; which 
      causes tension and pain in the head. One begins to realize the true nature 
      of all phenomenon as being impermanent (anicca), unsatisfactory (dukkha), 
      and not-self (anatta). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus, when one practices &quot;Tranquil Wisdom 
      Meditation&quot;, they are aware of the in-breath and at the same time, the 
      relaxation of the tightness in the head and the mind. They are also aware 
      of the out-breath and again, at the same time, the relaxation of the 
      tightness in the head and mind. It is alright if one happens to miss one 
      in-breath or one out-breath at first. They should not put unnecessary 
      pressure on themselves which might cause them to think how difficult this 
      practice is. This is actually an incredibly easy practice and a simple way 
      to develop the mind. Thus, if one occasionally misses the in-breath or 
      out-breath, just let it go and catch the next in-breath or out-breath. 
      Simple and easy, isn&#39;t it? At first, the breath may seem to be very fast 
      and difficult to notice. However, as one continues with their practice, 
      the meditation becomes easier and they will not miss the in-breath or 
      out-breath that much. After all, this is a gradual training. There is no 
      need to put undue pressure on oneself. Simply relax into the meditation.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When one practices &quot;Tranquil Wisdom 
      Meditation&quot;, the breath does not become subtle and difficult to observe. 
      If this happens, then the meditator is &#39;concentrating&#39; too much on the 
      breath. Also, the tightness in the head is not relaxed enough. If the 
      breath seems to disappear again, the meditator is focusing their 
      &#39;concentration&#39; and not tranquilizing the mind enough. The jhanas 
      (meditation stages) will appear by themselves as the mind becomes calm and 
      peaceful. The meditator does not have to push, force or &#39;concentrate with 
      a fixed mind&#39;. Actually, the Lord Buddha taught a most natural form of 
      meditation that works for every type of personality or individual. </FONT>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When one starts their meditation session, 
      they first close their eyes. This is being secluded from the sensual 
      pleasure of seeing. When a sound distracts the mind, the instructions are 
      to let the sound be there by itself, without thinking about whether one 
      likes the sound or not. Simply let the sound go... let go of the mental 
      fist around the sound... relax the tightness in the head, feel the mind 
      become calm and at ease... redirect the attention back to the object of 
      meditation, i.e., the breath. Relax the tightness in the head, feel the 
      mind open up, expand and become tranquil on the in-breath, relax the 
      tightness in the head on the out-breath, feel the mind become open,

      the distraction ... loosen the tightness in the head, open and expand the 
      mind,... redirect the attention back to the breath again. It doesn&#39;t 
      matter how many times the sensual pleasure arises. One has to allow it to 
      be there everytime it arises. Just remember to let it go... loosen the

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When the mind is distracted from the 
      breath and begins to think about feelings that arise, there is a tendency 
      for the mind to like or dislike that feeling. This thinking about and 
      trying to control feelings by thinking about them, causes the feeling to 
      get bigger and more intense. Thus, more pain arises. This mind/body 
      process is made up of five different aggregates which are affected by 
      clinging. The meditator has a physical body, feelings (both mental and 
      physical), perception (recognition}, volition or thoughts or free will and 
      consciousness. By seeing this, one can clearly observe that feelings are 
      one thing and thoughts are another. Unfortunately, all of us has developed 
      the habit of trying to think our feelings away. This only makes the 
      feelings bigger and more intense. As a result, more pain and suffering 
      arise. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When one practices the Lord Buddha&#39;s 
      meditation method, they must understand and let go this old habit of 
      thinking. Thus, when a feeling arises, no matter whether it is physical or 
      emotional, first, let go of that tight mental fist around the feeling... 
      now relax the tightness in the head... feel the mind expand, then become 
      calm and tranquil... next redirect the attention back to the breath. When 
      one does this, they are seeing the true nature of that feeling: It wasn&#39;t 
      there... now it arose by itself, i.e. change or impermanence. One 
      certainly does not request for this incredibly painful sensation to arise, 
      nor do they ask at that time to feel angry, sad, fearful, depressed, 
      doubtful or whatever the catch of the day happens to be. These feelings 
      arise by themselves, without one&#39;s desire for them to arise. They last as 
      long as they last. The more one tries to control, fight, or push away 
      these feelings, the more they stay and become very much bigger and extra 
      intense. This is because whenever one wants to control the feeling, they 
      are identifying with that sensation or emotion as being theirs personally. 
      One tends to think about -- how much it hurts, where did it come from, why 
      does it have to bother them now, &quot;Oh! I hate that feeling and want it to 
      go away&quot;. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Every thought about the feeling is the 
      ego-identification with that feeling. Everytime one tries to resist what 
      is happening in the present moment, they are fighting with the <I>Dhamma 
      of the Present Moment. </I>When a painful or even a pleasant feeling 
      arises, the Truth is -- it is there. Any resistance, trying to control, 
      wishing it away with thoughts, or fighting that feeling in any way, only 
      causes more suffering to arise. Actually whenever a feeling arises, one 
      opens the mind ... lets go of the want to control ... lovingly-accepts the 
      fact that this feeling is there, and allows it to be there by itself. <B>
      <I>Don&#39;t Resist Or Push. Soften</I></B>...&nbsp; This DROPS is the key to 
      having an accepting and open mind which leads to the development of 
      equanimity. Any slightest resistance or tightness means that there is some 
      ego-identification still attached to it. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let&#39;s say that a friend came up and 
      scolded you in the early morning after you went to work. What happened to 
      your mind? If you were like most people you scolded them back because you 
      were angry and fighting. When the friend went away, what did you think 
      about? What you said... what your friend said... what you should have 
      said... I&#39;m right for feeling the way I do and for what I said... they are 
      wrong for what they said and did... And so it went. This feeling of anger 
      is strong and there are thoughts which are attached to that feeling.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After a little while you distract yourself 
      with some other activities. But the anger is still there and if someone 
      comes to talk to you, chances are good that you will complain about your 
      other friend who scolded you. Thus, at that time you are giving your 
      dissatisfaction and anger to someone else and that affects them in a 
      negative way. At different times during the day, these feelings and the 
      thoughts that you are attached to them, arise. As a matter of fact, these 
      thoughts are just like they were recorded on a cassette tape. They come 
      back in the same order and with exactly the same words. After the end of 
      the day you would have distracted yourself such that this feeling doesn&#39;t 
      come up so often. Then comes the time to sit in meditation and purify the 
      mind. But what arises? This feeling of anger, and the associate thoughts! 
      Thus, here we go again. But this time, as you let go of getting involved 
      with those feelings and thoughts, you begin to let them go. Seeing that 
      these thoughts cause the feeling to grow, the meditator begins to soften 
      the mind. Never mind, it just isn&#39;t that important&quot;... Soften... &quot;Let it 
      be&quot;... open the mind and let go of that tight mental knot around these 
      thoughts... let go of the aversion to the feeling... feel the mind begin 
      to expand then relax... now loosen the tightness in the head... feel the 
      mind become calm, what relief! Now gently go back to the breath... on the 
      in-breath loosen the tightness in the head... on the out-breath relax the 
      tightness in the head... always feeling the mind open up, expand, and 
      become tranquil. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then the anger comes up again, and so, 
      again you do the same thing... let it be there by itself without getting 
      involved with the thinking about it... open and relax the mental hold of 
      it... loosen the tightness in the head... softly redirect the attention 
      back to the breath again. It doesn&#39;t matter how many times the mind goes 
      back to that feeling of anger. It is treated in the same way everytime. 
      One is not taking that feeling personally when they let the feeling be 
      there by itself. Thus, there is no ego-identification with that feeling. 
      This is seeing the true nature of that feeling, isn&#39;t it? The feeling 
      wasn&#39;t there before, but now it is. This is seeing impermanence. When that 
      feeling arises, it takes away the tranquility and peace. That is 
      definitely painful, a true form of suffering. When one allows the feeling 
      to be there by itself without getting involved or thinking about it, open 
      their mind and relax the tightness away, they are experiencing the 
      not-self nature at that time. Thus, when one practices &quot;Tranquil Wisdom 
      Meditation&quot;, they do experience the three characteristics of existence: 
      impermanence, suffering, and not-self. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As one continues to loosen the mind and 
      let go of any distraction, the attachment becomes smaller and weaker. 
      Finally it doesn&#39;t have enough strength to arise any more. When this 
      happens, the mind becomes filled with relief and joy. <I>This letting go 
      of attachment is being secluded from unwholesome states.</I> When one lets 
      go and the joy arises, it lasts for a period of time. As a result, the 
      mind becomes very tranquil and peaceful. The meditator experiences a mind 
      which stays on the object of meditation very easily. When this is done 
      repeatedly, the mind will naturally become calm and composed by itself. At 
      that time, one begins to develop some equanimity and balance of mind.

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">All of these different factors make up 
      what is commonly called the first jhana (meditation stage). At that time 
      there can still exists some very little wandering thoughts. If the mind 
      wanders away from the breath and the meditator relaxes the mind, the 
      wandering thoughts are noticed very quickly. Simply let go... relax the 
      tightness before coming back to the breath. Some meditation teachers call 
      this access concentration. But actually they are looking at things from 
      the viewpoint of &quot;concentration meditation&quot; and not &quot;Tranquil Wisdom 
      Meditation&quot;. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applied and Sustained Thought are 
      descriptions of the thinking mind and discursive thinking (wandering 
      thought). Some translations call initial and sustained thought as thinking 
      and pondering. There can still be directed thoughts in each one of the 
      different jhanas (meditation stages). The difference between directed 
      thought and wandering thoughts is: With wandering thoughts, one thinks 
      about what happened in the past or what will happen in the future, or 
      daydream about what they would like to see. Directed thought is about what 
      is happening in the present moment. These are observation thoughts i.e., 
      mind feels very happy right now, or mind is very calm, or body feels very 
      still and peaceful right now, etc. There is also another way of looking at 
      Applied and Sustained Thought. Applied Thought is the mind that notices 
      when the mind is distracted and brings the attention back to the breath. 
      Sustained Thought is the mind that stays on the breath without slipping 
      away again. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When the mind begins to stay on the object 
      of meditation for longer and longer periods of time, the relief and joy 
      will become quite strong. One will naturally feel like smiling because the 
      joy is such a pleasurable feeling in both the mind and body. At that time, 
      the body and mind feels very light until it is almost like floating. This 
      is quite a nice and pleasant experience. Some meditation teachers tell 
      their students that when joy arises, <I>&quot;Don&#39;t Be Attached!&quot;</I> Thus, 
      these students become fearful of that joy and try to push it away so that 
      they won&#39;t possibly have the chance to become attached. However, this is 
      not the correct thing to do because it doesn&#39;t matter what kind of feeling 
      that arises, either pleasurable or unpleasurable or neutral, their job is 
      to see that the mind stays on the breath and opening then relaxing their 
      mind. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If the mind is pulled away by a feeling, 
      simply let it be there by itself and relax the tightness in the head, feel 
      the mind open and expand, then go back to the breath. Attachment or 
      craving comes from getting involved with liking or disliking what arises 
      in the present moment whereas clinging is the thinking about it. One will 
      not become attached when they allow whatever arises to be there by itself, 
      then come back to the object of meditation. After the joy fades away, the 
      mind will become very calm, peaceful and comfortable. It is this 
      comfortable and tranquil feeling that is called <I>happiness born of 
      seclusion.</I> At first, one can sit in this stage of meditation for ten 
      or fifteen minutes and longer with practice. This is the first jhana 
      (meditation stage) and it will arise when one has let go of sensual 
      pleasure for a period of time, and have also let go of unwholesome habits 
      or states of mind which stops the meditator from having a mind without 
      distractions in it. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When one has experienced this state of 
      calm, they begin to realize the reasons that they are meditating. At that 
      time, the mind, is nicely composed and happy with very few distractions. 
      There is more peace of mind than has ever been experienced before. Thus, 
      after that experience, one becomes enthusiastic and wants it to happen 
      every time they sit. BUT, that very desire to have those calm states of 
      mind is the very thing which stops them from arising! They then try even 
      harder and put in more effort. Unfortunately, the mind only becomes more 
      and more restless and unsettled. This is due to the desire for something 
      to happen in a particular way. When it doesn&#39;t happen that way, one pushes 
      harder and tries to force things to be calm and tranquil. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As a result, one can&#39;t experience this 
      calm stage of meditation due to the attachment of wanting things to occur 
      as they want. This desire causes one to lean out of the present moment and 
      to try to make the next present moment the way they want it to be. When 
      that present moment isn&#39;t right, they try even harder. However, this calm 
      state of mind will occur when it occurs. Just relax and let go of that 
      strong desire, calm down and stop expecting things to work according to 
      one&#39;s own desires and attachments. After the first experience of jhana (a 
      meditation stage), the mind may become quite active the next lime one sits 
      in meditation. But, their mindfulness is sharp and is able to recognize 
      when the mind goes away quickly. Then they let it go, open the mind up, 
      and return the attention back to the breath. Calming and opening on the 
      in-breath, calming and loosening the mind on the out-breath... Before 
      long, the mind will settle down again and the joy will arise again. When 
      it fades away, one will again experience that comfortable happy feeling, 
      as well as a mind that is still and at ease. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At this time, one still has the experience 
      of all the five aggregates affected by clinging. They can still hear 
      things, or have feelings arise in the body. For example, they would know 
      when a mosquito lands on them. One may have some thoughts about that 
      mosquito, but they quickly recognize that this is a distraction and let it 
      go... loosen the tension in the head and mind, then softly come back to 
      the breath. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As one continues to open and calm the mind 
      on the in and out breath, eventually they will arrive at a stage where 
      there are no more wandering thoughts. The joy is a little stronger, and 
      lasts a little longer. When it fades away, the comfortable feeling of 
      happiness is stronger and the calm mind goes deeper into the breath. This 
      state is described as: </FONT></P>

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The stilling of applied and sustained 
      thought means that at that time, the mind becomes very still and stays on 
      the object of meditation quite nicely. There is no discursive thinking 
      about the past or future. However, there can still be observation 
      thoughts. Remember that true meditation is silent, open observation. There 
      is still feeling in the body as all of the sense doors are working. But, 
      for example, if a sound arises, it doesn&#39;t make the mind shake of move. 
      One knows where they are and what they are doing. The self-confidence 
      mentioned in the sutta, comes from the confidence one gains when they see 
      clearly for themselves how well the meditation works. The self-confidence 
      not only arises when one is sitting in meditation but, also during the 
      daily activities too. The singleness of mind means that the mind is very 
      calm and doesn&#39;t run around. It is contented to stay on the breath and 
      keep opening and loosening on the in and out breaths. These are the 
      description of the first two jhanas (meditation stages). </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As one continues onwards with their 
      practice and keep calming and opening the mind, eventually they reach a 
      stage where the feeling of joy becomes too coarse and it naturally won&#39;t 
      arise any more. This is always a rather comical time for the teacher 
      because the meditator comes to the teacher and says: </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Student: &#39;There&#39;s something wrong with my 
      meditation!&#39; <BR>
      Teacher: &#39;Why do you say that?&#39; <BR>
      Student: &#39;I don&#39;t feel anymore joy&#39;, <BR>
      Teacher: &#39;Is that bad?&#39; <BR>
      Student: &#39;No, of course not, but still I don&#39;t feel anymore joy, why?&#39; <BR>
      Teacher: &#39;Do you feel comfortable and more calm than ever before, does 
      your mind have a strong sense of balance in it, do you feel very much at 
      ease?&#39; <BR>
      Student: &#39;Yes, I feel all of that, but I don&#39;t feel anymore joy!&#39; <BR>
      Teacher: &#39;Good, continue. Everything is going along just fine. Relax and 
      stop demanding that joy arises when you want it to.&#39; </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The joy fades away by itself, and a very 
      strong sense of balance and calm becomes quite apparent. One can still 
      hear sounds, and even though the body seems to disappear, at times one 
      would know if someone were to touch them during their sitting meditation. 
      However, the mind does not get distracted by it. This is what it means 
      when the sutta says the meditator has full awareness. It is described as:

        of joy, a Bhikkhu abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware,

        abides in the third jhana (meditation stage), on account of which noble 
        one&#39;s announce: &#39;He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With the description above, one can 
      plainly see that being in the third jhana (meditation stage), the mind is 
      very clear, alert and balanced. They are aware of what is happening around 
      them, but the mind stays on the object of meditation easily and 
      comfortably. Being alert (being mindful) and having equanimity in the mind 
      is an unusual thing to experience because this state of meditation is the 
      highest and best feeling that they have ever experienced in their whole 
      life. Furthermore, one is not attached to it due to the strong equanimity.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At the same time, the body and mind is 
      exceptionally relaxed and at ease. what a nice state to be in! This is why 
      this state is praised by noble ones. Besides this easing of the tightness 
      in the head, the body looses tension and the feeling of sensations begins 
      to disappear. This is because the tightness in the mind causes tension in 
      the body. But now, the mind is so comfortable and tension free that the 
      tension in the sensation of the body goes away too. When this happens, the 
      body becomes so soft and comfortable that there is nothing to feel. 
      However, one is aware if anyone were to touch them. This is the meaning of 
      being mindful and fully aware. The mind knows what is happening around it 
      but it just does not shake or becomes disturbed. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is what one calls experiencing 
      happiness on the in and out breath. Some &quot;Fixed Concentration Meditation&quot; 
      teachers say that when one is in this state of jhana, the meditator can no 
      longer experience the body or any of the sense doors. They claim that the 
      meditator will not know if someone were to hit them with a stick or 
      someone were to change their positions of their hands and feet. This is 
      because their mind is so deeply absorbed into the object that they can&#39;t 
      be fully aware. This is clearly not true if one were to read the suttas or 
      when practicing &quot;Tranquil Wisdom Meditation&quot;. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As one continues calming, expanding and 
      relaxing the mind, it naturally begins to go deeper. Finally the feeling 
      of pleasure in the body/mind becomes too coarse and the mind experiences 
      exceptional equanimity and balance of mind. It is described thus in the 
      suttas: </FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>Here with the abandoning of pleasure 
        and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a Bhikkhu

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When the mind becomes very calm and still, 
      one experiences deep tranquility and equanimity of mind. They can still 
      hear sounds and feel sensations with the body, but these things do not 
      shake or move mind at all. Another description of this stage of meditation 
      (jhana) is: </FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;My composed mind was purified, 
        bright, unblemished, rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady and 
        attained to imperturbability.&quot;</I></FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This gives the serious meditator an idea 
      of what to expect when one attains this stage. The mind is exceptionally 
      clear, bright and alert. The mind can even see when a distraction begins 
      to arise, then let it go and open up, expand and calm down again before 
      coming back to the breath. The abandoning of pain and pleasure does not 
      mean that occasionally pain or pleasure won&#39;t arise. They will arise, but 
      the mind is in such a state of balance that it won&#39;t shake or become 
      involved with the distractions. At that time the mind is very aware when 
      pain or pleasure arises but the equanimity and mindfulness is so strong 
      that it does not become concerned with it. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With the previous disappearance of joy and 
      grief means one&#39;s mind has let go of the lower emotional states of liking 
      and disliking. All of the stages of the lower jhanas (meditation states) 
      involves letting go of emotional states of mind. At first, when one begins 
      to learn about meditation, they let go of very low coarse states which 
      frequently moves the mind. After they begin to learn how to calm the mind, 
      they can sit for longer periods of time without any distractions arising. 
      One then experiences the initial and sustained applications of mind and 
      the other jhana factors. When the mind settles deeper, the initial and 
      sustain application of the mind disappears. The joy becomes stronger for a 
      while but gradually it becomes too coarse and the mind has too much 
      movement in it. Thus, the mind will naturally go even deeper into the 
      object of meditation and the joy fades away by itself. At this time there 
      is equanimity, happiness, mindfulness and full awareness in the mind. All 
      these states of mind are very pleasant experiences. But eventually, the 
      happiness is too coarse a feeling and so, the mind goes deeper into the 
      breath and at the same time, continues opening, expanding and relaxing. At 
      this point the breath and the relaxing of the mind begin to arise 
      together. Then the happiness fades away and all that remains in the mind 
      is strong equanimity, exceptional mindfulness, and composure of mind. This 
      is how one experiences and tranquilizes the mental formations. As 
      Krishnamurti describes the true meditative state, &quot;A meditative mind is 
      silent. It is not the silence which thoughts can conceive of; it is not 
      the silence of a still evening; it is the silence when thoughts, with all 
      its images, its words and perceptions have entirely ceased. This 
      meditative mind is the religious mind -- the religion that is not touched 
      by the church, the temples or by chants.&quot; </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At this time, one&#39;s mind become very calm 
      and any slightest disturbances is noticed and is let go quickly and 
      easily. First, the mind lets go of tightness... now it goes back to the 
      breath... opening, expanding and calming on the in-breath... loosening, 
      stretching out and relaxing the mind on the out-breath. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When one reach this stage of meditation, 
      they begin to experience a finer and more exalted type of joy, which is 
      described as the Joy (Pharana Piti) Enlightenment Factor. The mind becomes 
      very peacefully happy and at ease like never before. This is called 
      gladdening the mind because it is such a pleasurable state to be in. At 
      that time, the mind is exceptionally uplifted, very clear and the 
      mindfulness is sharper than ever before. The equanimity is even more 
      balanced and composed. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><I>&quot;He trains thus: &#39;I shall breathe in

      mind.&#39;</I></B> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At this time, the mind becomes more subtle 
      and calm, with very few distractions. When they do arise, they are quickly 
      noticed, let go of, calm the mind and return back to the breath. 
      Naturally, the breath and the calming of the mind becomes easier and more 
      serene. They happen together naturally at the same time. </FONT></P>

      mind.&#39;</I></B> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Liberating the mind means that one stays 
      on the breath with enough joyful interest such that when the mind begins 
      to move or go away from the breath, they are aware and let the 
      distractions go without any identifying. One then relaxes the mind before 
      coming back to the breath. When a hindrance arises, one sees it quickly 
      and let it go without hesitation. At this point sloth and torpor, or 
      restlessness and anxiety, are the biggest obstacles to one&#39;s practice. 
      Whenever a hindrance arises, it will knock one out of the jhana and can 
      cause all kinds of disturbances. The phrase liberating the mind also means 
      to let go of the lower jhanas (meditation stages) and all of the jhana 
      factors by not being attached (thinking about and identifying with) them 
      in any way. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As one continues with their practice of 
      meditation on the breath, plus calming and expanding the mind, eventually 
      the mind becomes very deep and then they begin to notice that the mind is 
      expanding and getting bigger. Silence and spaciousness of mind go 
      together. The immensity of silence is the immensity of the mind in which a 
      center does not exist; actually speaking at this time, there is no center 
      and there is no outer edges. It continually grows and expands. One begins 
      to see that there are no boundaries, and space and mind are infinite. The 
      Anupada Sutta, Sutta Number 111 in Majjhima Nikiya, described this as;

        space. And the states in the base of infinite space -- the perception of

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Passing beyond perceptions of form, means 
      that even though one knows that they have a body at that time, this 
      awareness would not readily pull our mind towards it. In this state of 
      jhana (meditation stage), they are very aware of the mind and what it is 
      doing. The disappearance of all sense resistance and non-attraction to the 
      perceptions of change means even though a pain arises in the body, one 
      knows it but does not get involved with that sensation. They feel the mind 
      growing, changing and expanding but, they are not distracted from the 
      breath or the relaxing of the mind. The meditator&#39;s mind is continually 
      moving and expanding but their mind accepts this as it truly is. Seeing 
      impermanence and how one&#39;s mind changes and expands, one realizes that 
      this phenomena is part of an impersonal process which they have no 
      control. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As one continues on with the practice of 
      opening and calming the mind on the in-breath and the out-breath, they 
      will eventually start to see consciousness arising and passing away. It is 
      continually coming up and going away, arising and passing away, without a 
      break! The consciousness keeps coming into being, then vanishing in all 
      the sense doors. This is described in the Anupada Sutta as: </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When one is in this state of infinite 
      consciousness, there can still arise some hindrances like torpor or 
      dullness of mind, or restlessness. These hindrances arise because the 
      energy that they put into their practice isn&#39;t quite correct. When there 
      is too little energy, one experiences dullness (rarely does the meditator 
      have sleepiness at this time). On the other hand, if they try too hard or 
      put too much energy into the practice, restlessness will arise. Both of 
      these hindrances will knock one out of the jhana while they are present in 
      the mind. When one is in this state, they see change happen so rapidly and 
      continually, that it becomes very tiresome. They begin to see just how 
      much unsatisfactoriness arises with each consciousness. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus, one sees from first hand, 
      impermanence, suffering, and they know that they have no control over 
      these events. They happen by themselves. As a result, one sees the 
      not-self nature of this psycho-physical process. This is how one 
      contemplates impermanence. It is not done by thinking about it, but by 
      realizing it through their own personal experience. </FONT></P>

      the realm of &#39;nothingness&#39;. This is when there is no external thing for

      too lax or too energetic. It is here that the Seven Enlightenment Factors 
      become very important. They can be seen one by one as they occur. When 
      torpor arises, one must put the mind back into balance by arousing the 
      enlightenment factor of mindfulness, investigation of one&#39;s experience, 
      energy, and joy. If restlessness arises, one must arouse the enlightenment 
      factors of mindfulness, tranquility, stillness, and equanimity. (More will 
      be discussed later.) At this time, the mind becomes very subtle and 
      tricky. It becomes very interesting to see the subtle ways it distracts

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The mind becomes so small and has such 
      little movement, that it is sometimes difficult to know whether there is a 
      mind or not. It is also difficult to know if there is perception of a 
      mind. This extremely fine state of mind is not easy to attain, yet it is 
      attainable if one continues on with their practice of calming and 
      expanding the mind when they know that mind is present. At this time, one 
      cannot see the breath any longer, but there are still some feelings which 
      arise. This is when one begins to sit for long periods of time. At this 
      time, the meditation is the total tranquilizing and releasing of all 
      energy. Also one must be innocent of time, the longer one sits the better. 
      One begins to sit for three, four or five hours and this can be extended 
      during retreats or at home with one&#39;s daily practice. This is because it

      their practice and keep opening, expanding and calming their mind, the 
      subtly becomes very fine and the mind does not move at all. Eventually one

      comes back and is noticed. With the seeing of the final ignorance, there 
      is a change in the mind. It becomes dispassionate, and completely lets go 
      of the belief in a permanent unchanging self or soul. This is the only way 
      one can experience the supramundane state of nibbana, that is by seeing 
      directly all of the links of Dependent Origination. This is why&nbsp; it 
      is called the &#39;Doctrine of Awakening&#39;. The Anupada Sutta description is as 
      follows: </FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;Again, by completely surmounting the 
        base of neither-perception nor non-perception, the Bhikkhu enters upon 
        and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling. And his taints 
        are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom.</I></FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When one is in the state of the cessation 
      of perception and feeling, they will not know that they are in it. Why? It 
      is because they do not have any perception or feeling at all! It is like 
      all the lights were turned off on a very dark night. At that time one can 
      not see anything at all, not even if they were to put their hands in front 
      of their faces. This state is similar as there is no perception or feeling 
      at all. One may sit in this state for a period of time. When the 
      perception and feeling comes back, and if their mindfulness is sharp 
      enough, they will see directly the Second Noble Truth or the cause of 
      suffering (i.e., the cause and effect relationship of dependent 
      origination). When one has seen all of them then, they will see directly 
      the Third Noble Truth or the cessation of suffering (i.e., how all of 
      these links cease to be and how letting go of one leads directly to the 
      letting go of another). This is automatically seen by the meditator. It 
      does not matter whether they have studied dependent origination or not. 
      This is direct knowledge, not memorized or studied knowledge. The 
      statement: &#39;And his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom&#39; means 
      seeing and realizing all of the Noble Truths directly. It was said, &quot;if 
      one sees dependent origination, they see the Second and Third Noble 
      Truth.&quot; But in order to see the origin of suffering one has to know what 
      suffering is! Thus, if one sees the ceasing of the suffering i.e., the 
      Third Noble Truth, they naturally see the Fourth Noble Truth. One must 
      practice the way leading to the cessation of the suffering in order to see 
      the other three Noble Truths. And this is the Fourth Noble Truth. Thus, 
      seeing Dependent Origination directly, means that one sees and realizes 
      all of the Noble Truths. This is how one contemplates relinquishment.

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The <I>&#39;on whatever occasion&#39;, </I>is very 
      interesting and has far reaching implications. &#39;On whatever occasion&#39; does 
      not mean only while sitting in meditation, but, all of the time. During 
      one&#39;s daily activities, when the mind becomes heavy and full of thoughts, 
      one notices it, simply lets go of the thoughts, calms and loosens the 
      tightness in the mind, feels the mind expand and becomes tranquil then 
      goes back to the breath for one or two breaths. This will help greatly in 
      calming the mind and to improve our mindfulness during one&#39;s daily 
      activities. This is definitely a practical way to practice one&#39;s daily 
      activities and improve their awareness of states of consciousness. 
      Everytime one does this during their daily activities, it brings a kind of 
      awareness and perspective into their lives. It becomes easier to see the 
      three characteristics of existence, impermanence, suffering, and not-self 
      nature, even while working or playing. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The statement, &#39;On whatever occasion&#39;, 
      extends into one&#39;s walking meditation as well. Instead of putting the 
      attention on one&#39;s feet, (as some meditation teachers recommend), they can 
      still keep their attention on the mind, relaxing on the in and out breath, 
      while walking. This is mindfulness of body (the breath body) and can even 
      extend into other activities. The mindfulness of mind objects is a very 
      important aspect to be aware of and is much easier to watch than the 
      physical body. It is easy to tell when the mind is tight and tense. At 
      that time one can relax, loosen the tightness in the head then come back 
      to the breath for one or two breaths, if they do not have time to do more 
      right then. Remember that the first and second verses in the Dhammapada,
      <I>&quot;Mind is the forerunner of all (good and bad) states. Mind is chief; 
      mind-made are they.&quot;</I> Everything follows the mind, be it happiness or 
      suffering. By trying to follow all the movements of the body, one cannot 
      see the mind clearly enough to realize the tightness caused by that 
      movement and consciousness. Thus, directly being aware of the mind and all 
      of its movements and tendencies to tighten was what the Lord Buddha 
      intended, when he said &quot;On any occasion&quot;. </FONT></P>

      Being ardent means working hard, or being ever alert. Fully aware and 
      mindful, is pertaining to the alertness of the mind when it is in the

      one is in the &quot;Tranquility jhanas&quot;, they are very aware of what is 
      happening around them and their mindfulness is sharp and clear. One is 
      able to observe all of the mind states, feelings, sensation, or

      interested in the breath and the other things which arise. One also knows 
      when the mindfulness is dull, not sharp, and mind tends to be a little 
      bored or disinterested. When that happens, one knows that they must 
      pick-up their interest and see how everything that arises is truly 
      different. One then sees how every breath is different, never exactly the

      arises, whether it is any of the five hindrances, or an emotional state, 
      or a physical feeling, they impersonally examine it with interest. This is 
      done by not getting involved with thinking about that phenomenon, but only 
      observing it, allowing it to be there, then letting it go mentally -- by 
      opening up that tight mental fist which hardenly grabs it, relax, expand 
      and allow that distraction to be there by itself without thinking about it 
      ... loosening the tightness in the mind/head ... then redirecting the 
      attention back to the breath. Everytime the mind is pulled, one tries to 
      see the different aspects about that distraction. Then let it go, relax 
      the mind and come back to the breath. In this way, they can become more 
      familiar with the distraction and able to recognize it more quickly. This

      happen to get involved with the joy, it will go away very quickly. As a 
      result, they will most likely experience sleepiness or sloth and torpor

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These first four enlightenment factors are 
      very important when one experiences sloth and torpor. Sloth means 
      sleepiness and torpor means dullness of mind. When one gets into the 
      fourth jhana and above, the two main hindrances which arise are 
      restlessness and torpor. However, when one brings up the investigation 
      factor of enlightenment and examines this torpor, they have to use more 
      energy and this helps to overcome this dullness. When one gets into the 
      higher jhanas they must learn to fine tune their practice little by 
      little. By being familiar with these enlightenment factors, one will learn 
      how to eventually balance all of the factors. This directly leads to the 
      supramundane state of Nibbana. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The most important key for success in 
      meditation is the first enlightenment factor of mindfulness. Without 
      mindfulness, one cannot possibly reach any of these meditation stages. 
      Mindfulness is the main key to overcome both sloth and torpor, and 
      restlessness. Remember these hindrances can come at any time and knock the 
      meditator right out of any of the meditation stages, even up to the realm 
      of neither-perception nor non-perception. Thus, one must be very careful 
      to recognize these enlightenment factors and skillful in learning how to 
      use them when it is appropriate. The next three enlightenment factors are 
      important to overcome restlessness. </FONT></P>

      (meditation stages). After a while, the joy fades a little and one&#39;s mind 
      becomes exceptionally calm and peaceful. This state is called the 
      enlightenment factor of tranquility. At that time, one&#39;s body and mind 
      become extraordinarily peaceful and calm. The Satipatthana Sutta describes

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As one&#39;s mind and body become more 
      tranquil and at ease, the mind stays on the breath and the expanding mind 
      more naturally, without any distractions. It is much easier to open and 
      relax the mind with each in and out breath. The mind is definitely 
      composed and unruffled by any external or internal distractions. There 
      comes a time when mind prefers to stay still on the meditation object, 
      without undue force or trying to concentrate. It stays on the breath for 
      very long periods of time. Of course, at this time, there is very sharp 
      mindfulness and full awareness. One still has full awareness even when 
      they reach the realm of nothingness. The mind does not waver or move away 
      from the breath even though one hears sounds or knows that a mosquito has 
      landed on them. The mindfulness of breathing and stillness are very clear 
      and sharp to observe. When one is in the realm of nothingness, they can 
      explore and watch many different aspects of the mind. Their mind is also 
      very clear, even though one is in the lower meditation stages. Since one&#39;s 
      mind is still, they can observe things quite clearly, too. This can be 
      called the action of silence. When the mind is absolutely silent, it is 
      the blessing that everyone is seeking. In this silence, every quality of 
      silence is perfection of the present moment. The Satipatthana&nbsp; Sutta 
      describes this as: </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The equanimity enlightenment factor is 
      again, a very important factor to develop. It balances the mind when it 
      becomes unsettled. The equanimity enlightenment factor is the only factor 
      which allows the mind to lovingly-accept whatever arises in the present 
      moment. For example, if there arise any kinds of pain (physical or 
      emotional), it doesn&#39;t distract the meditator. The equanimity 
      enlightenment factor is the factor which helps one to see things 
      impersonally and without the ego-identification of getting involved with 
      distractions. It is the seeing of what arises in the moment, then going 
      beyond it with balance. The seeing of anatta (not-self) is the very thing 
      which allows one to progress rapidly along the Lord Buddha&#39;s Path. But one 
      must be somewhat careful with equanimity because it is often mistaken to 
      be indifference. Indifference has some dissatisfaction and aversion in it, 
      but not equanimity. Equanimity has only openness and complete acceptance 
      of everything that arises in the present moment. Equanimity opens the mind 
      totally. Indifference closes it, and tries to ignore what is happening in 
      the moment. The Satipatthana Sutta describes it thus: </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These last three enlightenment factors, 
      tranquility, stillness, and equanimity factors, will greatly assist one 
      when restlessness arises in the mind. Restlessness makes the mind think 
      many thoughts and causes lots of unpleasant feelings to arise in the body. 
      As a result, one feels like breaking their meditation and distracting 
      themselves in one way or another. To say the least, it is a very hard mind 
      that causes suffering to he more noticeable. The only way to overcome 
      restlessness is by developing stillness of mind and tranquility of body. 
      When the mind has restlessness in it, there is no balance of mind at all. 
      Instead, there is a lot of ego-identification with that terrible feeling. 
      Thus, to overcome this hindrance, one has to allow it to be there by 
      itself and still the mind. By bringing forth the stillness, tranquility, 
      and equanimity enlightenment factors and focusing the mind on these 
      different factors, they will overcome the restlessness. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The two major hindrances that always seem 
      to trouble meditators are torpor, or dullness of mind, and restlessness or 
      over activity of mind. One had better become friends with these two 
      hindrances, because they will stay around until one becomes an arahat. 
      Thus, the sooner we drop all resistance to these states when they arise 
      and begin to explore them with joyful interest, the faster we will be able 
      to recognize them. As a result, we will be able to let them go faster and 
      return into the jhana (meditation stage). </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Some meditators get up very early in the

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><I>41- &quot;And how, Bhikkhus, do the Seven 
      Enlightenment Factors, developed and cultivated, fulfill true knowledge

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><I>42- &quot;Here, Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu 
      develops the mindfulness enlightenment factor, which is supported by 
      seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, and ripens in relinquishment.</I></B>
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The term &quot;supported by seclusion&quot; means 
      that one must gain the lowest jhana (meditation stage). As was stated 
      above, the description of the first jhana starts with &quot;to be secluded from 
      sensual pleasure, then to be secluded from unwholesome states&quot;. At that 
      time, the mind is alert and stays on the object of meditation with 
      clarity, i.e. no distractions. If a distraction begins to arise, the 
      mindfulness recognizes that and lets it go. Next, the description says the 
      happiness experienced comes about by being born of seclusion. This is how 
      one&#39;s mindfulness enlightenment factor is supported by seclusion. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Dispassion means the mind is free from 
      attachments and clinging, i.e., not thinking or analyzing. Gaining to the 
      fourth jhana (meditation stage) means to reach a stage of having an 
      imperturbable mind, or a mind that has such strong equanimity that it 
      becomes dispassionate. This is how one&#39;s mindfulness enlightenment factor 
      is supported by dispassion. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Cessation here means the ceasing of 
      defilements and ego-identification with what arises. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Being mindful is a term that always had a 
      kind of slippery meaning and it is not what most people think. Its meaning 
      is very simple and precise when it is seen as observing mind, or 
      attention, or alertness of attention. Being truly mindful means to see 
      what the mind is doing at all times, then let go of the things that cause 
      tension to arise in the head, relax and tranquilize both body and mind. It 
      includes observing how this whole process works and allows it to be, 
      without getting involved in the drama of things. Not getting involved with 
      the drama of things means, to not identify with, or take personally this 
      impersonal process or try to control the present moment. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Being mindful means to lovingly open one&#39;s 
      mind and let go of all identification with that distraction, then relax 
      the tension in the head and in the mind, so that one can see things 
      clearly and calmly. Whenever one tries to resist or control what is 
      happening in the present moment, they are at that time, fighting with the 
      &#39;Dhamma&#39; or &#39;Truth of the Present Moment.&#39; </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This fighting with the reality of the 
      moment causes so much unsatisfactoriness and suffering to arise. However, 
      when one is mindful and see clearly that this is just a phenomena arising 
      and passing away, they can open up and accept it, without hardening their 
      mind or resisting in any way. At this time, joyful interest is very 
      important because when the mind has some joy in it there is no anger, 
      jealousy, aversion, fear, or anxiety, etc. Joyful interest helps the 
      meditator to have the proper perspective of seeing what happens in the 
      moment impersonally. When the mind is uplifted, one sees that whatever 
      arises is just part of a continuing process which they can learn from. Joy 
      causes the mind to be uplifted, which is why it is an enlightenment factor 
      and very important to one&#39;s practice. Also, when joy is in one&#39;s mind, 
      they are pleasant to be around. Remember, the acronym that is very helpful 
      to use is <I>DROPS.</I> It stands for <I>Don&#39;t Resist Or Push</I>, SMILE 
      and Soften the mind and accept everything when it occurs, because that is 
      the &quot;Dhamma of the Moment&quot;. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When one continues on with their practice, 
      their mind will eventually attain to the higher and more subtle stages of 
      meditations (arupa jhanas). At that time, one&#39;s mind experiences the realm 
      of &#39;nothingness&#39;. This is what is called cessation. It is called this 
      because there is nothing more to watch outside of the mind. When one 
      experiences the realm of &#39;nothingness&#39;, their mind is watching nothing. 
      But the mind is still there and the different enlightenment factors can 
      arise along with the five aggregates which are affected by clinging. Also, 
      some hindrances can still arise and knock one out of that exalted state. 
      Thus, there is nothing for the mind to watch outside of itself, and yet, 
      there is still lots to see. This is how one&#39;s mindfulness enlightenment 
      factor is supported by cessation. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When one experiences the realm of 
      neither-perception nor non-perception, and keeps opening and relaxing the 
      mind, eventually they will experience the cessation of perception and 
      feeling (Nirodha-Samapatti). During this occurrence, one will not know 
      this turning off of consciousness because they have no perception or 
      feeling at all! This is the only stage of meditation where this phenomena 
      occurs. This meditation state is still mundane, it is not the Supramundane 
      Nibbana yet. How can one know what is happening without perception or 
      feeling? It is only when the perception and feeling come back, and if the 
      mindfulness is sharp enough, will one sees directly, each and every link 
      of dependent origination forwards, one by one as they occur. Even this is 
      not the Supramundane State of Nibbana. The links are: <I>When ignorance 
      arises then formations arise, when formations arise then consciousness 
      arises, when consciousness arises mentality-materiality arises, when 
      mentality-materiality arises then the six-fold sense base arises, when the 
      six-fold sense base arises contact arises, when contact arises feeling 
      arises, when feeling arises craving arises, when craving arises then 
      clinging arises, when clinging arises then being arises, when being arises 
      birth arises, when birth arises then old age, death arises.</I> </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After this arising phenomenon ends, then 
      one will experience the cessation of the dependent origination, which 
      goes: <I>When old age and death cease then birth ceases, when birth ceases 
      then being ceases, when being ceases clinging ceases, when clinging ceases 
      then craving ceases, when craving ceases feeling ceases, when feeling 
      ceases then contact ceases, when contact ceases the six-fold sense base 
      ceases, when the six-fold sense base ceases then mentality-materiality 
      ceases, when mentality-materiality ceases then consciousness ceases, when 
      consciousness ceases then formations cease, when formations cease then 
      ignorance ceases.</I> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The seeing of dependent origination both 
      forwards and backwards leads the mind to the attainment of the 
      &#39;Supramundane Nibbana&#39;. This is where there is a major change in one&#39;s 
      outlook. One&#39;s mind at that time, becomes dispassionate about the belief 
      in a permanent everlasting ego or self. They see from first hand 
      experiential knowledge, that this is just an impersonal process and there 
      is no one controlling the way phenomena arise. These arise because 
      conditions are right for them to arise. In Buddhist terms, this is called 
      &#39;anatta&#39; or not self nature of existence. One also realizes that no one 
      can possibly attain sainthood by the practice of mere chanting words or 
      phrases or suttas, or the practice of having rites and rituals done for 
      them by someone else or by themselves. One has no more doubt about what is 
      the correct path that leads to the higher stages of purity of mind towards 
      arahatship. This is how one becomes a sotapanna and attains the true path 
      of purification. There is no other way to attain these exalted stages of 
      being. It is only through the realization of the Noble Truths by seeing 
      Dependent Origination.&nbsp; Merely seeing the three characteristics will 
      not now, nor ever be, the experience which leads to the &#39;Supramundane 
      Nibbana&#39;. This is why all of the Buddha&#39;s appear in the world, to show the 
      way to realizing the Noble Truths. </FONT></P>

        this that it was said: &#39;Bhikkhus, this is a &#39;direct path&#39; (some 
        translations say &#39;This is the only way&#39;, but that doesn&#39;t say it in the 
        correct way a direct path or way, says this much more clearly and with 
        less confusion) for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of 
        sorrow and&nbsp; lamentation,&nbsp; for the disappearance of pain and 
        grief, for the attainment of the true way, for the realization of 
        Nibbana -- namely, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness.&#39;&quot;</I></FONT></P>

      <P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>That is what the Blessed One said.

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is a pretty big claim which is not 
      made up by the author. He is only reporting what is in the suttas. When 
      one is serious about the practice of developing their mind through the 
      &#39;Tranquility&#39; of the &#39;Mindfulness of Breathing&#39;, they can reach the final 
      goal. When one reaches the first pleasant abiding (the first jhana) and if 
      they continue on with their practice, they have the potential to attain 
      either the stage of &#39;anagami&#39; or &#39;arahat&#39;. This is what the Lord Buddha 
      said. If one is ardent, and continues without changing or stopping in 
      their practice, then surely they will reach the goal which is described.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Again, remember that the only way to 
      attain the Supramundane Nibbana is by realizing Dependent Origination both 
      forwards and backwards. There is no other way because this is the seeing 
      and realizing of the Four Noble Truths which forms the main teaching of 
      the Lord Buddha. Great fruits and benefits befalls on those who practiced 
      according to the instructions prescribed by the Lord Buddha. </FONT></P>

        talking and idle gossip. The Bhikkhus waited patiently, and quietly 
        doing their own meditation practices of expanding the silent mind and 
        having clear mindfulness while waiting for the Buddha to speak. </FONT>
