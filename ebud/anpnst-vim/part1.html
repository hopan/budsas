      <P>This book may possibly be stirring up a hornet&#39;s nest of indignation 
      and criticism because it gives ideas which go against a unilateral belief 
      that the Lord Buddha taught two separate types of meditation techniques, 
      that is, &quot;Concentration meditation&quot; and &quot;Vipassana Meditation.&quot; This 
      unilateral belief which really means a &quot;one-sided&quot; belief is called 
      &quot;Ekamso-vada&quot; in Pali. It is to take a one-sided stand and maintain that 
      one&#39;s own opinion or view is correct and all other views are wrong. The 
      Lord Buddha advised his disciples to be flexible and not to be angry if 
      someone gives a new or different kind of understanding to his teachings. 
      He taught his true disciples to listen closely to what is being presented, 
      then compare it with what is being taught in the suttas--to see if it is 
      correct or not. The key word here is suttas (not commentaries or 
      sub-commentaries). This admonishment about not getting angry saves his 
      true disciples from polluting their own minds. And in the process of being 
      angry, they would not be able to determine whether the criticism was fair 
      or not. </P>
      <P>In the same way, this book is offered as a clarification of the 
      teachings of the Lord Buddha&#39;s method in practicing meditation. If one 
      holds on to a unilateral belief that &quot;Their way is the only way&quot; to 
      practice meditation, without honestly investigating what is being 
      presented in the suttas, then they may possibly be lead astray. Even the 
      best of intentions can cause one to go away from the Buddha&#39;s teachings, 
      if those teachings are not occasionally questioned, investigated and 
      compared with the suttas. </P>
      <P>The Lord Buddha illustrated the futility and absurdity of unilateral 
      belief and thinking by this story: </P>
      <P>Once upon a time, there was a king who, wishing to amuse himself, 
      ordered the Royal Elephant to be brought before him. He also ordered some 
      blind men, blind from birth, to be brought near the elephant. He then 
      asked these blind men to touch the elephant and gave a description of the 
      elephant to him. </P>
      <P>The man who touched the tail said the elephant was like a broom. The 
      one who touched a leg said it was like a tree. The one who touched the 
      body said it was like a wall. The one who touched the ear said the 
      elephant was like a winnowing fan. Thus, each described the elephant 
      differently, but each was sure that his own version was the true 
      description of the elephant. They did not realize that each one touched 
      only a part of the elephant. Each blind person had only a one-sided truth. 
      They started arguing with each other, each sticking to his own point of 
      view. The argument ended up in quarreling and fighting. The king and his 
      ministers rolled with laughter as the blind men continued to quarrel and 
      fight with each other. </P>
      <P>The Lord Buddha pointed out that meditators, as well as philosophers 
      dispute and quarrel with each other because similarly, they see only 
      one-side of the truth, or have only one way of looking at things. They 
      dogmatically cling to their views, maintaining that they alone have a 
      monopoly of that truth. All of the Buddhas consider and see all sides of 
      the truth. That is why the suttas are so much more important than the 
      commentaries. Although the comments made about a sutta may be helpful, it 
      is absolutely necessary to check what the commentary says against the 
      original sayings of the Buddha. </P>
      <P>This proves that genuine Buddhism is in no way be called unilateral. 
      According to this Buddhist way of thinking, experience is multi-faceted 
      and the Buddhist view is therefore multilateral. If truth is 
      multi-faceted, it cannot be stated in a unilateral way! </P>
      <P>This is why the Buddha said, &quot;I do not dispute with the world, though 
      the world disputes with me. No one who is aware of the whole truth can 
      dispute with this world.&quot; When a person asked the Lord Buddha for his 
      view, he replied that his view was that he did not oppose anyone in the 
      world, whether human, divine or diabolical. If this is the Buddhist 
      position, how can Buddhist meditators come in conflict with each other, or 
      for that matter, with anyone in the world? </P>
      <P>When meditation practitioners become dogmatic, they cease looking for 
      Truth (Dhamma) because dogmatism separates all people, including those who 
      seek to open and purify their minds. This definitely causes conflict and 
      verbal daggers to be thrown. Meditation and mental purification is 
      supposed to teach us love, compassion and tolerance. If this is so, how 
      can dogmatism prevail in the name of Truth? </P>
      <P>The Buddhist position cannot be understood if one is attached to 
      preconceived notions like, &quot;This is the Only Way.&quot; This was why the Lord 
      Buddha opened his teachings with the words, &quot;Open, is the Door to 
      Deathlessness. May those who have little dust in their eyes see clearly, 
      so that they can let go of blind faith.&quot; This idea is illustrated in a Zen 
      Buddhist story: </P>
      <P>Once, a professor went to a Zen Master. He asked him to explain the 
      meaning of Zen. The Master quietly poured a cup of tea. The cup was full 
      but he continued to pour. The professor could not stand this any longer, 
      so he questioned the Master impatiently, &quot;Why do you keep pouring when the 
      cup is full?&quot; &quot;I want to point out to you,&quot; the Master said, &quot;that you are 
      similarly attempting to understand Zen while your mind is full. First, 
      empty your mind of preconceptions before you attempt to understand Zen.&quot;
      </P>
      <P>Please enjoy reading this book with a mind that is open and free from 
      preconceptions.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

      </P>
      <P>Many people are now on a spiritual search for a path that leads their 
      mind to peace and openness. They discovered that the norms of the world 
      which emphasize material happiness, do not actually bring real peace and 
      security. Instead, it leads to more pain and dissatisfaction. To these 
      people, the Lord Buddha&#39;s Noble Eightfold Path exemplifies a simple and 
      contented life. A life that is open and free. He taught the methods to 
      free our minds of lust, hatred and delusion and started by showing his 
      disciples how to have an open mind that expands beyond its present 
      limitations so that one can examine with understanding. In the Kalama 
      Sutta, the Lord Buddha explicitly stated that one should always examine 
      and investigate and not follow any beliefs blindly. All of these 
      admonishments were for the purpose of opening and expanding one&#39;s 
      experience so that they will not be attached to any particular doctrine 
      without thorough investigation. </P>
      <P>This kind of honest inquiry into any particular doctrine opens one&#39;s 
      minds and expands their consciousness. Then, they can see what leads to a 
      close or tight mind and what leads to a mind which is open and clear. One 
      of the many lessons which the Lord Buddha taught is to first, expand our 
      consciousness by the practice of generosity (dana). When a person is 
      miserly, they have a tendency to have a tight and limited mind. Their mind 
      holds on to material things and easily becomes attached to them. 
      Attachment of any form makes the mind uncomfortable and tensed. This 
      tension is the cause of immeasurable pain and suffering (dukkha). Thus, by 
      encouraging the practice of generosity, it teaches one how to have a 
      joyful, open and clear mind, which is never closed or tight. Another form 
      of generosity is the giving of time and energy to help those who are 
      having problems, i.e. to become real friends. This includes helping others 
      to be happy! When one says or performs actions which cause people to 
      smile, it opens one&#39;s mind and then joy arises, not only to the other 
      person but in their own mind as well. This type of practice helps one to 
      expand their mind and let go of the tension. </P>
      <P>The Lord Buddha also emphasized the importance of keeping one&#39;s moral 
      disciplines (sila). There are five moral precepts which release the mind 
      from remorse, anxiety and guilty feelings, when they are continually kept 
      and observed. These precepts are abstaining from killing living beings, 
      abstaining from taking what is not given, abstaining from wrong sexual 
      activities, abstaining from telling lies, and abstaining from taking drugs 
      and alcohol. One&#39;s mind will be tension-free when they keep these simple 
      rules of conduct continually. </P>
      <P>Subsequently, the Lord Buddha taught the methods of meditation 
      (bhavana) or mental development to free the mind from tension. The essence 
      of meditation is to open and calm one&#39;s mind and accept whatever that 
      arises without any tightening at all. And thus, this book of instructions 
      is written for those who are on this noble quest. To a beginner, these 
      instructions may appear confusing and difficult to understand but, one 
      will gradually discover the many benefits when these instructions are 
      followed closely. </P>
      <P>In actual fact, meditation, as taught by the Lord Buddha, is never 
      broken into different types, as is commonly practiced today. It is never 
      deep concentration in any of its forms, that is, fixed or absorption 
      concentration (appana samadhi), access or neighborhood concentration&nbsp; 
      (upacara&nbsp; samadhi)&nbsp; or&nbsp; moment-to-moment concentration 
      (khanika samadhi) --which actually brings tightness to the mind and 
      suppresses the hindrances. The &#39;concentration&#39; meditation is a form of 
      suppression, a kind of cutting off at one&#39;s experience which causes a kind 
      of resistance to arise in one&#39;s mind. As a result, there is a conflict 
      with reality. On the other hand, &quot;Tranquil Wisdom Meditation&quot; opens one&#39;s 
      mind and is continually expanding it, which does not ever exclude or 
      resist anything. A &#39;concentrated&#39; mind does not meditate in the Buddhist 
      way. It doesn&#39;t matter whether one is talking about full or fixed 
      absorption concentration, or access concentration. It is still the same.
      </P>
      <P>The important rule of the meditation is, no matter what distracts one&#39;s 
      mind away from the breath and tranquilizing one&#39;s mind, they simply open, 
      expand, let it go without thinking about the distraction, relax the mind 
      and tightness in the head, feel the mind open and relax away the tension, 
      and softly redirect one&#39;s attention back to the object of meditation i.e., 
      the breath and relaxing. The act of calming the mind and relaxing the 
      tightness in the head before coming back to the breath makes a huge 
      difference between &quot;Concentration Meditation&quot; and &quot;Tranquil Wisdom 
      Meditation&quot;. A meditator who practices &quot;Concentration Meditation&quot; 
      over-focuses on the object of meditation and thus, they have the tendency 
      to close or tighten the mind until there are no more distractions. This 
      practice leads to deep absorption of mind where hindrances are blocked. On 
      the other hand, &quot;Tranquil Wisdom Meditation&quot; has the tendency to open 
      one&#39;s mind and to allow the mind to become calm naturally. One does not 
      suppress or force their mind to stay focused on the object of meditation. 
      Instead, the mind is always aware of what it is doing in the present 
      moment. Whenever any distraction arises, one lets go, opens, expands and 
      relaxes the tightness in the head before coming back to the breath and 
      calming the mind. Thus,&nbsp; as described in the sutta, &quot;Tranquil Wisdom 
      Meditation&quot; leads to wisdom, full awareness, sharp mindfulness and 
      eventually to the highest goal of attaining nibbana. </P>
      <P>The in-breath, the out-breath, the relaxing of the tightness in the 
      head and the opening and expanding of one&#39;s mind, is one&#39;s home base. This 
      means that whenever the mind goes away from home, they first let go, relax 
      the tightness again, feel the mind expand and become calm, then redirect 
      the attention back to the breath and calming the mind. One &quot;<B>Always 
      Comes Back Home</B>&quot; regardless whether it is a wandering thought, an 
      emotional pain, a physical sensation or any other distraction. They are 
      all treated in the same way! This is by far the easiest meditation 
      instructions that the Lord Buddha ever gave. Simply let go, relax the 
      tightness in the head, feel the mind expand and become tranquil, redirect 
      the attention back to the breath, on the in-breath relax the tightness in 
      the head and calm the mind, on the out-breath relax the tightness in the 
      head and calm the mind. Easy! Do not try to control the breath. Just 
      breathe normally and naturally. That&#39;s it in a nutshell. The rest of the 
      book describes these instructions, but with more precise explanations. As 
      one examines and explores the meanings in this book, they will begin to 
      understand and gradually apply this technique in their meditation sittings 
      as well as during their daily activities. At the same time, one will 
      marvel at the beauty and simplicity of the Lord Buddha&#39;s &quot;Mindfulness of 
      Breathing&quot; (Anapanasati). </P>
      <P>May all who read this book find it helpful and may they reach the 
      highest goal.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

      <P>In recent years, there have been many expositions of the Lord Buddha&#39;s 
      teachings in English and other languages. However, a great number of them 
      lack authenticity and do not accurately represent the Buddha&#39;s words. Many 
      are written in such a free-lance way that it is difficult to even 
      recognize these writings as Buddha-Dhamma. Thus, the purpose of these 
      pages is to draw attention to the far reaching significance of the Lord 
      Buddha&#39;s Dhamma, which includes the meditation instructions,<A HREF="#n1">[1]</A> 
      and the initial guidance to an understanding of his teachings and their 
      practical applications. This book attempts to give an accurate description 
      of meditation based on the Anapanasati Sutta (which instructions are <I>
      exactly the same,</I> letter for letter and word for word, as the 
      Satipatthana Sutta and the Maharahulavada Sutta, sutta number 62. Both are 
      from the Majjhima Nikaya.), with only limited use of standard 
      commentaries. It is selected from the Middle Length Sayings translated 
      from Pali by the Venerable Nanamoli and Venerable Bhikkhu Bodhi. </P>
      <P>We will first start with redefining some words which are regularly 
      misunderstood (or badly used to suit some commentaries), misused and are 
      causing a lot of confusion to the practice of the Lord Buddha&#39;s method of 
      meditation. Firstly, let us look at the word <I>jhana.</I> In Pali, jhana 
      has many types of meanings. It can mean meditation stages or illumination. 
      However, when the common translation of the word jhana as being merely 
      &quot;concentration&quot; is used, misunderstanding takes place. Thus, the author 
      will explain its meaning whenever it occurs in this book. The author also 
      observed that the word jhana was never defined as &quot;fixed concentration, 
      access concentration or momentary concentration&quot; in the suttas. These 
      definitions are only mentioned in some commentaries. </P>
      <P>The Lord Buddha invariably includes the word jhanas (meaning 
      &#39;meditation stages&#39;, not fixed absorption of mind) in the full gradual 
      training. According to the suttas, these meditation stages are not 
      mystical or magical experiences. They are simply stages to be recognized 
      by the meditator. These meditation stages (jhanas) contribute to the 
      build-in perfection of the path which emphasizes deep tranquillity, 
      wisdom, stillness and opening of the mind. These qualities provide a solid 
      base for the realization of both calmness of mind and the development of 
      wisdom. While they are still mundane, the jhanas (meditation stages) are 
      the very &#39;<B>footsteps of the Tathagata</B>&#39; that forms the gradual 
      training which leads to nibbana. </P>
      <P>Next is the Pali word <I>samatha.</I> The more accurate meanings of 
      samatha are peacefulness, calmness, tranquility, serenity or stillness and 
      not as the commonly translated terms like absorption or fixed 
      concentration. Thus, the author prefers to use the word tranquility. </P>
      <P>The Pali word <I>samadhi</I> is equally important too, as it has many 
      different meanings such as calmness, unified mind, tranquility, 
      peacefulness, stillness, composure of mind, quiet mind, serenity, and one 
      of the lesser meanings, &quot;concentration&quot;. Thus, the true meaning is not 
      merely fixed absorption concentration or access concentration, but 
      calmness or stillness in different degrees. Interestingly, Rhys Davids 
      found through his studies, that the word samadhi was never used before the 
      time of the Buddha.<A HREF="#n2">[2]</A> Even though as a Bodhisatta, he 
      practiced &#39;concentration meditation&#39;, this word has a different meaning 
      other than concentration. The Lord Buddha &quot;popularized&quot; the word samadhi 
      to express calm wisdom, tranquility, openness, awareness, along with 
      developing a mind which has clarity and wisdom in it. Later, the Hindus 
      changed the meaning to &#39;concentration&#39;. Hence, the author will use either 
      stillness, or composure of mind, or unified mind. According to the 
      Pali-English dictionary written by Buddhadatta, the prefix <I>sama</I> 
      means &quot;calmness or tranquility&quot; and <I>dhi</I> means &quot;wisdom&quot;. When these 
      two meanings are added together, the word samadhi can actually mean 
      &quot;tranquil wisdom&quot;. If one chooses to use the word concentration&#39;, they 
      must know that it means stillness of mind or composure of mind, or a 
      unified mind and not absorption, fixed (appana), or access (upacara) 
      concentration or even momentary (Khanika) concentration. </P>
      <P>This book is written with a deep conviction that the systematic 
      cultivation of &#39;Tranquil Wisdom Meditation&#39; <I>brings both insight</I> 
      into the seeing of the true nature of this psycho/physical (mind/body) 
      process and <I>serenity of mind</I> at the same time! Furthermore, there 
      is the seeing and realizing the cause and effect relationships of all 
      dependent conditions. This means seeing dependent origination which is the 
      development of penetrative wisdom that leads to dispassion, emancipation 
      and enlightenment. As a matter&nbsp; of fact, the Lord Buddha discovered 
      that &#39;concentration practices&#39; of any kind did not lead him to Nibbana.
      </P>
      <P>After becoming a homeless one, the Bodhisatta went to two different 
      teachers of &quot;concentration meditation&quot;. His first teacher was Alara 
      Kalama. After learning the Dhamma and discipline, he practiced until he 
      attained a very high and distinguished stage of meditation called the 
      &quot;realm of nothingness&quot;. The Bodhisatta then went to his teacher and asked 
      whether he could proceed any further with that meditation. Alara Kalama 
      replied that it was the highest stage anyone could attained. The 
      Bodhisatta was dissatisfied and went to another teacher by the name of 
      Uddaka Ramaputta. He learned the Dhamma and discipline, then practiced it 
      and attained the &quot;realm of neither-perception nor non-perception&quot;. The 
      Bodhisatta again went to his teacher and asked a similar question about 
      there being more to attain. Again, the Bodhisatta was told that this was 
      absolutely the highest attainment anyone could achieve. The future Buddha 
      was disappointed because he saw that there were still many more things to 
      let go of. He observed that these &quot;concentration techniques&quot;, which 
      focused intensely on the object of meditation caused tightening in the 
      mind. He reasoned that there was still attachment whenever there was 
      tension in the mind. He also noticed that if any part of the experiences 
      were suppressed or not allowed to arise, (This occurs with every form of 
      &#39;concentration&#39;--that is, fixed absorption concentration, or access 
      concentration.) there was still some kind of holding on or attachment to 
      an ego belief. Thus, after six long years of trying all of the various 
      spiritual and ascetic practices from body mortifications like starving the 
      body, to holding the breath, he realized that these practices did not lead 
      him to a calm and open mind which was free from attachment and suffering.
      </P>
      <P>On the night of the Bodhisatta&#39;s realization of the supreme nibbana, he 
      recalled an incident at a ploughing festival while he was just a young boy 
      of one or two years old. When his attendants left him alone under a 
      rose-apple tree, he sat in &quot;tranquil wisdom meditation&quot; and experienced a 
      mind that was expanded and opened! He saw that this form of meditation 
      would lead him to the experience of &quot;tranquility jhanas&quot; (as opposed to 
      &#39;concentration jhanas&#39;).<A HREF="#n3">[3]</A> As a result of the &quot;tranquil 
      wisdom meditation&quot;, his mind was filled with joy, his body became light 
      and happy. When the joy faded away, he then experienced strong calmness 
      and peacefulness. His mind and body became very comfortable. His mind was 
      very still, composed, with sharp mindfulness and full awareness of what 
      was happening around him i.e., he could still hear sounds and feel 
      sensations with his body, etc., at that time. </P>
      <P>When the Bodhisatta sat under the Bodhi tree to meditate on the full 
      moon night of May and made his great effort to attain the supreme nibbana, 
      he recalled that not all forms of pleasure are unwholesome. He realized 
      that there could be pleasurable feelings arising in the mind and body 
      although there was not any attachment to anything. That very night, the 
      Bodhisatta practiced &quot;Tranquil Wisdom Meditation&quot; through the method of 
      opening and expanding the mind. In short, he practiced the &quot;Anapanasati&quot; 
      or &quot;Mindfulness of Breathing&quot;. And as we all know, he became the Buddha or 
      the supremely enlightened one. </P>
      <P>The Anapanasati Sutta taught by the Lord Buddha 2500 years ago still 
      provides the most simple, direct, thorough, and effective method for 
      training and developing the mind for its daily tasks and problems as well 
      as for its highest aim--the mind&#39;s own unshakable deliverance from greed, 
      hatred and delusion. The method described here is taken directly from the 
      sutta itself and its results can be seen clearly and easily when one 
      practices according to the instructions on the sutta. The author would 
      like to emphasize that the instructions in this book are not his &quot;own 
      opinion&quot;, but is actually the Lord Buddha&#39;s own instruction given in a 
      clear and precise way. It can be called the &quot;Undiluted Dhamma&quot;, because it 
      comes directly from the suttas themselves, without a lot of additions or 
      free-lance ideas. </P>
      <P>The Anapanasati Sutta gives the <B>most</B> profound meditation 
      instructions available today. It includes the &quot;Four Foundations of 
      Mindfulness&quot; and the &quot;Seven Enlightenment Factors&quot; and shows how they are 
      fulfilled through the practice of &quot;Mindfulness of Breathing&quot;. This is done 
      by attaining all of the meditation stages (jhanas).<A HREF="#n4">[4]</A> 
      This sutta shows the direct way to practice &quot;Tranquil Wisdom Meditation&quot; 
      and does not categorize meditation practices. Strangely, the current 
      separation into various types of meditation like &quot;fixed absorption 
      concentration , or access concentration&quot; and &quot;momentary concentration&quot; 
      meditation seems to occur only in the commentaries but never in the 
      suttas. Thus, one must notice this and compare them with the suttas for 
      their accuracy. </P>
      <P>From the attainment of the fourth jhana, three alternative lines of 
      further development become possible. This sutta deals with only one of 
      those, namely the attainment of all the material and immaterial jhanas 
      (meditation stages), followed by the experience of the cessation of 
      perception and feeling (nirodha samapatti in Pali) and finally the 
      experience of&nbsp; Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada). In these 
      attainments, the Lord Buddha mentions four meditative stages that continue 
      the mental unification established by the jhanas (meditation states). 
      These states described as &quot;the liberation that are peaceful and 
      immaterial&quot;, are still mundane states. Distinguished from the material 
      jhanas (meditation stages) by their deepening of the subtle mental 
      observations, they are named after their own exalted stages: &quot;the base of 
      infinite space, the base of infinite consciousness, the base of 
      nothingness, the base of neither-perception nor non-perception.&quot; These 
      states of consciousness are very attainable if one ardently and 
      continually keeps their daily meditation practice going. As this is a 
      gradual training, one first must learn to walk before they learn how to 
      run. Thus, the beginning of the meditation practice is the basis for 
      further development. </P>
      <P>This is a straight and direct path towards liberation and the 
      supramundane nibbana. It does, however, require sustained meditative 
      effort, applied to a simple object of meditation to watch, i.e., the 
      breath, followed by the relaxation and expansion of the mind which allows 
      the mind to become calm and clear without distractions. </P>
      <P>When one practices the Anapanasati Sutta as a &quot;Tranquil Wisdom 
      Meditation&quot;, they find that their creativity and intuition increase as 
      their practice develops. This forms the timeless and universal appeal of a 
      true &#39;Doctrine of Enlightenment&#39; (realizing Dependent Origination and the 
      Four Noble Truths) which has the depth and breadth, the simplicity and 
      intelligence for providing the foundation and the framework of a living <I>
      Dhamma For All.</I> One will sense the urgency of the fundamental 
      &quot;non-materialistic&quot; problems and search for solutions that neither science 
      nor the &quot;religions of faith&quot; can provide. </P>
      <P>More important is the final realization which comes through the method 
      of &quot;Tranquil Wisdom Meditation&quot; that invokes experiencing the various 
      meditation stages (jhanas) and seeing through direct knowledge, all of the 
      twelve links of &quot;Dependent Arising&quot;. This means seeing and realizing 
      directly the second and third Noble Truths. And when these two Noble 
      Truths have been seen and realized directly, this implies that the First 
      Noble Truth and the Fourth Noble Truth are seen and practiced. This is 
      because one can&#39;t see the &quot;Origin of Suffering&quot; without first seeing the 
      &quot;Suffering&quot; itself and suffering would not cease without practicing the 
      way leading to the cessation of suffering. Thus, seeing and realizing 
      Dependent Origination, means that one sees and realizes all of the Four 
      Noble Truths, which is actually the true essence of Buddhist meditation.
      </P>
      <P>The true aim of the Anapanasati Sutta is nothing less than final 
      liberation from suffering which is the highest goal of the Lord Buddha&#39;s 
      Teachings--Nibbina. The practice of the Buddhist Path evolves in two 
      distinct stages, a mundane (lokiya) or preparatory stage and a 
      supramundane (lokuttara) or accomplished stage. The mundane path is 
      developed when the disciples undertake the gradual training in developing 
      their virtues (continually keeping the precepts), tranquility or deep 
      composure of mind, and developing wisdom. This reaches its peak in the 
      practice of &quot;Tranquil Wisdom Meditation&quot;, which deepens direct experience, 
      and at the same time, shows one the three characteristics of all 
      existence, as well as, all of the Noble Truths. </P>
      <P>In short, there are two kinds of nibbina, one is the worldly or mundane 
      type of nibbana and the other is the supramundane or unworldly type of 
      nibbana. The mundane or worldly type of nibbana is attained every time the 
      meditator lets go of an attachment or hindrance and relief arises along 
      with a kind of happiness. This type of nibbana will occur many times when 
      one is seriously practicing &quot;Tranquil Wisdom Meditation&#39;. <I>The 
      supramundane type of nibbana only occurs <B>after</B> the meditator sees 
      and realizes &#39;Dependent Origination&#39; (Paticcasamuppada) both forwards and 
      backwards.</I> (This means realizing the Four Noble Truths.) This 
      supramundane nibbana takes time and effort to achieve. However, that does 
      not mean that it is impossible for laymen and laywomen to attain it. With 
      persistent daily practice and by taking an occasional meditation retreat 
      with a competent teacher who understands how the &quot;Tranquil Wisdom 
      Meditation&quot; works, even those who live active lives in the world can still 
      achieve the highest goal of the Supramundane Nibbana. It was mentioned in 
      the Parinibbana Sutta, that during the time of the Lord Buddha, many more 
      laymen and laywomen became saints than the Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis when 
      they practiced on a regular basis. The common belief that one must be a 
      &#39;Bhikkhu&#39; or &#39;Nun&#39; in order to reach this goal is just not true. The 
      exhortation of the Lord Buddha was for all people who were interested in 
      the correct path to &#39;Ehipassiko&#39; (a Pali word meaning &#39;come and see&#39;). 
      This is very good advice because it helps those who are interested, to get 
      out of the judgmental, critical mind and honestly practice to see if this 
      is, in fact, the right way. </P>
      <P>Dependent Origination is the teaching which makes the Lord Buddha&#39;s 
      path unique among all other types of meditation. During his period of 
      struggle for enlightenment, Dependent Origination came as a marvelous and 
      eye-opening discovery that ended his pursuit in the darkness: <I>&quot;Arising, 
      arising--thus, Bhikkhus, in regard to things unheard before there arose in 
      me vision, knowledge, wisdom, understanding and light&quot;.</I> (Samyutta 
      Nikaya X11. 65/ii.105). Once enlightened, the mission of the Tathagata is 
      to proclaim Dependent Origination (This means the Four Noble Truths.) to 
      the world (Samyutta Nikaya X11.25-6). The Lord Buddha taught this in 
      discourse after discourse, so much so, that the Dependent Origination soon 
      becomes the <B>most essential and important</B> teaching of all. When the 
      Arahat Assaji was asked to state the Master&#39;s message as precisely and as 
      briefly as possible, he gave the doctrine of arising and ceasing of 
      phenomena. With a single sentence, the Lord Buddha dispels doubt about the 
      correctness of this summary: <I>&quot;He who sees Dependent Origination sees 
      the Dhamma, he who sees the Dhamma sees Dependent Origination.&quot;</I> (Taken 
      from the Middle Length Sayings [Majjhima Nikaya] Sutta 28 section 38). 
      This means seeing and realizing all of the Noble Truths. <B>This is the 
      only way!</B> </P>
      <P>When one&#39;s faculties have gained a degree of maturity and they see the 
      twelve links of &#39;Dependent Origination&#39; clearly, the mundane path rises to 
      the supramundane path because it leads directly and surely out of 
      &#39;Suffering&#39;. One then realize &#39;The Origin of Suffering&#39;, &#39;The Cessation of 
      Suffering&#39;, and &#39;The Path Leading the Way Out of Suffering&#39;. </P>
      <P>There is another interesting sutta about seeing of the Four Noble 
      Truths, found in the Digha Nikaya Sutta number 16, section 5.27. From this 
      section of the sutta, one concludes that the way to attain enlightenment 
      is by following the Eightfold Path and realizing the Noble Truths. It 
      says: </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><I><B>5.27- &quot;In whatever Dhamma and Discipline the Noble Eightfold 
        Path is not found, no ascetic is found of the first grade (meaning a 
        sotapanna), second grade (meaning sakadagami), third grade (meaning 
        anagami), or fourth grade (meaning an arahat). But such ascetics can be 
        found, of the first, second, third, and fourth grade in a Dhamma and 
        Discipline where the <U>Noble Eightfold Path</U> is found. Now, 
        Subhadda, in this Dhamma and Discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is 
        found, and in it are to be found ascetics of the first, second, third 
        and fourth grade. Those other schools are devoid of [true] ascetics; but 
        if in this one the Bhikkhus were to live to perfection, the world would 
        not lack for Arahats.</B></I></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The mind opens when it sees and realizes these twelve links of 
      Dependent Origination directly. As a result, the mind becomes 
      dispassionate and free. This is as true now in present times, as it was 
      2500 years ago. Any teaching that doesn&#39;t highlight the necessity of the 
      Dependent Origination as its realization and final goal or destination, 
      isn&#39;t teaching the true path. Currently, many people say that seeing 
      impermanence, suffering, and not-self is realizing nibbina. However, one 
      must note that although these characteristics do lead the way to realizing 
      nibbina and are very important to develop, they <I>don&#39;t directly allow 
      one to see the supramundane state of Nibbana.</I> <B>The meditator can 
      see, one or all of the three characteristics of existence, i.e., 
      impermanence, suffering and not-self, without directly seeing Dependent 
      Origination, but, when one sees Dependent Origination directly he will 
      always see all of the three characteristics.</B> According to the first 
      sutta in the Maha Vagga of the Vinaya, it cannot work. any other way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Courage to Investigate</FONT></B> </P>
      <P>Currently, there seems to be some disputes regarding the kinds of 
      meditation the Lord Buddha taught. One school of thought says -- &quot;One must 
      begin by practicing &#39;Jhana [fixed] concentration meditation&#39; and then 
      proceed to the fourth jhana <A HREF="#n5">[5]</A> before switching over to 
      the practice of &#39;vipassana meditation&#39; or momentary concentration [khanika 
      sarnadhi]. Other schools of thought say that one can attain Nibbana 
      without going through the jhanas,<A HREF="#n6">[6]</A> but only practice 
      &quot;vipassana meditation&quot;<A HREF="#n7">[7]</A> or developing access 
      concentration [upacara samadhi] right from the beginning of their 
      meditation practice. </P>
      <P>Interestingly, the word &quot;vipassana&#39; or &#39;vidassana&#39; (which has the same 
      meaning) is only mentioned very few times in the suttas, whereas the word 
      Jhana (here meaning tranquil wisdom meditation stages, not fixed 
      concentration) is mentioned many thousands of times. Moreover, the 
      Anapanasati Sutta shows that the Lord Buddha taught only one kind of 
      meditation, that is by simultaneously developing both the jhanas and 
      wisdom. (Here, the word jhana means meditation stages or illumination of 
      mind, not deep absorption or fixed concentration (appana samadhi), access 
      concentration (upacara samadhi) or even momentary concentration (Khanika 
      samadhi).) This sutta actually shows the method of how to tranquilize the 
      mind and develop wisdom at the same time by seeing the true nature of 
      existence. This means observing anicca [impermanence], dukkha [suffering], 
      anatta [not-self], along with seeing and realizing the cause and effect 
      relationships of Dependent Origination. At the same time, it also fulfills 
      the &quot;Four Foundation of Mindfulness and the Seven Enlightenment Factors&quot;. 
      Hence, the way leading to the realization of Supramundane Nibbana is 
      clearly and precisely taught in this wonderful sutta. </P>
      <P>The commentaries and sub-commentaries have divided &quot;concentration&quot; and 
      &quot;vipassana&quot; into different forms of meditation. This kind of &quot;separation&quot; 
      does not appear in the suttas. Although it is mentioned in the Anggutara 
      Nikaya that the first part of the practice is samatha and the second part 
      is vidassana (developing wisdom), it is not saying that they are two 
      different types of practices or meditations. The practice is the same! It 
      is only that different things are seen at different times, as in the case 
      of Sutta 111 &#39;One By One as they Occurred&#39; from the Majjhima Nikaya. This 
      sutta gives an explanation of Venerable Sariputta&#39;s meditation development 
      and experience of all the jhanas (meditation stages) before he attained 
      arahatship. </P>
      <P>When one starts to differentiate and categorize meditation practices, 
      the situation becomes very confusing. This is also evident in the popular 
      commentaries like the Visuddhi Magga and its sub-commentaries. One begins 
      to see inconsistencies when they make a comparison with the suttas. 
      Nowadays, most scholars use just a line or parts of a sutta to ensure that 
      the commentaries agree with the sutta. However, if one were to read the 
      sutta as a whole, the sutta has an entirely different meaning. This is not 
      to say that scholars are intentionally making wrong statements, but 
      sometimes they are caught in looking at such tiny details or parts of the 
      Dhamma with a unilateral view that they tend to lose view of the larger 
      picture of things. The description of the jhanas (here again meaning 
      absorption or fixed on or into the object of meditation, where 
      concentration suppresses the hindrances) in the Visuddhi Magga, doesn&#39;t 
      exactly match the description given in the suttas and in most cases, these 
      descriptions are very different! </P>
      <P>For example, the Visuddhi Magga talks about having a sign (nimitta in 
      Pali, this can be a light or other visualized mind-made pictures) arise in 
      the mind at certain times when one is practicing jhana meditation 
      (absorption concentration [appana samadhi] or when one gets into access 
      concentration [upacara samadhi] or even in momentary concentration 
      [khanika samadhi]. With each type of &#39;concentration&#39; a nimitta of some 
      kind arises. When this happens one is practicing a &#39;concentration&#39; type of 
      meditation practice which the Bodhisatta rejected as being the way to 
      Nibbana! However, if one were to check the suttas, the description of 
      nimittas arising in the mind has never been mentioned. And, if it were 
      very important, it would be mentioned many times. The Lord Buddha never 
      taught concentration techniques, having nimittas (signs) arising, or the 
      chanting of mantras. These are forms of Hindu practices that have sneaked 
      into Buddhism for a few hundred years. Their influences can be seen in the 
      &#39;concentration practices&#39; and in the Tibetan Buddhist styles of 
      meditation, as well as, in other popular commentaries like the Visuddhi 
      Magga. Thus, the current ways of practicing &quot;concentration&quot;, do not 
      conform to the descriptions given in the suttas. </P>
      <P>One must always honestly and openly investigate what is being said and 
      then check it against the suttas. It is best that one does this not with 
      just part of the sutta but the whole sutta itself, because taking out one 
      or two lines from various sections can cause confusion. When one honestly 
      questions what the Lord Buddha&#39;s Teachings really are, they will observe 
      that open investigation helps one to see more clearly and thus, questions 
      can be answered rationally. One must always remember that the commentaries 
      and sub-commentaries are the authors&#39; interpretation of what the suttas 
      say and mean. Many times good intentioned monks look for ways to expand 
      their understanding and attempt to help themselves and others with their 
      comments. Then as time goes by, more scholar monks will expound on a 
      certain comment, explaining the different and subtle meanings of some tiny 
      phrases and individual comments. This &quot;dilutes&quot; the true teachings and 
      thus, has the tendency to take one further away from the true meaning and 
      understanding of the suttas. As a result, many puzzling questions arise.
      </P>
      <P>For example: &quot;In the practice of momentary concentration, where does 
      Dependent Origination fit into the scheme of things?&quot; This practice 
      doesn&#39;t seem to go hand in hand with the teaching of Dependent 
      Origination. Another question is: &quot;According to the suttas, Right Effort 
      means bringing up zeal, or joyful interest, or enthusiasm (chanda) in the 
      mind. However, some meditation teachers say Right Effort only means 
      &quot;noting&quot;. Other puzzling questions that one might asked are, &quot;Which suttas 
      mentioned the terms momentary [Khanika Samadhi], access [Upacara Samadhi], 
      and absorption or fixed concentration [Appana Samadhi]?&quot; and &quot;Which sutta 
      describes &#39;Insight Knowledges&#39;?&quot; or &quot;Which sutta says that there is no 
      mindfulness while in the jhana meditation stage?&quot;. Please note that in the 
      Parinibbana Sutta, the Lord Buddha had requested his disciples to always 
      check against the suttas and not any other texts. </P>
      <P>There must come a time when one must stop repeating the words of 
      others, and stop practicing ways of questionable methods, without doing 
      some open and honest investigation of the original teachings of the Lord 
      Buddha. One must not depend on hearsay, or blind belief in what a teacher 
      says, simply because he is the authority. In the Kalama Sutta, the Lord 
      Buddha gives some very wise advice: </P>
      <UL>
        <LI>It is unwise to simply believe what one hears because it has been 
        said over and over again for a long time. </LI>
        <LI>It is unwise to follow tradition blindly just because it has been 
        practiced in that way for a long time. </LI>
        <LI>It is unwise to listen to and spread rumors and gossip. </LI>
        <LI>It is unwise to take anything as being the absolute truth just 
        because it agrees with one&#39;s scriptures (this especially means 
        commentaries and sub-commentaries). </LI>
        <LI>It is unwise to foolishly make assumptions, without investigation.
        </LI>
        <LI>It is unwise to abruptly draw a conclusion by what one sees and 
        hears without further investigation. </LI>
        <LI>It is unwise to go by mere outward appearances or to hold too 
        tightly to any view or idea simply because one is comfortable with it.
        </LI>
        <LI>It is unwise to be convinced of anything out of respect and 
        deference to one spiritual teacher (without honest investigation into 
        what is being taught). </LI>

      <P>We must go beyond opinions, beliefs and dogmatic thinking. In this way, 
      we can rightly reject anything which when accepted, practiced and 
      perfected, leads to more anger, criticism, conceit, pride, greed and 
      delusion. These unwholesome states of mind are universally condemned and 
      are certainly not beneficial to ourselves or to others. They are to be 
      avoided whenever possible. </P>
      <CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
      <P>On the other hand, we can rightly accept anything which when practiced 
      and perfected, leads to unconditional love, contentment and gentle wisdom. 
      These things allow us to develop a happy, tranquil, and peaceful mind. 
      Thus, the wise praise all kinds of unconditional love (loving acceptance 
      of the present moment), tranquility, contentment and gentle wisdom and 
      encourages everyone to practice these good qualities as much as possible.

      <P>In the Parinibbana Sutta, the Lord Buddha&#39;s advice to the Bhikkhus is 
      very plain and precise. One is to practice according to the scriptural 
      texts and observe whether the practice is done correctly. Only after close 
      examination and practice, along with experience, can one be sure that the 
      scriptures are correct. Thus, the Lord Buddha&#39;s advice to the Bhikkhus is 
      not only to use the suttas, but also to check whether the suttas are 
      correct according to the Dhamma and the Discipline. This is how one makes 
      sure that the information is true and can then be practiced correctly. 
      This is taken from Sutta number 16, section 4.7 to 4.11 of the Digha 
      Nikaya translated from the book &quot;Thus Have I Heard&quot; by Maurice Walsh. It 
      says: </P>

        <P><B><I>4.7- At Bhogangagara the Lord stayed at the Ananda Shrine. And 
        here he said to the monks: &quot;Bhikkhus, I will teach you four criteria. 
        Listen, pay close attention, and I Will speak.&#39; &#39;Yes, Lord,&#39; replied the 
        Bhikkhus.</I></B> </P>
        <P><B><I>4.8- &quot;Suppose a Bhikkhu were to say: &#39;Friends, I heard and

        neither approve nor disapprove his words. Then, without approving or 
        disapproving his words and expressions should be carefully noted and 
        compared with the Suttas and reviewed in the light of the Discipline. If 
        they, on such comparison and review, are found not to conform to the 
        Suttas and the Discipline, the conclusion must be: &quot;Assuredly this is 
        not the word of the Lord Buddha, it has been wrongly understood by this 
        monk; and the matter is to be rejected. But inhere on such comparison 
        and review they are found to conform to the Suttas and the Discipline, 
        the conclusion must be: &quot;Assuredly this is the word of the Lord Buddha, 
        it has been rightly understood by this Bhikkhu.&quot; This is the first

      <P>The spirit of open investigation and exploration into the ways and 
      means of the Lord Buddha&#39;s Middle Path, is open to all who have an 
      inquiring mind. This means a mind which is not stuck in looking at things 
      through pride and attachment at what they &quot;think&quot; is right without first 
      checking with the suttas.<A HREF="#n8">[8]</A> Occasionally, some 
      meditators become very attached to their opinions and teachers such that 
      they think their method is the &quot;only way&quot;, without checking the true 
      teachings from the suttas. As this book is taken directly from the sutta, 
      one can observe how things can be confused and misrepresented by some 
      commentaries and sub-commentaries. If one has the courage to investigate 
      and practice, they will be pleasantly surprised at the simplicity and 
      clarity of the Lord Buddha&#39;s teaching, especially when commentaries like 
      the Visuddhi Magga are left alone. Although the suttas appear dry and 
      repetitive, they are quite illuminating and can be fun to read, especially 
      when one practices the meditation and gains intellectual knowledge at the 
      same time.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

      to Tranquil Wisdom (Samadhi) Meditation</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">
      </FONT></P>
      <P>Before one starts with their meditation, it is very important to build 
      a strong foundation of morality (sila). If the meditator doesn&#39;t even 
      practice the five precepts, they will lose interest and finally stop 
      meditating, because they think that the technique is incorrect. Actually 
      the Lord Buddha&#39;s technique works very well. The meditator is just not 
      doing the complete practice nor is one doing it in the correct way. 
      Keeping the precepts is essential to the development and purity of the 
      mind. If one breaks any of these precepts, they will experience a lot of 
      restlessness, remorse, and anxiety due to their guilty feelings. This 
      causes the mind to be tight and clouds one&#39;s thoughts. </P>
      <P>These precepts are absolutely necessary for any spiritual attainments. 
      They provide the mind with general mindfulness and awareness which helps 
      one to have a peaceful mind that is clear from any remorse due to wrong 
      doing. A peaceful and calm mind, is a mind that is tension-free and clear. 
      Thus, it is a very good idea to take these precepts everyday, not as some 
      form of rite or ritual, but as a reminder for one&#39;s practice. Taking the 
      precepts everyday helps to keep one&#39;s mind, speech and actions uplifted. 
      There are people who recite these precepts in the Pali language. However, 
      it can turn into an empty exercise if the meditator doesn&#39;t completely 
      understand Pali. For the earnest meditator it is best to recite these 
      precepts daily in a language that one understands so that the meanings are 
      clear without a doubt. These precepts are: </P>
      <P><B>1. I undertake to keep the precept to abstain from killing living 
      beings. - </B>This precept includes non-killing of beings like ants, 
      mosquitoes, and cockroaches. </P>
      <P><B>2. I undertake to keep the precept to abstain from taking what is 
      not given. - </B>This covers any forms of stealing which even includes 
      taking a pencil from work without permission or using equipment like copy 
      machines for personal use. </P>
      <P><B>3. I undertake to keep the precept to abstain from wrong sexual 
      activity. - </B>Basically, it means not having any sexual activity with 
      and another person&#39;s partner, or having sexual activity with someone that 
      is still under the care of a family member. It also means that one must 
      follow the sexual laws of the land . Any sexual activity that causes undue 
      pain to another being will cause one to have remorse and guilty feelings 
      to arise. </P>
      <P><B>4. I undertake to keep the precept to abstain from telling lies, 
      using harsh speech, slandering others, and speaking gossip or nonsense 
      talk. - </B>This means abstinence from any type of speech which is not 
      true or helpful to others. It also includes abstinence from telling white 
      lies. </P>
      <P><B>5. I undertake to keep the precept to abstain from taking drugs and 
      alcohol which dulls the mind. - </B>Many people think that drinking one 
      glass of beer or one social glass of wine would not effect their mind. But 
      this is not true! If one is practicing meditation, they become very 
      sensitive and will notice the effects of even taking something as harmless 
      as aspirin. It can dull one&#39;s mind for a whole day. How much more with 
      alcohol and other drugs! However, when one is sick and the doctor says 
      that they must take a certain drug as medicine, then please take the 
      medicine. This precept refers to taking drugs or alcohol in order to relax 
      and escape from the stress of the day. </P>
      <P>As soon as one realize that they have broken a precept, one should 
      first forgive themselves and acknowledge that they are not perfect. This 
      helps one to free their mind a little. One then retakes the precepts as 
      soon as possible and make a determination not to break the precepts again. 
      Taking the precepts again will help to re-purify the mind. Over a period 
      of time, one will become more aware and naturally abstain from breaking 
      them due to realization of its harmful effects. </P>
      <P>Please practice only one meditation technique at a time because the 
      mind will becomes confused if one tries to mix and match various 
      meditation. Mixing and matching only stops one&#39;s progress. The best way is 
      to pick only one teacher who truly understands the meditation. The way to 
      select a good teacher is by observing if their students are kind, 
      pleasant, friendly and supportive. Then, stay with that teacher for a 
      period of time and see for oneself whether their mind becomes more happy 
      and peaceful all of the time, not just while meditating, but in daily life 
      as well. This is ultimately the best way to choose. Does one&#39;s awareness 
      of mind states become clearer and easier to recognize then let go of them 
      during one&#39;s daily activities as well as during the sitting practice? 
      Otherwise, check with the teacher and the suttas to see if what is being 
      taught agrees with them. As one&#39;s practice deepens and the meditation 
      becomes better, the suttas become clearer and easier to understand. This 
      always happens when the teacher is using the suttas as his guide. </P>
      <P>Lastly, it is very important for the meditator to recognize whenever 
      the five hindrances arise. They are lust or greed, hatred or aversion, 
      sloth and torpor or sleepiness and dullness, restlessness or remorse, 
      anxiety or scatteredness and doubt. A hindrance is an obstacle or a 
      distraction because it completely blocks one from practicing meditation 
      either while sifting or in their daily activities or seeing things in the 
      present moment clearly. It also causes one to take an impersonal process, 
      personally. Whenever these hindrances arise, one identifies with them very 
      strongly and takes them personally i.e., &quot;I am sleepy, I am restless, I 
      like and I want, I dislike and I hate, I have doubt&quot;. These hindrances 
      completely clouds their mind and stops one from seeing clearly whatever 
      happens in the present moment due to the ego involvement of &quot;I am that&quot;.
      </P>
      <P>When one is practicing &quot;fixed concentration&#39; the meditator lets go of 
      any distraction and then redirects their mind back to the meditation 
      object again. On the other hand, when one is practicing &quot;Tranquil Wisdom 
      Meditation&quot;, one lets go of the distraction (this part is exactly the same 
      as the &#39;fixed concentration&#39;), relaxes the tightness in the head and feels 
      the mind becomes open, expanded and calm. Only then does one redirect 
      their attention back to the object of meditation. The small difference of 
      relaxing the mind and feeling it open and calm, changes the whole 
      meditation from a &#39;fixed concentration&#39; to a more flowing, mindful and 
      calm kind of awareness, that doesn&#39;t go as deep as the absorption types of 
      meditation. As a result, the meditator becomes more in tune with the 
      teachings in the suttas. </P>
      <P>When one is practicing &quot;Tranquil Wisdom Meditation&quot;, they do not 
      suppress anything. Suppression means to push down or to push away or not 
      allow certain types of experience i.e., it stops the hindrances from 
      arising. Instead, when a hindrance arises, one must work to open their 
      minds by seeing it clearly as anicca (impermanence, it wasn&#39;t there and 
      now it is), dukkha (suffering or unsatisfactoriness, one sees that when 
      these distractions arise they are painful), and anatta (not taking it 
      personally, seeing the hindrances in the true way as being an impersonal 
      process that one has no control over and not taking these hindrances as &quot;I 
      am that&quot;). One then lets go of this obstruction, relaxes the tightness in 
      the head, calms the mind and finally, redirects the attention back to the 
      practice of &#39;Mindfulness of Breathing&#39;. </P>
      <P>As a result, one begins to see clearly how the mind works and this 
      leads to the development of wisdom. When one allows and does not identify 
      with these hindrances, they will naturally fade away, and the mind becomes 
      more clear and bright. Every time one lets go of the ego attachment of &quot;I 
      am that&quot;, the mind naturally becomes more expanded, alert and mindful. 
      Thus, one of the main reasons of this book is to show that whenever one 
      suppresses any thing, they are not purifying the mind, or experiencing 
      things as they truly are. At the time of suppression, one is pushing away 
      or not allowing part of their experience and thus, this contracts the mind 
      instead of expanding and opening the mind. As a result, it is not 
      purifying the mind of ignorance. One is actually stopping the process of 
      purification of the mind! It is impossible to experience the unconditioned 
      state of the Supramundane Nibbana when one does not let go of everything 
      that arises, and in that way, purify the mind of the ego belief of &quot;I am 
      that&quot;. The Lord Buddha had never taught suppression of any experience nor 
      did he teach a meditation that causes the mind to fix or to absorb into 
      the meditation object. Remember, he rejected every form of &#39;concentration 
      meditation&#39; as not being the correct way. Actually, any kinds of pain or 
      emotional upset or physical discomforts and even of death must be accepted 
      with equanimity, full awareness or strong attention and not identifying 
      with it or taking that pain personally. </P>
      <P>Real personality change occurs when one opens and expands their mind 
      and let go any kinds of hindrances, pain, suffering and tension even in 
      their daily lives. This means that one opens and expands their awareness 
      so that they observe everything with a silent mind which is free from 
      tightness and all ego-attachment. One gradually leads a happy and calm 
      life without a lot of mind chatter, especially during their daily 
      activities. When one practices &quot;concentration meditation&quot;, one will feel 
      very comfortable and happy while in the deep meditation but when they get 
      out of these exalted stages, their personality remains the same (this 
      means that the hindrances attack them but they do not recognize and open 
      their mind. Thus, they contract their mind and become even more 
      attached!). They might even tend to be prideful and critical! This is 
      because whenever a hindrance arises during the meditation, the meditator 
      lets it go and immediately goes back to the object of meditation again. 
      They do this without calming and relaxing the tightness caused by the 
      distraction. Instead, their mind tends to close or contract and tighten 
      around that experience (while in sitting meditation) until the mind 
      becomes more deeply &#39;concentrated&#39;. As a result, this suppresses the 
      hindrance. Thus, they have not completely let go of the ego-attachment to 
      that distraction. Their mind is also tight and tense because they are not 
      seeing clearly that they are not opening and allowing, but closing and 
      fighting with that distraction. This explains why nowadays meditators 
      complain that they have huge amounts of tension in their head. Actually, 
      when one truly lets go of any distraction, there will not ever be any 
      tension in the head. As a result of this suppression, there is no real 
      purifying of the mind and thus, personality change does not occur. </P>
      <P>Now, we are almost ready for the Anapanasati Sutta. But, before we go 
      into that, let&#39;s look at some words which have been changed so that their 
      meanings in the texts become clearer. For instance, the word &#39;rapture&#39; is 
      replaced by &#39;joy&#39;, and the word &#39;pleasure&#39; is changed to &#39;happiness&#39;. In 
      addition, the word &#39;concentration&#39; is replaced by &#39;stillness&#39;, &#39;composure 
      of mind&#39;, or &#39;unified mind&#39;. When one practices according to the Lord 
      Buddha&#39;s instructions as described here, they will be able to confirm 
      their experiences by reading the suttas. As a result, there is better 
      understanding of these profound texts. </P>
      <P>One last note: In these few opening chapters, the author has touched on 
      some controversial views about the practices of absorption or fixed 
      concentration (appana samadhi), access concentration (upacara samadhi) and 
      momentary concentration (khanika samadhi). Thus, the author appreciates 
      very much if the reader finds any mistake, they would indicate the suttas 
      which mentioned these various concentration practices. </P>
      <P>When one practice &quot;Tranquil Wisdom Meditation&quot; there is only opening, 
      expanding of the mind and allowing, then relaxing the tightness caused by 
      the hindrance or distraction, before going back to the object of 
      meditation again. This opening and allowing helps one to be more aware and 
      alert to the things which causes pain and suffering so that they can open 
      up and expand even further. With this kind of awareness, there is 
      personality change and only then can one fulfill the Lord Buddha&#39;s 
      admonition of &quot;We are the Happy Ones&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
