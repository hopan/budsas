    <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">L</font>ike the young
    teenagers who delight in doing things differently from their parents, new Buddhists in
    non-Asian countries seem to be going through their own proud adolescence by challenging
    the boundaries of traditional Buddhism. Fortunately, for both our youngsters and Western
    Buddhists, the arrogance of youth soon gives way to the mature, long years of
    understanding and respect for tradition. It is in order to hasten this growing up of
    Buddhism in Australia that I write this article on the meaning of 'Sangha' as it was meant
    to be understood by the Lord Buddha. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman">In the
    Tipitika, the recorded Teachings of the Lord Buddha, one finds two main focusses for the
    meaning of Sangha: the third part of the Threefold Refuge (in the Buddha, Dhamma and
    Sangha) and the third factor of the to-be -worshipped Triple Gem (The Buddha, Dhamma and
    Savaka Sangha). On odd occasions in the Tipitika, 'Sangha' is used to denote a 'herd' of
    animals (Patika Sutta, Digha Nikaya) or 'flock&quot; of birds (Jataka Nidana), but groups
    of lay disciples, both men and women, are always described as 'parisa', an assembly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So what is the meaning of Sangha in the first main
    context, in the Threefold Refuge? Certainly, only an exceedingly eccentric Buddhist would
    take as their third refuge a sangha of birds (only &quot;one gone cuckoo&quot;, as they
    say!). In fact, the Tipitika is precise in what is meant by the third refuge. In the
    Canon, on every occasion that an inspired person took the Threefold Refuge as an
    expression of their faith, it was either in the Buddha, Dhamma and Bhikkhu Sangha, or in
    the Buddha, Dhamma and Bhikkhuni Sangha. Thus, in original Buddhism, the meaning of Sangha
    in the context of the Threefold Refuge is unarguably the Monastic Sangha. <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    The Sangha as the third factor of the Triple Gem worshipped by Buddhists seems to have a
    different meaning. It is called the Savaka Sangha (or Ariya Sangha) and is defined as
    those attained to any of the Eight Stages of Enlightenment (the 4 usual stages divided
    into Path and Fruit) who are &quot;worthy of gifts, hospitality, offerings and reverential
    salutations, and who are the unsurpassed field of merit in the world&quot;. So, in the
    original texts, who are the &quot;unsurpassed field of merit and worthy of offerings and
    salutations&quot;? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Dakkhinavibhanga Sutta (Majjhima 142), the Buddha
    said that, &quot;an offering made to the monastic Sangha is incalculable, immeasurable.
    And, I say, that in no way does a gift to a person individually ever have a greater fruit
    than an offering made to the monastic Sangha&quot;. Consistency proves that the Savaka
    Sangha, the unsurpassed field of merit in the world, must be a part, a subset of the
    monastic Sangha - there is no greater fruit than an offering to the monastic Sangha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, in the world of the Tipitika, offerings and
    reverential salutations would always be given by the laity to the monastic and never the
    other way around. Even the highly attained lay disciple Ugga Gahapati who was a
    Non-Returner is seen to be giving reverential salutations to ordinary bhikkhus and serving
    their needs with his own hands (Anguttara Nikaya, Eights, Suttas 21 &amp; 22). Thus, those
    &quot;worthy of gifts, hospitality, offerings and reverential salutations&quot;, the
    Savaka Sangha, are again shown to be a part of the monastic Sangha of both genders. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This proves that the meaning of 'Sangha' in the context of
    the to-be-worshipped Triple Gem is that part of the monastic Sangha who have attained to a
    Stage of Enlightenment. This Savaka Sangha, or Ariya Sangha, is in no way outside of the
    monastic Sangha but within it, as a subset. To say otherwise is inconsistent with the
    Suttas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have carefully argued these points because today, many
    young lay Buddhist groups in Australia, Europe and the Americas are calling themselves
    Sangha, going for refuge to themselves, even worshipping themselves, and presuming this is
    Buddhism! This is sad, misleading and produces no progress on the Path. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is far better to go for refuge to the Monastic Sangha
    and give respect to that Sangha, especially those within the monastic Sangha with
    attainment on the Path. Why? Because the monastic Sangha is also the physical expression
    of the Lord Buddha's Middle Way, it is the only authoritative Buddhist teaching
    organization and, thirdly, it is the flag of Buddhism capable of giving inspiration in the
    villages and cities of our world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That the monastic Sangha is the physical expression of the
    Lord Buddha's Middle Way is easily demonstrated when one investigate the Suttas what the
    Lord Buddha meant by the 'Middle Way'. In the Aranavibhanga Sutta (Majjhima 139), the Lord
    Buddha clearly explained that the Middle Way is a celibate way, &quot;Beyond the pursuit
    of the pleasures of the five senses&quot;. Monasticism is the physical expression of
    celibacy. Every Buddhist should know that sensuality is the first of the three cravings
    (Kama-tanha) mentioned in the Second Noble Truth as the direct cause of Dukkha. Also, that
    such sensuality is the first of the attachments (Kama-upadana). So those who are earnest
    about abandoning such craving and uprooting such attachment would naturally gravitate to
    the monastic Sangha. Thus, the monks and nuns include all those who are serious enough
    about Enlightenment to do some serious letting go of their cravings and attachments. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That the authority on Buddhism lies with the monastic
    Sangha is demonstrated when one considers that only someone who is practicing the Dhamma,
    and uprooting sensuality has the authority to teach others to do the same. A sexually
    active lay Buddhist who enjoys good food and entertainment while amassing worldly
    possessions, and who teaches others to let go of attachments is called a hypocrite; one
    who doesn't practise what they preach to others. They have no authority. It is true that
    some monks also qualify as hypocrites here, but they are more easily shown up for what
    they are than the lay teacher with far fewer rules. In short, a monastic is more reliable.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That the monastic Sangha is the flag of Buddhism refers to
    the appearance and lifestyle of the Buddhist monk or nun. The simple brown robe and shaven
    head are symbols of renunciation and a rejection of fashion. They are a flag to the people
    that the way to happiness is not through amassing wealth and showing it off to others. The
    lifestyle of morality and restraint seen in the behaviour of a good monk or nun are a
    signpost to others that freedom lies within precepts, not beyond them. And the quietness
    and happiness of a trained monastic indicates the goal of the Noble Eightfold Path which
    is the end of suffering. Good monks and nuns stand out as no lay person could, inspiring
    even non Buddhists as worthy sons and daughters of the Lord Buddha. Like a patriot feels
    inspired and uplifted when they see the flag of their country, so a true Buddhist feels
    the same emotions on seeing the flag of the Sangha in a diligent monk or nun. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So this is the meaning of the word 'Sangha', both in the
    context of the Tipitika and in the context of modern times. May the monks and nuns who are
    its members please live up to all these meanings. And may lay Buddhist know better than
    young Western Buddhists and their spin doctoring of the Dhamma, and so preserve and
    support the lineage of the Great Teacher that is the Monastic Sangha./. &nbsp;</font></p>
