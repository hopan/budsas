      only two of the great religious teachers who were successful during their 
      own lifetimes were the Prophet Mohammed and Siddhatta Gotama, the Buddha. 
      Both had long teaching careers and both lived to see their respective 
      religions firmly established. Prof. Basham has written that Buddhism was a 
      minor religion until its adoption and promotion by King Asoka. Basham 
      bases his assumption on the fact that there is no archaeological evidence 
      of Buddhism before Asoka’s time but this seems to me to be a rather weak 
      argument. What physical evidence are wandering ascetics, which are what 
      the Buddha’s disciples were, likely to leave? They established few 
      permanent monasteries and those they did build were made of mud, bamboo 
      and thatch. As for stupas, these did not become an important feature of 
      Buddhist worship until about the 2nd century BCE. The Pali Tipitaka offers 
      ample and convincing evidence that the Buddha was well known throughout 
      wide tracts of northern India and that his Dhamma attracted large numbers 
      of converts from all classes, especially the elite.</FONT><P>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The highly critical attitude of Jains and 
      brahmins towards the new teaching as recorded in the Tipitaka suggests 
      that they saw it as a real threat. An important cause of the Buddha’s 
      success was no doubt his extraordinary personality. Even despite the great 
      distance in time between he and us, the heavy editing of the suttas and 
      their rather stilted language, the Buddha’s warm and compassionate 
      presence shines through on nearly every page. The logical consistency of 
      his Dhamma must have been an important factor also. However, no matter how 
      appealing a teacher or how common-sense a teaching it will not attract 
      converts unless they can come into contact with it. The Buddha was a 
      missionary from the very beginning and this was, together with the two 
      things mentioned above, the most important factor in the early success of 
      his teachings. He had a still heart but a very mobile body. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">According to the Tipitaka, almost the 
      first thing the Buddha did after his enlightenment was to embark on a long 
      journey in order to teach others what he had discovered. Equally 
      significantly, his instructions to his first five disciples was that they 
      should ‘wander forth’ to teach others what he had taught them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The area in which the Buddha wandered 
      during his life corresponds roughly to the modern Indian states of Uttar 
      Pradesh and Bihar. The furthermost east he went which can still be 
      identified is Kajangla (now Kankjol, 18 k south of Rajmahal right on the 
      Indo-Bangladesh border) and the furthermost west he is known to have gone 
      is Mathura, some 180 kilometres south of Delhi. These two locations are 
      nearly a thousand kilometres apart. The Buddha’s movements northwards were 
      of course limited by the then impenetrable jungles of the Himalayan 
      foothills and it is unlikely that he ever went further south than the 
      southern edge of the Ganges watershed. Still, this would mean that his 
      wanderings covered an area roughly equivalent to 200,000 square 
      kilometers, a huge area by any standards.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The evidence suggests that the Buddha only 
      occasionally visited the outer edges of this region. For example, he only 
      visited Mathura once and he probably visited Anga in the east (i.e. Campa, 
      Bhaddiya and Kajangla corresponding to modern Bhagalpur District) only 
      once also. Incidentally, I believe that Bhaddiya or Bhaddiyanagara as it 
      is also sometimes called in the Tipitaka, can be safely identified with 
      the village of Bhadariya some 12 kilometres south of Bhagalpur. However, 
      most of the Buddha’s wanderings took place in the eastern part of this 
      area, between the great cities of Savatthi, Rajagaha, Vesali and Kosambi. 
      The Tipitaka mention carriageways in towns and paths, roads and highways 
      through the countryside. However there is little doubt that these names 
      referred to the frequency of traffic on these arteries, not to the quality 
      of their paving or their width. All roads in ancient India were little 
      more than dusty, rutted tracks in the summer and impassable rivers of mud 
      in the rainy season. Banditry added to the risks of long distance travel.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Travellers on the road between Savatthi 
      and Sakheta were often robbed (Vin, IV: 87) and of course the fearsome 
      Angulimala was a robber and murderer who operated in forested areas around 
      Savatthi. Once the Buddha and an attendant were on tour of Kosala when 
      they came to a fork in the road. The Buddha said they should take one fork 
      while the attendant said they should take the other. This debate continued 
      for some time until in a huff the attendant put the Buddha’s bowl down and 
      walked off on the way he thought correct. He hadn’t gone far before he was 
      attacked by bandits who &quot;struck him with their fists and feet and tore his 
      robe&quot; (Ud, 90). In the more remote districts travellers might have 
      difficulty finding food, water and shelter. The Tipitaka mentions a 
      traveller getting down on all fours to drink from a puddle in a cows 
      footprint because no other water was available and of two parents lost in 
      the wilderness who saved themselves from starvation by killing and eating 
      their child. More normally though travel was just uncomfortable, tedious 
      and undertaken only when necessary. And yet it seems that the Buddha spent 
      most of his time on the road in order to reach as many people as possible. 
      Such was his determination and compassion.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In keeping with the rules laid down by 
      himself and in accordance with long established samana tradition, the 
      Buddha spent three months of the rainy season in one location and the rest 
      of the year on what were called ‘walking tours’. According to the 
      commentarial tradition after the 20th year of his ministry he spent every 
      rainy season in or near Savatthi, the capital of Kosala. The fact that 
      more of his discourses are set in this city that in any other place 
      suggests that there is some foundation in this tradition and if it is true 
      he may have decided to limit his wanderings at that time due to age. He 
      would have been sixty years old at the time. All the Buddha’s journeys 
      were undertaken on foot although as there are numerous rivers in the land 
      he knew he must have often had to use boats or ferries despite being no 
      specific mention of him ever actually doing this. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We read of monks once crossing a river by 
      holding on to the tails and backs of a herd of cattle that was swimming 
      across the same river suggesting that when there was neither bridges, 
      boats or rafts that the Buddha might have had to improvise as these monks 
      did. There is no mention of the Buddha travelling by carriage or cart. In 
      only one place is he described as wearing sandals, so he probably went 
      bare footed most of the time (Vin, IV: 186).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Tipitaka mentions the itinerary of 
      many of the Buddha’s journeys giving us an idea of the distances he 
      sometimes travelled. For example, we know that within the first twelve 
      months after his enlightenment he went from Uruvela to Isipatthana via 
      Gaya and Benares, spent the three months of the rainy season there and 
      then travelled to Rajagaha via Benares, Gaya, Uruvela and Lativanna. All 
      these places can be identified with certainly and thus we can calculate 
      that he must have walked at least 300 kilometres. In the longest single 
      journey recorded in the Tipitaka, he went from Rajagaha: to Vesali to 
      Savatthi and back to Rajagaha via Kitigiri and Avali, a round trip of at 
      least 1600 kilometres (Vin, IV, 189). It is likely that he would have 
      started a trip like this at the end of the rains retreat and arrived back 
      in time for the next retreat nine months later. Unfortunately, it is not 
      possible to know how much time these or any of the other journeys might 
      have taken. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the famous Mahaparinibbana Sutta we 
      know that he went from Rajagaha to Kusinara via Nalanda, Patna and Vesali, 
      a total distance of about 300 kilometres. According to the sutta he left 
      Vesali at the end of the rains retreat (October) and of course he is 
      supposed to have attained final nirvana in Kusinara on the full moon of 
      Vesakha (May). This suggests that he took seven months to travel about 95 
      kilometres. Even allowing for the fact that he was old and in ill health 
      this seems like a very long time. It should be pointed out that only later 
      text in the Tipitaka mention that the Buddha’s parinivana took place at 
      Vesakha and the sutta gives the impression that while his last journey was 
      slow it was at a steady pace. However, it seems likely that the Buddha 
      conducted his journeys at a leisurely pace.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The evidence suggests that he would wake 
      before sunrise, go for pindapata in the nearest town or village just after 
      sunrise and having eaten, would set off while it was still cool. He would 
      walk until the midday heat became unpleasant and then take an afternoon 
      rest. If there was a village nearby he might stay until the next morning 
      and if not he might continue walking until he got to the next village. How 
      long he stayed at a particular place would have depended on many factors - 
      whether local people came to talk with and listen with him, whether food 
      and water was available, whether the atmosphere was congenial. We know for 
      example that he cut short his first stay in Rajagaha when people began to 
      complain that too many young men were leaving their families to become 
      monks (Vin, IV: 43). Once he arrived in the village of Thuna to find that 
      there was no water to drink because the brahmin inhabitants, hearing that 
      he was coming, had blocked up their wells with rice husks and cow dung 
      (Ud,78). The warm and respectful reception that Buddhist monks get today 
      was not always available to the Buddha and his disciples. He is often 
      described as travelling with either 500 monks (a conventional number 
      meaning ‘a lot’) or simply with &quot;a large group of monks&quot;. At other times 
      he would dismiss his attendant and companions telling them that he wanted 
      to wander by himself for a while (S.III:94).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha was not, as is commonly 
      supposed, primarily a forest dweller. Of the four monasteries he founded 
      and now identified by archaeologists - Ghositarama, Jivakarama, Jetavana 
      and Veluvana - the first is actually inside the walls of the city while 
      the other three are within easy waking distance of their respective 
      cities’. When staying in these places the Buddha’s accommodation would 
      have been reasonably comfortable but when he was on the road the situation 
      was very different and he would have to sleep in or take shelter in 
      whatever was available. We read of him sleeping in a potter’s shed on 
      grass spread on the floor (M.I:502). On another occasion, he arrived in 
      Kapilavatthu and finding no proper lodgings, spent the night in Bharandu’s 
      hermitage sleeping on a mat on the ground (A.I:277). Often he must have 
      simply slept in one of the many mango groves that to this day are still to 
      be seen near most north Indian villages. Finding him out in the open one 
      winter’s night Hattaka asked the Buddha if he was happy. He replied; &quot;Yes 
      my lad, I live happily. Of those who live happily in the world I am one&quot;. 
      Hattaka expressed surprise at this, pointing out that it was the dark half 
      of the month, the time of frost, that the ground was trampled hard by the 
      hoofs of the cattle, the carpet of leaves thin, the wind cold and that the 
      Buddha’s robe appeared to be thin. The Buddha reaffirmed that he was 
      nonetheless happy (A.I:136).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha must have also enjoyed the 
      freedom his life of wandering gave him. For him &quot;the household life is 
      full of hindrances, a path of dust. Free as the wind is the life of one 
      who renounces all worldly things&quot; (D,I:62). However, moving from place to 
      place had very important practical reasons behind it too, in a world 
      without the communications that we take for granted it allowed him to 
      spread his teachings far and wide. He was also aware that some personal 
      contact with him was important, especially for newly ordained monks and 
      nuns, and that this may have been a factor in determining in which 
      districts he visited and how often (S,III:90). During his wanderings he 
      might visit a district, teach, make some disciples, even ordain a few 
      monks or nuns and then perhaps not come again for many years. If a monk 
      from such a district wished to see him again he could simply set off to 
      wherever the Buddha was staying at the time. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sona Kutikannawas was ordained by 
      Mahakaccana and about a year later developed the desire to meet the man 
      whose teachings he had committed himself to. He said to his preceptor; &quot;I 
      have not yet met the Lord face to face, I have only heard about what he is 
      like. If you give me permission I will travel to see the Lord, the Noble 
      One, the Enlightened Buddha (Ud,58). For lay disciples with domestic 
      obligations undertaking a long journey to see the Buddha would have been 
      more difficult and so they may have had to wait, perhaps many years, 
      before they got to see him again. The Thapataya Sutta gives us some idea 
      of the excitement caused in an outlying district when its inhabitants 
      heard that the Buddha might be on his way to see him and how the 
      excitement increased as word of his gradual approach reached them 
      (S,V:348-349). Elsewhere we read of people’s anxiousness for news about 
      the Buddha and of what he had been teaching.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Once a monk who had spent the rainy season 
      with the Buddha in Savatthi arrived in Kapilavatthu. When people heard 
      where the monk had come from he found himself deluged with questions about 
      the Buddha (S,V:450). On another occasion a group of brahmins from Kosala 
      and Magadha who had arrived in Vesali, heard that the Buddha just happened 
      to be in town and decided that the opportunity to meet him was one that 
      was too good to miss. The Buddha had apparently given his attendant 
      instructions that he was not to be disturbed while the brahmins were 
      adamant that they would not leave until they got to see the famous 
      teacher.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Seeing this impasse, the novice Siha asked 
      the attendant to tell the Buddha that there were three people waiting to 
      see him. The attendant said he would not do this but he wouldn’t object if 
      Siha did. This was done, the Buddha asked Siha to put a mat outside his 
      residence in the shade for him to sit on while he talked to the brahmins 
      (D,I:151). But the Buddha couldn’t be everywhere at once and so monks and 
      nuns would often take long journeys for the privilege of spending some 
      time in his presence. For example once while he was residing in Catuma at 
      least five hundred monks arrived to see him (M,I: 456). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However, with him moving around a lot, it 
      was not always possible to know where he was at any one time. In the 
      beautiful Parayana Vagga of the Sutta Nipata we read of the sixteen 
      disciples of the ascetic Bavari setting out for northern India in the hope 
      of meeting the Buddha. First they heard that he was at Savatthi and 
      &quot;wearing matted hair and dressed in deer skin&quot; they headed there. They 
      went through Kosambi and Saketa and arrived in Savatthi only to find that 
      he had left some time previously. They followed his route through Setavya, 
      Kapilavatthu, Kusinara, Pava and Vesali finally catching up with him at 
      the Pasanaka Shrine, (Barabar Hills north of Gaya) &quot;and like a thirsty man 
      going for cool water, like merchants going for profit, like a heat 
      exhausted man going for shade, they quickly ascended the mountain&quot; (Sn 
      1014).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There were undoubtedly as many languages 
      and dialects spoken in the Buddha’s India as there are today and this 
      would have created special problems for him. Theravada tradition asserts 
      that the Buddha spoke Pali although there is no mention in the Tripitaka 
      of what language he spoke. Like merchants, diplomats and others whose 
      professions meant frequent travel in different regions it is very likely 
      that apart from his mother tongue, which would have been a dialect of 
      Kosala, he was probably fluent in several other languages as well. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the Aranavibhanga Sutta he says that 
      insisting on using one’s own dialect in an area where another is spoken 
      can only cause confusion and conflict. &quot;It has been said, ‘One should not 
      stake too much on the local language...’ How does one do this? In 
      different regions they might call the same thing a pati, a patta, a 
      vittha, a serava, a dharopa, a pona, a hana or a pisila (these are all 
      different words for a bowl or dish). So whatever they call it in one 
      region, one uses that word thinking, ‘It seems this person is referring to 
      that object’, and one uses that word accordingly&quot;. These are the words of 
      someone familiar with at least eight languages and dialects and who was 
      very open and practical about language. The Buddha was equally open about 
      regional customs as well.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Once when he found some monks spending too 
      much time bathing and playing in the water he made a rule that they should 
      only bathe once a month. Later some monks who had been staying in an 
      outlying region where people found their infrequent bathing revolting (not 
      surprisingly) reported this to the Buddha and he allowed them to bathe 
      more often to accord with the customs of that region. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Once again this is the kind of thing one 
      would expect of the urbane well-travelled individual. Whatever the Buddha 
      was he was not parochial and no doubt his travels made him even more 
      urbane and open-minded.</FONT></P>
