<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Conceit is tolerated in the successful,&quot; this
  saying is applicable to worldly matters but not acceptable in spiritual light. Even then
  it still has its limits. To what point then, is it too much? Flaunting constitutional laws
  may be one, overstepping human rights may be another. Results could be disastrous,
  especially if it involves someone powerful and at the top. In the Buddha's time the
  massacre of the Sakyans by Virudhaka and his army is a classic example. But this does not
  occur only with conceit, it may be likewise with other mental defilements when they become
  strong.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore we may trace all sufferings back to the mind,
  hence the saying from the Dhammapada, &quot;The mind is the forerunner of all
  states.&quot; Conceit is an unwholesome, unskillful mental state, and as such it inflicts
  suffering whilst it arises and brings worse after that. It is described as &quot;puffed
  up&quot; or &quot;swollen headed&quot; as if to say, &quot;I am the greatest and no one
  (or almost no one) knows better than me.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a result one exalts oneself and depreciates others. One
  loses prudence, conscience, mindfulness and hence let the defilements a freehand to
  shamelessly and carelessly displaying ones property and person. Step on his toes at this
  point and you're going to get the worst of it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One may be pround of ones:</font><ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Birth - that is, to be proud that one is born of such a
      noble family, race, etc. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Possesssions - that is, to be proud of being rich, having
      mansions, cars, jewelry, responsible posts in society, etc. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Virtues and other meritorious qualities - that is, to be
      proud of having moral precepts, having attained concentration, insights, etc. </font></li>
  </ol>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In meditation, our aim is to eradicate all defilements and
  so conceit in any of these categories will have to be watched out for, tackled with and
  destroyed. In this article however, we will look into the last category.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have personally been asked more than once, &quot;Why is
  so and so who gives good dhamma talks, being acclaimed as a good yogi, and even gives
  meditation instructions act in such a conceited manner?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation is the process and way to purify the mind of
  defilements with the selfishness at the focal point and it is amazing that how such a
  thing could happen. Well, for one, ones own defilements are not easy to see, though it is
  not true in the case of seeing other's. And when they arise they can very effectively mask
  reality. Try telling someone deeply infatuated how filthy and smelly his lover's body is
  and he'll think you're nuts. How on earth did Devadatta commit such an atrocious crime
  towards the Buddha, and Price Ajjatasattu to his father? They were intelligent men who
  could have won the path with Buddha's help. We certainly should never underestimate the
  power of the defilements and be conceited to overestimate our abilities.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So I answer, &quot;Well, obviously more meditation needs
  to be done and could you imagine how worse it can be without all those Dhamma?&quot;
  Things usually happen this way: One first undertakes meditation sincerely and seriously.
  With practice there will be some progress. One would out of compassion try to do ones part
  for others. As a result, along comes praises, gains, honour, etc. All this may just be too
  much to take and as the saying goes, it went right up to the head. Here we must be
  remember that conceit begins with its subtle forms that occur only at the mental level.
  When it shows up in the face, voice or actions such as praising oneself and running down
  others thoughtlessly it is certainly very gross. At that point it is not too difficult to
  spot the sore thumb. Therefore the commentary describes conceit as holding up the banner
  so that others can see. A Thai saying: &quot;When the buffalo wants to shit, it will know
  how to raise up its tail&quot; says it more effectively and with humour.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the next thing that happens will be one thinking highly
  of oneself and looking down on those who do not meditate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I know of one layperson who has even gone to the extent of
  running down ones earlier meditation teachers, giving rude remarks to monks who does not
  meet with ones standard and turns friends who try to correct one into enemies. The
  eventual fate of such a person will be isolation from other's worthy company after causing
  considerable harm to oneself, the Dhamma and the spiritual community. Such a one has been
  described as the flowering of the bamboo before it dies.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we see how important it is that a Buddhist needs to
  meditate to eradicate their defilements with conceit included. Emphasis can be made on
  conceit when it involves the leaders.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another thing about conceit when it occurs concerning
  meditation is that is may even be more difficult to rectify than normal circumstances.
  This is becuase the conceited is supposed to have experienced some extraordinary and lofty
  experiences which is considered profound or even holy. It's something that makes him a
  saint or half-saint. And you simply are not in the position to argue because you still
  haven't got it. So it needs somebody higher or highest to tell him one or two things. It
  is unfortunate that such somebody is not easy to come by. It also depends on how high on
  the clouds he has gone.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such experiences can come under tranquility or insight
  meditation experiences.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In tranquility meditation experiences, one may feel proud
  of having attained certain states of concentration. If there's a big name such as 1st
  jhana, 2nd jhana, etc to go along with it, it's even better. Included in this category are
  all the accompanying experiences such as joy, lights, seeing visions etc. One may even
  believe one has developed clairvoyance, ability to recollect past lives, telepathy, etc.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one has really attained to such deep states where ones
  mind is totally detached and removed from the normal range of senses, into states more
  deep and blissful than deep sleep, it is commendable but nevertheless halts the path of
  progress should any attachment and conceit develop no matter how slight. Thinking that
  those deep absorptions are the absolute Nibbana would be worse as it falls under clinging
  to wrong view. Thinking one has supernormal powers when in fact they are mostly
  hallucinations can be worse, because one will eventually end up with madness if not
  corrected in time. For such sad cases the woeful states will surely be waiting for them at
  their deathbed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At this point we can see how important it is to note
  mindfully when such states or thoughts regarding such states arise.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In insight meditation experiences one may also come across
  the elevating effects of concentration such as light and joy besides the insight knowledge
  peculiar to insight meditation. In the Vissudhimagga, ten extraordinary experieces or
  phenomena may be met with due to progress in the practice. It further adds that one may
  cling to it with attachment, conceit or wrong views. These ten imperfections of insight (<i>vipassanupakilesa</i>)
  are:</font><ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Light or illuminations </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Knowledge </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Joy </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Quietude or tranquility </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Rapturous happiness </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Resolve or faith </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Exertion or energy </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Equanimity or balance </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Desire or attachment </font></li>
  </ol>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Take for example joy (piti): When one experiences joy, it
  may be so overwhelming that one begins to want more of it and finally indulge in it, such
  is clinging with attachment. At times one may think highly of oneself that few are those
  that enjoy such happiness as myself, then there is conceit. However, there may be times
  when the joy can be so blissful that one is completely oblivious to everything around one,
  making one think that one has experienced the blissful cessation of Nibbana, then there is
  wrong view. From here we can see that these three attachment, conceit and wrong views are
  closely connected. One eventually leads to another.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although one may have read or being told about the dangers
  of attachment to such states, very often, yogis still fall into the trap and have to be
  reminded again and again. Although it occurs strongly at the third insight knowledge of
  comprehension, it can arise at any stage of the practice. So we have to be on guard at all
  times, because attachment here may not mean only halting of ones progress but also mental
  imbalance and rebirth in the woeful states. This is especially so if one thinks that one
  has reached stages of sanctification when one has in fact not.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Besides these ten imperfections of insight, one may also
  get attached, become conceited or develop wrong views after one has emerged from the
  experiences of insight knowledges, except of course the Path and Fruition knowledges. Even
  a stream winner who has abandoned wrong views, attachment to wrong practice and skeptical
  doubts is still not free from conceit. Of course it will be considerably lesser than an
  ordinary person because with the destruction of wrong views, conceit is also destroyed to
  some degree, especially the grosser forms.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <i>Maha Rahulovada Sutta</i>, the Buddha advises
  Rahula to develop the meditation that is the perception of impermanence to get rid of the
  'I am' conceit. This is none other than the practice of insight meditation. When one
  develops thorough and penetrating mindfulness to note each and every mind and body process
  moment to moment without fail, the seven factors of enlightment will arise and these will
  uproot the defilements including conceit.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Firstly when there is mindfulness, defilements have no way
  to arise. If it has arisen through some negligence, mindfulness will quickly take notice
  of it and replace it with mindfulness. When it develops into penetrative experiential
  knowldge (investigation of the Dhamma) it will see clearly the three characteristics of
  impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and non-self. Then one will come to some realization
  that: &quot;Since all is so transient, what is there for me to be proud of? Since there is
  so much suffering, what is there for me to be conceited about? Since there is No-self, who
  is there to be conceited?&quot; Further development of such insights will bring joy and
  tranquility in the realization of non-self. These will further encourage one to go one
  abandoning any attachments to clinging to the Self and the 'I am' conceit. With increased
  energy and concentration of such awareness and insight, the mind will become very
  equanimous to any formations or phenomena that arises. The balance of mind will further
  help in the development of mindfulness and the eradication of pride, just as one is not
  easily shaken by praise or blame.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, one can, if negligence manages to creep in,
  attachment and conceit regarding these wholesome states may still arise. So again may we
  be reminded to be every vigilant against negligence. And may we all be diligent in our
  practice to abandon forever all our conceit to realize what the Exalted One has said:</font></p>
