      <p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><b><i><FONT SIZE="6">W</FONT>hy did the Buddha say that some
    questions just shouldn't be asked? </i></b></font></p>
    
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">One of the first stumbling blocks that Westerners often encounter when
    they learn about Buddhism is the teaching on anatta, often translated as &quot;no-self''. This
    teaching is a stumbling block for two reasons.
    </font></p>
    
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">First, the idea of there being no self doesn't fit well with other
    Buddhist teachings, such as the doctrine of karma and rebirth: If there's no self, what
    experiences the results of karma and takes rebirth? <br>
    <br>
    Second, it doesn't fit well with the Western Judaeo-Christian worldview which assumes the
    existence of an eternal soul or self as a basic presupposition: ie, if there's no self,
    what's the purpose of a spiritual life? <br>
    <br>
    Many books try to answer these questions, but if you look at the Pali canon 
    -- the earliest
    extant record of the Buddha's teachings -- you won't find them addressed at all. In fact,
    the one place where the Buddha was asked point-blank whether or not there was a self, he
    refused to answer.<br>
    <br>
    When later asked why, he said that to hold either that there is a self or that there is no
    self is to fall into extreme forms of wrong view that make the path of Buddhist practice
    impossible. Thus the question should be put aside. <br>
    <br>
    To understand what his silence on this question says about the meaning of anatta, we first
    have to look at his teachings on how questions should be asked and answered, and how to
    interpret his answers. <br>
    <br>
    The Buddha divided all questions into four classes: those that deserve a categorical
    (straight yes or no) answer; those that deserve an analytical answer, defining and
    qualifying the terms of the question; those that deserve a counter-question, putting the
    ball back in the questioner's court; and those that deserve to be put aside. The last
    class of question consists of those that don't lead to the end of suffering and stress. <br>
    <br>
    The first duty of a teacher, when asked a question, is to figure out which class the
    question belongs to, and then to respond in the appropriate way. You don't, for example,
    say yes or no to a question that should be put aside. If you are the person asking the
    question and you get an answer, you should then determine how far the answer should be
    interpreted. <br>
    <br>
    The Buddha said that there are two types of people who misrepresent him: those who draw
    inferences from statements that shouldn't have inferences drawn from them, and those who
    don't draw inferences from those that should. <br>
    <br>
    These are the basic ground rules for interpreting the Buddha's teachings, but if we look
    at the way most writers treat the anatta doctrine, we find these ground rules ignored. <br>
    <br>
    Some writers try to qualify the no-self interpretation by saying that the Buddha denied
    the existence of an eternal self or a separate self, but this is to give an analytical
    answer to a question that the Buddha showed should be put aside. <br>
    <br>
    Others try to draw inferences from the few statements in the discourse that seem to imply
    that there is no self, but it seems safe to assume that if one forces those statements to
    give an answer to a question that should be put aside, one is drawing inferences where
    they shouldn't be drawn. <br>
    <br>
    So, instead of answering &quot;no'' to the question of whether or not there is a self 
    --
    interconnected or separate, eternal or not-- the Buddha felt that the question was
    misguided to begin with. <br>
    <br>
    Why? No matter how you define the line between &quot;self'' and &quot;other'', the notion of self
    involves an element of self-identification and clinging, and thus suffering and stress.
    This holds as much for an interconnected self, which recognises no &quot;other'', as it does
    for a separate self. If one identifies with all of nature, one is pained by every felled
    tree.<br>
    <br>
    It also holds for an entirely &quot;other'' universe, in which the sense of alienation and
    futility would become so debilitating as to make the quest for happiness -- one's own or
    that of others -- impossible. <br>
    <br>
    For these reasons, the Buddha advised paying no attention to such questions as 
    &quot;Do I
    exist?'' or &quot;Don't I exist?'' for however you answer them, they lead to suffering and
    stress. <br>
    <br>
    To avoid the suffering implicit in questions of &quot;self'' and &quot;other'', he offered an
    alternative way of dividing up experience: the Four Noble Truths of stress, its cause, its
    cessation, and the path to its cessation. <br>
    <br>
    Rather than viewing these truths as pertaining to self or other, he said, one should
    recognise them simply for what they are, in and of themselves, as they are directly
    experienced, and then perform the duty appropriate to each. <br>
    <br>
    Stress should be comprehended, its cause abandoned, its cessation realised, and the path
    to its cessation developed. These duties form the context in which the anatta doctrine is
    best understood. <br>
    <br>
    If you develop the path of virtue, concentration, and discernment to a state of calm
    well-being and use that calm state to look at experience in terms of the Noble Truths, the
    questions that occur to the mind are not &quot;Is there a self? What is my self?'' but rather
    &quot;Am I suffering stress because I'm holding onto this particular phenomenon? Is it really
    me, myself, or mine? If it's stressful but not really me or mine, why hold on?'' <br>
    <br>
    These last questions merit straightforward answers, as they then help you to comprehend
    stress and to chip away at the attachment and clinging -- the residual sense of
    self-identification -- that cause it, until ultimately all traces of self-identification
    are gone and all that's left is limitless freedom. <br>
    <br>
    In this sense, the anatta teaching is not a doctrine of no-self, but a not-self strategy
    for shedding suffering by letting go of its cause, leading to the highest, undying
    happiness. At that point, questions of self, no-self, and not-self fall aside. Once
    there's the experience of such total freedom, where would there be any concern about
    what's experiencing it, or whether or not it's a self?</font></p>
