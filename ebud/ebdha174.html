    face="Times New Roman">his essay is based on a talk &quot;The Working of Kamma&quot; by
    the author at the Kuching Buddhist Society, Sarawak in December, 1997 and was published by
    the Buddhist Gem Fellowship in their book &quot;K. Sri Dhammananda Felicitation&quot; in
    1999. It is reproduced here with some minor amendments.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">W</font><font size="3">hat is </font><font
    size="4">K</font><font size="3">amma?</font></font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><em>Kamma</em> is usually an interesting subject
    because it concerns everyone and there are many different aspects of it. There are many
    natural laws that govern our lives but the most important is the law of <em>Kamma-vipãka</em>.
    In a discourse (A.N. 6.63) the Buddha said &quot;Intention, monks, is <em>Kamma</em> I
    say. Having willed, one acts through body, speech and mind&quot;. This means that
    intentional action is <em>kamma</em>, and <em>vipãka</em> is the result or effects of it.
    The result may ripen immediately, later in this life or in a future life.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><em>Kamma</em>-<em>vipãka</em> is sometimes
    translated as cause and effect (yinkuo in Chinese books) but that is not a good
    translation. This is because there are two types of cause and effect - worldly cause and
    effect, and kammic cause and effect. The difference can be seen, for example, when you are
    driving a car and suddenly a small boy runs across the road, and you hit the boy and kill
    him. You did not have the intention to kill the small boy, so you did not create any
    kamma. However, you did knock down the boy and the boy's family might pull you out of the
    car when you stop, and beat you up. In addition to that, they might also sue you in court.
    So there is a result of knocking down the boy, namely, you get a beating and then be sued
    in court. However, this is worldly cause and effect. It is not concerned with Buddhist <em>kamma</em>-<em>vipãka
    </em>because there was no intention on your part to kill the boy. So we must clearly
    differentiate between worldly cause and effect and <em>kamma</em>-<em>vipãka </em>(intentional
    action and its result). They are different because one involves action with intention and
    the other does not.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Then comes the question: how do we create <em>kamma?
    </em>It is created through the three doors of body, speech and mind. Through the body, we
    can kill, steal and commit adultery. Through speech, we lie, cause disharmony by carrying
    tales from one person to another, use coarse speech and idle talk(gossip). Mental <em>kamma</em>
    is when we have excessive greed and covetousness, malice and hatred, wrong views, etc.
    Mental <em>kamma</em> is not so much thinking or stray thoughts but thoughts with some
    kind of intention behind them.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What is wholesome <em>kamma</em> and what is
    unwholesome <em>kamma</em>? In other words, what is good <em>kamma</em> and evil <em>kamma</em>?
    Good <em>kamma</em> is that which benefits living beings, helps living beings, and makes
    them happy. Evil <em>kamma</em> or unwholesome <em>kamma</em> is that which harms living
    beings, like killing and stealing, that results in the suffering of some living beings. In
    this way the criteria for good and evil in Buddhism is different from other religions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The effect of <em>Kamma </em>is also long
    lasting. For example, in one discourse (A.N. 5.31) a king's daughter by the name of Sumana
    came to the Buddha and asked if there is a difference between a person who likes to give
    alms to the monks and a person who does not, if both subsequently are reborn in heaven.
    The Buddha said that the difference between the two of them is that the alms-giver
    surpasses the non-giver in life span, beauty, happiness, honour and power. Sumana then
    asked if there would be a difference between the two subsequently when both are reborn
    into the human realm. Again the Buddha said there would be - the alms giver surpassed the
    non-giver in life span, beauty, happiness, honour and power. Sumana then asked whether
    there would be a difference between the two when both renounced and became monks. The
    Buddha answered affirmatively. The alms giver will get more offerings of food, robes,
    medicines from the lay people when he is a monk; more people will like him and he will
    have more places to live compared to the non-giver. So we can see the long-lasting effect
    of <em>kamma</em> which follows us.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">A</font><font size="3">voiding</font><font
    size="4"> E</font><font size="3">vil</font></font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's teaching is concerned with skillful
    living so that we can reduce or avoid unnecessary suffering. It is important to know the
    law of <em>kamma-vipãka</em> in order to avoid unnecessary suffering. In life, there are
    some types of suffering that are unavoidable but there are those that are avoidable. What
    is unavoidable suffering? It is growing old, becoming sick and dying. These are the three
    things that nobody can avoid. However, there are certain sufferings that we can avoid. In
    the worldly sense, take for example, drinking and driving. If you drink and then drive at
    the same time, you'll probably end up with an accident. However, you know that when you
    drink, you shouldn't drive and when you drive, you shouldn't drink - that way you avoid an
    unnecessary accident. So in the same way, when it comes to <em>kamma-vipãka,</em> we know
    unskillful or evil actions which harm living beings bring suffering to the doer as a
    consequence. So we abstain from evil actions and avoid unnecessary suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The law of <em>kamma-vipãka</em> is like the
    saying &quot;As you sow, so shall you reap.&quot; Depending on what you plant, you'll get
    its fruit in return. So, we train ourselves to abstain from unwholesome or unskillful <em>kamma.</em>
    For this, the Buddha advised that we uphold the five precepts every day which is the basic
    training in moral conduct. The first precept is not to kill. The second is not to take
    what is not given. The third is not to commit adultery. The fourth is not to lie. The
    fifth is not to take intoxicants. There are the very basic things that are even found in
    the laws of the country. If you kill a human being, the law will get you; similarly, when
    you steal or run away with somebody's wife or husband, or cheat, you will get yourself
    into a lot of trouble. So these five precepts are the basic things that we have to uphold.
    Note that these precepts are training rules, not commandments.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In the early Buddhist teachings, it was not
    taught that we must become vegetarians. If you want to become a vegetarian, that is very
    good. However, if you do not want to become a vegetarian, you should know when meat cannot
    be eaten. The type of meat allowed to be eaten has three conditions: when you do not (1)
    see, (2) hear, and (3) suspect, that the animal was specifically killed for you. With
    these three conditions, you do not experience the direct <em>kamma</em> of killing the
    animal because there was no intention on your part to do so, although there may be worldly
    cause and effect involved. For instance, if you buy the meat from the market which is
    already slaughtered, e.g. fish that is already dead, that is acceptable. The type of meat
    that is not allowed is where for example, you go to the market, and select a chicken and
    ask the seller to slaughter the chicken for you, or you enter a restaurant and select a
    live fish to be cooked.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Eating meat does not necessarily mean that one
    approves of the killing of animals. Suffering <em>(dukkha)</em> is a fact of life, and as
    living beings strive to survive, those that succeed inevitably do so at the expense of
    other living beings. Eating vegetarian food still indirectly involves the killing of
    kangaroos and rabbits, squirrels and monkeys, insects and snails, and other 'pests' -
    should the whole world become vegetarians, animals would probably still be killed as they
    would multiply in such great numbers and so quickly as to be a threat to human survival
    (e.g. in Malaysia, dogs on the streets without licences are disposed of).</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">D</font><font size="3">oing</font><font
    size="4"> G</font><font size="3">ood</font></font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After avoiding doing evil, we need to do good and
    create wholesome <em>kamma</em> that benefits others, so that in return, we get the
    benefits too. Thus, the Buddha advised us to do dãna. <em>Dãna</em> is offerings or
    charity. You can also keep the eight precepts once a week. As lay people do not have much
    time to cultivate the spiritual path like monks, they can set aside one day each week to
    cultivate the eight precepts. This can be done either in a monastery, Buddhist Society or
    at home.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also explained how good <em>kamma</em>
    can result in a lot of blessings. In the <em>Mangala Sutta</em>, a heavenly being <em>(deva)</em>
    asked the Buddha about the highest blessings. The Buddha then taught the <em>deva</em> the
    ways to obtain the highest blessings. For instance, the Buddha said not to associate with
    fools but to associate with the wise; to respect those who are worthy of respect such as
    parents, elders, teachers and monks. To have much knowledge of the Buddha's teachings also
    brings you blessings. Discussion of the Dhamma with others, and having gratitude (which is
    not common in this world) brings blessings too. Among the first people that we need to
    show gratitude to are our parents because they have done a lot for us. It is a Buddhist
    tradition that we support and respect our parents. Another cause for blessings is
    humility. People sometimes forget about it when they succeed in life. When we become
    bosses, our ego increases and that is not good for us.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Sometimes we forget these things, but when we
    read about the Dhamma, it reminds us to walk the good way. Meekness is another good
    quality. Even in the Bible, it is said. &quot;Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit
    the kingdom of heaven.&quot; Forbearance or patience is another important quality. People
    are sometimes not nice to us. In such cases, we have to be patient and try to see that
    perhaps we have done something wrong in the past and we are getting the retribution. When
    we see it in this way, we will learn to bear difficult or trying circumstances. Visiting
    monks or seeing monks so that we can learn some Dhamma is another way we can get
    blessings.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In a discourse (A.N. 4.4.), the Buddha said that
    there are four types of persons to whom you must conduct yourself carefully because they
    are the four fields of merit and the four fields of demerit. If you are good towards them,
    there will be a lot of merit. If you act badly towards them, you will get a lot of
    demerit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first type of person is the Buddha. However, since the
    Buddha has passed into <em>parinibb<font size="3">ãna,</em> we cannot interact with him.
    So, we cannot do anything about that. The second type of person is the disciples of the
    Buddha, namely the monks and nuns. We have to be careful not to create bad<em> kamma</em>
    with monks or nuns because if that monk or nun is a good monk or nun, then our demerit is
    serious. The third one is our mother, and the fourth is our father.</font></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our mothers and fathers are a good field of
    merit. If you serve your mother and father well, you will get a lot of blessings. Some
    people make the mistake of being not filial towards their parents, and after their parents
    have passed away, they may get a lot of remorse that troubles their minds. Therefore, we
    learn from the Buddha's teachings to be good to our parents while they are still alive.
    After they have passed away, there is not much we can do for them. To really repay our
    parents' kindness; we should teach them to have faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and <em>Sangha</em>,
    to uphold the five precepts, to be generous or charitable, and to listen to the Buddha's
    discourses so as to have more wisdom.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The first advantage of doing wholesome <em>kamma</em>
    is that you will get a good reputation. Because if you do not kill , do not steal, commit
    adultery or lie, you will get a good reputation. You will have nothing to be ashamed of
    when you do good <em>kamma</em>, and that is the second advantage of doing good. When you
    are facing a group of people, you would dare to face them without any sense of shame.
    Whereas, if you have done shameful deeds, you would not have such confidence.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Another advantage of doing good <em>kamma</em> is
    that we would have a very clear mind when we grow old because there is no remorse to
    disturb us. When I lived in Penang a few years ago, I had a very devoted old supporter to
    whose house I used to go on alms round. This old woman is in her 80s and she is very thin
    and frail, but her mind is very clear. She has a very good memory as a result of keeping
    the precepts very thoroughly and practising much charity. She can even remember telephone
    numbers quite clearly.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, there are some people who do
    not keep the precepts. When they reach their 50s, their mind is often disturbed and
    troubled, and very quickly by the age of 55, they are already senile and talking nonsense.
    This is because they have a lot of unwholesome <em>kamma</em> troubling their minds.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We are also not afraid to die when we keep the
    precepts and do good. If we have very good <em>kamma</em>, we have the confidence that the
    good <em>kamma</em> will support us when we die. We know that when we close our eyes and
    pass away, we will be going to a good place. Whereas, people who have done a lot of evil
    are afraid of dying when their time comes. They are very scared and dare not close their
    eyes. Some of them do not even dare to switch off the lights at night, and some are even
    terrified.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Lastly, if you have good <em>kamma</em>, the
    Buddha said that it will lead us to a good rebirth. If in addition to doing good we
    encourage others to do good, or approve of good deeds or praise the doing of good we
    encourage others to do good, or approve of good deeds or praise the doing of good, then
    more blessings are generated. And vice versa for doing evil - more demerit is created.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">According to a discourse (A.N. 8.36), there are
    three bases of meritorious action - charity <em>(dãna)</em>, moral conduct <em>(sîla)</em>
    and mind development <em>(bhãvanã)</em>. A person who practises charity and moral
    conduct only on a small scale would be reborn as a human being of poor luck. One who
    practises these two things to a medium degree would be reborn as a human being of good
    fortune. And one who practises charity and moral conduct to a high degree would be reborn
    in the heavenly realm. This also implies that people who practise neither charity nor
    moral conduct would be reborn in the three woeful states - ghost, animal and hell realms -
    and the would be the majority of people.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">E</font><font size="3">ffects of</font><font
    size="4"> K</font><font size="3">amma</font></font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The is a discourse called <em>Culakammavibhanga
    Sutta</em> where a person asked the Buddha why people in the world are different: some are
    ugly, some are beautiful; some have short life, others have long life; etc. The Buddha
    said that beings are born of their <em>kamma</em>, owners of their <em>kamma</em>,<em> </em>abide
    supported by their <em>kamma</em>.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Buddha explained that if in a previous life,
    a person is always angry, then when he is reborn as a human, he would become ugly. If a
    person is good-natured, and does not have a temper, he would be born beautiful. This is
    because every time we become angry, our face looks fierce and ugly. When we are often
    angry, we habitually make our face fierce and ugly. So we are reborn with a fierce and
    ugly face, and people will say it is an ugly face. Whereas another person who is
    good-natured, always smiling and takes things evenly will have a face that is sweet and
    pleasant. Naturally, he will be born beautiful.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Why is a person born sickly? The Buddha said that
    if a person likes to harm living beings, for example, beat his slaves, or dogs or other
    animals and make their bodies painful, then the next time when he comes back as a human,
    he will have a sickly body that gives him pain as a retribution. However, if you do not
    torture other beings and do not make their bodies painful, then naturally, when you come
    back as a human, you will be healthy and strong.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If a person in a past life has done a lot of
    killing, for example he liked to go hunting, and fishing - in other words, he enjoys
    himself at the expense of the life of other beings - due to the fact that he had made
    other beings' lives short, the next time he will get a short life as a result. You see
    some children that are born but do not survive, or pass away very young. Some children
    suffer from cancer although they are very young. On the other hand, a person who does not
    kill, and who allows other beings to have a long life, will naturally have long life as a
    result.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If you have been selfish in the past - never
    charitable, never helpful to others - in the next life, you will be reborn into a poor
    family. When you try to do business, nobody wants to support you. However, if you are
    charitable, very helpful towards others, in the next life, you will get it back. You might
    be born into a wealthy family, or if you start a business, people will come and support
    you. So you become wealthy very easily. You can see this sometimes. There might be two
    shops selling the same things on the same road, but one might be successful and the other
    a failure. Therefore, some of the things that the Buddha taught are self-evident because
    you can see it all around us.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Why is a person born stupid? This is because in
    the past, when you did not know something, you did not take the trouble to investigate
    what is wholesome. Another reason for stupidity could be due to the fact that the person
    drank too much liquor. Why is a person born intelligent? Firstly, if he does not know
    something, he takes the trouble to ask and investigate. The other reason is that he avoids
    intoxicants like liquor and drugs. The third reason is that he meditates. We meditate to
    develop our mind. It brings us wisdom.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Why are some people unknown and insignificant,
    and others are influential and well-known? The Buddha said that the person who is unknown
    and insignificant is a person who was a small-hearted person, who was always jealous of
    other people, and very spiteful. Therefore, when he is reborn he becomes unknown and
    insignificant. Nobody bother about him. Whereas another person is big-hearted and was
    never jealous of other people. He had a lot of goodwill instead of ill-will. Therefore,
    that person, when he come to be a human again, will be born influential and well-known,
    and powerful.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So <em>kamma</em> can explain why people in the
    world are all different. Due to past life <em>kamma</em>, each of us comes into life with
    different qualities. However, we must remember that we cannot put it all on past life <em>kamma</em>
    alone, because the law of <em>kamma</em> does not only concern our past life<em> kamma</em>.
    If you say everything is due to past life <em>kamma</em>, then we do not need to do
    anything - just sit down and wait for <em>kamma</em> to bring us everything. Evidently,
    you can see that it does not work this way.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We take an example of the Form 5 students
    studying to try to get ten A's in their examinations. Let us consider three types of
    students. The first one does not bother to study, but he goes around praying from temple
    to &quot;daot kong&quot; (a deity) and everywhere else, trying to get ten A's, but refuses
    to study, So, can he get ten A's? Definitely not because he does not put in the <em>kamma</em>.
    He relies on past <em>kamma</em> only.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The second student studies very hard, but
    unfortunately, he is born not very smart, but he works very hard. He stays up very late
    until 12 midnight, sleeps six hours, and studies hard everyday. Perhaps he might get two
    or three A's because he is not very smart. The third student is born very intelligent, and
    on top of that, he studies very hard. He is the type of person who can get ten A's. For
    the second student who studies very hard, that is his present life <em>kamma</em>.
    However, he did not have the support of past life <em>kamma</em> that gives him
    intelligence. That is why he did not succeed. On the other hand, the third student has the
    support from previous life <em>kamma</em> to be born very smart, and he works hard
    (present life <em>kamma</em>). When both the past life and the present life <em>kamma</em>s
    are working together, we can get what we want. This is a fact that we have to keep in
    mind.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It is because of this reason that the Buddha said
    that we have to strive. The Buddha said that all Buddhas only show the way. Striving
    should be done by you. Therefore, we should understand that the Dhamma only guides us; we
    have to do the walking ourselves. That is why some people say that Buddhism is a
    do-it-yourself religion.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">C</font><font size="3">riteria for </font><font
    size="4">A</font><font size="3">ction</font></font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In one discourse (M.N.61), the Buddha advised
    about performing <em>kamma</em>. He said that before we do any <em>kamma</em>, we have to
    reflect, &quot;This <em>kamma</em> that I am going to do through body, speech and mind -
    is it going to harm somebody? If it is going to harm some being or myself, I should not do
    it. However, if it benefits some other being, or if it benefits myself, then I should do
    it again and again.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So before you do a <em>kamma</em>, you must
    reflect. Even while doing the <em>kamma</em>, the Buddha said that we must also reflect.
    In the midst of doing <em>kamma</em>, we must reflect thus, &quot;Is what I am doing now
    right or wrong? If it is right, I'll continue to do it. If it is wrong, I'll stop
    immediately.&quot; After the action is done, we should again reflect back and think
    carefully what we did - yesterday, or three days ago, or a week ago, or a month ago. You
    reflect on whether the action was correct or not, and whether you should have done it or
    not. When we reflect on our actions in this way, we will be living our lives skillfully,
    and we will avoid unnecessary suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Another good criterion for judging whether a <em>kamma</em>
    that should not be done, or whether it is an evil <em>kamma</em> that should not be done,
    is, according to the Buddha, whether the <em>kamma</em> leads to an increase, or decrease
    in wholesome states of mind; or a decrease in wholesome states of mind; or a decrease or
    increase in unwholesome states of mind, in yourself and other people. If the <em>kamma</em>
    brings about an increase in wholesome states of mind, or a decrease in unwholesome states
    of mind in others or oneself, then that is good <em>kamma</em> which should be performed
    again and again.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What are wholesome states? Wholesome states are
    good states of mind; happy states of mind, like non-attachment; goodwill instead of
    ill-will; a tranquil mind instead of a restless mind; not jealous of others; and the like.
    So this kind of wholesome states of mind gives you peace, gives you a happy state.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Whereas unwholesome states of mind are states of
    mind are states that make you agitated; make you unhappy, e.g. greed, anger, restlessness,
    jealousy, arrogance. Evil <em>kamma</em> or unwholesome states. You should avoid
    performing this kind of <em>kamma</em>.</font></p>

    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In one discourse (S.N. 36.21), the Buddha said
    that not all suffering is due to <em>kamma</em>, there are other factors that can cause us
    suffering. Suffering could be due to imbalance of wind or bile or phlegm. It could be the
    weather, perhaps. In Kuching, for example, the air pollution index suddenly shot up to
    about 1000 (in the year 1997) and caused a great deal of suffering. Another reason could
    be our own carelessness. Another possible reason is accident.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">However, things mostly happen because of <em>kamma</em>.
    Consider the case of a person who gets involves in an accident, and passes away. If his
    death is due to carelessness, or accidental occurrences, then it means that his <em>kamma</em>
    as a human being might not be over.. He would probably be reborn as a human being.
    However, if his death is because his <em>kamma</em> as a human being has ended, then he
    would not be reborn as a human being. He would be reborn in another plane of existence.
    Therefore, this is another thing to remember; not everything is due to <em>kamma</em>.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There are five<em> kammic</em> offences mentioned
    in a discourse that are considered as most serious. The first serious offence is when you
    intentionally shed the blood of a Buddha with evil intent. The second serious offence is
    when you kill an <em>Arahat</em>. The third serious offence is the killing of your own
    mother. The fourth serious offence is the killing of your own father. Lastly, you cause
    disharmony among the harmonious community of monks that result in the community being
    split. These five offences will bring one down to hell in the next rebirth, and will make
    one stay there for a long time.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The working of<em> kamma-vipãka</em> is very
    complex. The Buddha said in one discourse (A.N. 4.77) that there are four things that you
    should not think about too much. If you think too much about these four things, you would
    become deranged. The first is the power of the Buddha; the second is the depth and power
    of <em>jhãna</em>; the third is <em>kamma-vipãka</em>; and the fourth is speculation
    about the nature of the world.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Why should we not think too much
    about <em>kamma-vipãka</em>? It is because <em>kamma-vipãka</em> is very complex. The
    working of <em>kamma-vipãka</em> depends not only on your present lifetime but also on
    many, many lifetimes of unsettled <em>kamma</em> accounts. On top of that, the result of
    it depends on the state of mind at that moment. Moreover, the state of mind of the other
    person you do the <em>kamma </em>to also affects you <em>vipãka</em>. For example, when
    you make an offering to a murderer, or a criminal, or to and evil person, your merit is
    very small, but if you make an offering to a holy man, then your merit or blessings is
    great. Conversely, if you kill a holy man, then your kammic offence is very great.
    Whereas, if you kill a mosquito, the <em>kamma</em> is not as bad, but still you are not
    encouraged to kill it. The workings of <em>kamma-vipãka</em> is very complex that we find
    it hard to understand.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Sometimes we see certain people whom
    you consider as evil, rough, and offensive, but they are having a luxurious life. This is
    sometimes due to their good <em>kamma</em> from past life supporting them, and they are
    now creating a lot of bad <em>kamma</em> which has not ripened yet. This could be due to
    the fact that people can change. For example, when a man is poor he is humble,
    industrious, faithful to his wife, frugal, etc. When he becomes rich after several years,
    he may become arrogant, vain, womanise, drink, gamble, etc. - a completely different
    personality. Similarly, a good person in a previous life, when reborn under favourable
    conditions, might become corrupted by his good fortune. Because of this we find it hard to
    see fairness in this world. We see that good people are not the ones who are happy, but
    many evil people are happy. The working of <em>kamma-vipãka</em> is very difficult to see
    unless we have the psychic power to look into the past.</font></p>

    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There is one very important discourse (A.N. 5.43)
    where the Buddha said that there are certain things in the world that everybody wants but
    are very hard to obtain, namely, to be born beautiful, to have happiness, honour, a long
    life, and a good rebirth after death. The Buddha said that these things are not obtainable
    by prayers or vows, or even by thinking a lot about them everyday - for if they were, why
    are beings suffering here? It is useless to only pray and make vows.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Buddha points out to us that if praying and
    making vows alone can bring us the things we want, then why is there suffering in the
    world? We mentioned earlier about the student trying to get ten A's without studying, and
    who instead prays and makes vows, and goes from one deity to another deity. This student,
    of course would never get his ten A's.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So the Buddha said that we have to walk the path
    that brings us to what we want. This means that if you want long life, then you must not
    kill. If you do not kill, then you do not even have to pray because long life will come
    naturally. If you want to be born beautiful, be good natured, not angry. If you want
    happiness, give happiness and you will deserve happiness.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Of course, it's natural for most people to pray
    when they are suffering, and sometimes when we pray, our prayers are answered - mainly
    because we have the supporting <em>kamma</em>. For example, a person might be very, very,
    rich, and he suddenly gets cancer. He then goes all around the world to get the best
    specialist doctors in the world, but if his <em>kamma</em> is not supporting him, even the
    best doctors from America or Europe will not be able to cure him.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Another person might be very poor, and also have
    cancer, but if his <em>kamma</em> is supporting him, he will be cured even though he does
    not have the money to go to a specialist centre. Someone might recommend him some herbs to
    take, or drink his own urine! So the right way to have our wishes fulfilled and have a
    happy life is to perform skilful <em>kamma</em>, avoid unskilful <em>kamma</em>, and
    without having to resort to prayers, all the good effects of the skilful <em>kamma</em>
    will ripen and bring us happiness.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There is another important discourse (S.N. 42.6)
    where a certain headman came to talk to the Buddha. The headman said to the Buddha that
    there is a type of brahmin in the West that have a peculiar tradition. Besides the
    tradition if carrying water, bathing in the water to purify themselves and worshipping
    fire, when their relative passes away, they immediately take the corpse out of the house,
    and hold the corpse high up to the sky. They face the corpse out towards heaven and shout
    the name of the deceased and direct him to go to heaven. They believe that because the
    corpse is facing heaven, the deceased can see heaven, and when they call out to his soul,
    the soul will naturally go up to heaven. Then the headman said that perhaps the Buddha
    (having psychic power) can bring it about that everyone after dying can be reborn in
    heaven. This is an interesting question because even in this modern age some people still
    believe that the Buddha can help us be reborn in heaven.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So, the Buddha replied by asking the headman a
    question first. He said suppose a man came to the edge of a deep lake, and held up a rock
    in both his hands, and threw it into the middle of the lake. Now as the rock was sinking
    into the water, all the people came together and shouted at the rock, and praised the
    rock, and asked the rock to float up to the surface, and float towards the shore. The
    Buddha asked the headman whether the rock would float up. The headman answered that it is
    not possible because the rock is heavy; naturally it would sink in the water. So the
    Buddha said that in the same way, suppose a man has done a lot of evil, he has killed,
    stolen, committed adultery, lied, etc. When he passed away (and his heavy <em>kamma</em>
    was pulling him down), people came together and shouted to him to go to heaven, is it
    possible that he would go there? The headman said that it is not possible because he had
    done so much evil, so like the stone, he would sink into a bad rebirth. Then the Buddha
    said that suppose another man came to the edge of the deep lake. He took a cup of oil and
    threw the cup of oil into the middle of the lake. The cup would sink but the oil, being
    light, would float to the surface. As the oil was floating up to the surface, people came
    and shouted to the oil sink into the water. Is it possible for the oil to sink? The
    headman said that it is not possible because oil is light, it will naturally float up. The
    Buddha then said that in the same way, suppose a person had done a lot of people were to
    come and shout, and curse him to go to hell, is it possible that he'll go to hell? So the
    headman said that it is not possible because he is a good man. Naturally, he will go up to
    heaven (being lifted by his good <em>kamma</em>).</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So by answering these questions, the headman
    understood what the Buddha meant, that is, the Buddha cannot help us. Whether we rise, or
    sink, depends on our<em> kamma</em>. That is why Buddhism is unlike other religions in the
    sense that the Buddha does not say that by becoming a Buddhist, you are guaranteed a place
    in heaven. There is no favouritism. Whether you go to heaven, or elsewhere, depends on
    your <em>kamma</em>. We cannot bribe heaven to open the door for us - this is fair.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In the<em> Mahayana Sixth Patriarch Sutra</em>,
    someone asked the Patriarch whether it is true Pure Land is very near for those of
    superior wisdom but very far for those of inferior roots. He added, &quot;The deluded
    person recites the Buddha's name seeking rebirth there, while the wise person purifies his
    own mind.&quot; From this it is obvious that our mind (or heart) is very important.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In the Buddha's teaching the world is the
    creation of consciousness or mind. A pure mind creates a happy world, and evil mind
    creates a woeful world. So purifying the mind is most important for rebirth into a happy
    world, not chanting or praying or making vows.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This is another important principle of<em> kamma</em>
    we should remember. No one can change the working of the natural law of <em>kamma.</em>
    All beings are subject to the law of <em>kamma</em>-<em>vipãka, </em>even the Buddha. The
    Buddha explained the Truth or Reality of the natural laws of existence to us, but they
    exist all the time, whether we understand them or not.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">K</font><font size="3">amma and </font><font
    size="4">C</font><font size="3">onditions</font></font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The result of <em>kamma</em> is different for
    different people (A.N. 3.99). Besides the factor of intention, it also depends on the
    person who does the <em>kamma</em> and the person the <em>kamma</em> is done to. For
    instance, a small evil deed done by a person who is undeveloped in moral conduct, mind and
    wisdom, i.e. one who constantly does evil <em>kamma,</em> can possibly bring him to hell.
    The same evil deed done by one developed in moral conduct, mind and wisdom, i.e. one who
    constantly does good <em>kamma</em>, is expiated in the very life and not a bit of it is
    seen hereafter.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">To give a simile: suppose you are cooking at the
    back of your house, and a beggar comes to the front of your house to ask for money, and he
    sees nobody. So he walks into the front hall and he finds ten dollars or a hundred dollars
    on the table. He sees nobody around still, and pockets the money, and walks out. Just at
    that time, you come out from the back and see the beggar walking away, and notice the
    money missing from the table. Most likely you would shout, and try to catch the beggar, or
    phone the police to have the beggar arrested. Finally, the beggar ends up in jail.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">However, suppose a very famous man, perhaps a
    well-known politician, pays a visit to your constituency, and seeing no one similarly
    enters your house. As before, you are at the back of the house, and came out just in time
    to see him walking away, and your money missing. Recognising him, most probably you would
    not call the police since a lot of hassle can be expected from this powerful person. And
    he might get away scot-free.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As you can see from this story, although two
    persons do the same <em>kamma</em> - it will support us so that even when we do some evil
    deed, the consequence of the evil deed becomes minimised, just as for the powerful
    politician. On the other hand, those who have done a lot of evil <em>kamma</em> - one poor
    in blessings, just like the poor beggar - will suffer drastically the reverse effect.</font></p>

    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">How do we overcome our past evil <em>kamma</em>?
    To overcome past evil <em>kamma</em>, the Buddha said that we have to do a lot of good
    deeds now. The Buddha gave a beautiful simile of salt and water (A.N. 3.99). During the
    time of the Buddha, there was no fine salt like the kind we have, but they had lumps of
    salt. So the Buddha said that suppose a man took a lump of salt and put it into a cup of
    water, stirred the water, and drank it. The water would definitely taste very salty.
    However, if the person took the same lump of salt, and put it into the river, and stirred
    the river water, and drank it, it would not taste salty because of the large amount of
    water in the river.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said that the water represents good <em>kamma</em>
    and the salt represents evil <em>kamma</em>. So a lot of good <em>kamma</em> dilutes the
    effect of the evil <em>kamma</em>. Therefore, it is very important that we do a lot of
    good to overcome our past evil <em>kamma</em>. What is past, we cannot change; we can only
    take care of the present. To take care of the present, we have to do a lot of good.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">All <em>kamma</em> that we do have the potential
    to ripen. However, not every <em>kamma</em> has to ripen. The Buddha said that if every <em>kamma</em>
    has to ripen, then we cannot get out of <em>samsãra</em> (rounds of rebirth). This is
    because our kammic account is so great due to our uncountable lifetimes of <em>kamma</em>.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A good example is Angulimala, the bandit who
    killed hundreds of people. He lived in the forest, and he was so strong and powerful and
    quick that he killed many people who passed through the forest. He had the habit of
    cutting the thumbs and fingers of the people that he had killed, and made them into a
    garland that he wore around his neck, which was why he was called Angulimala, meaning
    'finger-garland wearer'. The Buddha knew that the king would be asked by the people to get
    an army to kill Angulimala because they were afraid to pass through that hill for many
    people were killed there. Wishing to save Angulimala the Buddha walked up to the kills
    alone to find him.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The bandit Angulimala saw the Buddha and thought
    that it would be easy to kill him. So he came behind the Buddha and ran after him with his
    knife and weapons. He wanted to kill teh Buddha, but although he ran very fast, he found
    that he could not get near the Buddha because the Buddha was using his psychic power. So,
    Angulimala stopped and asked the Buddha to stop. The Buddha turned around and looked at
    Angulimala, and said to him, &quot;I have stopped, Angulimala; you stop too.&quot;
    Angulimala thought to himself, &quot;Why does this man say that I have not stopped, but he
    has stopped?&quot; and he asked the Buddha to explain.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said to him, &quot;I have stopped
    harming all beings, but you have not stopped.&quot; The Buddha then taught him some Dhamma
    and after listening to it, Angulimala was changed completely. Angulimala threw away his
    weapons and asked the Buddha to allow him to become a monk. So the Buddha walked back to
    the monastery, and Angulimala followed him, and so he became a monk.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The king who was asked to kill Angulimala was
    scared although he had the army with him because of Angulimala's reputation as a fierce
    bandit. So the king went to see the Buddha in the forest monastery hoping to get some
    blessings from the Buddha, in order that he would not be killed. The Buddha saw that the
    king was in full armour and surrounded by his army, and so the Buddha asked the king where
    he was going. The king said that he was asked by a lot of people to catch or kill
    Angulimala, and he was on the way to do so.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Buddha asked the king if he was to see
    Angulimala now as a monk, restrained and virtuous, how would he react? The king said he
    would pay homage to him and protect and support him like other monks. The Buddha then
    pointed out Angulimala and said, &quot;Great king, that is Angulimala.&quot; When the king
    turned around and saw Angulimala, his hair stood up and he became terrified. The Buddha
    pacified the king saying, &quot;Do not be afraid, great king, do not be afraid. There is
    nothing for you to fear from him.&quot; The king found it hard to believe, but he did
    because it was the Buddha who said so. Therefore, the king gave his respect and support to
    Angulimala.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Then Angulimala strove very hard and became an <em>arahant</em>.
    Imagine that! He did not have to be reborn in hell for many thousands of years to repay
    his <em>kammic</em> debt! The merit of striving in the holy life and attaining <em>ariyahood</em>
    is so great as to free us from rebirth in the woeful planes. So we can see that of the
    three bases of meritorious action, development of the mind <em>(bhãvanã)</em> surpasses
    moral conduct <em>(sîla)</em> and charity <em>(dãna).</em></font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">K</font><font size="3">amma and </font><font
    size="4">R</font><font size="3">ebirth</font></font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also said that most beings, after passing away,
    will be reborn into woeful planes because of selfishness <br>
    (A.N. 1.19.2). We want to protect our self-interest, we want to protect those whom we
    consider as part of ourselves - our family, people of the same race, people of the same
    religion, people of the same country - so we do a lot of evil deeds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, the Buddha said that most beings after passing
    away will fall into the woeful planes. The hell realms are the worst, a little higher is
    the animal realm, and slightly better than that is the ghost realm. These three planes are
    the woeful planes of rebirth. The realm of human beings is above them. Above us are the
    deva realms, or the heavenly planes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Possibly only two or three out of ten people would be
    reborn as human beings, or go to heaven. Perhaps seven or eight people will go to the
    woeful planes. Therefore, we have to be careful while living our lives. We should take the
    trouble to learn the Dhamma because life is very short. On an average, we only live up to
    seventy, and if you are now forty, that means you have only thirty more new years to
    celebrate. When another year goes by, you have twenty-nine years left, another year goes
    by and there is twenty-eight years more, and so on. Time is very short, so we have to make
    the most use of it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is possible to have the same rebirth as the ones that
    you love so that you can meet them again in the future? There was an old man and an old
    woman who came to see the Buddha. They told the Buddha that from the time they were
    married when they were teenagers, up to the present old age, they had loved each other so
    much that they had never had even a thought of anger towards each other. So they said that
    they would like to meet again in the next life. They asked the Buddha if it is possible.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said that if two persons have these four things
    in common, they can meet again in the future rebirth. Firstly, they must have the same
    faith, i.e. same religious beliefs. Secondly, they must have the same moral conduct. This
    means that their morality is equally good, or equally bad. The third common factor is
    generosity. They must be equally generous or selfish. The fourth one is wisdom, that is,
    they have to be equally wise or foolish. If these four things are the same, then they
    would meet again in a future rebirth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fact that we meet now is also due to <font size="3"><em>kamma-vipãka</em>.
    The Buddha said that it is very hard to find a being that is not related to you in the
    past. We might have been father and child , or mother and child. There are billions of
    people in this world, but the number of people that we actually meet or know is not many,
    therefore, these people are probably mostly people with whom we have affinity from the
    past.</font></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Once a cousin of the Buddha by the name of
    Mahanama came to see the Buddha (S.N. 55.3.1). He told the Buddha that he was thinking
    that suppose a day comes in which he might meet with a violent death. If he were to die a
    violent death, would he be reborn into a woeful plane of existence? The Buddha answered by
    telling him not to worry because for a long time he had practiced in faith, moral conduct,
    learning, generosity and wisdom, and because of that the mind soars aloft.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In other words if one has been practising the
    Dhamma and has lived one's life according to the Dhamma, then one's mind is inclined
    towards the Dhamma. Therefore, when one passes away, one's mind will bring one to a lofty
    rebirth. The Buddha is saying that our everyday mind is important. If you are a
    good-natured person, then that is your everyday mind, that is your natural frequency. So
    when you pass away, you will go to a state where beings are also good natured and
    peaceful. However, if you are a person who is easily agitated, hot-tempered, angry
    everyday, and have a tendency towards violence, then that everyday mind of yours will
    bring you to a rebirth where beings are also hot tempered and have a tendency towards
    violence, for example, the animal realm. Therefore, cultivating a wholesome mind everyday
    is very important. So it is good for us to learn and practise the Dhamma so that our minds
    are inclined toward the lofty (not the base or unwholesome) and that will bring us to a
    good rebirth.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Is it possible to help our relatives who have
    passed away? This was a question posed by a Brahmin to the Buddha (A.N. 10.177). The
    Buddha said it depends on where the relative has been reborn - only if he is reborn as a
    ghost can he be helped. Although the Buddha did not explain why, it would probably be
    because ghosts come back to their human relatives hoping to receive some help. They make
    themselves visible or they contact their relatives in the sleep (dream) state. So in the <em>Theravãda</em>
    tradition, Buddhists usually do charity on behalf of their deceased relative and transfer
    the merit to him. Offerings of food and clothing are usually made since these two items
    are what are probably needed most.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In China there was a very famous monk called Bodhidharma
    who was one of the earliest monks from India who went to China a long time ago. The
    emperor of China heard of him and invited Bodhidharma to the palace. The emperor had done
    a lot of charity, for example, he had built monasteries for monks and nuns, and many
    orphanages, etc. Therefore, the emperor thought that he had a lot of merit. So when he met
    Bodhidharma, he told him that he had done a lot of good deeds, and asked him whether he
    had a lot of merit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bodhidharma, being a virtuous and straightforward person
    bluntly told the emperor that he had no merit. The emperor was very unhappy when he heard
    what Bodhidharma said, so he refused to talk to the monk any further. Bodhidharma then
    left the palace. What Bodhidharma was trying to say is that there is a difference between
    worldly merit and spiritual merit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Worldly merit is what the Chinese call &quot;<em>foo
    ter,&quot;</em> and spiritual merit is <em>&quot;koong ter.&quot;</em> Worldly merit is
    blessings that leads to good rebirth, like practising generosity and moral conduct.
    Spiritual merit is merit that brings you out of <em>samsãra</em>, like studying the
    Dhamma, practising meditation, letting go of attachments, etc. Therefore, we have to
    differentiate worldly merit from spiritual merit. Doing a lot of worldly merit is good
    because it helps and supports us. However, if we want to get out of <em>samsãra</em>,
    then we have to study the Buddha's teachings, meditate and let go of attachements.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">C</font><font size="3">onclusion</font></font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Buddha advised us to contemplate five things
    everyday. Firstly, &quot;I am of the nature to age, I have not gone beyond ageing.&quot;
    The second contemplation is &quot;I am of the nature to sicken, I have not gone beyond
    sickening.&quot; Thirdly, we contemplate &quot;I am of the nature to die, I have not gone
    beyond dying.&quot; The fourth contemplation is &quot;All that is mine, beloved and
    pleasing, will become otherwise, will become separated from me.&quot; Lastly, we
    contemplate that &quot;I am the owner of my <em>kamma</em>, heir to my <em>kamma,</em>
    born of my <em>kamma</em>, related to my <em>kamma,</em> abide supported by my <em>kamma</em>;
    whatever <em>kamma</em> I shall do, for good or for ill, of that I shall be the
    heir.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In the first three contemplations, we contemplate
    that we are growing old, getting sick, and eventually die. In the fourth contemplation, we
    contemplate that those that are beloved and dear to us (including our property), are going
    to charge, and become separated from us. The fifth contemplation is contemplation that <em>kamma</em>
    is supporting us, and that we will inherit the result of<em> kamma</em>. We are the owner
    of our <em>kamma</em>, so we have to be careful about our <em>kamma</em>. Therefore, these
    are good contemplations to make.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Sometimes when we have problems, for example, if
    we become sick, like having cancer, we would go everywhere looking for a miraculous cure.
    When we hear of another place that is powerful in its cure, we would go there too.
    However, when we understand the Dhamma, we would make the effort to look for a cure, but
    we would not be unduly alarmed. Most people become alarmed when their time of death is
    near because they are not prepared for it. Understanding the Dhamma prepares us for death.
    We understand the Dhamma that everything is impermanent; we know that because we are born,
    then we have to die. When we accept that fact, then when death comes, we can accept it
    calmly. If we do not accept it, we will suffer a lot.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Those people who go here and there, looking for a
    cure for their cancer, although they may find a miracle and are cured, how much longer can
    they live? Maybe another five or ten years, but death will come again another day. When
    you see the face of death, you will shake and tremble again. However, when we understand
    the Dhamma, then we are prepared for death when it comes, and we are able to accept it
    calmly because we have prepared ourselves for it, having lived our lives skillfully.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Human life is very important compared to other
    types of lives in other realms because in the human realm we create a lot of<em> kamma</em>.
    This is because we use our thinking mind a lot. The world &quot;man&quot; or &quot;<em>manussa</em>&quot;
    probably comes from &quot;<em>mano</em>&quot; the thinking faculty. When we use our
    thinking to plan and carry out the plans with intention, we are then creating<em> kamma</em>.
    Therefore, as humans create a lot of <em>kamma</em>. Therefore, as humans create a lot of<em>
    kamma</em>, this life is very important because our actions here determine our next few
    rebirths.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, the human realm is the most
    conductive for us to strive to end our suffering and the continued round of rebirths. That
    is why only here can you find Buddhas and <em>Arahats</em> (A.N. 10.63) and the <em>Sangha</em>
    of monks. Hence, it is of paramount important that we avoid unnecessary suffering and
    eventually end all suffering.</font></p>
