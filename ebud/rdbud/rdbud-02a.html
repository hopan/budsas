    <p><b><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Upatissa (Sariputta) and Kolita
    (Moggallana)</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the time of the Buddha, in a village called Upatissa,
    there lived a well-known Brahmin family. The father, Vanganta, and mother, who was named
    Rupasari, had a beautiful baby boy whom they named Upatissa, after the village in which
    they lived. On the very same day, in the village known as Kolita, a Brahmin woman named
    Moggali gave birth to a son whom they named Kolita, after the village in which they lived.
    The two families were well-known to each other and the two boys, Upatissa and Kolita, were
    best friends.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Both families were wealthy and well respected. As was the
    custom at the time, each of the young men had a retinue of 500 companions. Upatissa
    travelled in luxury by palanquin while Kolita travelled by carriage. Both youths led a
    life of pleasure and luxury.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day Upatissa and Kolita, together with their
    companions, decided to attend a festival known as the Hilltop Festival, which included
    dance, music and drama. At first they enjoyed the festivities and joined in the
    merrymaking. However, on the third day, reflecting on the fleeting nature of sense
    pleasures, Upatissa and Kolita decided to give up their wealth and luxuries and take to
    the holy life of ascetics. At about the same time that Upatissa and Kolita gave up sense
    pleasures, Prince Siddhattha married Princess Yasodhara.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On hearing of their renunciation some of their companions
    joined them. Upatissa and Kolita decided to study under the well-known Ascetic Sanjaya.
    Before long they had learned everything that Sanjaya could teach. Realizing that they had
    not found the truth they were seeking, Upatissa and Kolita decided to seek other teachers
    and learn their doctrine in search of the Truth. The friends parted after deciding that
    they would come back and teach the other, if either of them realized the enlightenment
    they were seeking.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Upatissa was still searching for a teacher when he saw a
    monk seeking alms for his noonday meal. The serenity and bearing of the monk impressed
    Upatissa. Thinking that he should not disturb the monk until after his meal, Upatissa
    followed him back to the forest grove where he dwelled. He then asked the monk under whom
    he had studied and if he could teach the doctrine of his master. The monk who impressed
    Upatissa was none other than Assaji, one of the first five disciples of the Buddha. Assaji
    informed Upatissa that he was himself a new disciple of the fully enlightened Buddha. He
    said that he would teach the Master&#146;s doctrine, but that being new to the doctrine he
    would have to be brief.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Upatissa requested that he teach whatever he knew. Assaji
    then said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Of those things that arise from a cause<br>
      The Tathagata (Buddha) has told the cause<br>
      And also what their cessation is.<br>
      This is the Doctrine of the Buddha.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On hearing the first two lines of these four lines the
    spiritually advanced Upatissa attained the first stage of sainthood, Sottapanna. After
    inquiring as to where the Buddha dwelt he then went back to inform Kolita that he had
    found the Master who would show them the path to deliverance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The moment that Kolita saw his friend he knew that
    Upatissa had found the path to deliverance. There was a radiance in his friend that had
    not been there before. Upatissa confirmed that a Fully Enlightened Being had been born on
    earth for the benefit of men and Devas. He then explained about His meeting with Assaji
    and repeated the four lines he had heard. On hearing the four lines Kolita too attained
    Sotapanna. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kolita was now anxious to meet the Master. However,
    Upatissa suggested that they should first go back and inform Sanjaya that a Fully
    Enlightened Being had appeared so that he too could benefit by the Doctrine. The two
    friends went back and informed Sanjaya.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sanjaya, however, did not want to go back to being a
    student. He had a large retinue and was a respected teacher. Blinded by vanity and
    ignorance he disregarded the pleas of his former students. Sanjaya realized the wisdom of
    the Buddha and he acknowledged the supremacy of the Buddha. He asked, &quot;Are there more
    wise men or fools on this earth?&quot; When Upatissa replied that there were more fools
    than the wise Sanjaya said, &quot;Then let the wise go to the Buddha. Let the fools come
    to me.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Upatissa and Kolita left Sanjaya and set off towards
    Rajagaha, where the Buddha was residing in the bamboo grove. About half of Sanjaya&#146;s
    pupils decided that they would join Upatissa and Kolita and follow the Doctrine of the
    Buddha. The text says that Sanjaya was so upset at seeing his retinue dwindle that he was
    stricken with illness and vomited hot blood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Upatissa and Kolita approached the Buddha and requested
    permission to be ordained. The Buddha ordained the two and preached the Dhamma. On hearing
    the Dhamma all of their retinue attained Arahanthship and joined the order. It took Kolita
    a week with further instruction from the Buddha and Upatissa two weeks of concentrated
    effort to realize the Truth. After ordination Upatissa was known as Sariputta and Kolita
    as Moggallana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then appointed Sariputta as His first chief
    disciple and Moggallana as His second chief disciple. The roles of the chief disciples are
    very important. They helped the Buddha with His growing congregation and had three main
    functions to perform as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- To help the Buddha in the consolidation and teaching of
      the Dhamma for the benefit of men and Divine beings. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- To be a role model for the Sangha (monks and nuns).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- To supervise the training and administration of the
      Sangha.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Sariputta and Moggallana were appointed as the chief
    disciples there arose a dispute among the Sangha. Even though the Noble Order was young,
    the Buddha had many Arahanths in His retinue of monks. The five monks who were His first
    pupils &#150; Kondanna, Bhadhiya, Vappa, Mahanama and Assaji, Yasa and his fifty-four
    friends, the three Kassapa brothers, and many others who were senior to Sariputta and
    Moggallana. Why had the Buddha not selected one of them? The Buddha then explained that He
    had not selected His chief disciples. All that He had done was to appoint the persons who
    had many aeons ago aspired to these positions and worked tirelessly, performing
    meritorious deeds, to fulfil their aspiration. The fruits of their labour were being
    fulfilled under His order.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And so we go back 100,000 world cycles and one
    incalculable period in time to the era of the Buddha Anomadassi, the 18th Buddha prior to
    the Gotama Buddha. Sariputta at that time was known as Sarada, and Moggallana as
    Sirivaddhana. Sarada, unsatisfied with his luxurious life of wealth and pleasures, had
    adopted the life of an ascetic. Inspired by the radiance of the Anomadassi Buddha, he had
    prepared a canopy of fragrant flowers which he held above the Buddha to form a fragrant
    arbour. The Anomadassi Buddha, accompanied by His chief disciples, Nisabha and Anoma,
    attained a higher meditative stage, which He retained for a week. Sarada was so inspired
    by the Anomadassi Buddha that he remained thus, holding the fragrant canopy, so as not to
    disturb the Buddha. The Buddha Anomadassi, seeing the merit of Sarada and desiring to
    inspire Sarada to further heights, instructed Nisabha to dispense the Dhamma to Sarada and
    the devotees who were present. So inspiring were the Dhamma and the deportment of the
    chief disciple that Sarada paid homage to the Buddha Anomadassi and aspired to be the
    first chief disciple of a future Buddha. The Buddha Anomadassi looked into the future and
    seeing that his aspiration would be fulfilled, prophesied that 100,000 world cycles and
    one infinite period into the future, Sarada would be the first chief disciple, by the name
    of Sariputta, of the Gotama Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sarada then urged his friend to perform meritorious deeds
    and to aspire to be the second chief disciple of the Gotama Buddha. Inspired by his
    friend, Sirivaddhana built an alms hall, provided meals and robes to the Anomadassi Buddha
    and His retinue of 100,000 monks and aspired to be the second chief disciple of the Gotama
    Buddha. The Anomadassi Buddha, seeing that Sirivaddhana&#146;s aspiration would be
    fulfilled, prophesied that he would be the second chief disciple, named Moggallana, of the
    Gotama Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The knowledge, wisdom and abilities of the Buddha were
    incomparable. There was no one in the Sangha who could take His place or substitute for
    the Teacher. However, the combined qualities of the two chief disciples complemented those
    of the Buddha. Sariputta, who was foremost in wisdom, was steady and focussed his energies
    on leading as many persons as possible to the first stage of sainthood, Sotapanna (also
    known as stream enterer). This was because once they had entered this stage they would
    move forward and reach the other stages within seven more births. There was no longer the
    danger of their falling back or obtaining birth in an unhappy realm. Sariputta felt that
    he should place as many persons as possible in the Path. Moggallana, the more aggressive
    of the two, was foremost in psychic powers. Feeling that even one more rebirth was one too
    many, Moggallana concentrated his efforts on taking the devotees from Sotapanna to
    Arahanthship. The two friends continued to work together as one, each drawing on the
    strengths of the other, for the betterment of men and gods.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha had the deepest respect and regard for His
    chief disciples and used them as an example for His monks. He encouraged His monks to
    associate with and emulate the chief disciples by saying:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Associate, O monks, Sariputta and Moggallana<br>
      and keep company with them.<br>
      They are wise bhikkhus<br>
      and helpers of their fellow monks...&quot;</font></i><b></p>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">6. Sariputta</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta was the first (right) chief disciple of the
    Buddha and foremost in wisdom. His special task was the detailed analysis and
    systematisation of the doctrine. Because of his deep insight of the ultimate Truth he was
    responsible for drawing out the subtle implications of the Dhamma and for explaining the
    meaning of complex teachings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to his wisdom, Sariputta was well-known for
    his patience, compassion, humility and helpfulness to others. Not only did he help the
    community and the monks in the Dhamma, but he also provided material help and comfort.
    When the monks left for their alms round early in the morning Sariputta did not join them.
    Instead, he stayed in the monastery and made sure that everything was in order. If one of
    the novice monks had forgotten to sweep out a room or if any item was disarranged
    Sariputta put it in place and swept the premises. He wanted to ensure that the monastery
    should at all times be in order so that visiting devotees would not have a negative
    impression of the Order.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta&#146;s Caring</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He then visited the sick hall and provided comfort and
    medicine for the monks who were sick. Tending a sick monk named Tissa that everyone had
    rejected, the Buddha had said, &quot;Those that tend the sick tend me (follow my
    teachings).&quot; Sariputta, reminding the monks of this, encouraged the novice monks to
    help with the caring and comforting of the sick. If any of them required medicine that was
    not available on site, he arranged for it to be obtained. It was only after such duties
    were taken care of that Sariputta went on his alms round.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many documented instances of Sariputta&#146;s
    ministering to the sick. His instruction and comfort to Anathapindika are noteworthy.
    Sariputta helped Anathapindika on two occasions. The first was when he was sick and in
    excruciating pain. Sariputta had reminded Anathapindika that he was a Sotapanna and as
    such on the path to enlightenment. He could not fall away from the Dhamma or obtain
    rebirth in one of the unhappy plains. These words relaxed Anathapindika&#146;s mind and
    gave him great happiness. The excruciating pain disappeared. So grateful was Anathapindika
    to Sariputta that he offered him the rich meal that had been prepared by his servants to
    tempt him to eat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second instance was at Anathapindika&#146;s deathbed.
    Anathapindika, who had a lot of confidence in Sariputta and respect for him had requested
    his presence &#145;out of compassion for him&#146;. Sariputta, accompanied by Ananda, had
    come and given an inspiring sermon on non-attachment. Anathapindika was moved to tears by
    the profound discourse, the likes of which he had never heard before. Shortly after,
    Anathapindika died and was reborn in the Tusita heaven as a Deva. That night he came in
    splendour to Jetavana to praise the glory of the chief disciple. Saluting the Buddha, he
    said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sariputta truly is endowed with wisdom<br>
      With virtue and with inner peace,<br>
      Even a monk that has gone beyond <br>
      At best can only equal him.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next morning the Buddha told His monks of His visitor
    and what he had said, without identifying the Deva. Ananda immediately identified
    Anathapindika correctly by saying that the Deva must be Anathapindika, reborn as a Deva,
    as he had great respect for and confidence in Sariputta.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta&#146;s Humility</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta&#146;s humility is also documented in the text.
    When travelling with the Buddha he did not feel that as the first chief disciple his place
    should be next to the Buddha. Instead, he trailed behind, helping the sick and infirm
    monks who usually lagged behind. In fact, because of his immense compassion and caring, on
    one such instance Sariputta was the last to arrive. As all the good accommodation had been
    taken, Sariputta slept in a tent made of robes. When this was brought to the Buddha&#146;s
    attention He said that accommodation should be arranged based on seniority in the order
    and dispensed the Tittira Jataka, where in a previous birth the Buddha and His chief
    disciples had similarly decided that the three of them would pay homage and obeisance to
    the most senior member.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On another occasion a seven-year-old novice monk brought
    to Sariputta&#146;s attention the fact that his inner robe dragged below his outer robe.
    Moving aside, Sariputta adjusted his robe, then saluted the young monk and asked,
    &quot;Now is it correct, teacher?&quot; The Milindapanha documents Sariputta&#146;s
    account of this incident as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one who has gone forth this day, at age seven<br>
      Should teach me, I accept it with lowered head;<br>
      At sight of him I show my zeal and respect:<br>
      May I always set him in the teacher&#146;s place.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta&#146;s respect for his teacher Assaji who first
    taught him the Dhamma is an example that all should follow. Each night before sleeping
    Sariputta would pay obeisance to the Buddha. Then he would look around, prostrate himself
    and worship a direction. Observing this, the monks informed the Buddha that Sariputta had
    taken to worshiping the different directions (north, south, east and west). The Buddha
    corrected their assumption by saying that each night Sariputta looked with his divine eye
    to see in which direction his first teacher, Assaji, was residing. Then, after paying
    obeisance to him, he slept placing his head in that direction, careful to ensure that his
    feet were not in the direction in which Assaji was residing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The honouring of one&#146;s teachers is an integral part
    of the Buddha&#146;s teaching. The Nava Sutta instructs that one should honour one&#146;s
    teacher, especially those who teach the nectar of the Dhamma. The Sutta starts as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;As the Devas pay devout homage to Indra<sup>1</sup>,<br>
      So should one revere the person<br>
      Through whom one has learnt the Dhamma.&quot;</font></i><b></p>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta&#146;s Patience</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta&#146;s patience and forbearance are also
    legendary. A group of men were praising the noble qualities of the elder when a young
    Brahmin challenged them saying that the reason Sariputta had never shown anger was because
    he had never been provoked. To prove that Sariputta, like others, would resort to anger,
    he walked up behind the elder and dealt him a resounding blow. Sariputta said &#145;What
    was that?&#146; and then, without even turning around to find out who had hit him,
    continued walking. The Brahmin was overcome with guilt and shame at his conduct. Falling
    on his knees he begged pardon and told Sariputta how he had hit him to provoke anger.
    Sariputta then forgave the Brahmin. The Brahmin, not satisfied with a verbal pardon, asked
    Sariputta to come to his home for the noonday meal to show that he bore no malice towards
    him. Sariputta accepted the invitation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the meal, as Sariputta was leaving, he saw that a
    mob of angry supporters had gathered with sticks and stones to punish the Brahmin. They
    had witnessed the Brahmin&#146;s treatment of the elder whom they loved and respected.
    Sariputta asked them what the commotion was about. When informed he asked, &#145;Whom did
    the Brahmin strike, you or me?&quot; On being told that it was the Elder whom the Brahmin
    had struck he dispersed the angry crowd by saying, &quot;I have pardoned him. What cause
    is there for anger when I whom he struck feel none.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta&#146;s caring, compassion and humility won him
    many friends. He was the chief disciple of the Buddha, second in wisdom to the Buddha. But
    he was humble, caring and compassionate. He also did not in any way use his position for
    special treatment. In addition to his close friendship with Moggallana, his childhood
    friend, he had a close relationship with Ananda, the Buddha&#146;s personal attendant.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta, who felt that as Chief disciple he should be
    attending to the needs of the Buddha, was deeply grateful for the respect, care and
    attention that Ananda lavished on the Buddha. In turn, Ananda was deeply respectful of the
    chief disciple of the Buddha who helped to administer and train the Buddha&#146;s large
    following. When Ananda gave ordination to novice monks he took them to Sariputta for
    higher ordination. Similarly when Sariputta gave ordination to novice monks he took them
    to Ananda for higher ordination. In this way the two great elders shared a large
    congregation of monks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda also, with the Buddha&#146;s permission, often kept
    choice robes that he received for Sariputta. In the same manner, Sariputta passed on to
    Ananda choice offerings that had been made to him. Once Ananda received a very expensive
    robe from a wealthy Brahmin and, with the Buddha&#146;s permission, kept it for ten days
    for Sariputta&#146;s return. The other monks commented on this deep friendship, saying,
    &quot;We can understand Ananda, who has not as yet attained Arahanthship, feeling such
    deep affection for Sariputta, but how is it that Sariputta, who is free of taints, should
    reciprocate?&quot; The answer, of course, was that Sariputta&#146;s attachment was not a
    worldly attachment but a love and respect for Ananda&#146;s virtues. It is also because
    Arahanths have not eradicated samsaric virtues (vasana gune). It is only the Buddha who
    has eradicated vasana gune.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta must have been a stimulating companian for he
    was sought after by many. What attracted people to him was his deep caring for others, his
    enormous patience and his exemplary behaviour. When Sariputta entered the meditative stage
    on the void, even the Devas came to pay homage to him. The following is Maha
    Kassapa&#146;s praise of the elder:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;These many Devas, powerful and glorious,<br>
      Ten thousand (Devas), from Brahma&#146;s company,<br>
      Stand with joined hands worshipping him,<br>
      Sariputta, wise marshal of the Dhamma, <br>
      The great meditator in concentration.<br>
      &quot;Homage to you, O thoroughbred man,<br>
      Homage to you, O supreme man...&quot;<br>
      -- ( Theragatha 1082-1084)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Despite the fact that he had a large following and was
    well-respected, Sariputta had difficulties convincing his mother, Rupasari, of the Truth,
    as she had been taught from birth the doctrine of the Brahmins. Sariputta had three
    brothers, Cunda, Upasena and Revata, and three sisters, Cala, Upacala and Sisupacala. All
    six took ordination under the Buddha and attained Arahanthship. Cunda was in later years
    Sariputta&#146;s attendant. Despite the fact that Rupasari had such distinguished children
    in the Order, she herself was a non-believer, deeply set in Brahmin rites and rituals. In
    fact, she had not wanted her youngest son, Revata, to be ordained, and had planned a
    marriage for him at a very young age to prevent him from entering the order. However, on
    his wedding day, when Revata viewed the very old grandmother of his bride-to-be, he became
    disillusioned and, realizing the impermanence of all things, ran away from the wedding to
    the monastery to be ordained. His three sisters married, but gave up the household life
    and became nuns. Their children too entered the order.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">None of her children or grandchildren, however, could
    influence Rupasari. When Sariputta visited the city of his birth with a large gathering of
    monks, he came to his mother&#146;s house for alms. His mother, whilst offering them food,
    insulted him in front of all the monks by berating him. She said, &quot;O you, eater of
    others&#146; leavings. When you fail to get food you go from house to house among
    strangers, licking the leavings from the back of their ladles. And so it was for this that
    you gave up eighty crores of wealth. You have ruined me. Now go on and eat.&quot; She then
    went on to berate the monks for having her younger son as an attendant by saying, &quot;So
    you are the men who have made my younger son your page boy&quot;. Sariputta, however, did
    not say a word. He took his food in silence and returned to the monastery. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rahula, who had been among the retinue of monks, related
    this incident to the Buddha. Thereupon the Buddha praised Sariputta in front of the
    assembly of monks by saying:</font></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can all learn from Sariputta&#146;s great patience,
    forbearance and humility. The Buddha has instructed us on the respect we should have for
    our mothers. Sariputta&#146;s exemplary behaviour is one that we should all follow.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta&#146;s Enlightenment</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta attained supreme knowledge whilst listening to a
    discourse that the Buddha was addressing to Dighanakha, Sariputta&#146;s nephew. The
    Buddha was teaching the comprehension of feeling and began by explaining the nature of the
    body. He then asked Dighanakha to contemplate the body so that desire and concern for the
    body should be abandoned. He then went on to explain the impermanence of all feeling and
    the doctrine of dependent arising. Sariputta, who was fanning the Buddha, listened to the
    discourse and describes his attainment of Arahanthship as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The Blessed One, The Buddha, The One with Vision,<br>
      Was teaching the Dhamma to another.<br>
      Whilst the Dhamma was being taught,<br>
      I lent an ear keen on the goal.<br>
      That listening of mine was not in vain,<br>
      For I am released free from cankers.&quot;<br>
      -- (Theragatha 995-996)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha repeatedly praised and reinforced
    Sariputta&#146;s administration and handling of the monks. There is, however, one occasion
    on which the Buddha mildly admonished Sariputta. Sariputta had taught the Brahmin
    Dhananjani at his deathbed and ensured rebirth in a Brahma realm by teaching him about the
    four Brahma Vihara: Metta (loving-kindness), Karuna (compassion), Mudita (sympathetic joy)
    and Upekkha (equanimity). The Buddha questioned him as to why he had not taught Dhananjani
    further and helped him to destroy all cankers and attain Nibbana. Sariputta, unlike the
    Buddha, did not have the ability to know the spiritual capabilities of a person. As
    Dhananjani was a Brahmin he had ensured that his goal, which was birth in the Brahma
    realm, was met. The Buddha explained that as a result Dhananjani would need to obtain
    birth again in the human realm to achieve Arahanthship. This shows that rebirth, even in a
    Brahma realm, is not desirable, as one who has not attained Sotapanna could in a
    subsequent birth perform an unwholesome deed that could lead to rebirth in an unhappy
    realm. The Buddha had seen that Dhananjani would have been capable of attaining
    Arahanthship with some well-directed instruction.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta&#146;s Last Days</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Sariputta&#146;s life was nearing its end he decided
    that it was time to convince his mother of the Truth and place her on the Buddha&#146;s
    Path. Sariputta knew that he had to first open her mind so that she would be receptive to
    the Buddha&#146;s Teaching. He also knew that the only way that could be done was by
    shaking the confidence she had in Maha Brahma. Knowing that the Brahmas, including Maha
    Brahma, had great regard for him, he decided to go to his birthplace to pass away on the
    same bed in which he had been born. But first he had to take leave of the Buddha. With his
    retinue of monks he visited the Buddha and saluted Him respectfully. He then said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Lord of the world, O Great Sage,<br>
      I soon shall be released from life,<br>
      Going and coming shall be no more.<br>
      This is the last time I worship you,<br>
      Short is the life that now remains in me<br>
      But seven days from now I shall lay<br>
      This body down, throwing the burden off.<br>
      Grant it, O Master! Give permission, Lord!<br>
      At last the time has come for my Nibbana<br>
      Now I have relinquished the will to live.</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then asked Sariputta where he would attain
    final Nibbana. Sariputta replied that it would be in the Magadha country, in the village
    named Nalaka (Upatissa). The Buddha then asked Sariputta to dispense the Dhamma to his
    younger and elder brothers, as they would no longer have the opportunity to see a Bhikkhu
    like him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The great elder then gave a discourse in which he
    displayed all his wondrous powers. Rising to the loftiest height of truth descending to
    mundane truth, rising again and again, he expounded the Dhamma directly and with similes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He then worshipped the feet of the Buddha, embraced them
    and said: &quot;So that I may worship at these feet I fulfilled the perfections throughout
    an incalculable period and one hundred thousand world cycles. My heart&#146;s wish has
    found fulfilment. From now on there will be no more contact and feeling. Soon I will enter
    the City of Nibbana the unaging, peaceful, blissful and secure, which has been attained by
    many hundreds of thousands of Buddhas. If any deed or words of mine did not please you, O
    Lord, may the Blessed One forgive me. It is now time for me to go.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then forgave Sariputta by saying, &quot;There
    is nothing either by deed or words that I have to reproach you, Sariputta, for you are
    learned, of great wisdom, of broad and bright wisdom, of quick, keen and penetrative
    wisdom.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Immediately after the Buddha gave permission for Sariputta
    to attain Nibbana the great Earth shook and the skies tore open with a deluge of rain as
    if the very heavens were crying for the passing away of the great elder. The Buddha then
    rose and went to His perfumed chamber. Three times Sariputta circumambulated the chamber
    and paid reverence, and said: &quot;It was one incalculable period and one hundred
    thousand world cycles ago that I prostrated myself at the feet of the Anomadassi Buddha
    and made the aspiration to see you. This aspiration has now been fulfilled and I have seen
    you. At the first meeting it was my first sighting of you. This is my last. There will be
    none in the future.&quot; And with raised hands joined in salutation, he reverenced the
    Buddha and walked backwards until the Blessed One was out of sight.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Blessed One then addressed the Bhikkhus who surrounded
    Him and asked them to accompany Sariputta on his last journey. At His words all four
    assemblies at Jetavana left the Master alone and accompanied the great elder. The citizens
    of Savatthi also joined in with incense and fragrant flowers. A multitude of weeping and
    lamenting devotees followed the elder. Sariputta then addressed the devotees and reminded
    them of the impermanence of all things. &quot;Have I not, he said, taught you of the
    impermanence of all near and dear to us&quot;? He then asked everyone to go back to
    Savatthi, as the Master was alone and should not be left unattended.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Accompanied by a retinue of five hundred monks whom he
    himself had ordained, Sariputta set off for his birthplace. It took them a week to travel
    to Nalaka and on the way he spent one night in each of the different cities, teaching the
    Dhamma with compassion to the devotees for the last time. Upon entering the city of his
    birth he sent a message through his nephew informing his mother that he and his retinue
    would be staying with her for a day, and asking her to prepare his birth chamber and
    residence for his 500 monks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He then walked slowly to his childhood home. Rupasari was
    perplexed at her son&#146;s appearance. &quot;I wonder,&quot; she thought, &quot;if he has
    realized the error of his thinking in leaving all his wealth. Perhaps in his old age he
    has grown wiser and has come back to reclaim his wealth.&quot; She then went about
    preparing for her son and his retinue.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta approached his mother&#146;s house and entered
    the bedchamber where he had been born. But he was now in great pain and very sick with
    dysentery. He lay down to rest whilst his brother, the novice Cunda, attended to his
    needs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The four leading Devas of the Catumaharajika Heaven,
    seeing that the Marshall of the Dhamma was about to pass away, descended in all Their
    radiance to pay obeisance to the Venerable elder. Shortly after, Sakka, the king of the
    Tavatimsa Heaven, illuminated the whole area and descended to earth, and kneeling before
    the elder, paid obeisance to the Venerable One. Finally, Maha Bahama, in His full
    radiance, descended to earth to pay His last respects and catch a last glimpse of the
    elder.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rupasari approached her son and questioned him on his
    visitors. &quot;Who were the four radiant beings&quot;, she asked, &quot;who paid
    obeisance to you?&quot; Sariputta replied, &quot;The four great divine kings,
    upasika.&quot; &quot;Are you then greater than them?&quot; asked his mother. &quot;They
    are like temple attendants&quot;, replied Sariputta. &quot;Ever since our Master took
    rebirth they have been standing guard over Him, swords in hand.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His mother then questioned him on his next visitor who
    surpassed the four kings in radiance. &quot;That&quot;, said Sariputta, &quot;is Sakka,
    the king of the Devas.&quot; &quot;Are you then greater than the king of the Devas,
    dear?&quot; asked his mother. &quot;He is like a novice who carries a Bhikkhu&#146;s
    belongings,&quot; replied Sariputta. &quot;When our Master returns from the Tavatimasa
    Heaven, Sakka takes His bowl and extra robe and descends to earth with Him.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And when Sakka had gone&quot; asked his mother,
    &quot;who was it who descended to your room, filling the room with his radiance?&quot;
    &quot;That,&quot; replied Sariputta, &quot;is your Maha Brahma. The lord and master to
    whom you have been paying obeisance.&quot; &quot;Are you then greater than my lord Maha
    Brahma?&quot; asked his mother.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, Upasika,&quot; replied Sariputta, &quot;on the
    day our master was born it is said that Maha Brahma received the Great Being in a golden
    net.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Upon hearing this the Brahmin woman thought, &quot;How
    great must be the power and goodness of my son&#146;s Master,&quot; and she was suffused
    with happiness, joy and confidence in the Exalted One.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta, seeing that his mother was now ready to receive
    the teachings of the Buddha, explained to her the Dhamma based on the virtues of the
    Buddha. At the end of the discourse his mother attained the first stage of sainthood,
    Sotapanna. Enjoying the bliss of Sotapanna, she then asked him why during all these years
    he had not bestowed the ambrosia of the knowledge of the deathless on her. Sariputta
    realized that his end was imminent. Seeing that his mother was now on the Path to
    Emancipation, and that she would not fall away from the Path, Sariputta requested the
    presence of his retinue of monks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the monks had assembled he asked Cunda to help him to
    a sitting position. And addressing the monks, he said, &quot;For forty-five years I have
    lived and travelled with you. If by deed or word I caused you pain, forgive me,
    brethren.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the monks replied that he had never given any cause
    for displeasure or pain and in turn asked Sariputta for forgiveness for any wrong they may
    have done. Then the elder, pulling his robe around him, lay on his right side and entered
    into the nine successive attainments of meditation in forward and reverse order, then
    passed through the four absorptions, and just as the crest of the sun was rising, at early
    dawn passed away to final Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Next morning when his mother found that he had passed away
    she lamented at the missed opportunity to perform meritorious deeds for her son. And thus
    lamenting and crying at her own former folly spent the morning, for even as a Sotapanna
    she still had not eradicated all attachments. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After a week of ceremonies and homage a funeral pyre was
    built of sandalwood with rich arches of gold to cremate the elder. News of the
    elder&#146;s death spread and people from all over came to pay homage and their last
    respects to the Marshal of the Dhamma. Throughout the night the devotees listened to
    discourses of the Dhamma until finally Venerable Anuruddha extinguished the glowing embers
    with scented water and, using a filter cloth, sifted the relics of the elder.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Cunda, Sariputta&#146;s attendant, informed Ananda
    that Sariputta had passed away and handed him his master&#146;s robe and bowl, Ananda
    became weak and pale with grief over his friend. He addressed the Buddha and said,
    &quot;Lord, the novice Cunda has told me that Sariputta has passed away. Then, Lord, my
    own body became weak as a creeper; everything around me became dim and things were no
    longer clear to me...&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then questioned Ananda as to how this could be,
    as Sariputta had not taken any of Ananda&#146;s knowledge or virtue with him when he
    passed away. The Buddha then reminded Ananda of impermanence and of the fact that He had
    taught him that all near and dear to us would eventually pass away.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta&#146;s Contribution</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta&#146;s enormous contribution as the Marshal of
    the Dhamma can be understood by his description of his attainment of the supreme knowledge
    and the Buddha&#146;s praise of the elder. Sariputta said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It was half a month after my ordination, friends,
      that I realized in all their parts and details,<br>
      the analytical knowledge of meaning, <br>
      the analytical knowledge of the doctrine,<br>
      the analytical knowledge of language,<br>
      the analytical knowledge of perspicacity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">These I expound in many ways, teach them and make them
      known, establish and reveal them, explain and clarify them. If anyone has any doubt or
      uncertainty, he may ask me and I shall explain the matter.&quot;</i> (Anguttara Nikaya)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta, with this fourfold analytical knowledge, not
    only excelled in understanding the Dhamma, but also in teaching it so that others could
    understand. Because of his excellence in the Anupada Sutta, the Buddha declared him to be
    a true spiritual son and His chief assistant in &quot;turning the Wheel of the
    Dhamma&quot;. The Buddha said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If one could ever say rightly of one that he has
      come to mastery and perfection in noble virtue, noble concentration, noble wisdom and
      noble liberation, it is of Sariputta that one could thus rightly declare.</font></p>
      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">If one could ever say rightly of one that he is the
    Blessed One&#146;s true son, born of His speech, born of the Dhamma, formed of the Dhamma,
    heir to the Dhamma (not heir to worldly benefit), it is of Sariputta that one could thus
    rightly declare.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After me, O monks, Sariputta rightly turns the Supreme
    Wheel of the Dhamma even as I have turned it.&quot;</font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many discourses and books attributed to
    Sariputta which form a comprehensive body of the Buddha&#146;s teaching. Sariputta
    understood in a unique way how to organize and present the rich and deep Dhamma in a lucid
    manner that was intellectually stimulating and inspirational. He was also responsible for
    the codification of the Abhidhamma that the Buddha taught in the Tavatimsa heaven to the
    Devas. Each day the Buddha would come back to earth to partake of His alms food and then
    would transmit this knowledge to Sariputta. Thus the giving of the method of the Higher
    Teachings was to the chief disciple who was endowed with the analytical knowledge, who
    then passed it on to the monks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha&#146;s high regard for Sariputta is seen again
    and again. In one instance the Buddha compared Sariputta to a crown prince as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If he is endowed with five qualities, O monks,
      the eldest son of a world monarch righteously turns the wheel of sovereignty that has been
      turned by his father. And the wheel of sovereignty cannot be overturned by any hostile
      human being. What are the five qualities? The eldest son of a world monarch knows what is
      beneficial, knows the law, knows the right measure, knows the right time and knows the
      society (with which he has to deal).</font></p>
      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">Similarly, O monks, is Sariputta endowed with five
    qualities and rightly turns the Supreme Wheel of the Dhamma, even as I have turned it. And
    the Wheel of the Dhamma cannot be overturned by ascetics or priests, by deities or Brahma,
    nor by anyone else in the world. What are those five qualities? Sariputta, O monks, knows
    what is beneficial, knows the Dhamma, knows the right measures, knows the right time and
    knows the assembly (he is to address).&quot;</font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta encouraged those in the Noble Order by his
    wisdom and gentle ways. He said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;Of restrained conduct, full of mindfulness,<br>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta&#146;s great reputation long survived him. His
    great work still remains today, preserved and enshrined in some of the oldest books of
    Buddhism alongside the words of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">7. Moggallana</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moggallana, who was the second (left) chief disciple of
    the Buddha, was instrumental in preserving, cultivating and enriching the Dhamma for
    future generations. He was also foremost in supernormal powers. Before long he came to be
    known as Maha Moggallana or &quot;Moggallana the great&quot;, so as to distinguish him
    from other contemporaries with the same name.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There were many monks who were highly skilled in various
    supernormal powers. But they each mastered only one or two of the powers. Anuruddha and
    the nun Sakula possessed supernormal vision or the divine eye. The monk Sobhita and the
    nun Bhadda Kapilani could recollect many past births. Cula Panthaka was skilled in astral
    travel, while the monk Sagala mastered the element of fire and Pilindi Vaccha excelled in
    communications with divine beings. Maha Moggallana, however, mastered all of these
    supernormal powers in a comprehensive manner and as such surpassed in excellence these
    other monks and nuns. His powers were also stronger than those possessed by the nun
    Uppalavanna, who was foremost among the nuns in supernormal powers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In general we limit our knowledge to that which we can
    experience with the five senses. Since we are limited by the capabilities of our sense
    organs, we tend to perceive our limited experiences as absolute. Therefore, with
    confidence we look into an empty room and say that there is nothing in the room though in
    fact the room is teeming with life forms so small that they cannot be seen with the naked
    eye. Similarly, there are many sounds that we cannot hear and smells we cannot detect. In
    fact, it is proven that the hearing and olfactory senses of a dog are far superior to
    those of a human being. Despite this fact, we restrict our experience and view the truth
    that is perceived as absolute due to the limitations of our sense organs. The universe as
    experienced by the wise is much larger, as they can tap into other sources of energy with
    their developed mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through development of the four ways of power (iddhipada),
    Maha Moggallana was capable of a much wider experience in space and time. His knowledge
    transcended the limitations and boundaries of the normal mind. By developing his mind over
    an infinite period of time, Moggallana achieved supernormal powers that may seem like
    make-believe to modern man. Some of his powers and feats have been carefully documented
    and preserved to help future generations understand the full potential of the mind. There
    were six types of supernormal powers that Maha Moggallana had developed. They have been
    outlined briefly with some examples as documented in the texts.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">(1). Penetration of others&#146; minds and thought
    reading.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moggallana, like the Buddha, had the ability to penetrate
    and read the minds of others and often helped the Buddha by using this trait. One night
    the Buddha sat in silence in front of an assembly of monks, observing each of the monks
    gathered in turn, without uttering a word. When morning dawned the Buddha addressed the
    assembly and said that this assembly was impure, as there was among them a monk who was
    corrupt.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moggallana surveyed the minds of each of the monks
    gathered and saw that one of the monks was corrupt. Approaching him he asked the monk to
    leave. The monk refused. Three times Moggallana requested that the monk leave the
    assembly. Each time the monk refused. Moggallana then led him out of the assembly and
    closed the door. Moggalana then asked the Buddha to recite the rules of monastic
    discipline (Patimokkha) as the assembly was now pure. The Buddha, observing that the
    assembly was pure, addressed the monks with a sermon on the Monastic Discipline.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The text also refers to an incident where Moggallana had
    penetrated the minds of 500 of his disciples and determined that they were all Arahanths.
    The monk Vangisa, who was well-known for his poetic language, had immediately realized
    what had happened and praised Moggallana&#146;s ability to the Buddha as follows:</font><b></p>
    </b><blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;While the sage is seated on the mountain slope,<br>
      Gone beyond to the far shore of suffering,<br>
      His disciples sit in attendance on him,<br>
      Triple knowledge men who have left death behind.<br>
      Moggallana, great in spiritual powers,<br>
      Encompassed their minds with his own<br>
      And searching (he came to see) their minds.<br>
      Fully released, without attachment.&quot;</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">(2). Ability to hear sounds that cannot be heard by
    persons - Divine Ear</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One evening when Sariputta came to visit Moggallana, he
    observed such a serene and calm expression on his friend&#146;s face that he questioned
    Moggallana if he had dwelt in one of the peaceful abodes of mind. Moggallana informed
    Sariputta that this was not the case, that he had been engaged in a deep talk with the
    Exalted One. Sariputta then remarked that the Buddha was living in Savatthi while they
    themselves were many miles away in Rajagaha. He then asked if Moggallana had gone to the
    Buddha or if the Buddha had come to him. Moggallana said that neither had happened. They
    had, by using the divine eye and ear, engaged in a Dhamma talk on the mental faculty of
    energy. Sariputta, observing the supernatural powers of his friend, then proclaimed that
    so powerful were Moggallana&#146;s supernatural powers that if he so wished, like the
    Buddha, he might be able to live through an entire aeon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moggallana also had the ability to hear the voices of
    divine beings and spirits. For example, a spirit had warned him of the impending danger to
    the Buddha by Devadatta, who was plotting to kill him. Moggallana also often visited the
    heavens and lower worlds and asked the beings that dwelt there about the actions that they
    had performed to obtain such birth. He then conveyed this information to his disciples to
    encourage them to perform wholesome deeds and refrain from unwholesome deeds.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">(3). Ability to see things that cannot usually be seen
    by persons - Divine Eye</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moggallana often used his divine eye to perceive the
    whereabouts of the Buddha. He also used it to observe other beings. Once when Sariputta
    was seated deep in meditation Moggallana observed a demon pound his head. He then
    questioned his friend on how he was feeling. Sariputta replied that he had a slight
    headache resulting from the blow. Moggallana then praised his friend on his powers of
    concentration while Sariputta praised his friend on his ability to view the demon which he
    had not seen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One such recorded incident occurred when Moggallana and
    the monk Lakkhana were descending Vulture&#146;s Peak. Moggallana, who had observed a peta
    (unhappy spirit) had smiled. Lakkhana, realizing that Moggallana had viewed something that
    he had not, questioned him. Moggallana agreed to give his answer when they were in the
    presence of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As they approached the Buddha, Lakkhana again questioned
    Moggallana as to why he had smiled. Moggallana replied that he had seen a spirit shaped
    like a huge snake engulfed in flames, screaming whilst being chased and pecked at by
    vultures. Moggallana had felt compassion for the suffering being and then relief in the
    knowledge that he himself would never in the future have such a birth, as this was his
    last birth. This relief had caused him to smile. Moggallana did not think that anyone
    would believe what he saw unless it was confirmed by the Buddha. He then went on to
    explain the kammic cause for such a birth. He said that in a former birth this spirit had
    been a farmer. He had a field, which he was ploughing close to where a Pacceka (silent)
    Buddha was residing. The townsfolk often crossed his field to visit the Pacceka Buddha.
    This upset the farmer and he tried all kinds of methods to dissuade the people from
    crossing his field. The multitude of devotees, however, ignored his instructions and
    continued to walk over his field.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The farmer had then watched for an opportunity to observe
    the Pacceka Buddha leaving his residence, whereupon he had destroyed his belongings and
    burnt his shelter. The devotees were furious when they found out that the farmer had
    destroyed the Pacceka Buddha&#146;s shelter and belongings. They vented their anger on him
    by battering him to death. The farmer was reborn in the Avichi hell and after many
    thousands of years was reborn in Vulture&#146;s Peak as the snake ghost (peta) engulfed in
    flames.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha confirmed Moggallana&#146;s sighting and story
    by saying that He Himself had viewed the same spirit on the day He attained enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Like the Buddha, Moggallana could also view the law of
    kamma in operation. He could see persons with unwholesome deeds being reborn in peta and
    asura realms and those with meritorious deeds being reborn in heavenly realms. The
    Petavatthu documents 51 incidents and the Vimanavatthu 85 incidents that Moggallana had
    observed and used to help teach his disciples the effects of one&#146;s wholesome and
    unwholesome intentional actions. In fact, with this ability, Moggallana drew many
    disciples of other teachers into the Noble Path. This resulted in many jealousies among
    other teachers who lost disciples.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">(4). Ability to travel through space - Astral Travel</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the seventh rainy season the Buddha recited the
    Abhidhamma, the higher teachings, to the Devas in the Tavatimsa Heaven, for three months.
    Using astral travel, Moggallana visited the Buddha from time to time to inform Him of the
    progress of the Noble Order.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On another occasion when Moggallana was seeking the
    Buddha, he saw that the Buddha had visited a Brahma realm to shake the arrogance of a
    Brahma. A certain Brahma was under the false view that as Brahma he was above the Buddha
    and the Noble Order. The Buddha, seeing this and realizing the potential of this Brahma,
    appeared on his throne. Moggallana, seeing and realizing the Buddha&#146;s intention,
    joined Him and thus subdued the pride and arrogance of the Brahma. The subdued Brahma was
    ready to accept the supremacy of the Buddha and His Teachings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moggallana also used his ability of astral travel to help
    Sariputta when he was sick. The doctor had recommended a medicine made of lotus stalks,
    which were only available in the Himalayan mountains. Moggallana immediately travelled to
    the mountains and obtained the medicine required to cure his friend. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was also Moggallana who brought the Ananda Bhodi to
    Savatthi from Buddha Gaya. Ananda asked the Buddha what could be done to help the many
    disappointed devotees who travelled to Savatthi to see the Buddha, only to find that He
    was away attending to another in distress. The Buddha asked for a sapling from the great
    Bodhi tree under which He had attained enlightenment to be planted in Savatthi. He then
    proclaimed that the Bodhi Tree would be a symbol of the Buddha that devotees could
    venerate in His absence. Moggallana, using his supernormal powers, travelled to Buddha
    Gaya and brought the sapling.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">(5). Mastery of matter- Supernormal Locomotion</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The text indicates many instances where, at the request of
    the Buddha, Moggallana used his supernormal powers to shake people out of their inaction
    and non diligence in the Dhamma. On one occasion the monks residing in the mansion of
    Migara&#146;s mother were negligent and slothful. The Buddha instructed Moggallana to
    instil confidence in them by performing a miracle. Moggallana shook the mansion by pushing
    it with his big toe. The monks, seeing the supernormal feat and recognizing the powers of
    Moggallana, went back to diligent practice and attained higher levels of spiritual
    development.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In another instance Moggallana observed that the King of
    the Heavens, Sakka, was being negligent and embroiled in sense pleasures. Travelling to
    Sakka&#146;s heavenly abode, Moggallana used his big toe to shake Sakka&#146;s mansion and
    thus reminded him of his mortality and the impermanence of all phenomenon. Sakka then went
    back to a more righteous way of life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once the Buddha and His retinue were going through great
    hardship as the rains were delayed and famine had set in. Moggallana offered to turn the
    earth so that the rich soil underneath would be brought up and crops harvested. The Buddha
    declined Moggallana&#146;s offer saying that many innocent creatures would be killed if
    such an act was performed as there were many small creatures that lived in the soil.
    Moggallana then offered to build a road by using his supernormal powers, between the city
    in which they were residing and another which was lush with vegetation. The Buddha again
    declined, saying that they would instead weather out this famine, which would soon be
    over. These are the only documented instances where the Buddha declined a request made by
    Moggallana. In general, the Buddha, who had great confidence and respect for Moggallana,
    supported his decisions and requests.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">(6). Transformation of form</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most famous and spectacular of Moggallana&#146;s
    powers was his ability to transform himself into other beings. The power struggle and
    ultimate defeat of the King Cobra NandopAnanda are well-known. The Visuddhimagga describes
    this battle as follows. On one occasion the Buddha, with a retinue of 500 Arahanths,
    visited the Tavatimsa Heaven. In so doing they passed above and disturbed the divine royal
    snake, NandopAnanda. In anger he surrounded Mount Sineru with his massive coils and spread
    his huge hood so that the world below was enveloped in darkness. Several of the monks
    offered to subdue the enraged snake but the Buddha, realizing the powers of the divine
    serpent, chose Moggallana for the task. Moggallana then transformed himself into a huge
    snake and engaged NandopAnanda in a terrible battle. Drawing upon one power after another,
    appearing in various shapes, he overcame his opponent. In the last phase of the battle he
    assumed the form of Supanna, a celestial eagle, arch-enemy of the snake. At this point
    NandopAnanda retreated in defeat and Moggallana, resuming his form as a monk, brought the
    subdued NandopAnanda to the Buddha for an apology.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Jataka there are many references to
    Moggallana&#146;s past births. In many birth stories the Bodhisatta, Moggallana and
    Sariputta had been together as brothers, friends, ministers or disciples . There are also
    recorded instances of other past associations. The Jataka also brings to light the strong
    bond between Moggallana and Sariputta. For in many instances they were associated and
    close friends. In general, however, Sariputta was of a higher station than Moggallana
    though this is more apparent when they were both in animal births. In all, more than 30
    instances of their past associations are recorded in the Jataka.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Moggallana&#146;s Enlightenment</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moggallana has left a legacy of his experiences in
    sixty-three verses, which are recorded in the Theragatha. The following emphasize his
    inwardly-directed efforts, his powers of meditation, his happiness at his friends&#146;
    emancipation, His experience of the truth of no soul and of the supernormal, and his final
    deliverance.</font></p>

    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Moggallana&#146;s Last Days</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even though Moggallana had supernormal powers and was an
    Arahanth he did not, unlike his friend Sariputta, have a peaceful death. Moggallana&#146;s
    ability to see into other realms and explain the operation of the law of kamma, together
    with his extraordinary teaching skills, made him very popular. Many disciples of other
    teachers were placed in the Buddha&#146;s Noble Path by Moggallana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ascetics of other sects, seeing their numbers dwindle,
    decided to kill Moggallana. Unwilling to perform the evil deed themselves for fear of
    exposure, they hired assassins to kill Moggallana. Moggallana was meditating in his hut in
    Black Rock on Mount Isigili on the outskirts of Rajagaha when they made the first attempt.
    Moggallana used his supernormal powers to escape unseen. The second time too the assassins
    found an empty hut. On the third attempt Moggallana&#146;s supernormal powers momentarily
    deserted him. The assassins battered and crushed his bones and left him for dead. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moggallana, however, was the second chief disciple of the
    Buddha. He was not going to pass away without first paying homage to the Buddha and
    obtaining permission for his Parinibbana. Gathering his battered body with supreme effort,
    using astral travel, Moggallana went to where the Buddha was residing and asked permission
    to die. Then, as was the custom for the chief disciple, he dispensed the Dhamma to those
    in attendance, performed many miracles to give confidence to the multitude gathered, and
    passed away to Parinibbana. Moggallana passed away two weeks after his friend Sariputta,
    in the month of Kattika (October/November).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The monks and disciples were outraged at the untimely
    death of their beloved teacher. The king ordered an investigation into the murder and
    caught the assassins, who informed him that they had been hired by Niganthanatha ascetics.
    The king then had the ascetics tortured and killed, in keeping with the laws at that time
    for murderers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The devotees also asked the Buddha why Maha Moggallana had
    come to such a painful death. The Buddha explained the law of kamma that even an Arahanth
    could not avoid, and spoke of a grave crime that Moggallana had performed in a previous
    birth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the instigation of his wife, Moggallana had murdered
    both his parents, who were blind, by pounding them to death. His aged parents, who thought
    that they were being attacked by a band of robbers, implored their son, whom they loved,
    to save himself. Little did they know that it was their own son, who, in the guise of
    robbers, had committed this evil act. Moggallana suffered in hell for many thousands of
    years and had to die a violent death even as an Arahanth, for killing one&#146;s parents
    is a grave (garuka) crime, the effects of which are not easily extinguished. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moggallana&#146;s ability to teach and his supernormal
    powers assisted him in his role of training the Sangha and the multitude. It was also
    Moggallana who, together with his friend Sariputta, brought the errant monks back to the
    Buddha when Devadatta caused a schism in the Sangha. He also assisted in the consolidation
    of the Dhamma and the administration of the Sangha.</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">8. Ananda</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda was one of Prince Siddhattha&#146;s cousins. His
    father was Amitodana, a younger brother of King Suddhodana. As his birth brought a lot of
    happiness to his family he was named Ananda. He was born on the same day as Prince
    Siddhattha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda was ordained as a monk in the second year of the
    Buddha&#146;s ministry, when he was thirty-seven years old. Shortly after, hearing a
    sermon by the Ven. Punna Mantaniputta, he attained the first stage of sainthood,
    Sotapanna. When the Buddha was fifty-five years old, Ananda became His personal attendant.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha addressed the assembled monks and informed them
    that He had many attendants who had assisted him periodically but none of them had been
    able to fulfil their duties perfectly. &quot;It is time&quot; he said, &quot;to have a
    reliable, trustworthy attendant.&quot; He then asked if any of the assembled monks would
    like to be His personal attendant. All the noble ones gathered immediately responded to
    His request by offering their services. Ananda, however, who dearly wished to be His
    attendant, modestly held back, thinking, &quot;The Buddha would surely appoint me if I
    were the most suitable person.&quot; The Buddha, with His divine eye, observed that many
    eons ago Ananda had aspired to be a personal attendant of a Buddha, the fulfilment of
    which was to occur during His reign. Refusing the offers of the other monks, He turned to
    Ananda and offered the post to him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda agreed to accept the post if the Buddha would agree
    to eight conditions. Four of them related to the non-acceptance of gifts and favours from
    the Buddha. Ananda wanted to ensure that there would be no doubts cast that he had
    accepted this position in order to obtain material gain. The other four related to the
    performance of his duties while being mindful of his own advancement in the Noble Path.
    The Buddha agreed to Ananda&#146;s requests.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fact that Ananda felt comfortable in asking the
    Buddha, whom he loved and respected and to whom he was loyal, for a conditional
    acceptance, illustrates the relationship between the Buddha and His monks and the manner
    in which the Buddha ran His ministry. The Buddha was the undisputed leader. But there was
    no fear under His reign. Monks felt free to voice their opinion and to question the Buddha
    at will.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In truth, the term personal attendant does not convey all
    the duties and responsibilities carried out by Ananda. In addition to taking care of all
    the Buddha&#146;s personal needs Ananda was an executive assistant to the Buddha and
    helped in the management of His large retinue of monks, nuns and devotees. He also had the
    unique advantage of hearing most of the Buddha&#146;s discourses and because of his
    unusually retentive memory, was declared the Guardian of the Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To attain the position of personal attendant of a Buddha,
    one needs to aspire to the position and perform many meritorious deeds over a period of
    100,000 world cycles. Ananda made this aspiration 100,000 world cycles ago, at the time of
    the Buddha Padumuttara. At that time he was born as Sumana, the younger half-brother of
    the Bodhisatta Gotama (known at that time by the name Jatila). He provided the requisites
    during the three months of the rainy season to the Padumuttara Buddha and His retinue of
    100,000 monks. He then aspired to be the personal attendant of a future Buddha. The Buddha
    Padumuttara looked into the future and saw that this aspiration would be fulfilled. He
    informed Ananda that in 100,000 world cycles he would be the personal attendant of the
    Buddha Gotama. From this time onwards Ananda continued to perform meritorious deeds to
    fulfil his aspiration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to being the Guardian of the Dhamma, Ananda
    was well-known for two other important events that he initiated. They were the planting of
    the Ananda Bodhi and the founding of the order of the nuns.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many persons came to Jetavana to pay homage to the Buddha
    and to learn His teachings. Sometimes when they came, the Buddha was away helping a person
    in distress. As many had travelled long distances to see Him and were disappointed, Ananda
    asked the Buddha what could be done to help these disappointed devotees. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then asked Ananda to bring a sapling from the
    Bodhi Tree in Buddha Gaya and plant it in Jetavana. He then said: &quot;In my absence, let
    my devotees pay homage to the great Bodhi Tree that gave me protection during
    enlightenment. Let the Bodhi Tree be a symbol of my presence. Those who honour the Bodhi
    Tree would in essence be honouring and paying homage to me.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ever since that time, Buddhists from all over the world
    have venerated the Bodhi Tree as they would the Buddha, with scented water, flowers and
    incense. Many uninformed persons have misunderstood this symbolic action by saying that
    Buddhists worship trees. The Buddha statue, the Bodhi Tree, the relics of the Buddha, are
    but symbols of the Buddha that people use to focus the mind on the compassionate and
    serene qualities of the Buddha. The veneration of the Buddha provides the tranquillity and
    peace of mind that many people cannot readily acquire to meditate, study, and listen to
    His teachings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was at Ananda&#146;s request, on behalf of Maha
    Pajapati, that the Buddha instituted the order of the nuns. The Buddha had initially
    refused Maha Pajapati Gotami&#146;s request to be ordained. It was after Ananda&#146;s
    question as to whether women were incapable of reaching spiritual heights and the
    Buddha&#146;s reply that women were as capable as men of reaching spiritual heights, that
    the Buddha had agreed to the formation of the order of the nuns. As such, women had a
    special regard and respect for Ananda. This, together with his pleasing nature, made
    Ananda very popular. It is said that there were none who spoke ill of Ananda or were
    envious of him despite his honoured position and proximity to the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The documented past life stories of Ananda reflect that he
    was seldom a god (unlike his stepbrother Anuruddha) and seldom an animal (unlike his
    cousin Devadatta). Ananda was often a human and in many births was the brother of the
    Bodhisatta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even though Ananda was very learned and knowledgeable, he
    only reached the first stage of sainthood, Sotapanna, during the lifetime of the Buddha.
    His deep attachment to the Buddha prevented him from attaining Arahanthship. As a result,
    he was not aware of the exact moment when the Buddha passed away. Thinking that the Buddha
    had attained Parinibbana, he informed his stepbrother Anuruddha. Anuruddha, who was an
    Arahanth, observing with his divine eye that this was not the case, clarified to Ananda
    that the Blessed One had not yet passed away. He had reached a meditative stage known as
    Cessation of Perception and Feeling.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Shortly after the Buddha&#146;s Parinibbana, on the day of
    the First Council of the Dhamma, (Sangayana) Ananda attained Arahanthship. Ananda was
    designated by the Buddha as the leader in five categories. They were:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Erudition<br>
      Retentive memory<br>
      Good behaviour<br>
      Steadfastness<br>
      Ministering of care</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thirty of Ananda&#146;s verses have been preserved in the
    Theragatha. The following illustrate his encouragement to associate with good friends and
    those well-versed in the Dhamma.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;A clever man should not make friends<br>
      With a malicious man, or an angry man, or an envious man,<br>
      One delighting in (others&#146;) misfortune;<br>
      Contact with a bad man is evil.<br>
      A clever man should make friends <br>
      With a man of faith, a pleasant man, <br>
      With wisdom and great learning;<br>
      Contact with a good man is fortunate.<br>
      See the painted puppet<br>
      A heap of sores, a compounded body, diseased,<br>
      With many bad intentions,<br>
      For which there is no permanent stability.<br>
      Desiring understanding of the doctrine,<br>
      One should associate with that disciple of the Buddha,<br>
      Who has great learning, is expert in the doctrine,<br>
      Possesses wisdom, is of such a kind.<br>
      -- (Theragatha 1018-1020, 1030)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda declared the following verses to inspire others to
    follow his example as the Guardian of the Dhamma. He also encouraged others to carefully
    examine and understand the teachings prior to their practice.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;82,000 teachings from the Buddha<br>
      I have received,<br>
      2,000 more from his disciples;<br>
      Now 84,000 are familiar to me.<br>
      Who nothing has heard and nothing understood (those void of Dhamma)<br>
      He ages only oxen-like<br>
      His stomach (body) only, grows and grows<br>
      But his insight deepens not.<br>
      Thou follow him who has heard much<br>
      Then what is heard shall not decline.<br>
      This is the tap-root of the holy life;<br>

      Keen in his patient application<br>
      He strives to weigh the meaning well.<br>
      At the right time he makes the effort<br>
      And inwardly collects his mind.&quot;</i><br>
      <i>-- (Theragatha 1024,1025,1027-1029)</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda passed away at the age of one hundred and twenty.
    The Dhammapada states that as people on both sides of the River Rohini wanted his relics,
    Ananda preached the Dhamma to the people while seated in the air in the middle of the
    river and wished that his body would split in two with one part falling on one bank of the
    river and the other part on the other bank of the river. He then entered the ecstatic
    meditation on fire. Flames instantly issued from his body and, as willed, one portion of
    his relics fell on one side of the river while the other portion fell on the other side.
    The people then enshrined his relics in stupas so that they could honour him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda&#146;s greatest contribution to the Dhamma occurred
    three months after the Parinibbana of the Lord Buddha. The Buddha had declared Ananda as
    the guardian of the Dhamma because of his retentive memory. At the First Sangha Council,
    Ananda, under the direction of Maha Kassapa, led the five hundred Arahanths in the
    recitation of the Teachings and helped in the codification of the Dhamma. This method of
    preservation of the Dhamma was used again in later years. The second Sangha Council was
    led by one of Ananda&#146;s pupils.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">9. Maha Kassapa</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the district of Magadha, in a village known as
    Mahatittha, there lived a wealthy Brahmin couple named Kapila and Sumanadevi. They had a
    son whom they named Pipphali Kassapa. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As was the custom at that time, when he came of age his
    parents looked for a suitable girl for him to marry. Pipphali, however, was not interested
    in marriage and informed his parents that he would look after them until they passed away
    and then take to the life of an ascetic. His parents were not happy with this decision and
    insisted that he should select a suitable girl. To appease his parents, Kassapa had his
    goldsmith make a beautiful statue of a girl out of solid gold and said that he would marry
    if they could find a girl who resembled the statue.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kapila then summoned eight Brahmins, and after giving them
    a large sum of money and the statue, asked them to roam the country in search of a bride
    who resembled the golden statue, for his son.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Brahmins were in a village named Sagala when they saw
    an exquisitely beautiful girl named Bhadda Kapilani who resembled the statue. They spoke
    to her parents and found that they were agreeable to the marriage. They then went back and
    reported to Kapila and Sumanadevi that a suitable bride had been found.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Kassapa heard about his oncoming marriage to Bhadda,
    he decided to write to her. Explaining that he was interested in becoming an ascetic he
    asked her to refuse this proposal and look for a suitable match elsewhere. Unknown to him,
    Bhadda too had no desire to marry and had chosen instead the life of an ascetic. She too
    had sent a similar letter to Kassapa requesting that he look elsewhere for a bride. The
    letters, however, were intercepted by both sets of parents who were aware of their
    children&#146;s feelings, and loving letters agreeing to the marriage were substituted.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A large wedding was arranged, and with great ceremony
    Bhadda was given in marriage to Kassapa. Neither one of them, however, was interested in
    married life. The influence of their past meritorious actions and lives as ascetics was so
    strong that they both decided to live a celibate life. They lived in harmony as good
    friends, looking after Kassapa&#146;s old parents until they passed away as was the
    custom, and inherited the family wealth and estates.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Maha Kassapa&#146;s Renunciation</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day when Kassapa was supervising the ploughing of the
    field in preparation for the growing season, he was shaken by a common sight that had gone
    unnoticed by him in the past. The ploughing had resulted in many worms and little
    creatures being unearthed and a host of birds, attracted by the worms, were circling his
    field and feasting.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Observing the destruction of many innocent creatures,
    Kassapa questioned his workers as to who was responsible for their suffering and death.
    His workers then informed him that he was responsible, as they were ploughing the field on
    his account. This statement had a profound effect on Kassapa. He decided that he would
    hand over the family wealth to Bhadda and take the life of an ascetic in search of
    deliverance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unknown to him, at about the same time Bhadda had made a
    similar decision. Her servants had put out some sesame seeds to dry in the sun. Little
    creatures had flocked around the sesame seeds and raucous birds had gathered to feast on
    the tiny creatures. Bhadda had seen the suffering of the little creatures and asked her
    servants who was responsible for their suffering and death. She too had been told that she
    was responsible, as it was on her instruction and for her consumption that the sesame
    seeds had been spread out in the sun.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Reflecting on the suffering, Bhadda decided to hand over
    all the family wealth to Kassapa and take to the life of an ascetic. So it was that in the
    evening both Kassapa and Bhadda discussed their decision to find that they were both of
    one mind. Talking it over they both decided to take to the holy life and seek deliverance
    from suffering. Shaving each others&#146; heads they donned the simple robes of ascetics
    and left their home. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When their servants and the villagers heard about their
    renunciation they cried and lamented and tried to dissuade the couple. Kassapa and Bhadda,
    however, had made up their minds. Distributing their wealth among the servants, they
    continued on their way. And thus they wandered, Kassapa in front with Bhadda following a
    few yards behind, in search of a teacher.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After some time, Kassapa reflected that it was not
    appropriate that his very beautiful former wife should follow him. People, he reflected,
    would assume that he was associated with Bhadda and would start rumours and make
    accusations. As they were both pure and innocent of any wrongdoing, the wrongful thoughts
    of the people would then cause them much suffering. Discussing his thoughts with Bhadda,
    he requested that she not follow him any longer. Bhadda, who agreed with his decision,
    separated from him at the next junction. Whilst Kassapa took the road to his right, she
    took the road to her left.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The text indicates that the earth trembled at this
    renunciation due to the purity and merit of the ascetics. The Buddha, observing the
    trembling of the earth, saw with his super-normal vision that one of his future great
    disciples was on his way to meet Him. He decided to meet Kassapa and walked down the road
    towards Mahatittha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the road between Nalanda and Rajagaha the Buddha sat
    down under a fig tree to await His future disciple. The moment Kassapa laid eyes on the
    Buddha he knew that he had found his Master. The Buddha stood in all His radiance,
    surrounded by an aura. Falling at the Buddha&#146;s feet and saluting Him respectfully,
    Kassapa asked permission to enter the Noble Order.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then dispensed a discourse in which He
    instructed Kassapa on three accounts. He instructed Kassapa in order that he may:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">Train himself so as to have a keen sense of shame for
      doing unwholesome deeds towards seniors, novices and those of middle status in the Noble
      Order.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Listen, examine, reflect and absorb the teachings that are
      conducive to wholesome deeds.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Be mindful of the body and its thoughts and actions.</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After this discourse the Master and His new disciple
    walked back to Rajagaha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the way the Buddha wanted to rest under the root of a
    tree. Kassapa then took his outer robe, folded it four-fold and asked the Buddha to sit on
    it, as His doing so would bring great benefit to him for a long time. The Buddha accepted
    Kassapa&#146;s robe and commented on its softness. Hearing this, Kassapa immediately
    offered his robe to the Buddha by saying, &quot;May the Blessed One, out of compassion for
    me, accept this robe.&quot; The Buddha then asked Kassapa if he would wear the worn-out,
    coarse rag-robe that He was wearing. Full of joy, Kassapa accepted the Buddha&#146;s
    rag-robe and agreed to wear it. Kassapa was the only monk with whom the Buddha had
    exchanged robes. Though the significance of this exchange was not described in the text,
    it may have reminded Kassapa of an ancient aspiration to be foremost among the monks in
    austere practices, because he took upon himself the thirteen austere practices.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Maha Kassapa&#146;s Aspiration</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One hundred thousand world cycles ago, at the time of the
    Padumuttara Buddha, Kassapa was born as a wealthy landowner named Vedeha, and at that time
    too, Bhadda had been his wife. The Padumuttara Buddha was residing at the Khema Deer Park
    near the city of Hamsavati. Vedeha observed the Padumuttara Buddha appointing a monk by
    the name of Mahanisabha as the disciple foremost in austere ascetic practices and His
    third most pre-eminent disciple. Inspired by the Padumuttara Buddha, Vedeha invited the
    Buddha and His retinue to his home for their meals on the following day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha and His monks were eating Vedeha noticed
    that the monk Mahanisabha was walking the streets on the alms round. Vedeha invited the
    elder to partake of his alms at his home. When Mahanisabha refused, he took the
    elder&#146;s bowl and filled it with fragrant food and handed it back to him. He then
    questioned the Buddha as to why Mahanisabha had not accepted his invitation to come to his
    home for meals. The Padumuttara Buddha then explained that many world cycles ago
    Mahanisabha had aspired to be foremost in austere practices, and that in keeping with his
    aspiration he only accepted food obtained by going on the alms round.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vedeha was suffused with happiness and inspired by
    Mahanisabha. He decided that he too would like to be declared as a monk foremost in
    austere practices and the disciple of a future Buddha. Offering the Buddha Padumuttara and
    His retinue of monks meals and the requirements for seven days, he prostrated himself in
    front of the Padumuttara Buddha and aspired to be the monk foremost in austere practices
    as the disciple of a future Buddha. Seeing that Vedeha would fulfil this aspiration, the
    Buddha Padumuttara declared that at the time of the Gotama Buddha, Vedeha would be known
    as Maha Kassapa, and would be declared the third most pre-eminent monk and foremost is
    austere practices. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The relationship between the Gotama Buddha and Kassapa
    started many lifetimes ago. The Jataka stories document nineteen births in which Kassapa
    was related to the Bodhisatta, sometimes as his father, sometimes as his brother, and
    often as his teacher or friend. As such the immediate bond that formed when Kassapa saw
    the Buddha had deep roots. Kassapa also renewed his aspiration in the presence of
    succeeding Buddhas and performed many meritorious deeds over countless years. As foretold,
    Kassapa fulfilled his aspiration at the time of the Gotama Buddha. The Buddha appointed
    Kassapa foremost among the monks who persevered in austere practices.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha repeatedly praised Kassapa&#146;s commitment to
    austere practices and his detached behaviour. He said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When Kassapa goes among families his mind is not
      attached, not caught up, not fettered. He thinks,&quot;Let those who want gain acquire
      gain! Let those who want merit do merit!&quot; He is pleased and glad at the gains of
      others, just as he is pleased and glad at his own gains. Such a monk is fit to go among
      families.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When he preaches the Doctrine, he will not do so for
      the sake of personal recognition and praise but for letting them know the teaching of the
      exalted one so that those who hear it may accept it and practise accordingly. He will
      preach it because of the excellence of the Teaching and out of compassion and
      sympathy.&quot; -- (Samyutta Nikaya )</font></p>
      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Maha Kassapa&#146;s Practice of Austerities</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Two interesting encounters with the Devas further
    illustrate Kassapa&#146;s commitment to austere practices. The first is his reaction to
    the female Deva Laja&#146;s ministering. Laja could remember that she owed her present
    splendour to an offering she had made to the great elder. Laja, who had been a poor woman,
    had offered parched rice to the elder with great devotion. On her way back home she had
    been bitten by a poisonous snake and had died. As a result of her offering she had been
    reborn in the Tavatimsa Heaven in great splendour. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The grateful Laja decided to sweep the elder&#146;s cell
    and fill his vessels with water. On the third day he saw the Deva in all her radiance
    cleaning his cell. Kassapa questioned her as to what she was doing and on being told,
    asked her not to minister to his needs in the future as he was bent on austere practices.
    The dejected Laja left in great sadness. The Buddha, seeing the dejected Laja, came before
    her in compassion and explained to her the meritorious effects of her ministering. He then
    consoled her by informing her of the aspiration the elder had made. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second instance was when Kassapa was residing in the
    Pipphali Cave. He had attained a meditative stage and remained thus for seven days. The
    elder had then set out to obtain alms for Rajagaha. Inspired by the great elder, the Devas
    had descended to Earth with heavenly food. Kassapa, however, had refused the nectar of the
    Devas saying that he preferred to give this opportunity to the poor so that they could
    acquire merit. The disappointed Devas returned to the heavens and told Sakka, the King of
    the Heavens, about Kassapa&#146;s refusal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Sakka heard about Kassapa&#146;s refusal there arose
    in him a great desire to wait upon the great elder. Disguising himself as a poor weaver he
    offered Kassapa rice. When the elder accepted the food there arose a heavenly fragrance
    and Kassapa was instantly aware that he had been tricked by the Deva. He then admonished
    Sakka for taking the opportunity to acquire merit away from the poor. Sakka then asked
    Kassapa if he had failed to acquire merit from this deed due to his trickery. After
    informing Sakka that he had acquired merit despite his trick, Kassapa continued on his
    alms round.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also informed Kassapa of the virtues of ascetic
    life and of the benefit of practising austerities in gaining emancipation. This not only
    encouraged Kassapa to continue in his austere practices but also encouraged him to pass
    them on to others by being a role model. The Buddha said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot; Formerly, Kassapa, there were elders of the
      Order who were forest dwellers, living on alms food, wearing rag-robes, using only the
      threefold set of robes, having few wants and being contented living secluded and aloof
      from society, energetic, and they praised and encouraged such a way of life. When such
      elders or younger Bhikkhus visited the monastery, they were gladly welcomed and honoured
      as being dedicated to the practice of the Dhamma. Then those who welcomed and honoured
      those noble monks would also strive to emulate them in their way of life and this would be
      of great benefit to them for a long time.&quot;</em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;But nowadays, Kassapa, those who are honoured
      when visiting a monastery are not monks of austere and earnest life, but those who are
      well-known and popular and are amply provided with the requisites of a monk. These are
      made welcome and honoured, and their hosts try to emulate them, which will bring them harm
      for a long time. Hence one will be right in saying that such monks are harmed and
      overpowered by what does harm to a monk&#146;s life.&quot; --(Samyutta Nikaya)</em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kassapa, who had made the aspiration to be the monk
    foremost in austerities at the time of the Padumuttara Buddha, took these words to heart.
    In fact, on one occasion he admonished Ananda who had taken 200 novice monks to the homes
    of disciples before they were advanced in the Dhamma. Attracted to worldly pleasures, the
    novices had given up the order and gone back to the family life. Kassapa admonished Ananda
    for not taking care of his pupils. The wealthy often invited the Buddha and His retinue
    for meals. Kassapa, by going on the alms round and refusing such invitations, ensured that
    the opportunity of this meritorious act of giving alms was available to the poor. He
    stopped at every house on the path and accepted every gift with equal grace.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kassapa&#146;s austere life and detachment are explained
    by him in his verses:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Down from my mountain lodge I came one day<br>
      And made my round for alms about the street<br>
      A leper there I saw eating his meal<br>
      And courteously I halted at his side.<br>
      He with his hand all leprous and diseased<br>
      Put in my bowl a morsel. As he threw,<br>
      A finger broke off and fell into my food.<br>
      At a wall nearby I ate my share<br>
      Not at that time or after felt disgust.<br>
      For only he who takes as they come<br>
      The scraps of food, cow&#146;s urine for medicine,<br>
      Lodging beneath a tree, the patchwork robe,<br>
      Truly is a man contented everywhere.&quot;<br>
      -- (Theragatha 1054-1057) </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On another occasion the Buddha requested Kassapa to teach
    errant monks. The Buddha said, &quot;Exhort the monks, Kassapa. Either I, Kassapa, should
    exhort the monks, or you. Either I or you should give them a discourse on the
    Dhamma&quot;. These words imply the confidence the Buddha had in Kassapa, as not every
    Arahanth had the ability to teach in a manner that would be understood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The text did not specify why the Buddha chose Kassapa over
    his chief disciples Sariputta and Moggallana for this instruction. They too were excellent
    teachers. It could be that this instruction was given after their passing away or just
    before, as the Buddha was aware that Kassapa would outlive Him, unlike his chief disciples
    who would pass away before He did. It could also have been because the Buddha saw in His
    monks a movement away from austere practices to a life of comfort and materialism.
    Kassapa, who led an austere life, would have been the perfect role model for the errant
    monks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kassapa often questioned the Buddha, as did the other
    monks. On one occasion, Kassapa asked the Buddha why, early in His dispensation, there
    were fewer rules for the monks and more Arahanths, while later there were more rules for
    the monks and fewer Arahanths. The Buddha replied as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So it happens, Kassapa, when beings deteriorate
      and the true Dhamma vanishes: then there are more rules and fewer Arahanths. There will
      be, however, no vanishing of the Dhamma until a sham Dhamma arises in the world. But when
      a sham Dhamma arises in the world, there will be more rules and fewer Arahanths.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But, Kassapa, it is not a cataclysm of the four
      elements - earth, water, fire and air that make the Dhamma disappear. Nor is the reason
      for its disappearance similar to the overloading of a ship that causes it to sink. It is
      rather the presence of five detrimental attitudes that causes the obscuration and
      disappearance of the Dhamma.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;These are the five: It is the lack of respect and
      regard for the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, the training, and for meditative
      concentration on the part of monks, nuns, and male and female devotees. But so long as
      there is respect and regard for these five things the Dhamma will remain free of
      obscuration and will not disappear.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is important to note that it is not only the Sangha
    that have been entrusted with the preservation of the Dhamma. Even the lay devotees can
    and should contribute to its preservation. In fact, each and every one of us should do our
    part to ensure the preservation of the Dhamma in whatever way we can to ensure the
    availability of the Dhamma for future generations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kassapa did not question the Buddha as to when a sham
    Dhamma would appear in the world or as to what exactly He meant by a sham Dhamma. Even
    though there are many traditions of Buddhism in the world they all contain the Four Noble
    Truths and the Doctrine of Dependent Origination which is the core of the Buddha&#146;s
    teaching. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even though the Buddha often commended Kassapa for his
    austere practices and detached manner, He felt deep compassion for the ageing elder. On
    two occasions the Buddha reminded Kassapa that now that he was old, his coarse, worn-out
    rag-robe may be uncomfortable against his skin and that he should now wear soft robes. He
    also requested him to accept invitations from householders for alms, and to live in
    monasteries without resorting to the alms round and dwelling in the forest. Kassapa,
    however, refused, saying that he had been a forest dweller and had worn rag-robes for a
    long time, and recommended this behaviour to others. He also said that he had few wants
    and that he was contented and happy with what he had, and that he had also recommended
    this behaviour to others. As such, he preferred to remain in the austere practices which
    he had on many occasions recommended to others. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then questioned him as to why he led such an
    austere life and he replied that it was for his own well-being and with compassion for
    later generations. He said that they could then emulate his exemplary behaviour and be
    inspired by him. For not only did he preach austerity to others but he also exemplified it
    in his behaviour. The Buddha then praised him for his words and gave permission for him to
    remain as a forest dweller, wearing rag-robes and going the alms round, as doing so would
    be of benefit to men and gods.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It almost seems as if the Buddha, realizing that there
    would be a decline in monastic values after His Parinibbana, was grooming Kassapa for the
    important role he would play in the preservation of the Dhamma. The Buddha had
    specifically declared that there would be no successor after His passing, but that the
    Dhamma would be their Teacher. Even so the Buddha would have foreseen that Kassapa&#146;s
    austere practices would make him a reputable, outstanding leader who would be respected
    and honoured by the monks. On many occasions the Buddha praised and encouraged
    Kassapa&#146;s austere practices. Kassapa in turn used every opportunity to encourage his
    pupils away from materialism and towards the beauty of an austere life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kassapa describes the beauties of forest dwelling and the
    insight and peace it brings which lead to the penetration of the Dhamma as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;These regions are delightful to my heart<br>
      When the kareri creeper spreads its flower wreaths,<br>
      When sound the trumpet call of elephants<br>
      These rocky heights delight my heart.<br>
      These rocks with hue of dark-blue clouds<br>
      Where streams are flowing, cool and crystal-clear,<br>

    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Maha Kassapa&#146;s Great Contribution</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kassapa&#146;s greatest contribution to the preservation
    of the Dhamma occurred after the Parinibbana of the Lord Buddha. Of the Buddha&#146;s
    great disciples, only Ananda and Anuruddha were present in Kusinara when the Buddha passed
    away, as Sariputta and Moggalana had both passed away prior to the Buddha. Kassapa, with
    his retinue of monks, was travelling towards Kusinara from Pava when they met an ascetic
    who had with him a Mandarava (coral tree) flower. As this plant grows in the heavens
    Kassapa knew that something unusual had occurred. He asked the ascetic if he knew anything
    about the Buddha and the ascetic confirmed that the Buddha had passed away a week prior.
    He said that the gods and the Malla kings were paying their respects to the Buddha with
    incense and flowers. This Mandarava plant he said he had taken from the cremation site.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the monks heard of the Buddha&#146;s passing away all
    who had not attained Arahanthsip started to lament and cry. But there was one monk named
    Subhadda who addressed the other monks and said, &quot;Enough, friends. Do not grieve, do
    not lament. We are well rid of the Great Ascetic. We have been in trouble by His telling
    us this is good, this is not good. Now we can do what we like and we do not have to do
    what we do not like.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The text does not indicate Kassapa&#146;s response to
    these cruel words. Kassapa may have remained silent so as not to cause discord among the
    monks. Instead, he consoled the grieving by reminding them of the truth of impermanence
    that the Buddha had taught. Kassapa, however, noted this incident for he cited it when he
    gathered the Arahanths for the First Sangha Council. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kassapa then made a mental aspiration that the funeral
    pyre would not light until he and his retinue of monks reached Kusinara. In keeping with
    his aspiration, the sandalwood pyre would not light. When Kassapa and his monks arrived
    the wood shifted to expose the sacred foot of the Buddha. With bowed head Kassapa and his
    retinue paid homage to the Buddha, after which the sandalwood pyre caught fire.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the cremation and distribution of the Buddha&#146;s
    relics Kassapa concentrated his efforts on the preservation of the Dhamma. Remembering
    Subbadda&#146;s challenge and the possibility of moral laxity and the decline of the
    Dhamma, he proposed holding a Sangha Council where the Dhamma and the rules for the
    Sangha, the Vinaya, would be reviewed. When he shared his views with the other members of
    the Noble Order, they agreed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the First Sangha Council, Kassapa selected 500 members
    from the Sangha, all Arahanths except for Ananda. Ananda, who was known as the guardian of
    the Dhamma, was selected because of his retentive memory and detailed knowledge of the
    84,000 suttas dispensed by the Buddha and His great disciples. Upali, the former barber of
    the Sakyan Prince, who was an Arahanth, led the Vinaya as he had been declared by the
    Buddha as the monk foremost in the knowledge of the monastic rules (Vinaya). All other
    monks were required to leave Rajagaha for the seven-month duration of the recitation. All
    the teachings of the Buddha and the monastic discipline were recited. The Dhamma was
    codified and organized into the five collections (Nikayas) and the three Pitakas: Sutta
    Pitaka, Vinaya Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka. The first Sangha Council was held in the
    capital of Rajagaha, in the country of Magadha, under the patronage of King Ajatasattu,
    three months after the passing away of the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda, with the encouragement of Anuruddha, meditated and
    reached Arahanthship at dawn on the day of the First Sangha Council. He then travelled
    through the air using astral travel to indicate his deliverance and took his place among
    the other members of the Council.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the First Council the high regard that the monks had
    for Kassapa grew further. He was seen as the head of the order even though the Buddha had
    specifically declared that there would be no successor and that when He was gone, the
    Dhamma would be the teacher. Before his death, Kassapa handed the Buddha&#146;s bowl to
    Ananda as a symbol of the continuation of the faithful preservation of the Dhamma.
    Kassapa, who had generally been recognized as being the most worthy in succession, chose
    Ananda as being the most worthy after him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kassapa records his deliverance, gratitude and praise of
    the Master as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In the whole field of the Buddha&#146;s
      following,<br>
      Except for the Mighty Master himself,<br>
      I stand the foremost in ascetic ways;<br>
      No one practises them as far as I.<br>
      The Master has been served by me,<br>
      And all the Buddha&#146;s teaching has been done;<br>
      Low have I laid the heavy load I bore,<br>
      Cause for rebirth is found in me no more.<br>
      Gotama the Immeasurable does not cling<br>
      To robe, to food or place of lodging,<br>
      Like spotless lotus blossoms He is free from taints<br>
      Bent on renunciation He transcends the three worlds.<br>
      The four foundations of mindfulness are His neck<br>
      The great Seer has faith and confidence for hands;<br>
      Above His brow is perfect wisdom; nobly wise,<br>
      He ever wanders with all desire quenched.&quot;<br>
      -- (Theragatha 1087-1090)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kassapa was known as Maha Kassapa (great) to distinguish
    him from others who had the same Brahmin name. It is said that Maha Kassapa was the only
    monk to share seven of the thirty two marks of noble birth that the Buddha had. In keeping
    with his aspiration the Buddha declared that Maha Kassapa was foremost among the monks in
    austere practices. He was also the third most pre-eminent monk among the Buddha&#146;s
    retinue.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The First Sangha Council was extremely successful in the
    preservation of &quot;The Word of the Buddha&quot;. This method, the introduction of which
    resulted in Maha Kassapa being called &quot;the Father of the Dhamma&quot; was used in
    subsequent years as and when required. It also led to the use of the term
    &quot;Theravada&quot; or recitation of the elders (Arahanths) being used for the Word of
    the Buddha. Since then there have been six more Sangha Councils under the Theravada
    Tradition and one Sangha Council under the Mahayana Tradition. The Second Sangha Council
    was held 100 years after the Parinibbana of the Buddha, in the Valukarama at Vesali, under
    the patronage of King Klasoka. One of Ananda&#146;s pupils, the Arahanth Sabbakmi, who
    was 120 years old, presided over the Second Sangha Council, and 700 members of the Sangha,
    all of whom were Arahanths, took part. The Second Sangha Council took eight months to
    complete.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Third Sangha Council was held 235 years after the
    Parinibbana of the Buddha in the 17th year of King Asoka&#146;s reign, under his patronage
    in the Asokarama in Pataliputta. The Arahanth Moggaliputta Tissa presided over the Third
    Sangha Council and 1,000 members of the Sangha, all of whom were Arahanths, took part. The
    Third Sangha Council took nine months to complete.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">About four hundred and fifty years after the Buddha&#146;s
    Parinibbana, around 90 BC, the Fourth Sangha Council which was in the Theravada Tradition
    was held, and the Word of the Buddha was documented for the first time in Matale at the
    Aluvihara in Sri Lanka, under the patronage of King Vatta Gamini Abhaya (Walagambahu).
    Five hundred members of the Sangha, all of whom were Arahanths, took part in the Fourth
    Sangha Council. The Great Commentator, Buddhaghosa, who wrote the <i>Path of Purification
    (Visuddhi Magga), </i>states that the number of books written on Ola (palm) leaves was so
    great that when piled one on top of another they reached the height of six elephants.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next Sangha Council, the First Sangha Council in the
    Mahayana Tradition was held in Kashmir about five hundred years after the Parinibbana of
    the Lord Buddha, under the patronage of King Kanishka (78 BC - 101 AC). The Ven. Vasumitta
    presided.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Fifth Sangha Council in the Theravada Tradition was
    held in Mandalay in Myanmar (Burma), two thousand four hundred and fifteen years after the
    passing away of the Lord Buddha, in November 1871 under the patronage of King Mindon. The
    scriptures written on palm leaves would eventually deteriorate. To ensure the preservation
    of the scriptures the Buddha Dhamma was inscribed on marble slabs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Two thousand four hundred Bhikkus led by Venerable
    Jagarabhivamsa of the Dakkhinarama Monastery assisted by the Venerable Narindabhidhaja and
    the Venerable Sumangalasami began by reciting the scriptures in the traditional manner.
    The joint Dhamma recitation lasted five months. Then with the help of skilled crafts men
    it was inscribed in seven hundred and twenty-nine marble slabs. It took seven years six
    months and fourteen days to complete the work. The marble slabs were placed in Pitaka
    Pagodas in the grounds of King Mindon&#146;s Kuthodaw Pagoda at the foot of the Mandalay
    Hill. It is now known as the world&#146;s largest book.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Sixth Sangha Council, known as the Kaba Aye, which was
    of the Theravada Tradition, was held in Yangon (Rangoon) in 1954. It was sponsored by the
    Burmese Government led by the Honorable Prime Minister U Nu. He authorised the
    construction of the Maha Passana Gaha, &#145;the great cave&#146;, an artificial cave
    similar to the cave in which the First Sangha Council was recited. The Sixth Sangha
    Council was unique in that the Bhikkus taking part in it came from eight different
    countries. Two thousand five hundred learned Theravada monks from Mynmar, Cambodia, India,
    Laos, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam graced the momentous occasion. The late
    Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw was appointed to question the Dhamma as required and the
    Venerable Bhadanta Vivittasarabhivamsa answered the questions eloquently. By this time the
    scriptures had been translated to the native language of all the participating countries
    except for India. The traditional recitation took two years. The commentaries and
    different scripts were also examined and reconciled where necessary. This version of the
    Tripitaka which was sanctioned by the entire Theravada Buddhist World is now accepted as
    the pristine teachings of the Buddha Gotama</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The retentive powers of the minds of Arahanths developed
    through years and years of meditation, the Buddha&#146;s style of teaching which was
    repetitive, and His instruction to memorize the Teaching so as to hand it down to others,
    resulted in a comprehensive text for future generations. The fact that only Arahanths were
    admitted to the early Sangayanas ensured that it was only those who had experienced the
    Truth, those who have seen the supreme bliss of Nibbana, who participated in this very
    important preservation. The freedom the Buddha gave to investigate, question and debate
    also helped, as the teachings were analysed whenever there was a conflict of opinion and
    corrected to ensure that it was the word of the Buddha which was preserved. Thus the
    Arahanth Maha Kassapa, the third most pre-eminent monk of the Buddha, often referred to as
    the &quot;Father of the Dhamma&quot;, ensured the preservation of the Dhamma for future
    generations.</font></p>
