    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>17. Khema</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Khema, who was of royal birth, lived in the city of Sagala
    in the kingdom of Magadha. Because of her golden skin, her parents had named her Khema.
    When she grew up she became the chief consort of King Bimbisara. She was extremely
    beautiful and very conscious of her exquisite beauty. As such she did not want to see the
    Buddha or hear the Dhamma, as the Buddha had made it quite clear that external beauty was
    impermanent and of no value to enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Bimbisara, who was a devoted follower of the Buddha,
    wanted his queen to listen to the Buddha&#146;s teachings. He thought of a plan to entice
    her to visit the monastery in which the Buddha was residing. King Bimbisara had his
    musicians describe in song the natural beauty of the grove in which the Buddha was
    residing. Khema, who was extremely fond of beauty, listened enraptured to their
    description of the beautiful flowers and trees that surrounded the Buddha. Wanting to
    experience the beauty of the grove, Khema decided to visit the monastery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was giving a discourse to a large gathering
    when he saw Khema in the distance, approaching the monastery. With his psychic powers he
    created a vision of an exquisitely beautiful maiden by his side. Khema, enchanted by the
    beauty of the grove and its scented flowers, walked closer and closer to the gathering
    until her attention was drawn to the beautiful maiden who was fanning the Buddha. Khema,
    who admired beauty, was captivated by the maiden whose beauty far surpassed her own.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then made the beautiful maiden age slowly
    before her eyes. Khema saw the maiden&#146;s beautiful skin wrinkle, her hair change to
    grey and her body age. She then saw the body collapse with age and pass away, leaving
    behind just a corpse which in turn changed to a heap of bones. Understanding that all
    conditioned phenomena were impermanent, Khema realized that the same would happen to her.
    How could she retain her beauty when this exquisite vision aged and decomposed before her
    very eyes?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Khema was ready to listen to the Buddha, who then
    dispensed to her the dangers of lust and sense pleasures and requested her to give up
    sense pleasures which were transient. Directing her spiritually advanced mind to the
    teachings, Khema attained Arahanthship. She then received permission from King Bimbisara
    to enter the Noble Order of Nuns. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Khema was able to penetrate the truth so quickly because
    of her practice of the virtues and wisdom many aeons ago. Because of her strong attraction
    to the Truth and wisdom, Khema had attained birth in the proximity of Buddhas, Pacceka
    Buddhas and Bodhisattas in many previous lives and had studied, practised and taught the
    Dhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One hundred thousand world cycles ago, at the time of the
    Buddha Padumuttara, Khema was born in a servant family in the City of Hannsavati. She had
    been inspired by the Padumuttara Buddha who was dispensing the Dhamma to an assembly of
    monks and nuns. There arose in her a strong desire to offer a meal to the Padumuttara
    Buddha. As she had no money, she had cut off her beautiful hair and sold it to earn the
    money required to give alms to the Buddha. She had then made the aspiration to be the
    chief female disciple of a future Buddha and foremost in wisdom. From that time onwards
    Khema had worked tirelessly to fulfil her aspiration. Ninety-one world cycles ago at the
    time of the Buddha Vipassi, she was a Bhikkhuni and a teacher of the Dhamma. At the time
    of the Buddhas Kakusandha, Konagamana and Kassapa in the present Maha Baddha Kappa, she
    had been a lay disciple of the respective Buddhas, had built monasteries and given alms to
    each of the Buddhas and their retinue of monks and nuns, and practised the Dhamma
    diligently.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many Jataka stories of Khema&#146;s previous
    births. She had had the opportunity to develop wisdom as the wife of the Bodhisatta Gotama
    (Jataka 354), as His daughter-in-law (Jataka 397), and as the wife of Sariputta (Jataka
    534). In each of these previous birth stories she had been virtuous and had performed many
    meritorious deeds to fulfil her aspiration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After attaining Arahanthship Khema understood the
    impermanence of the body and the dangers of sensual pleasures. Once an insistent admirer
    tried to seduce her, as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;You are so young and beautiful,<br>
      And I myself am in the bloom of youth;<br>
      Come, noble lady, let us rejoice<br>
      In the music of a fivefold ensemble.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Khema, who was already an Arahanth, admonished him as
    follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I am repelled and humiliated<br>
      By this putrid, fleshy body,<br>
      Afflicted by illness, so very fragile<br>
      I have uprooted sensual craving.<br>
      Sensual pleasures are now like sword stakes,<br>
      The aggregates are their chopping block.<br>
      That which you call sensual delight<br>
      Has become for me no delight at all.<br>
      Everywhere delight has been destroyed,<br>
      The mass of darkness has been shattered.<br>
      Know this O evil One -<br>
      You are defeated, Exterminator.<br>
      Fools who do not know reality<br>
      In forest glades they seek retreat<br>
      And worship in reverence, planets, stars, or fire<br>
      To quench passion&#146;s impurity.<br>
      The great Buddha, noblest of all men<br>
      I who worship Him<br>
      From sorrow of repeated birth am free<br>
      The Noble Buddha Order, I protect devotedly.<br>
      -- (Therigatha 139-144)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Khema, who was the first female chief disciple of the
    Buddha, ranked foremost in wisdom and insight. She was respected by all for her wisdom and
    ability to explain the higher teachings. Her wisdom and lucid explanations of deep
    subjects made a lasting impression on King Pasenadi Kosala, who had great respect and
    regard for her. Khema, with her sharp mind, wisdom, and analytical skills, helped the
    Buddha in teaching the Dhamma to His large congregation of nuns and in training the nuns,
    to whom she served as a role model. There are also many recorded instances where Khema,
    with compassion and understanding, taught the Dhamma to male and female lay devotees.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">18. Uppalavanna</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Uppalavanna was the unusually beautiful daughter of a rich
    merchant. Her skin was the blue- black colour and texture of the calyx of the blue lotus.
    Because of the unusually beautiful colour of her complexion, her parents named her
    Uppalavanna or &#145;one with the hue of the blue lotus&#146;. When she came of age her
    parents had her married to a young merchant from a wealthy family. As was the custom at
    the time, she moved to her husband&#146;s home in Savatthi.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Uppalavanna lived happily with her in-laws until her
    husband had to travel to Rajagaha for business. Neither Uppalavanna nor her husband were
    aware that she was with child when he left. When her pregnancy became noticeable, her
    mother-in-law accused her of misconduct. Despite her pleas of innocence, Uppalavanna was
    cast out of her home by her mother-in-law who now despised her. Uppalavanna, who had not
    done any wrong, decided that she would go to Rajagaha in search of her husband. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The journey was long and difficult. Accepting the
    hospitality of strangers who felt compassion for the beautiful woman who was heavy with
    child, she walked slowly from city to city until her labour pains started. Resting in a
    hut on the way-side she delivered a baby son. Tired and weak, Uppalavanna wrapped the
    new-born in her robe and rested. Then, leaving the baby in the hut, she walked to the
    river close by to wash.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A stranger who was passing by heard the faint cry of her
    baby. Seeing the little baby with no parents in sight, he decided to adopt the child. When
    Uppalavanna came back to the hut she was devastated. Weeping in sorrow she ran about
    looking for her child, but was unable to find her baby son.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Uppalavanna was desolated. She knew that she could no
    longer go to her husband. He would surely kill her if he found out that she had lost his
    son. A first-born son was the head of the family who carried on the lineage. In the
    male-dominant society of India this was a very precious child and his birth a celebrated
    event. Uppalavanna knew that she had no hope of being forgiven for her carelessness.
    Having no place to go, she decided to go home to her parents. She was walking through a
    thick jungle when a robber who was hiding out in the jungle caught sight of her. Attracted
    by her unusual beauty, he decided to take her as his wife. The desperate Uppalavanna
    agreed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before long she conceived again and gave birth to a baby
    girl. Her life, however, was not a happy, comfortable one. Her husband was often violently
    angry with her. He continually reminded her of her past and his gracious hospitality
    towards her in taking her as his wife. After one such long and furious argument he stormed
    off in anger. Uppalavanna, who was furious with her husband, jumped up and threw her baby
    daughter who was resting on her lap on to the bed. The baby flew off the bed, on to the
    floor and cut her head. Blood gushed from the wound as the baby lay unconscious.
    Uppalavanna was sure that she had accidentally killed her daughter. She knew that her
    husband would never believe her. She feared for her life for she knew the wrath of her
    robber husband. She decided to run away again. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Earning her keep by performing menial jobs the beautiful
    Uppalavanna scraped a living. Her former wealth and beauty were of no use to her. She was
    a fallen woman, ashamed to go back to her parents and afraid to go back to her husband.
    She lived thus for many years in great poverty. One day as she was gathering firewood a
    handsome youth saw her. Attracted by the older woman&#146;s beauty he decided to take her
    as his wife. Uppalavanna, who was tired of her insecure life, agreed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Uppalavanna and her husband lived together in harmony for
    some time. Then one day he had to leave on business. When he came back he brought with him
    a second wife &#150; a very beautiful woman who was in the flush of youth. Uppalavanna
    accepted the younger woman reluctantly. Men often had their way with women and having more
    than one wife was a common occurrence. The two women formed a shaky friendship.
    Uppalavanna was grooming the younger wife&#146;s hair one day when she noticed a large,
    jagged scar on her head. The young woman then informed her that she was the daughter of a
    robber and that she had injured her head when her mother had fought with her father.
    Uppalavanna was horrified. This was her own daughter whom she had left for dead many years
    ago. The thought that she and her daughter had shared a man sickened her. Unable to bear
    the shame of her degrading life she went to the Buddha for solace and comfort. Uppalavanna
    then decided to join the Noble Order of Nuns.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Soon afterwards it was her turn to unlock and clean the
    assembly hall. After she had lighted the lamp and swept the hall the flame of the lamp
    attracted her. Concentrating on the element of fire, she went into deep meditation and
    attained Arahanthship together with the analytical knowledge.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of her comprehensive supernormal powers
    Uppalavanna was declared by the Buddha to be foremost in supernormal powers among His
    nuns. She was also His second chief female disciple. Together with Khema she helped the
    Buddha with the teaching and administration of His growing congregation of nuns.
    Uppalavanna, who had suffered greatly in her youth because of society&#146;s treatment of
    women, helped other young women attain freedom from suffering. Her experience of the
    unique suffering faced by women made it easy for her to empathise with others in similar
    situations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To understand Uppalavanna&#146;s quick attainment of
    enlightenment we need to go back many aeons to the time of the Buddha Padumuttara. At the
    time of the Buddha Padumuttara, Uppalavanna was born to a wealthy family in the City of
    Hannsavati. She had seen the Padumuttara Buddha appoint another nun foremost in
    supernormal powers and appoint her as His second female disciple. Inspired by the nun,
    Uppalavanna had provided meals and the requisites to the Buddha and His retinue for seven
    days. She had then made the aspiration to be the second chief disciple of a Buddha. The
    Buddha Padumuttara, seeing that Uppalavanna would fulfill her aspiration, prophesied that
    under the Buddha Gotama she would be the second chief female disciple and foremost in
    supernormal powers. From this time onward Uppalavanna had performed meritorious deeds
    earnestly and worked towards her aspiration. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The text documents some of Uppalavanna&#146;s past births.
    At the time of the Kassapa Buddha, the Buddha who preceded our Gotama Buddha, Uppalavanna
    was born to the royal family in the city of Benares as the daughter of King Kiki. She had
    been a devoted follower of the Buddha and had performed many meritorious deeds, including
    the building of a beautiful monastery for the Buddha. At death she was reborn in a divine
    realm and enjoyed heavenly bliss for a long time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Her next documented birth is as a poor woman. Between the
    time of the Supreme Buddha Kassapa and the Supreme Buddha Gotama there had appeared on
    earth many Pacceka Buddhas. A Pacceka Buddha who had been in deep meditation for seven
    days in the Gandhamadana Mountain had descended from the mountain in search of alms. At
    that time Uppalavanna had just picked some blue lotus flowers and rice which she had then
    made into popped rice. On seeing the Pacceka Buddha she had offered Him the popped rice
    and the beautiful blue lotus flowers that she had just picked. Then, full of joy, she had
    aspired to be as beautiful as the blue lotus. Accepting the meal and the flowers, the
    Pacceka Buddha had returned to the mountaintop, using astral travel. At death Uppalavanna
    was reborn in a heavenly realm where she enjoyed heavenly bliss for a long time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">She then passed away from the heavenly realm and was born
    again in the human realm. No record exists of her parents or her birth. The text documents
    that a hermit who lived in the forest near a lake where blue lotus flowers grew had found
    the beautiful baby by the side of the lake, beside the flowers. The baby, who was very
    beautiful with skin the colour of a blue lotus, was named Uppalavanna by the hermit. He
    then decided to adopt the helpless infant. Uppalavanna grew up to be exceedingly beautiful
    and resembled a celestial nymph. She led a sheltered life alone in the forest with the
    hermit. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, a traveller who was passing through the forest
    saw the unusually beautiful girl and inquired from the hermit as to her origin. When the
    hermit explained that she was an orphan and that he had brought her up as his own child he
    went back and informed the king of the exceptionally beautiful maiden who lived in the
    forest. The King decided to make her his consort. Together with his courtiers, he visited
    the hermit and asked Uppalavanna to be his queen. She agreed. Leaving the forest, she
    moved into the palace and soon became his favourite queen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next documented birth is when Uppalavanna was reborn
    in Rajagaha as the wife of a farmer. At this time eight Pacceka Buddhas had appeared in
    the world and Uppalavanna had the good fortune to offer them alms. She had prepared a meal
    of fragrant rice and was taking it to her husband who was tilling the land when she saw
    the eight Buddhas seeking alms. She had immediately given the Buddhas the meal that she
    had prepared for her husband, and invited them to her home for their meal on the following
    day. She had then prepared fragrant food and picked eight bunches of blue lotus flowers,
    which she had offered to the Buddhas after the meal. For the second time, she aspired to
    be as beautiful as the blue lotus. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next documented birth was in Savatthi at the time of
    our Gotama Buddha. The aspiration made at the time of the Padumuttara Buddha was to bear
    fruit. Her degrading life was too much to bear. Sharing her husband with her daughter
    weighed heavily on her mind. She decided to join the order of nuns under the Buddha. Even
    though the text documents two instances of Uppalavanna&#146;s aspiration to be as
    beautiful as the blue lotus it is most likely that she also renewed her original
    aspiration to be foremost in supernatural powers and the second chief disciple of the
    Buddha. Fulfilment of such an aspiration requires great effort and many meritorious deeds.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is likely that her unusual colouring and exotic beauty
    attracted more attention, which resulted in the preservation of this section of the text.
    The fact that Uppalavanna immediately agreed to be a nun under the Buddha Gotama and that
    she attained Arahanthship shortly thereafter, indicates that there must have been many
    other instances when she had developed wisdom and spiritual insight and renewed her
    aspiration after performing meritorious deeds. These, however, were not available in my
    research.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that time it was common for nuns, as it was for monks,
    to retreat into the forest to meditate. Uppalavanna returned from her alms round and
    entered her hut in the Dark Forest. Unknown to her, a former admirer named ananda, who was
    in love with her, had entered her hut and hidden under her bed. Shortly after she had laid
    down to rest, catching her by surprise, he climbed on top of her and overpowered her.
    Despite her pleas and protest, he abused her and had his way. He then left, slinking out
    unseen as he had come in.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The evil of abusing an Arahanth, however, was too
    powerful. Tormented by his evil deed, ananda died burning in the fires of his desire and
    was reborn in the Avichi Hell.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Uppalavanna composed herself and informed the nuns of her
    ordeal. The nuns in turn informed the Blessed One. The Buddha&#146;s worst fears for His
    Order of Nuns had come to pass. Uppalavanna, His chief disciple, had been overpowered,
    abused, and treated with disrespect. Approaching King Pasenadi Kosala, the Buddha
    requested that he build a residence for the nuns within the confines of the City. He then
    made it a monastic rule that nuns should not meditate and reside alone in the forest. From
    this time onwards nuns resided only within the city.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometime later the monks assembled in the Dhamma hall and
    began to discuss this incident. There arose a debate as to the needs of Arahanths to
    gratify their passions. The Buddha then cleared up their doubts by informing them that the
    desire between a man and woman is quenched in those who have attained Arahanthship and
    described an Arahanth (Brahmin) thus:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>One, who like water on a lotus leaf<br>
      Or mustard seed on a needle point,<br>
      Clings not to pleasures sensual &#150;<br>
      That one I call a Brahmin (Arahanth).&quot;</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Uppalavanna explains her suffering and final attainment of
    release as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Both of us, mother and daughter<br>
      Were co-wives<br>
      Of me there was religious excitement<br>
      Amazing hair raising.<br>
      Woe upon sensual pleasures<br>
      Impure, evil-smelling, with many troubles<br>
      Wherein we,<br>
      Mother and daughter were co-wives.<br>
      Having seen the peril in sensual pleasures<br>
      And (seeing) renunciation as firm security,<br>
      I went forth at Rajagaha from the house<br>
      To the homeless state.<br>
      I know that I have lived before<br>
      The divine-eye has been purified<br>
      And there is knowledge of the state of mind<br>
      The ear-element has been purified<br>
      Supernormal powers too have been realized by me<br>
      I have attained the anhiliation of craving<br>
      (These) six supernormal powers have been realized by me<br>
      The Buddha&#146;s teaching has been done.<br>
      Having fashioned a four-horse chariot by supernormal powers<br>
      Having paid homage to the Buddha&#146;s feet<br>
      The glorious protector of the world<br>
      I stood on one side.&quot;<br>
      -- (Therigatha 224-229)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Uppalavanna was often desired by many admirers because of
    her extraordinary beauty. The fact that she was a member of the Buddha&#146;s Holy Order
    did not deter them. The following verses illustrate the insistence of an admirer and
    Uppalavanna&#146;s response. </font></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;You who are so beautiful<br>
      Seated beneath a sal tree with blossoms crowned<br>
      So aware of your own loneliness<br>
      Do you not tremble when seducers come along?&quot;<br>
      &quot;Though men like you, seducers<br>
      A hundred thousand should approach<br>
      No single hair of mine will turn<br>
      Nor will I quake with fear<br>
      And so, tempter, coming alone<br>
      Of what effect are you?<br>
      I who possess supernormal powers<br>
      Can make my form disappear<br>
      Between your eyebrows or your belly<br>
      I could lodge and stay<br>
      How then, Mara, can you see me?<br>
      My mind I have so disciplined<br>
      Clairvoyance, I have cultivated<br>
      The fourfold path I have realized<br>
      I know the Buddha&#146;s words and ardently I follow.<br>
      Lusts as deadly weapons, rend and tear apart<br>
      These our bodies, heirs of senses<br>
      Desires of which you speak<br>
      Lack all desire for me.<br>
      I have conquered all desire<br>
      And rent apart<br>
      The murky gloom of ignorance<br>
      Know, tempter, I have triumphed over you.&quot;<br>
      -- (Therigatha 230-235)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The exotic Uppalavanna, who could relate to the unique
    suffering that women faced, was a great asset to the Buddha. Using her supernormal powers
    and her gentle pleasing nature, she helped many thousands of women in their emancipation.
    Many, drawn by her beauty, compassion and gentleness, emulated the great Arahanth and
    attained their own enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">19. Bhadda Kundalakesa</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the time of the Buddha in the city of Rajagaha there
    lived a rich merchant who had a very beautiful daughter named Bhadda. Because of her
    frivolous and passionate nature her parents had her confined to the seventh floor of a
    seven-story mansion where she lived in seclusion with her maidservants.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day she heard a commotion and looking out of her
    window saw a very handsome youth who had been led to trial for committing a robbery. She
    instantly fell passionately and hopelessly in love with the youth. Her parents tried to
    dissuade her by pointing out that he was a thief and not to be trusted but Bhadda would
    not heed their advice. Instead,she lay down on her bed and refused to eat or drink until
    the man was given to her in marriage. In desperation, Bhadda&#146;s parents agreed to her
    request. Her father gave a large bribe to the officials who substituted a poor, innocent
    man for the youth, and Bhadda&#146;s lover was freed. Bhadda&#146;s parents gave her in
    marriage to the youth, hoping that her love and his good fortune would mend his ways.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the youth, who was a thief at heart, did not change.
    Instead, he was obsessed with his wife&#146;s beautiful wedding jewellery, which he
    planned to steal from her. He informed Bhadda that he had taken a vow to the God of the
    Mountains. He had vowed that if his life was spared he would go to the top of the
    mountain, the abode of the God, and make an offering. It was time, he said, to keep the
    vow. Instructing Bhadda to dress in all her finery, he set off with her to the top of a
    high mountain.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the way they reached a steep cliff with a sheer face
    known as robbers&#146; cliff, as in accordance with the laws of that time thieves were put
    to death at this point by pushing them over the cliff. He then told Bhadda to hand over
    all her jewellery and informed her of her impending death as he planned to push her over
    the cliff and make off with her jewels. Bhadda was at a loss as to what she should do.
    However, being extremely quick-witted, she came up with a plan to foil her husband.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">She agreed to his request and asked permission to pay
    obeisance to her husband whom she said she dearly loved. Then falling on her knees, she
    saluted him from each side and when she was directly behind him pushed him over the cliff.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bhadda, who was a kind and compassionate person, was
    horrified at what she had done. The fact that she had killed a person, even in
    self-defence, weighed on her mind. No longer was she attracted to men and sense pleasures.
    Having decided to take to the life of an ascetic, she joined a religious movement known as
    the Jains.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In keeping with the beliefs of the Jains her hair was
    pulled out at the roots as a form of penance. She followed their teachings and practised
    their religion diligently. Her hair however, started to grow back, only this time it came
    back in the form of thick curls. Bhadda was soon referred to as Kundalakesa or &#145;curly
    hair&#146;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before long Kundalakesa had mastered all the knowledge of
    the Jains. She moved from teacher to teacher, grasping and learning their philosophies and
    practices very quickly. Having studied under many spiritual teachers Kundalakesa became a
    very knowledgeable, spiritual person. So much so that she gained a reputation for being
    excellent at debating in matters of religion and philosophy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kundalakesa used to travel from city to city challenging
    people to debates. Whenever she entered a city, she made a small mound of sand and planted
    in the centre a branch of the rose apple tree. She would then challenge anyone who wanted
    to debate with her to accept her challenge by trampling down the mound of sand.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day when the Buddha was in residence at the Jetavana
    monastery, Kundalakesa arrived in Savatthi and issued her challenge. Sariputta decided to
    accept her challenge. He instructed some children to go and trample the mound of sand on
    his behalf and to ask Kundalakesa to come to the monastery on the following day to debate
    with him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Confident of her victory, Kundalakesa came to the
    monastery with a large gathering of her supporters. She began by questioning Sariputta.
    Each question that she asked was answered correctly by Sariputta. Kundalakesa asked
    question after question until she was exhausted of questions. No matter what her question
    Sariputta knew the answer. It was now Sariputta&#146;s turn to challenge her. Kundalakesa
    faltered at the very first question. Not knowing the answer she asked him to teach her.
    Sariputta agreed to answer the question in the presence of the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta led her to the Buddha and Bhadda listened to His
    teaching. Bhadda, who was extremely quick-witted, attained Arahanthship instantaneously.
    The Buddha declared that Bhadda was foremost among the nuns in understanding the Dhamma
    quickly, for, like the monk Bahiya, she had attained enlightenment instantaneously.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Using her skill in debating Bhadda travelled far and wide
    preaching the Dhamma to others so that they too could benefit by the Truth. She describes
    her experiences of enlightenment and her travels whilst teaching the Dhamma as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>

    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">20. Patacara</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Patacara was the beautiful daughter of a wealthy Savatthi
    merchant. When she came of age her parents arranged a marriage for her to a man of similar
    status and wealth. Patacara, however, was in love with one of the servants in her
    parents&#146; household. She decided to elope with her lover as she felt that it would be
    impossible for her to obtain the consent of her parents to marry a servant.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dressing as a servant and carrying a pot of water on her
    head, Patacara fled with her lover. They set up house in a village at some distance from
    Savatthi. Her husband tilled the land and earned a meagre living. Patacara worked at
    pounding the rice, cooking and cleaning &#150; duties that had formerly been performed by
    the servants in her parents&#146; home. Thus she led a difficult life, paying in this
    birth itself for the suffering she had caused her parents through her elopement.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After some time Patacara became pregnant with their first
    child. As was the custom she wanted to go back to her parents&#146; home for the delivery.
    At the appropriate time she requested her husband to take her back to her parents. He
    refused, as he was sure that they would have him tortured and killed for taking her away
    from them. Patacara then decided to go on her own. Telling her neighbours that she had
    gone to visit her parents, Patacara started walking towards Savatthi.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When her husband returned from work and found that
    Patacara had left to see her parents he was distraught. Running after her he caught up
    with her and pleaded for her to return. At that time the birth pains started. Taking
    shelter under some bushes Patacara gave birth to a baby boy. At her husband&#146;s
    insistence she turned back and returned to their home.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some years later Patacara became pregnant with their
    second child. When the time for the child&#146;s birth drew near, determined to have the
    baby with the support of her parents, she took her older son and walked towards Savatthi.
    She had walked half the distance when her husband caught up with her. Again he dissuaded
    her from going. But this time Patacara was determined to be with her parents.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">They were travelling thus when they were overcome by a
    fierce rainstorm. Strong winds tore across the path, swaying the branches hither and
    thither, and torrents of rain poured down. In the midst of the storm Patacara&#146;s birth
    pains started. She asked her husband to build a temporary shelter to shield them from the
    torrential rains and wind. He left to cut down some suitable branches to build a shelter.
    Patacara waited in vain for her husband&#146;s return. Then, shielding her first-born as
    best she could, she gave birth to a second son. Patacara slept the night huddled under a
    bush, her body arched to shield her two sons from the storm. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next morning she traced the steps of her husband to
    find his stiffened body. When cutting branches for a shelter he had disturbed a poisonous
    snake. Death had been painful but quick. Lamenting in sorrow, Patacara gathered her sons
    and continued to her parents&#146; home in Savatthi.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the way they had to cross the swollen river Aciravati.
    The water was waist-high and the current strong. Patacara, exhausted by the storm and her
    recent ordeal of childbirth, knew that she could not carry both children. Leaving her
    older son on the bank she carried the newborn babe to the other side. Then she started
    back to fetch her first-born. She was half-way across when she saw a hawk swoop down to
    carry away the newborn who resembled a piece of red meat. Patacara screamed and waved her
    hands, hoping the hawk would drop her baby. The hawk ignored her cries, but her
    first-born, thinking that his mother was calling him, ran into the river only to be swept
    away by the swirling waters.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Patacara was broken with grief. She had lost her husband
    and two sons within one day. Numb with grief, her hair streaming, her clothes wet, a
    tear-stained Patacara approached Savatthi. There she met a city dweller and inquired as to
    the whereabouts of her parents. The stranger begged her not to ask about that family.
    &quot;Inquire about any other but not that family,&quot; he said. But Patacara insisted.
    He then informed her that the previous night&#146;s strong winds had blown over their
    house, killing both her parents and her brother. Then, pointing towards blue smoke that
    rose into the air, he said, &quot;Look, that is the smoke from the funeral pyre of the
    three that died. They were cremated together.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Her grief too great to bear, Patacara lost her mind.
    Screaming in pain she ran about the town, her clothes torn, hair streaming, half-naked.
    The locals abused her and called her names for they were sure that she was mentally
    deranged. A grief-stricken, half-crazy Patacara approached the Jetavana monastery where
    the Buddha was residing. The townsfolk tried to stop her. But the Buddha, perceiving with
    his compassionate eye her inner wisdom, bade her enter. He then brought her back to
    mindfulness by His compassion and words. The Buddha said, &quot;Regain your mindfulness,
    sister&quot;. It was as if a bucket of cold water had been thrown over her body. The words
    shook her very being and calmed her grief-stricken mind. Wrapping a cloak that someone had
    thrown to her around her person, Patacara told her tragic story to the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha listened with compassion and patience, then
    told her not to be troubled any longer. &quot;You have come to One who can help relieve
    your suffering. It is not only today that you have lost sons, husbands and parents, but
    throughout this infinite round of samsara you have lost sons and others dear to you.&quot;
    &quot;You have, He said, shed more tears than the waters in the four oceans.&quot; As He
    went on speaking Patacara&#146;s grief subsided. The Buddha then concluded with the
    following verse:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;The four oceans contain but a little water<br>
      Compared to all the tears we have shed<br>
      Smitten by sorrow, bewildered by pain<br>
      Why, O woman, are you still heedless?&quot;</i><br>
      <i>No sons are there for shelter<br>
      No father or related folk<br>
      For one seized by death<br>
      Kinsmen provide no shelter.<br>
      Having well understood this fact<br>
      The wise men well restrained by virtue<br>
      Quickly indeed should clear<br>
      The path going to Nibbana.&quot;<br>
      -- (Dhammapada 268, 288, 289)</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By the time the Buddha had finished His discourse Patacara
    was no longer the raving madwoman who had entered the monastery. She had penetrated the
    Truth of the impermanence of all conditioned things and attained the first stage of
    sainthood, Sotapanna. She then requested ordination as a nun. After entering the Noble
    Order of nuns, Patacara practised the Dhamma diligently. Her diligence soon bore fruit, as
    before long Patachara attained Arahanthship. She explains her experiences and her
    attainment as follows in the Therigatha:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ploughing the field with their ploughs<br>
      Sowing seeds upon the ground,<br>
      Maintaining their wives and children,<br>
      Young men acquire wealth.<br>
      Then why, when I am pure in virtue,<br>
      Practising the Master&#146;s Teaching<br>
      Have I not attained Nibbana<br>
      For I am neither lazy nor arrogant?<br>
      Having washed my feet<br>
      I reflected upon the waters.<br>
      When I saw the foot water flow<br>
      From the high ground down the slope.<br>
      My mind became concentrated<br>
      Like an excellent thoroughbred steed.<br>
      Having taken a lamp I entered my hut<br>
      I inspected the bed and sat on the couch.<br>
      Then, having taken a needle<br>
      I pulled down the wick<br>
      The liberation of the mind<br>
      Was like the quenching of the lamp.&quot;<br>
      -- (Therigatha 112-116)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Patacara had achieved her goal. With the quenching of the
    lamp, her mind, which was one pointed, attained liberation. Patacara was designated by the
    Buddha as the nun who was foremost in Vinaya (discipline rules for the monks and nuns). As
    a young girl Patacara had been undisciplined and frivolous. She had rebelled against the
    authority of her parents and reaped the misfortune of her rebellion. Thus it is not
    surprising that she valued the importance of discipline and became the nun foremost in the
    Vinaya. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Patacara was able to move from a frivolous girl to a saint
    so quickly because of her past life aspirations and training. At the time of the
    Padumuttara Buddha one hundred thousand world cycles ago, she had observed the Teacher
    assign to a nun the title of foremost in the discipline. She had been inspired by that nun
    and aspired to be the nun foremost in discipline under a future Buddha. The Buddha
    Padumuttara, seeing that Patacara had the merit and ability to fulfil her aspiration, had
    prophesied that she would be the nun foremost in discipline at the time of the Buddha
    Gotama. Patacara had been a nun under many subsequent Buddhas and the insight and wisdom
    she had acquired came to fruition under the Gotama Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many nuns benefitted from Patacara&#146;s instruction and
    training. The following are the grateful words of the nun Cunda, formerly a beggar, who
    obtained instruction from her.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;Because she had compassion for me<br>
      Patacara gave me the going forth (ordination)<br>
      Then she gave me an exhortation,<br>
      And enjoined me in the ultimate goal.<br>
      Having heard her word,<br>
      I followed her instruction;<br>
      The lady&#146;s exhortation was not in vain,<br>
      I am now canker-free, with the triple knowledge.&quot;</i><br>
      <i>-- (Therigatha 125-126)</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The text also contained the unidentified writings of one
    who described the experiences of a group of 30 nuns who obtained instruction from
    Patacara.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">Having heard her advice, Patacara&#146;s instruction,<br>
      They cleaned their feet and sat down on one side.<br>
      Then, devoted to serenity of mind,<br>
      They practised the Buddha&#146;s teaching.<br>
      In the first watch of the night,<br>
      They recollected their former births.<br>
      In the night&#146;s middle watch,<br>
      They purified the divine eye.<br>
      In the last watch of the night,<br>
      They sundered the mass of darkness.<br>
      Having risen they worshipped her feet,<br>
      &quot;Your instruction has been taken to heart.<br>
      As the thirty gods honour Indra,<br>
      The one unconquered in battle,<br>
      So shall we dwell honouring you.<br>
      We are cankerless, bearers of triple knowledge.&quot;<br>
      -- (Therigatha 119-121)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The writing clearly illustrates the gratitude of the nuns
    to the teacher whose instruction helped them to attain the unconditioned (Nibbana). In
    addition to honouring the Buddha they were exceedingly grateful to the one who taught them
    the Dhamma, and worshipped and honoured their instructor. Just as the Buddha showed
    gratitude to the Bodhi Tree that gave Him shade and shelter, thus providing the
    environment He needed for mental concentration and enlightenment, His nuns and monks
    honoured the teachers who helped them reach Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Patacara, who had suffered greatly because of her
    undisciplined and inconsiderate behaviour, devoted her life to teaching other young women
    monastic discipline and the benefits of a disciplined mind. She was respected as a great
    teacher and a compassionate nun who helped many women attain emancipation.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">21. Sundari Nanda</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nanda was the daughter of King Suddhodana and Queen Maha
    Pajapati Gotami and the stepsister of Prince Siddhattha. As she brought great pleasure and
    joy to her parents she was named Nanda, which means joy and pleasure. Nanda grew up to be
    extremely graceful and beautiful and was often referred to as Sunadari Nanda or
    &#145;Nanda the Beautiful&#146;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When her mother, Queen Pajapati, and many other Sakyan
    ladies gave up the household life to take up the holy life, Nanda decided to join them.
    However, she did not do so out of confidence in the Buddha or the Dhamma. Nanda was
    ordained as a nun to conform to the wishes of her relatives, whom she loved.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The lovely Nanda was very popular and respected by all.
    People were touched by the sight of the lovely royal daughter, sister of the Buddha,
    wandering the streets for alms in the simple robes of a nun. Nanda&#146;s mind, however,
    was not on her emancipation. She was enthralled by her beauty and popularity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nanda knew that she was not keeping the high ideals of the
    Holy Order. Afraid that the Buddha would admonish her for her vanity and preoccupation
    with beauty, she avoided meeting Him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day the Buddha had all His nuns who were in residence
    come to Him one at a time for instruction. Nanda did not comply as she felt guilty and did
    not want to face the Buddha. The Buddha then called her and gave her a spiritual message
    that emphasized all her good qualities. Even though this discourse made Nanda joyful and
    uplifted her, the Buddha realized that Nanda was not yet ready for a discourse on the Four
    Noble Truths.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing that Nanda was still enthralled with her beauty, He
    created an exquisite vision of a beautiful maiden whose beauty surpassed Nanda&#146;s
    radiance. He then made the image age before her eyes. Nanda saw the beautiful maiden age,
    her skin growing old and wrinkled and her hair turning grey. She saw the woman collapse
    with age and finally die. She saw the body decompose and turn into an ugly sight, bloated
    with worms. Nanda realized the impermanence of this body with which she was so
    preoccupied. Her mind was now ready for the teachings. The Buddha then explained the
    Dhamma of impermanence and the loathsomeness of this body to her. He also gave her the
    loathsomeness of the body as her topic of meditation. Because of her strong attraction to
    her beauty it was necessary for her to contemplate the loathsomeness of her body to
    penetrate the Truth. Before long Nanda attained Arahanthship and expressed her struggle
    for attainment and the bliss of Nibbana as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Nanda, behold this body,<br>
      Ailing, impure and putrid,<br>
      Develop the meditation on the foul,<br>
      Make the mind unified, well composed.<br>
      As is this so was that,<br>
      As is that so this will be (doctrine of cause and effect),<br>
      Putrid, exhaling a foul odour,<br>
      A thing in which fools delight.<br>
      Inspecting it as it is,<br>
      Unwearying by day and night,<br>
      With my own wisdom I pierced right through,<br>
      And then I saw for myself.<br>
      As I dwelt ever heedful,<br>
      Dissecting it (the body) with methodical thought,<br>
      I saw this body as it really is,<br>
      Both inside and outside.<br>
      Then I became disenchanted with the body,<br>
      My inward attachment faded away,<br>
      Being diligent and detached at heart,<br>
      I live in peace, fully quenched.&quot;<br>
      -- (Therigatha 82-86)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">22. Bhadda Kapilani</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bhadda was the former wife of Maha Kassapa. Together with
    her husband she led a celibate life and eventually gave up her wealth and possessions to
    lead the life of an ascetic in search of Truth. When Kassapa suggested that they should
    part ways in search of a Teacher she agreed, and taking the left fork of the road,
    approached Savatthi. She listened to the Dhamma of the Buddha at Jetavana but as He had
    not yet formed the order of the nuns she remained in a nunnery with another sect of
    ascetics.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was approximately five years later that the Buddha
    formed the order of the nuns. Bhadda then joined the order, meditated and attained
    Arahanthship. At the time of the Padumuttara Buddha, Bhadda, together with her husband,
    had performed many meritorious deeds. Whilst Kassapa, then known as Vedeha, had been
    inspired by a monk who led an austere life, Bhadda had been inspired by a nun who could
    recollect many past births. After performing many meritorious actions, she had aspired to
    be the nun foremost in recollection of past births. The Padumuttara Buddha, seeing that
    her aspiration would be fulfilled, declared that at the time of the Gotama Buddha, one
    hundred thousand world cycles into the future, she would be the nun foremost in
    recollecting past births. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is interesting to see the effects of the great
    Arahanths&#146; aspirations and their fulfilment. Even though Bhadda had the potential to
    be an Arahanth and had taken to the holy life five years prior to Maha Pajapati, she had
    no inclination to establish the order of the nuns. Her aspiration was to recollect aeons
    of past lives. This knowledge was her strength and was what she used in motivating her
    pupils. When studying the histories of the great disciples one realizes how varied they
    were in temperament and interests, how each one was inspired by different attributes,
    selected that which interested them and then used this faculty to help others see the
    Truth. Bhadda used her knowledge of past lives to interest and motivate her pupils to
    perform acts of merit and to strive diligently.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also interesting are Bhadda&#146;s past associations with
    Kassapa. During the era of the Buddha Padumuttara, Bhadda and Vedeha performed many
    wholesome deeds and at death were reborn in the heavenly realms. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next recorded life story is many, many years later, at
    the time of the Buddha Vipassi, the fifth preceding Buddha, ninety-one world cycles prior
    to the Buddha Gotama. At that time Bhadda and Kassapa were once again husband and wife,
    but they were exceedingly poor. So poor, that they had only one outer garment which was of
    good quality. Husband and wife shared this one garment by each taking turns to go out. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that time the Buddha Vipassi was giving a special
    sermon and both Bhadda and her husband, Ekasataka, wanted to hear Him speak. But as they
    only had one garment Bhadda went during the daytime and her husband went in the night. As
    the Ekasataka listened to the sermon, the value of giving and generosity became so deeply
    impressed in his mind that he wanted to give the only outer garment they had to the
    Vipassi Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But after the thought entered his mind Ekasataka started
    to have doubts. Thoughts rushed through his mind. &quot;How can we manage with no outer
    garments? This is all we both have. Should I not consult my wife first?&quot; Then pushing
    aside these doubts, he removed his outer garment and laid it at the feet of the Vipassi
    Buddha. Having done so he clapped his hands joyfully and cried, &quot;I have won! I have
    won!&quot; When the king, who was also in the audience, heard the cry of victory, he
    inquired as to what had happened. The king was overwhelmed by the poor man&#146;s act of
    generosity. Making him the court chaplain he gave Ekasataka and his wife many sets of
    clothes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And so the situation of the poor couple changed. Resulting
    from this selfless act, at death Ekasataka was reborn in a celestial realm. There he lived
    in splendour until the effects of his wholesome deeds wore off, whereupon he was reborn as
    a righteous king with Bhadda as his chief queen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many other past life stories are documented where Kassapa
    and Bhadda had been associated. Once Bhadda and Kassapa were the parents of ananda. After
    the aged mother of ananda&#146;s teacher fell hopelessly in love with ananda, so much so
    as to plan the death of his teacher, her own son to have her lover, both Bhadda and ananda
    took to the life of ascetics.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On another occasion Kassapa and Bhadda had been the
    Brahmin parents of four sons. Bhadda&#146;s four sons were the Bodhisatta, our Buddha
    Gotama, Sariputta, Moggallana and Anurudha (Jataka 509). Parents and children had all
    taken to the holy life of ascetics.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also interesting is the life story at a time between
    Supreme Buddhas when Bhadda had wronged a Pacceka Buddha. She had quarrelled with her
    sister-in-law, and seeing that her sister in-law had just offered fragrant food to a
    Pacceka Buddha, she had taken his bowl, thrown out the food and filled it with mud. Almost
    immediately she had felt remorse for her action. Taking the bowl back she had washed it
    and refilled it with fragrant, well-prepared food.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a kammic consequence of this action, in a subsequent
    birth Bhadda was born with great wealth and beauty but her body gave off an unbearable
    smell. Her husband, who was again Kassapa, could not stand the smell and left her. She had
    many other suitors because of her wealth and beauty, but none would remain with her
    because of her offensive odour.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During this period there had appeared in the world a fully
    enlightened Supreme Buddha named Kassapa. Feeling that her life was of little use Baddha
    sold all her property, melted down her jewellery and formed a golden brick which she
    donated to the shrine that was being built to hold the relics of the Kassapa Buddha, who
    had just passed away. As a result of this deed her body became fragrant again and her
    former husband took her back.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last documented life story was where Bhadda had been
    the Queen of Benares and had supported many Pacceka Buddhas. Deeply moved at the sudden
    death of the Pacceka Buddhas she had given up her life as queen and taken to the life of
    an ascetic. By the powers of her renunciation and her meditative lifestyle she had been
    reborn in a Brahma realm. At the same time Kassapa too had been reborn in the Brahma
    realm. It was after this life that they had been reborn in the human world as Pippali
    Kassapa and Bhadda Kapilana. It was also the experience in the Brahma realm that resulted
    in their decision to lead a celibate life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As an Arahanth Bhikkhuni Bhadda devoted herself to the
    teaching of younger nuns in monastic discipline. The Therigatha documents her praise of
    her former husband Kassapa and her own attainment of emancipation. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;A son of the Buddha and his rightful heir,<br>
      Kassapa who is well concentrated<br>
      Knows his abode in previous lives<br>
      The Brahmin is a triple knowledge bearer.<br>
      Just so is Bhadda Kapilani<br>
      A triple knowledge nun who has left death behind.<br>
      Having conquered mara (death) and his mount,<br>
      She lives bearing her final body.<br>
      Having seen the grave danger in the world,<br>
      We both went forth into homelessness.<br>
      Now we are destroyers of the cankers,<br>
      Tamed and cool, we have won Nibbana.&quot;</i><br>
      <i>-- (Therigatha 63-66)</i></font></p>

    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">23. Kisa Gotami</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Gotami was the daughter of a poor man. Because of the
    leanness of her body she was referred to as Kisa Gotami or &quot;Lean Gotami&quot;. She
    was fortunate, however, in marrying the son of a rich merchant. But the treatment she
    received from her in-laws was not in keeping with a lady of noble birth. They never let
    her forget her beginings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before long Kisa Gotami conceived and gave birth to a son.
    She adored her child and lavished her attention and love on him. The child was just
    beginning to walk when he succumbed to a fatal sickness and died. Kisa Gotami, who had
    never experienced death before, was devastated. The in-laws who had mistreated her had
    accepted her after the birth of her son. As such she had lavished her attention on her son
    and centred her life around the child who had brought about her acceptance. Determined to
    seek medicine that would bring him back to life, she placed her dead child on her hip and
    went from house to house in search of a skilled physician.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The villagers began to laugh at her and call her names.
    Could she not see that her child was dead? But the grief-stricken Gotami persisted. A
    certain wise man, feeling compassion for the distraught woman, directed her to the Buddha.
    Paying obeisance to the Buddha, Kisa Gotami asked Him to bring her child back to life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, with his divine eye, saw that Kisa Gotami was
    spiritually advanced due to past life efforts. Her mind, however, was not ready for the
    Dhamma due to her unbearable grief. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing that Kisa Gotami had never before experienced
    death, the Buddha asked her to bring Him a few mustard seeds from a house where there had
    been no death. Kisa Gotami lived in a village where extended families lived together. She
    went from house to house with her dead child, only to find that she could not find a house
    where a death had not occurred. Before long Kisa Gotami realized that death was common to
    all beings. Disposing of her dead child in the cemetery, she went back to the Buddha for
    consolation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha questioned her if she had obtained the mustard
    seeds. Gotami informed the Buddha that in every family in the village there had been a
    death. &quot;The dead&quot;, she said, &quot;seem to outnumber the living.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing that Kisa Gotami was ready for the Dhamma, the
    Buddha taught her the impermanence of all things. At the end of the four-line discourse,
    Kisa Gotami, who was spiritually ripe, attained the first stage of sainthood, Sotapanna.
    She then asked permission to be ordained as a nun.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The nun Kisa Gotami practised the teachings of the Buddha
    in earnest. One day, as she was about to put out the lamp in the Dhamma hall, she was
    attracted by the flame. Concentrating on the dancing flame she reflected, &quot;Even as it
    is with this flame, so also it is with living beings. Some flare up while others flicker
    out. Only they that have reached Nibbana are seen no more.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, realizing that Kisa Gotami was close to
    reaching her goal, projected a radiant image of Himself and using her reflections
    instructed her as follows: &quot;Even as it is with this flame, so is it also with living
    beings. Some flare up while others flicker out. Only they that have reached Nibbana are
    seen no more. Therefore, better is the life of one who sees Nibbana though living but for
    an instant than to endure a hundred years and not see Nibbana.&quot; At the end of the
    discourse Kisa Gotami attained the supreme bliss of Nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In gratitude Kisa Gotami describes the great joy the
    Buddha gave her and encouraged others to associate with the Noble Ones.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;To the world the Sage has praised<br>
      The value of noble friendship<br>
      By resorting to noble friends<br>
      Even a fool becomes wise.<br>
      One should resort to worthy people,<br>
      For thus one&#146;s wisdom ever grows,<br>
      By resorting to worthy people<br>
      One is freed from suffering.<br>
      One should know the Four Noble Truths:<br>
      Suffering and its origination,<br>
      Then the cessation of suffering<br>
      And the Noble Eightfold Path.<br>
      -- (Therigatha 213-215)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kisa Gotami, who had suffered greatly as a poor woman of
    low birth, related to other women who were in pain. The life of a woman was difficult and
    fraught with suffering. Women were often treated as chattel and abused. Many men had more
    than one wife. Kisa Gotami, who had suffered as a woman, was compassionate to the
    suffering of women. She describes some of the ordeals that women she knew had to
    experience and her relief in release from suffering. It is only when one understands the
    plight of women in India at the time of the Buddha that one can truly appreciate the
    radical change that He instituted and the gratitude that women such as Kisa Gotami felt
    towards Him for recognizing that women were as spiritually capable as men.</font></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once she was approached by Mara, the evil one, who tried
    to seduce her but Gotami was strong and undefeatable. With equanimity she addresses the
    tempter as friend.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why not when you&#146;ve lost your son<br>

      -- (Samyutta Nikaya)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha dispensed the Dhamma because of the
    impermanence of all things, for it is this impermanence that results in suffering. The
    Buddha often used the suffering caused by the death of a loved one to illustrate the
    impermanence of all conditioned phenomena. He then helped the spiritually advanced such as
    Kisa Gotami to attain the supreme bliss of the unconditioned Nibbana. Kisa Gotami took on
    ascetic practices and wore coarse robes patched from the discarded rags she found at
    charnel grounds. The Buddha declared that Gotami was foremost among the nuns who wore
    coarse garments, one of the thirteen ascetic practices.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">24. Isidasi</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Pataliputta, which later became the capital of Emperor
    Asoka, there lived two nuns named Bodhi and Isidasi who were good friends. They had both
    destroyed all defilements and attained enlightenment. One day the friends discussed their
    past histories and their initiation to the Noble Order. Bhikkuni Bodhi, who was elderly,
    had undergone great suffering. She told her story to Isidasi and then asked the young and
    beautiful nun how someone as beautiful and likable as she had experienced the suffering of
    existence. Bodhi said, </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;You are lovely, noble Isidasi,<br>
      And your youth has not yet faded.<br>
      What was the flaw that you had seen<br>
      That led you to pursue renunciation?&quot;<br>
      -- (Therigatha 403)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Isidasi then told her life story. She had been born in the
    city of Ujjeni as the much-loved only daughter of a rich merchant. When she came of age, a
    wealthy merchant who was a friend of her father asked for her hand in marriage for his
    son. Isidasi&#146;s parents were overjoyed at the proposal as they knew the family well.
    Isidasi, who was a model daughter, displayed these qualities and behaviour to her husband
    and in-laws. She soon she won over the hearts of her parents-in-law. Isidasi also grew to
    love her husband. Disregarding the help offered by her servants she took care of all his
    meals and needs herself. However, despite her love and model behaviour, her husband soon
    tired of her. Isidasi describes her life as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;By myself I cooked the rice,<br>
      By myself I washed the dishes.<br>
      As a mother looks after her only son,<br>
      So did I serve my husband.<br>
      I showed him devotion unsurpassed,<br>
      I served him with a humble mind,<br>
      I arose early, I was diligent, virtuous,<br>
      And yet my husband hated me.&quot;<br>
      -- (Therigatha 412-413)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While admitting to his parents that Isidasi was blameless
    her husband insisted that he could no longer live with her. However, as she had done no
    wrong, he offered to leave the city and start a new life elsewhere. Isidasi&#146;s
    parents-in-law were devastated. They loved their daughter-in-law and did not want to lose
    her. Thinking that there was a problem that their son was hesitant to tell them, they
    questioned Isidasi. She answered truthfully as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I have done nothing wrong,<br>
      I have done him no harm,<br>
      I have not spoken rudely to him.<br>
      What have I done that my husband hates me?&quot; <br>
      -- (Therigatha 418)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Her parents-in-law were perplexed and disappointed. They
    had grown to love Isidasi as a daughter. They did not, however, want their son to move
    away to another city. They decided to send Isidasi back to her parents, certain that with
    her beauty and kindness she would easily find another suitable partner. This rejection was
    devastating to Isidasi. Being sent back to one&#146;s parents was a disgrace and a shame
    in Indian society at the time of the Buddha. Isidasi describes her pain as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Rejected, overcome by suffering,<br>
      They led me back to my father&#146;s house.<br>
      While appeasing our son, they exclaimed,<br>
      We have lost the beautiful goddess of fortune&quot;.<br>
      -- ( Therigatha 419)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Isidasi&#146;s parents were perplexed by what had
    happened. Accepting the inevitable they began looking for a suitable husband. Before long
    they found a wealthy young man who was so overcome by Isidasi&#146;s beauty and deportment
    that he offered to provide half of the usual marriage dowry that was given by the
    bride&#146;s father. Despite the fact that Isidasi lavished her attention on her new
    husband and treated him with utmost respect, the same pattern followed. Within a month he
    retuned her to her father and annulled the marriage, though he could give no cause for his
    extreme dislike of his model wife.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Isidasi was devastated. This second rejection pierced her
    heart like a poisoned arrow. She moped around the house, dejected. When a mendicant came
    to their house begging for alms, Isidasi&#146;s desperate father offered her to the
    ascetic. The ascetic seemed to be unsatisfied with his solitary life. The prospect of a
    beautiful wife and a life of luxury in a splendid mansion appealed to him. Giving his
    begging bowl and robes to her father he accepted Isidasi as his wife. But after two weeks
    he brought her back and asked for his robe and bowl. &quot;He preferred&quot;, he said,
    &quot;to be the poorest man on earth than to live with Isidasi under the same roof.&quot;
    Despite the fact that they pleaded to know the reason for the rejection he could give
    none. &quot;All he knew, he said, was that he could not live with her.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Isidasi was ready to commit suicide. The shame and sorrow
    of three rejections were too hard to bear. She was planning for her death when a Buddhist
    nun named Jinaddata came to their house for alms. Pleased by her serenity and countenance,
    Isidasi asked permission from her father to enter the Noble Order. Her father was hesitant
    as he did not want to lose her company, but seeing the suffering in his beloved
    daughter&#146;s eyes, he agreed. He then urged her to attain the supreme state of Nibbana.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then my father said to me<br>
      Attain enlightenment and the supreme state<br>
      Gain Nibbana which the Best of Men<br>
      Has Himself already realized&quot;.<br>
      -- (Therigatha 432)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After her ordination Isidasi concentrated her efforts on
    reaching the supreme bliss of Nibbana. Within seven days she attained the higher
    knowledge. Isidasi could recollect her past lives, see the passing away and rebirth of
    beings and penetrate the knowledge required for the destruction of all suffering. Looking
    into her past lives Isidasi understood the cause of her failed marriages.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">She explained the cause of her present suffering to her
    friend Bodhi. Eight lifetimes ago Isidasi had been born a man &#150; a rich, handsome and
    dashing goldsmith. Women had been attracted to him and he had taken advantage of them even
    though they were other men&#146;s wives and innocent girls. He flitted from woman to
    woman, breaking hearts, quite oblivious to the pain and suffering he was causing. He
    wanted to take his pleasure again and again. He wanted change. The fact that he had broken
    many hearts and marriages did not bother him at all. They were all trophies that he could
    brag about.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He danced his last dance at death. He had to reap the
    effects of the suffering he had caused. At death he was reborn in hell and experienced the
    torment and suffering of the fiery realm for many, many years. Just as he had caused
    suffering with no regard to the pain of others, he suffered torment without mercy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After suffering in hellish torment for the lifespan of the
    plane he was reborn in the womb of a monkey. Seven days after his birth the leader of the
    monkeys, seeing a threat to his position from the new-born monkey, bit his genitals and
    castrated him. Isidasi describes this act, done to prevent future rivalry, as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;A great monkey leader of the troops,<br>
      Castrated me when I was seven days old,<br>
      This was the fruit of that kamma<br>
      Because I had seduced others wives.&quot;<br>
      -- (Therigatha 437)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At death he was reborn as a sheep, the offspring of a
    lame, one-eyed ewe. He lived in misery for twelve years, infected with intestinal worms,
    obliged to transport children and pull the plough and cart with hardly any rest. Hard work
    was what the frivolous goldsmith had avoided and hard work was what he now had to endure
    as a beast of burden. He had been castrated by his owner and his life was a misery of
    intense, hard work with loss of sight in his latter years.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After being in the animal realm for two births he was
    reborn in the human world as a cross between a male and a female. He was the child of a
    slave girl born in the gutter. He led a solitary life of suffering, shunned by both males
    and females and was treated as a freak.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In his next birth he (the former goldsmith) was reborn as
    a female. He had now become a woman, the object of his former desire. The woman&#146;s
    father was a good-for-nothing carter who failed at every endeavour. He gave his daughter
    to a rich merchant to pay his debts. Despite her pleas she found herself taken into the
    merchant&#146;s household as a slave girl. She was sixteen years old and an attractive
    girl. After some time, the son of the household fell in love with her, and took her as his
    second wife. Naturally, the first wife was most displeased with this arrangement. The
    slave girl, however, did everything in her power to strike discord between the husband and
    wife, as she liked her new position. This resulted in much fighting and quarrelling in the
    household until she finally succeeded in breaking up the marriage and separating the
    husband and his first wife.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fruits of her earlier unwholesome deeds as the
    goldsmith had been exhausted. But this new suffering she had caused had to bear fruit. The
    slave girl was reborn as Isidasi. In her previous birth she had caused disharmony and
    separated a husband and wife, causing great grief and suffering. She now had to suffer the
    contempt and rejection of every man she married. The text does not specify the meritorious
    deeds that she must have performed in her past, previous to her frivolous behaviour, but
    her compassion, calm acceptance and devotion to her husbands created the opportunity for
    the past good deeds to mature.With effort and diligence Isidasi attained Nibbana. She
    explained her final liberation as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This was the fruit of that past deed,<br>
      That although I served them like a slave,<br>
      They rejected me and went away;<br>
      Of that too I have made an end.&quot;<br>
      -- (Therigatha 447)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can all benefit from Isidasi&#146;s story. Over time,
    especially in the western world, moral values have deteriorated. Young men and women are
    very casual about sexual behaviour and the media and television have glorified sex through
    advertisements, movies and magazines. What was once considered immoral is now considered
    moral. Despite the ignorance of humankind, the law of kamma operates. The Buddha laid down
    a very simple moral code to follow regarding sexual behaviour. As Buddhists we are not
    only advised to refrain from adultery and rape, but we are cautioned against inappropriate
    sexual behaviour of any kind. This includes relationships with those under the
    guardianship of parents, relatives and friends and relationships with members of religious
    orders who have taken the vows of celibacy. Buddhists should not indulge in casual sex but
    should exercise restraint and ensure that they form meaningful, long-term relationships
    based on love and commitment before they give in to their desires. Buddhists should also
    actively work at preventing child abuse and the breaking up and disruption of marriages
    caused by casual relationships.</font></p>

    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">25. Sona</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the time of the Buddha there lived in Savatthi a woman
    named Sona who had ten children. She had spent her entire life occupied with the welfare
    of her children. She had enjoyed nursing them, feeding them, educating them and when they
    were older, finding suitable partners for them. Her whole life centred around her children
    and soon she was known as &#145;Sona with many children&#146;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sona&#146;s husband was a lay devotee of the Buddha. As
    his children were all married and his responsibilities reduced, he spent more and more
    time studying and practising the Dhamma. Before long he was totaly inspired by the
    Teachings. He decided to join the Holy Order. It was not easy for Sona to accept this
    decision, but instead of holding him back she decided that she too would lead a more
    religious life. With this in mind she divided up her wealth and land among her children
    and asked them to support her by providing her with the bare necessities of life. She then
    spent her time in religious activities as a lay devotee of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For some time all went well. Then, one by one, her
    children and their spouses began to feel that she was a burden to them. They had never
    really accepted their father&#146;s decision to join the Noble Order and they resented
    supporting their mother who was now spending most of her time in religious devotion.
    Forgetting how much she had done for them, they started quarrelling amongst thenselves on
    an equitable division of her support and care. They all felt that it had been an unfair
    arrangement in which each of them had to bear an unfair proportion of her support. To them
    the mother who had sacrificed so much became a nuisance and a burden.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This ungrateful treatment caused great suffering to Sona,
    who had sacrificed her entire life for her children. She became bitter and angry. She had
    expected her children to support her in her old age as was the custom in India. Having
    distributed her wealth among them she had no means to support herself. Disillusioned, she
    decided to seek solace from the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After listening to one of the Buddha&#146;s nuns, Sona
    began to analyze her feelings and disappointment in her children. Had she sacrificed her
    life for them and nurtured them selflessly or had she done it with expectation of return?
    Had she given unconditional love to her children? How did her feelings compare with the
    compassion and loving-kindness the Buddha advocated?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sona decided to join the Buddha&#146;s order of nuns to
    practise and develop selfless love and virtues. Following her husband&#146;s path, she
    became a nun. Before long, however, Sona realized that she had taken her old habits with
    her into the order. She was an old woman who was set in her ways. Joining the order had
    not changed her as a person. Often she was a target for criticism by younger nuns as she
    had difficulties in changing her ways. Sona realized that attaining spiritual purity was
    no easy task.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sona began to practise mindfulness and self-observation in
    earnest. She had to be aware of her emotions and weaknesses and discipline her mind.
    Because she had entered the order in her latter years Sona knew that she had to work with
    effort. She practised meditation with urgency, often passing the entire night in sitting
    and walking meditation. So as not to disturb others, she started to meditate in the lower
    hall in the dark by guiding herself with the pillars. Before long her determination and
    effort resulted in Sona attaining Arahanthship. She describes her attainment in her own
    words:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then the other Bhikkhunis<br>
      Left me alone in the convent.<br>
      They had given me instructions<br>
      To boil a cauldron of water.<br>
      Having fetched the water<br>
      I poured it into the cauldron.<br>
      I put the cauldron on the stove and sat,<br>
      Then my mind became composed.<br>
      I saw the aggregates as impermanent,<br>
      I saw them as suffering and not self.<br>
      Having expelled all cankers from my heart,<br>
      Right there I attained Arahanthship.&quot;<br>
      -- ( Apadana 234-236)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the other nuns retuned they asked Sona for the hot
    water and she realized that she had not as yet boiled it. Using the supernormal powers
    that she now possessed and the fire element Sona heated the water and offered it to the
    nuns, who reported her extraordinary feat to the Buddha. The Buddha declared Sona as
    foremost among the nuns who put forth great effort and praised her effort and attainment
    by saying:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Though one should live a hundred years<br>
      As a lazy, sluggish person,<br>
      Better it is to live a single day<br>
      Firmly arousing one&#146;s energy.&quot;<br>
      -- (Dhammapada 112)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sona describes her life in the Therigatha as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I bore ten children in this body,<br>
      In this physical frame of mine.<br>
      Then when I was old and frail,<br>
      I went up to a Bhikkhuni.<br>
      She gave me a discourse on the Teaching,<br>
      On the aggregates, sense bases, elements.<br>
      Having heard the Dhamma discourses from her,<br>
      I shaved my hair and then went forth.<br>
      Whilst still a probationer,<br>
      I purified the divine eye.<br>
      Now I know my past abodes,<br>
      Where it is that I lived before.<br>
      With one-pointed mind well composed,<br>
      I developed the sinless state.<br>
      Immediately I was released,<br>
      Quenched with the end of clinging.<br>
      The five aggregates are well understood,<br>
      They stand cut off at the root.<br>
      Fie on you, O wretched aging,<br>
      Now there is no more re-becoming.&quot;<br>
      -- (Therigatha 102-106)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sona&#146;s story is one from which we can all learn.
    Children who read this should reflect on their responsibilities to their parents. Our
    parents took care of us when we were too young to take care of ourselves, taught us right
    from wrong and showed us the Dhamma. The Buddha said that even if we carried our parents
    on our shoulders for our entire lifetime (shoulder the responsibility of their care and
    comfort) we would not be able to settle the obligation we owe them for what they have
    done. The effects of what one does to one&#146;s parents have forceful results. Both the
    wholesome and unwholesome deeds we perform towards our parents have serious consequences.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For parents there is much to learn from Sona. We do not
    own our children. How can we, when we do not even own ourselves? Children should fulfill
    their obligations to their parents. We should show them by example. But bringing up
    children in Western society is even more difficult than bringing them up in the East. If
    our children don&#146;t fulfil their duties we must remember that the Buddha said that we
    are our own saviours. Nothing is gained by reflecting on their omissions and getting
    bitter and angry. But much can be gained by disciplining ourselves and purifying our own
    minds. The cause of suffering &#150; craving lies within us. All we can do is to ensure
    that we have done our best for our children. We cannot save them just as they cannot save
    us. In the end each of us is our own saviour.</font></p>
