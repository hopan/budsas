    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">10. Anuruddha</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anuruddha<b> </b>was one of Prince Siddhattha&#146;s
    cousins. His father, who was named Amitodana, was a younger brother of King Suddhodana.
    Amitodana had two consorts. Anuruddha, his brother, Mahanama and his sister, Rohini, were
    born from one consort. Ananda, who later became the Buddha&#146;s personal attendant, was
    the son of the other consort. As such Ananda was Anuruddha&#146;s step-brother.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anuruddha was brought up in immense luxury. His mother,
    who adored him, ensured that all his wishes were fulfilled. The following story
    illustrates the luxury he enjoyed. One day Anuruddha, who was playing marbles with his
    friends, decided to bet on his winning the game. He promised fresh cakes to whoever could
    beat him at marbles. Luck was against him. Again and again he lost to his friends. Each
    time he sent a message home to his mother asking for cakes, which she lovingly provided.
    Finally the message came back that there was no cake. Anuruddha, who had always had
    everything he wanted, thought that this was a new type of cake and sent a message back
    asking his mother to send the no-cake to pay off his debt.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Sakyan princes began giving up their royal lineage to
    follow the Buddha, Mahanama, the older of King Amitodana&#146;s sons, felt that either
    Anuruddha or he should follow in the footsteps of their Great Cousin. He called his
    younger brother and asked him if he would like to be ordained under the Buddha. Anuruddha,
    however, was too attached to sense pleasure. He was well-known for his love of dance,
    music and luxuries. Anuruddha felt that the homeless life would be too harsh for someone
    brought up in the lap of luxury. Mahanama, however, convinced his brother by describing
    the trials he would face when conducting the duties and responsibilities he had as a
    nobleman. When Anuruddha realized that he would have many responsibilities to fulfill if
    he were to take the place of his older brother and endless rounds of rebirth in samsara
    where he would toil embroiled in suffering, he decided to renounce his life of luxury. He
    went to his mother and asked her permission to be ordained under the Sakyan Sage.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His mother, who wanted to keep both her sons with her,
    refused. Thinking that his friend who was heir to the throne would never give up his royal
    heritage, she informed Anuruddha that he could go if his friend Bhaddiya went with him.
    Anuruddha spoke to his friend to convince him to join the order. Bhaddiya refused, as the
    glory of being a future king was more appealing to him. Anuruddha did not give up. Little
    by little he broke down the defences of his friend. First Bhaddiya agreed to join the Holy
    Order in seven years. On further insistence and pleading, Bhaddiya reduced the time until
    finally he agreed to leave in seven days as it would take that long for him to settle his
    affairs and hand over the succession of the position of viceroy to his successor. On
    hearing of their decision Anuruddha&#146;s step-brother, Ananda, their cousin, Devadatta,
    and two other Sakyan princes, Kimbila and Bhagu, decided to join them. The princes,
    together with the court barber, Upali, left the palace under the pretence of going to the
    pleasure gardens.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After travelling for some distance the princes handed
    their royal jewels and rich clothes to Upali and donned the simple robes of ascetics. They
    then instructed Upali to return to the palace with the message that the Sakyan princes had
    left to join the order of the Noble Ones under the great Sakyan Sage, the Buddha. Upali,
    however, was afraid that the Sakyans, who were a very fierce warrior race, would not
    believe him. He felt that he would be killed, as the Sakyans would think that he, Upali,
    had robbed and killed the young princes. He asked permission to go with them to be
    ordained under the Buddha. The princes agreed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Together, they proceeded to where the Buddha was residing
    and asked to be ordained. The Sakyan princes, who were well-known for their pride and
    arrogance, asked the Buddha to ordain Upali, the barber who had attended them for a long
    time, first, so that he would then be senior to them. As such they would have to pay
    obeisance and respect to Upali, which would help to subdue their Sakyan pride. The Buddha
    complied to their request.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before long Anuruddha developed the divine eye &#150; the
    ability to see beyond the range of the physical eye. He could survey one thousand world
    systems (the Buddha could see, and spoke of ten thousand world systems). These world
    systems could be compared to modern-day galaxies. The Buddha said that each world system
    contained 31 planes of existence in which there were 31 different life forms, and of such
    world systems He viewed ten thousand. Anuruddha, however, developed his divine eye only to
    the extent where he could view one thousand world systems. He also had the ability to see
    into the past births of others and to see their place of rebirth after death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The development of the divine eye is mundane in character.
    It can be developed without reaching any of the four stages of spiritual development
    &#150; Sotapanna, Sakadagami, Anagami or Arahanthship. In fact, Anuruddha achieved it
    prior to obtaining the first stage of sainthood. As such it can be achieved by an
    unliberated worldling. The divine eye can be developed by one who has reached the fourth
    stage of mental absorption (Jhana) and takes this meditation further as described in The
    Path of Purification (Visudhimagga). Anuruddha often taught this skill to his students.
    His verses relate his experience thus:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In fivefold concentration rapt,<br>
      The mind in peace and unified,<br>
      Inner tranquillity I gained<br>
      And thus was purified my eye divine.<br>
      In fivefold Jhanas standing firm<br>
      I knew the passing and rebirth of beings,<br>
      Their coming and their going I perceived,<br>
      Their life in this world and beyond.<br>
      -- (Theragatha, 916-917)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Despite this achievement Anuruddha had difficulties in
    reaching Arahanthship. His spiritual development, however, helped him to live in harmony
    with two other monks, Kimbila and Nandiya. These three lived alone in concentration in the
    Eastern Bamboo Park and met every fifth night to discuss the Dhamma. The harmony that
    existed between these monks became legendary. The Buddha once asked Anuruddha how he lived
    in peace and harmony with his two companions. Anuruddha replied, &quot;In deed, words and
    thoughts I maintain loving kindness towards these venerable ones in public and in private
    thinking. Why should I not set aside what I want to do and do only what they want to do?
    We are different in body, Venerable Sir, but one in mind&quot;. The Buddha praised their
    harmony and held them as an example to other monks to strengthen the unity of the Sangha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then questioned Anuruddha on his difficulties
    in obtaining liberation. Anuruddha explained that he had reached a higher state of
    concentration in which he perceived an inner light and radiance but that the vision of
    light and radiance disappeared very soon and he did not understand the reason.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Describing from His own experience the Buddha then
    explained the eleven imperfections or hindrances that may arise and how to overcome them.
    Anuruddha followed the Buddha&#146;s advice and developed further and further in refined
    meditative perceptions. He did not, however, reach Arahanthship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day Anuruddha visited Sariputta and said,
    &quot;Brother Sariputta, with the divine eye I am able to perceive a thousand-fold world
    systems. My energy is strong, my mindfulness is alert and unconfused, my body is collected
    and unified. Yet my mind is not freed without clinging from the defiling taints&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta replied, &quot;When you think, Brother
    Anuruddha, that with your divine eye you can see a thousand-fold world systems, that is
    self-conceit. When you think of your strenuous energy, your alert mindfulness, your calm
    body and your concentrated mind, that is agitation. When you think your mind is still not
    liberated from taints, that is scruples in you. Discard these three things. Do not pay
    attention to them. Instead, direct the mind towards the deathless.&quot; Anuruddha again
    went into solitude and directed his mind in earnest to remove these obstructions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, perceiving that Anuruddha was close to
    enlightenment but that he needed further instruction, appeared before him in form made by
    mind. The Buddha&#146;s instruction to Anuruddha on the non-diffused helped him reach
    perfection. An hour after the attainment he proclaimed the following:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He knew my heart&#146;s intent, the Master,<br>
      He whose peer the world has not seen.<br>
      He came to me by mystic power, <br>
      With body wrought by mind.<br>
      To me when further Truths I wished to learn,<br>
      The Buddha (this last Truth) revealed:<br>
      He who delights in freedom from diffuseness,<br>
      That freedom from diffuseness taught to me.<br>
      And I who heard the blessed Dhamma dwelt,<br>
      Constantly intent to keep His rule,<br>
      The Threefold Wisdom have I made my own,<br>
      And all the Buddha&#146;s ordinance is done</i>.&quot;<br>
      <i>-- (Theragatha, 901-903)</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of Anuruddha&#146;s development of the divine eye
    the Buddha declared that he was foremost among the monks who had developed the divine eye.
    Anuruddha had aspired to be foremost in the development of the divine eye one hundred
    thousand world cycles ago, at the time of the Padumuttara Buddha. On seeing the Buddha
    Padumuttara appoint one of His monks as foremost in the divine eye and being inspired by
    the character and qualities of the monk, Anuruddha decided that he would like to have such
    a position under a future Buddha. With this in mind he performed many meritorious deeds
    and aspired to be foremost in the divine eye under a future Buddha. The Padumuttara
    Buddha, seeing that Anuruddha&#146;s aspiration would be fulfilled, announced that he
    would be foremost in the divine eye at the time of the Gotama Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the passing away of the Padumuttara Buddha,
    Anuruddha approached the monk and asked him what meritorious acts he should perform to
    attain such a position. The monk then instructed him to light many lamps in the shrine
    that held the relics of the Padumuttara Buddha and to aspire that as these lamps dispelled
    the darkness, shedding light to the surrounding area so that others could see, may he
    develop the divine eye to view the many world systems and divine beings. The Theragatha
    states that at the time of the Buddha Kassapa, Anuruddha had lit butter lamps to honour
    the grave of the Kassapa Buddha and had renewed his aspiration. These and many other
    meritorious acts that Anuruddha performed led to the fulfilment of his aspiration at the
    time of the Gotama Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Twenty-three accounts of Anuruddha&#146;s past lives have
    been documented in the Jataka (birth stories of the Buddha). Fifteen of these births were
    in the celestial realms, thirteen of which were as Sakka, the leader of the Tavatimsa
    heaven. It was Anuruddha as Sakka who dressed up as an old Brahmin to test the Bodhisatta
    further by asking for His wife, the princess Maddi, in the Vessantara Jataka. Twice as
    Sakka, Anuruddha saved the Bodhisatta&#146;s life when He was in danger. It was also
    Anuruddha as Sakka who showed the Bodhisatta the celestial and hellish worlds in the
    Guttila Jataka. In the seven earthly past life stories he was often an ascetic. Only one
    past life story documents birth as an animal (wood pigeon). Anuruddha&#146;s strength of
    character, his loyalty and his compassion to others are illustrated over and over again in
    these stories. In many births he had been of help to the Bodhisatta. The Theragatha also
    documents some of his former lives. Anuruddha, who could see into his past births,
    described some of them as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I know my former lives, and where and how<br>
      I lived in years gone by: among the Gods of the Thirty-Three (Tavatimasa heaven)<br>
      I stood of Sakka&#146;s rank. <br>
      Seven times a king of men I held my sway,<br>
      Lord of the earth from end to end foursquare,<br>
      A conqueror, of Jambudipa (India) chief,<br>
      Using no force or arms I ruled by right.<br>
      Thence seven. And another seven spans of life,<br>
      Fourteen former births I recognize,<br>
      Even then in the worlds of gods reborn</i>.&quot;<br>
      <i>-- (Theragatha 913-915)</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anuruddha outlived the Buddha and was instrumental in
    ensuring that the wishes of the divine beings were met at the Buddha&#146;s funeral. When
    the Buddha passed away Maha Brahma (the Brahmin creator God) and Sakka (ruler of the
    Tavatimsa Heaven) honoured the Buddha in verses evoking the law of impermanence to console
    the grieving Brahmas and Devas. The third to speak was Anuruddha, who consoled the
    grieving with the following words:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No movement of breath, but with steadfast heart,<br>
      Desireless and tranquil comes the Sage to His end.<br>
      With heart unshaken by any painful feelings,<br>
      Like a flame extinguished, His mind released.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anuruddha also encouraged and helped Ananda to attain
    Arahanthship prior to the First Sangha Council. Anuruddha was in charge of the Angutttara
    Nikaya at the first council. He passed away at Veluva in the Vajjian land with the
    following prediction of his oncoming death:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;The Buddha has my loyalty and love, <br>
      And all of the Buddha&#146;s Law is done.<br>
      Low have I laid the heavy load I bore,<br>
      Cause for rebirth is found in me no more.</i><br>
      <i>In Veluva, in Vajjian land, it will be<br>
      That life will reach its final term for me;<br>
      And I beneath the bamboo-thicket&#146;s shade that day,<br>
      Free from all taints shall wholly pass away.&quot;<br>
      -- (Theragatha 918-919)</i></font><b></p>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">11. Maha Kaccana</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the district of Ujjeni, in the capital city of Avanti,
    there lived a Brahmin couple of the Kaccayana clan named Tiritavaccha and Candima. As the
    Kaccayana clan was one of the oldest and most respected Brahmin clans they were very
    well-known and respected. They had a son whom they named Kancana (one with golden hue)
    because of his unusually golden skin. Kancana studied the Brahmanic Vedas and when he came
    of age replaced his father as court chaplain.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king whom he served was known as Candapajjota, or
    &#145;Pajjota the Violent&#146; due to his explosive temper. When the king heard that a
    Blessed One had arisen in the world a desire arose in him to see the Buddha. He requested
    his chaplain to invite the Buddha to Avanti as his guest. Kancana agreed to invite the
    Buddha if the King gave him permission to be ordained as a monk.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With the king&#146;s permission Kancana and seven other
    courtiers left Avanti and set out for Savatthi, where the Buddha was residing. Inspired by
    the Buddha&#146;s teaching, all eight attained Arahanthship together with the four
    analytical knowledges and were ordained as monks. Kancana was known as Kaccana after
    ordination. Kaccana enumerated the scenic beauty of Ujjeni to the Buddha, with the
    intention of inviting Him to visit Avanti. The Buddha, realizing that Kaccana was quite
    capable of inspiring the king, his ministers and townsfolk, asked Kaccana to return to
    Avanti with the former courtiers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the way back the eight monks stopped overnight at a
    city named Telapanali. In this city lived two beautiful maidens. One was a rich girl who
    had lost all her hair due to a disease. The other was a girl who had become impoverished
    after her parents&#146; death. The poor girl, who lived with her former governess, had
    thick, beautiful, long hair, which was the envy of the rich girl. The rich girl had
    repeatedly offered to buy the lustrous hair of the poor girl for a considerable amount of
    money, to make a wig. The poor girl, however, had refused her offer.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the poor girl saw the serene monks on their alms
    round there arose a longing in her to offer them a meal. Not having the necessary means,
    she cut off her hair and sold it to the rich girl. Using the money, she bought the items
    required to make a delicious meal and prepared food for the eight monks. So great was her
    devotion and happiness in this gift that the effect of her wholesome deed was instant. Her
    hair grew back in all its splendour to its original length.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Kaccana returned to Avanti, he informed the king of
    this incident. The king then requested that the girl be brought to Avanti and made her his
    chief consort. After this incident King Pajjota had great confidence in Kaccana. Before
    long Avanti was a single blaze of saffron robes as ministers and townsfolk embraced the
    Buddha&#146;s Teaching and entered the Noble Order. The queen, who was deeply grateful to
    the elder for her good fortune, built for him a monastery in the Golden Grove Park.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha used two methods of teaching for His monks.
    Often he began with a short verse, on which he then elaborated with well-organised
    examples and similes, and then concluded by linking it back to the opening verse by
    summarizing the deep contents of His message. At times, however, He gave a short message
    full of deep meaning, on which He did not elaborate, as He wanted His Sangha to reflect on
    the message and ascertain its meaning through examination and contemplation. The more
    spiritually advanced met this challenge with enthusiasm, as it stretched their minds and
    helped them to grow. But at times the novice monks could not discern the meaning of His
    words. The novice monks then approached Kaccana and asked him to explain the Buddha&#146;s
    words. Kaccana then elaborated on the teaching and explained it in a manner that was
    understood by the less advanced members of the Sangha. The Buddha, when informed of
    Kaccana&#146;s explanation, consistently praised him for his interpretation by saying that
    He Himself would have given exactly the same answer had the question been put to Him.
    Because of Kaccana&#146;s analytical, organised mind and his ability to penetrate the
    Dhamma and then simplify the message in a manner that was easy to understand, the Buddha
    declared him as foremost among the monks who elaborated on short verses taught by Him.
    Kaccana was known as Maha Kaccana to distinguish him from other monks who had the same
    Brahmanic name.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As with the other titles that the Buddha gave to His
    Sangha, this appointment was not a chance happening. The aspiration and meritorious deeds
    that led to this appointment were sown many aeons ago at the time of the Padumuttara
    Buddha. At that time Kaccana was born to a wealthy family and saw the Padumuttara Buddha
    appoint a Bhikkhu as foremost among monks who explain in detail short verses declared by
    Him. Kaccana was inspired by the Bhikkhu&#146;s ability and a strong desire arose in him
    to strive for a similar title at the time of a future Buddha. Inviting the Buddha and His
    retinue of monks to his home for a week, he provided them with alms and necessities. He
    then built a stupa with a seat, which he had inlaid with gold and fitted with a jewelled
    parasol, for the Buddha Padumuttara.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kaccana then prostrated himself respectfully in front of
    the Buddha and aspired to be the foremost monk who explained in detail short verses
    declared by a future Buddha. The Buddha Padumuttara, seeing that Kaccana&#146;s aspiration
    would be fulfilled, prophesied that at the time of the Gotama Buddha, 100,000 aeons into
    the future, he would be born to a Brahmin family by the name of Kaccana and be declared as
    the monk foremost in explaining in detail the short verses declared by the Buddha Gotama.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha Padumuttara also made other prophesies about
    Kaccana&#146;s future births. He declared that as a result of his meritorious deeds
    Kaccana would be the Lord of the Gods for 30 aeons. He would then return to the human
    world as a world monarch named Pabhassara. Kaccana continued in samsara performing
    meritorious deeds and renewing his aspiration until he was reborn as Kancana in the
    Kaccayana clan to fulfil his aspiration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The text also indicates the origin of his unusually
    beautiful, golden complexion. Shortly after the Parinibbana of the Kassapa Buddha (the
    Buddha who preceded our Gotama Buddha), Kaccana had donated a golden brick to make a stupa
    in the name of the Kassapa Buddha and had made a wish to have a golden hue like the gold
    he had donated whenever he was reborn. This wish had resulted in Kaccana&#146;s skin
    having an unusually beautiful, golden hue.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Maha Kaccana made an invaluable contribution to the
    preservation of the Dhamma. His lucid explanations of deep subjects have been carefully
    documented and as such helped not only the contemporaries of the Buddha but following
    generations. The text documents well his role as a great teacher. His primary role,
    however, was to elaborate on the statements made by the Buddha. Compared to the other
    great disciples there are only a few recorded instances where he taught the Dhamma to one
    person individually. His explanations and teachings are clear and to the point, using an
    analytical approach as opposed to using similes and examples.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kaccana begins with a short utterance of the Buddha. He
    then goes on to explain in detail its hidden meaning. Eight Suttas found in the Nikayas,
    three in the Majjhima Nikaya, three in the Samutta Nikaya and two in the Anguttara Nikaya,
    are especially noteworthy. There are also in the Nikayas some teachings which are directly
    attributed to Maha Kaccana. These teachings have a distinctive flavour revealing the mind
    from which they were born. They are thorough, well-rounded, balanced and meticulous. Often
    Kaccana explains the essence of the verse with only a few words.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A few examples of Kaccana&#146;s skill in explaining the
    deep meaning of the Buddha&#146;s words and the Buddha&#146;s praise of his skills follow:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day when the Buddha was seated in meditation in the
    Nigrodha park in Kapillavatthu, an arrogant Sakyan named Dandapani approached Him and
    asked in a discourteous tone, &quot;What does the recluse assert? What does he
    proclaim?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, realizing well Dandapani&#146;s quarrelsome
    nature and intention, replied:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Friend, I assert and proclaim such (a teaching)
      that one does not quarrel with anyone in the world, with its gods, with its maras and its
      Brahmas in this generation, with its recluses, Brahmins, its princes and its people; such
      that perceptions no more underlie that Brahmins who abide detached from sensual pleasures,
      without perplexity, free of worry, free from craving, for any kind of being</i>.&quot;
      (Majjhima Nikaya)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This reply was totally incomprehensible to Dandapani, who
    left, subdued. One monk who had not understood the meaning of the Buddha&#146;s words
    inquired as to what exactly the Blessed One&#146;s teaching was whereby one can avoid all
    quarrels and at the same time be free from the influence of craving.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha&#146;s deep reply was:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Bhikkhus, as to the source through which
      perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation beset a person, if nothing is found
      to delight in, welcome, and hold to, this is the end of the underlying tendencies to lust,
      aversion, views, doubt, conceit, the desire for being, and ignorance; this is the end of
      reliance on rods and weapons, of quarrels, brawls, disputes, recriminations, malice, and
      false speech; here these evil, unwholesome states cease without remainder.&quot; (Majjhima
      Nikaya)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The monks, however, could not comprehend the Buddha&#146;s
    words. As the Buddha had retired to His quarters they did not want to question Him
    further. Instead, they approached Maha Kaccana and asked him for an explanation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Maha Kaccana first informed them that it was the Buddha to
    whom they should go, for it was He who could best answer their questions. He reminded the
    monks that coming to him when the Buddha was present was like seeking heartwood among the
    branches and leaves of a tree when the trunk was present. Upon being told the
    circumstances, he explained the words of the Buddha which emanated from the doctrine of
    dependent origination, as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Dependent on the eye (and other sense organs),
    eye-consciousness (and other forms of sense consciousness), occur. The meeting of the
    three is contact. With contact as condition, there is feeling. What one feels one
    perceives. What one perceives one thinks about. What one thinks about one mentally
    propagates. With what one has mentally propagated as the source, perceptions and notions
    (conditioning activities) tinged by mental propagation, beset a person with respect to
    past, future and present forms cognisable through the eye. The same pattern is repeated
    for each of the sense organs.&quot; The elder then expanded and linked it with the
    teaching of the Doctrine of Dependent Origination and explained to the monks how
    everything is conditionally dependent on the preceding condition and ceases with the
    cessation of the preceding condition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Maha Kaccana Bhaddekaratta Sutta from the Majjhima
    Nikaya also illustrates Maha Kaccana&#146;s gift in explaining the complex. A Bhikkhu
    named Samiddhi approached the Buddha and requested Him to dispense the Bhaddekaratta
    Sutta, which was in general known by memory to all the monks. The Buddha responded by
    saying:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Let not a person revive the past<br>
      Or on the future build his hopes,<br>
      For the past has been left behind<br>
      And the future has not been reached.<br>
      Instead with insight let him see<br>
      Each presently arisen state;<br>
      Let him know that and be sure of it,<br>
      Invincibly, unshakeably.<br>
      Today the effort must be made;<br>
      Tomorrow death may come, who knows?<br>
      No bargain with Mortality can<br>
      Keep him and his hordes away.<br>
      But one who dwells thus ardently<br>
      Relentlessly by day and night &#151;<br>
      It is he the Peaceful Sage has said,<br>
      Who has one fortunate attachment.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then arose and retired to His chambers.
    Samiddhi did not understand the Buddha&#146;s poem, but he did not want to disturb Him.
    Approaching Maha Kaccana, Samiddhi saluted him respectfully and asked him the meaning of
    the poem.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After reminding Samiddhi that it was not appropriate that
    he should come to him when the Buddha was in residence, Kaccana took the first two lines
    of the poem and explained them by way of the six sense bases.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Starting with the sense base of the eye, he said,
    &quot;One revives the past when one recollects the eye and the forms seen in the past,
    dwelling upon them with desire and lust. One builds up hope on the future when one sets
    one&#146;s heart to experiencing future sense objects that one has not as yet encountered.
    One who does not bind himself to desire and lust resulting from past memories of sensory
    experience and yearnings for future sensory experiences is one who does not revive the
    past or build up hope on the future. Similarly, one whose mind is shackled by lust to the
    present sense faculties and their objects is one vanquished in regard to presently risen
    states, while one who is not bound by lust to the present sense faculties is called one
    invincible in regard to presently arisen states. The elder then repeated the above
    explanation using each of the other sense bases.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this manner, using simple language, the elder advised
    the monks not to be attached to sense objects of the past, present and future. Instead, to
    strive with insight to observe the impermanence of all phenomena because death could
    strike anyone at any time. And one could not bargain with death. Maha Kaccana thus
    encouraged Samidhi not to waste a moment but to strive on with diligence to experience
    insight.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Later, when the monks told the Buddha of Maha
    Kaccana&#146;s explanation, He praised the elder by saying that if He had been questioned,
    He too would have answered in the same manner.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Maha Kaccana also used his analytical abilities and
    organization skills to teach the Dhamma. The Majjhima Nikaya has a very interesting
    dialogue between the elder and King Avantiputta of Madhura, who was the grandson of King
    Candappajjoti of Avanti. Once when Maha Kaccana was residing in Madhura, King Avantiputta,
    having heard of his fame, approached the elder and questioned him. His question, however,
    was not a complex question from the higher teaching. It was a topic of importance that was
    weighing heavily on the Brahmins who thought that they were the superior ones chosen by
    Maha Brahma, their creator God. The noble caste rulers had established their supremacy
    over the entire Indian nation by claiming that they were the fairest caste, the purified,
    the sons of Brahma, His offspring &#150; born of Brahma, created by Brahma, heirs of
    Brahma. At the time of the Buddha, the Brahmins had succeeded in establishing their
    supremacy over the whole Indian social system by declaring that those born to the Brahmin
    caste, to a Brahmin family, were the direct descendants of Maha Brahma, the title given to
    the creator God. They were the chosen people. They were the undisputed leaders and
    nobility. The Buddha, however, had denounced the degrading caste system and declared that
    it was not by birth that one was a Brahmin (nobleman), but by deeds. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Avantiputta&#146;s question to Maha Kaccana, who was
    from a very old, well-respected, and high-caste Brahmin family, had far-reaching,
    significant importance. The king attempted to justify this drive for power by appealing to
    the divinely ordained status, in keeping with the Brahmanic beliefs. He questioned the
    elder, who himself was of pedigreed Brahmin caste, about the supremacy of the Brahmins.
    The Elder then corrected his false views by saying:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The claim of the Brahmins is just a saying in the
    world &#150; one with no divine sanction at all.&quot; Then, to prove his point further,
    the elder elaborated on his claim by saying: &quot;Anyone of any social class who gains
    wealth can command the labour of those of other castes. Even a menial could enrol a
    Brahmin in his service. One of any caste who violates the principles of morality could be
    reborn in hell (Devadatta and King Ajatasattu) while one of any caste who observes the
    principles of morality and generosity could be reborn in a happy realm (Laja). One of any
    caste who breaks the law will be punished. One of any caste who renounces the world and
    becomes an ascetic will receive homage and respect (Sunita and Upali).&quot; The Elder
    continued to conclude that these four castes (in existence at that time) were all the
    same, that there was no difference, no divine sanction in them at all.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the end of the discussion King Avantiputta expressed
    his appreciation by saying, &quot;I go to Master Maha Kaccana for my refuge, I go to the
    Dhamma for my refuge, I go to the Sangha for my refuge.&quot; Maha Kaccana corrected him
    by saying, &quot;Do not come to me for refuge. Go to the Fully Enlightened One, to whom I
    too go for refuge. When the king inquired as to the whereabouts of the Buddha, the elder
    informed him that the Blessed One had already attained Parinibbana, leading us to the
    conclusion that this discussion occurred after the passing away of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not only was Maha Kaccana honoured and respected by the
    Sangha and lay disciples, he was also well-respected and honoured by the gods. Monks
    usually dispersed to various cities and monasteries for the rainy season. At the end of
    the rainy season they gathered at an assembly that was held by the Buddha to advise the
    monks and to admonish them for any indiscretions. Many monks travelled back to wherever
    the Buddha was residing for this assembly. Maha Kaccana was no exception. Often travelling
    from afar, he ensured that he was present for the after-rains assembly. The other elders,
    accustomed to seeing Maha Kaccana, kept a seat for him in the assembly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one such occasion Sakka, the king of the Tavatimsa
    Heaven, together with a large retinue, descended to earth to pay homage and respect to the
    great disciples. On noticing that Maha Kaccana was absent, Sakka thought to himself,
    &quot;It would be good if the Noble Elder were to arrive so that I can pay respect to
    him&quot;. Just then Maha Kaccana entered the assembly and sat down in the seat prepared
    for him. Overwhelmed with joy, Sakka dropped to his knees and, grasping the elder&#146;s
    feet, paid homage to him by bowing low. He then showered him with garlands and incense.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Novice monks were affronted as to why Sakka had singled
    out Maha Kaccana for special homage. The Buddha, however, reproved them by saying that
    those monks, like Maha Kaccana, who guarded the sense doors (to ensure no unwholesome
    deeds were performed), were beloved by both gods and humans. He then declared:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Even the Devas hold him dear,<br>
      Whose senses are subdued.<br>
      Like horses trained well by a charioteer,<br>
      Whose pride is destroyed,<br>
      And who is free from corruptions.&quot;<br>
      -- (Dhmmapada 94)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this manner the Buddha assured His disciples that one
    did not have to resort to prayers to obtain favours from the gods. The Devas enjoyed
    favouring and honouring those who practised the virtues and kept the precepts of morality.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Maha Kaccana assisted many novice monks and lay devotees
    to understand the complex teachings. His keen mind, analytical abilities, and
    organizational skills helped many of the less spiritually advanced to grasp the deep
    teachings of the Buddha. Maha Kaccana was declared by the Buddha to be foremost among the
    monks who explained in detail brief statements proclaimed by the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">12. Bakkula</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the time of the Gotama Buddha, in the city of Kosabhe,
    there lived a wealthy, high-caste merchant and his wife. After some time the wife
    conceived and the couple was blessed with a beautiful baby son on whom they lavished all
    their love and affection. As they lived close to the river Yamuna, the baby was taken to
    the river by his nurse for his daily bath.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The river Yamuna was a deep, wide river with shallow banks
    and swiftly-flowing water. The nurse was bathing the young baby when she was terrified by
    a large fish that was swimming towards her. In her haste to get out of the water she lost
    the baby. Wading into the river she tried to swim after the precious child. The current,
    however, was swift. She watched in horror as the child was taken further and further from
    her reach, towards the large fish.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many miles down the river was a fishing village. The men
    who fished in the Yamuna river were excited, for their nets had drawn a very large fish.
    Hauling in their nets with difficulty, they took the large fish which was thrashing about
    to the home of the wealthiest resident, who had a large household with many servants.
    Knowing that only the rich could afford such a large fish they sold it to the merchant,
    who had no children. The fish was taken to the kitchen, but the cook was reluctant to cut
    the unusually large and beautiful fish. Deciding to serve it whole, he carefully opened it
    by inserting his knife along its side. The cook was greatly surprised to find a young
    baby, still alive, in the stomach of the fish. Running to his mistress, he handed the
    beautiful baby to her. The woman, who had no children, was filled with joy at the sight of
    the baby, and decided to bring him up as her own.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The unusual story of the child&#146;s beginning soon
    spread throughout the village. Many came to see the beautiful baby who was regarded as a
    miracle child. Before long the news spread upriver to the grieving parents who were still
    in deep sorrow due to the loss of their son. Suspecting that it could be their child, they
    visited the fishing village to examine the baby. Recognizing the baby as her own, the
    birth mother asked for the custody of her child. However, the new mother, who had brought
    up the child with love, was too attached to the baby to part with it. Unable to settle the
    dispute on their own, the two families took their grievance to the king. The king heard
    both sides of the story and gave both families joint custody of the child, who was renamed
    Bakkula meaning &#145;two castes&#146;. Bakkula had the unique privilege of claiming
    lineage from two very wealthy, high-caste Brahmin families. He grew up in the midst of
    extreme luxury and love from both sets of parents. He had the best available education and
    took turns living with both sets of parents. As he came of age his parents arranged a
    marriage to a beautiful girl.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The aspiration made many eons ago had to be fulfilled. As
    he grew older Bakkula was inspired by the teachings of the Gotama Buddha. He decided to
    join the Buddha&#146;s Noble Order. Eight days later he attained the supreme bliss of
    Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The monks soon noticed a strange phenomenon regarding
    Bakkula. Not only was he as knowledgable as any physician, he was also exceptionally
    healthy, never succumbing to sickness despite the fact that he often tended the sick
    monks. Bakkula was also well- known for his remarkable memory. Similarly to the chief
    disciples of the Buddha, Sariputta and Moggallana and his former wife, Yasodara, Bakkula
    could recall his past births over infinite periods of time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha appointed Bakkula as the monk foremost in good
    health and longevity. Bakkula entered the noble order at the age of eighty and led the
    life of a householder for eighty years and the life of a monk for 80 years. To understand
    the cause of his remarkable memory and his longevity one needs to go back many, many years
    into the past.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One hundred thousand world cycles and one infinite period
    ago, a Supreme Buddha named Anomadassi reigned over India. Having realized the timeless
    Four Noble Truths and the Doctrine of Dependent Origination, the Anomadassi Buddha,
    together with His Chief Disciples, Nisabha and Anoma, taught the Buddha Dhamma for the
    benefit of mankind and gods. The Anomadassi Buddha, who was travelling through villages
    and cities preaching the Dhamma, was in a monastery in a beautiful grove of flowering
    trees near a huge rock formation known as Sobitha when he was stricken with grave illness.
    Enduring His pain and discomfort with the strength of His mind, the Anomadassi Buddha
    continued His noble mission of helping mankind eradicate all suffering by showing them the
    path to emancipation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At this time a young man who was skilled in his studies,
    not content with his education, turned to searching for truth. Giving up his household
    life he took to the life of an ascetic. Before long he attained the mental ecstasies
    (Jhana). Inspired by the teachings of the Anomadassi Buddha, he entered the Noble Order.
    However, despite his effort he did not attain enlightenment. Seeing the Buddha Anomadassi
    and diagnosing His illness, the young monk requested permission to treat His ailment. He
    then combed the area, obtained the necessary herbs and roots, and prepared the medicine
    required for treatment. Offering the medicine to the Anomadassi Buddha with devotion and
    compassion, he tended to the Buddha&#146;s needs and restored Him back to health. He then
    aspired for long life and good health in all his future births in samsara (cycle of birth
    and death). Realizing that he required more effort and meritorious deeds to attain
    emancipation, he continued to perform meritorious deeds. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Anomadassi Buddha looked into the future and
    prophesied that the young monk would be reborn in the Brahma realms for many world cycles,
    after which he would return to the human world as a royal monarch. He would then enjoy the
    comforts of a royal monarch for many births. Throughout his birth in the celestial and
    human realms he would be blessed with long life and exceptionally good health. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bakkula&#146;s next documented birth is during the reign
    of the Padumuttara Buddha. He was inspired by a monk on whom the Padumuttara Buddha had
    conferred the title of monk foremost in long life and good health. He performed many
    meritorious deeds and aspired to be foremost in long life and good health under a future
    Buddha. The Padumuttara Buddha prophesied that many eons into the future there would reign
    a Supreme Buddha of the Sakyan clan by the name of Gotama. At this time, Bakkula would be
    born into a wealthy Brahmin family, attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana, and be declared
    the monk foremost in good health and longevity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next documented birth story is at the time of the
    Vipassi Buddha, when Bakkula was born in the city of Bandumatti. On completing his
    education he decided to join the Noble Order. Before long he attained the mental
    ecstasies. During this time a contagious desease spread among the Vipassi Buddha&#146;s
    Noble Order. By using his supernormal powers Bakkula gathered the herbs and roots required
    and prepared the medicine that cured the Sangha. He then renewed his aspiration. At death
    he was reborn in the Brahma realms and had the opportunity to enjoy celestial bliss for a
    long period of time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next documented birth story is at the time of the
    Kassapa Buddha. After seeing a derelict monastery he repaired it and offered it to the
    Sangha. Taking refuge in the Kassapa Buddha he continued his efforts at emancipation. At
    death he was reborn in the heavens.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As prophesied, the aspiration made at the time of the
    Padumuttara Buddha was fulfilled during the reign of the Gotama Buddha. Bakkula, with his
    remarkable memory and the experience gained by attending the First Sangha Council was
    invaluable in teaching and assisting the Sangha in preserving the Word of the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">13. Sivali</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the time of the Buddha Gotama there reigned a righteous
    King and Queen named Koliya and Suppavasa. After some time Queen Suppavasa conceived a
    child. The unborn child brought great fortune to the kingdom. Not only did the queen
    receive many gifts from friends and relatives, but the whole kingdom became prosperous.
    Crops grew in abundance and everyone was well-fed and healthy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The queen grew heavy with child but when the natural time
    for the birth arrived, she failed to deliver the baby. She grew uneasy as time passed by
    with still no signs of the birth, and asked the King to invite the Buddha and His retinue
    of monks for a meal. After the meal the Buddha blessed the queen by saying:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;May Suppavasa, daughter of the Koliya clan,<br>
      Be happy and healthy and give birth to a healthy son.&quot; </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the Buddha left, the queen gave birth to a
    beautiful, healthy son. As a mark of respect for the Buddha, who had eased the
    queen&#146;s heavy burden with His blessings, He and His retinue were invited to receive
    alms at the palace for seven days. The prince was named Sivali, as from the time of his
    conception, the people&#146;s hardships were alleviated through an abundance of rich
    crops.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day when Sariputta was on his alms round he visited
    the prince and informed him of the suffering that he and his mother had undergone because
    of the delayed pregnancy. Sariputta then went on to explain to the prince the unwholesome
    action that his mother and he had performed and the resulting effects of their actions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a previous birth Sivali had been born as the King of
    Benares and had waged war on a neighbouring kingdom. He had surrounded the kingdom and
    told the citizens to surrender or fight back. When they refused to surrender, in
    collaboration with his consort, his present mother, he had decided to surround the city
    and hold them hostage until they did so. The citizens, who did not want to fight back or
    live under the rule of such a king, had not surrendered. As a result they had suffered
    greatly without food for a very long period. Many of the sick and the elderly had died but
    the arrogant king and his queen had not given in. Many months later the King had withdrawn
    his troops and released his hostages but he had paid dearly for the suffering he had
    caused. At death he was reborn in Avichi hell. The delayed pregnancy and the suffering he
    and his mother had undergone resulting from the delay were the residual effects of this
    action.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After illustrating the Noble Truth of suffering, Sariputta
    asked the prince if he would like to join the Noble Order so that he could seek the path
    to end all suffering. The prince was overjoyed at this invitation and agreed to join the
    order with his mother&#146;s permission.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The queen, who was a devoted follower of the Buddha,
    agreed. She escorted Prince Sivali in procession to the monastery to be ordained. On the
    day of ordination when his hair was shaved, Sariputta advised Sivali to meditate on the
    impurities of the body. Sivali, who was spiritually advanced resulting from previous
    wholesome actions, focused his mind as instructed. Before the completion of the shaving of
    his hair, Sivali attained the supreme wisdom of Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The monks soon noticed a strange phenomenon when they were
    with Sivali. Sivali always seemed to have an abundance of rich, fragrant food and the
    other requisites (robes, shelter and medicine). Monks who were with him also had the
    opportunity to share in the bounty. Wherever Sivali went people flocked around to prepare
    food for him. Sivali was indeed blessed with all the requisites of a monk.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And so it was that wherever Sivali travelled he was well
    taken care of. He and his retinue of 500 monks were in an uninhabited forest for seven
    days, but they were not short of food. The Devas made sure that all their requirements
    were met. Similarly when Sivali was travelling through the desert his requisites were
    provided. The Buddha, seeing that Sivali was fulfilling a previous aspiration in His
    reign, declared that he was foremost among the monks in obtaining requisites. He also
    instructed monks who were travelling on long, tedious journeys through uninhabited terrain
    to be accompanied by Sivali, as with him by their side they would be ensured of the
    requisites. In fact, on one occasion when the Buddha and His retinue of 30,000 monks were
    travelling to visit the monk Khadhiravaniya Revata (Sariputta&#146;s younger brother) they
    had to cross an uninhabited forest. Ananda, fearing that they would not be able to obtain
    food in the jungle for such a large number of monks, questioned the Buddha about the
    logistics of the journey. The Buddha assured Ananda that they had nothing to worry about
    as Sivali was with them. With Sivali present there would be no shortage of food because
    even the Devas revelled in taking care of his requirements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In general the effects of one&#146;s wholesome and
    unwholesome intentional actions are reaped only by the doer. However, there are instances,
    as with Sivali, that others too benefit from unusually strong actions of another. This
    overflow of the results of the effect of a persons strong kamma on others is known as
    nissandha pala (overflowing results of kamma). While vipaka pala (results of kamma) are
    reaped only by the doer nissandha pala are experienced by others who happen to be with
    you. Nissandha pala could be both wholesome and unwholesome in accordance with the deed
    performed. For instance Sariputta did not obtain alms in one instance resulting from the
    nissandha pala of Losaka&#146;s strong unwholesome deeds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To seek the cause of this strange phenomenon we need to go
    back many aeons to the time of the Buddha Padumuttara. Sivali, who had been born as a poor
    man, had the opportunity to see the Buddha Padumuttara confer on another monk the honour
    of being foremost among monks who obtain the requisites. Fascinated by the way everyone
    desired to provide alms and robes to this monk, Sivali had decided that he too would like
    to hold a similar position in a future birth. He had then performed many acts of
    generosity to the Buddha Padumuttara and His retinue and made an aspiration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha Padumuttara, foreseeing that Sivali&#146;s
    aspiration would be fulfilled, had prophesied that at the time of the Gotama Buddha he
    would be foremost among the monks who obtained requisites. From this point onwards, Sivali
    had started in earnest to work toward his aspiration. At death he was reborn in a heavenly
    realm where he enjoyed many years of heavenly bliss.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next documented birth story took place at the time of
    the Buddha Vipassi, 91 world cycles before our Gotama Buddha. Sivali was born as a
    merchant in the City of Bandhumati. The City was preparing a great alms-giving for the
    Buddha Vipassi and His retinue of monks, when they realized that they were short of curd
    and honey, a delicacy that was often served after the noonday meal. Messages were sent all
    over the city to obtain the required delicacy. Unable to obtain the quota required, the
    king&#146;s men raised the price of the curd and honey from one gold coin to 100 coins.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the meantime Sivali, a merchant who sold curd and
    honey, was approached and offered 100 gold coins for his merchandise. Sivali was surprised
    at the unusually high offer and asked for whose consumption they were buying the curd. On
    being told that it was for the Buddha Vipassi and His retinue of monks, Sivali asked
    permission to donate his wares to the Buddha. He then renewed his aspiration to be
    foremost among the monks who received requisites. The Buddha Vipassi, seeing that
    Sivali&#146;s aspiration would be fulfilled, blessed him by saying, &quot;May your
    aspiration be fulfilled.&quot; Sivali then became a devotee of the Vipassi Buddha and
    practised His Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Resulting from this strong aspiration and the meritorious
    deeds and efforts performed in previous births, Sivali fulfilled his aspiration to be
    foremost among the monks who obtained requisites at the time of the Gotama Buddha. To
    date, Buddhists venerate the Arahanth Sivali, and often keep a picture or a discourse
    known as the Sivali Paritta in their home as a symbol of abundance of food and prosperity.</font></p>

    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">14. Angulimala</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of King Pasenadi Kosala&#146;s subjects was a learned
    Brahmin by the name of Bhaggava Gagga, who served as his royal chaplain. Bhaggava and his
    wife Mantani had a baby son. In keeping with the custom of the times his father cast a
    horoscope for the new-born babe. To his horror, he found that the baby was born under the
    &quot;robber constellation&quot;, which would result in tendencies of a life of crime.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That morning when the chaplain visited the king and asked
    him how he had slept, the king informed him that he had had a night of terror. &quot;I
    woke up in the night&quot;, said the king, &quot;and saw my weapons which were lying at
    the side of my bed sparkling brightly. Could this&quot;, he asked, &quot;mean danger to my
    kingdom or myself?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bhaggava then informed the king that the same strange
    phenomena had occurred throughout the city and informed the king that the cause was his
    newborn son who had a robber&#146;s horoscope. The king then asked Bhaggava if the stars
    foretold that the boy was to be a lone robber. Bhaggava informed the king that indeed the
    stars foretold that his son would lead a life of solitary crime. Bhaggava then asked the
    king if they should kill the baby now to prevent the crimes that would be unleashed in the
    future if this baby lived. King Pasenadi, reflecting on the fact that the child would grow
    up to be a lone robber, asked his chaplain to bring him up carefully and to educate him
    well so that this prediction could be avoided.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bhaggava and Mantani decided to name the baby Ahimsaka, or
    &quot;harmless&quot;, in the hope that his name and a good upbringing and education would
    change the latent tendencies that were dormant in him. Ahimsaka grew up to be physically
    strong, intelligent and well-behaved. As he excelled in his studies his father sent him to
    Takkasila, the famous ancient university of India, for his higher education. Ahimsaka, who
    was a good student, soon surpassed all the other students and excelled. Before long he was
    the favourite of his teacher. His teacher treated him as his son and often invited
    Ahimsaka to share meals with him in his home. Ahimsaka&#146;s academic excellence and his
    obvious friendship with the teacher made him many enemies. His fellow students, jealous of
    his success, decided to poison the teacher&#146;s mind in order to destroy the friendship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">They began systematically to poison the mind of the
    teacher by making false accusations against Ahimsaka. At first the teacher disregarded
    their slander and rebuked them, but when more and more students independently came to him
    with the same story his confidence wavered. Slowly a seed of doubt entered his heart. Was
    Ahimsaka plotting against him? Was he planning to take over his pupils and surpass him?
    His teacher decided that he would have to kill Ahimsaka before he himself was killed. But
    Ahimsaka was big and strong. Killing him would not be easy. Besides, his reputation as a
    teacher would be ruined if he were in any way connected with Ahimsaka&#146;s death. The
    teacher reflected on a plan to get rid of Ahimsaka, whom he now perceived as a threat, in
    a manner that would not incriminate him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ahimsaka had just completed his course of studies. It was
    the custom at that time for the pupils to give a gift to honour the teacher who had taught
    them. Reminding Ahimsaka of this honoured custom, he requested a necklace of one thousand
    fingers, each of which was to be obtained from a different person&#146;s body. The teacher
    most probably had secretly cast Ahimsaka&#146;s horoscope himself, for this science was
    well-known at that time, and had seen that Ahimsaka had within him criminal tendencies. He
    also expected that before long Ahimsaka would be caught by the king&#146;s men and
    executed for his crimes. Thus, thinking that he had come up with a foolproof plan to kill
    Ahimsaka, he insisted on his gift when Ahimsaka hesitated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ahimsaka came from a family who believed in non-violence.
    Remembering his parental and family values, Ahimsaka refused to provide this gift. But the
    teacher insisted by telling him that this was expected of him and that not giving the
    requested gift would totally nullify the value of all he had learned, as he would not have
    met the honoured teacher&#146;s wish. Ahimsaka therefore felt compelled to agree.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At this point Ahimsaka&#146;s latent tendencies for
    violence arose and exploded within him. In previous births he had been strong and violent.
    He had, in fact, eaten human flesh and relished killing. His dark past and lack of
    compassion resurfaced and the good influence of his parents and upbringing were forgotten.
    His love for danger, adventure and killing took over. Instead of collecting the thousand
    fingers from dead bodies, which could have been found in the burial grounds, he took to a
    life of crime in the Jalini forest in his home state of Kosala.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There he lived on a high cliff, observing travellers upon
    whom he swooped down and killed. Slaying them, he took one finger from each victim. First
    he hung the finger on a tree so that birds and other creatures would eat the rotting flesh
    and then he threaded the bones into a garland which he wore round his neck. Before long he
    came to be known as Angulimala, or &quot;garland of fingers&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The whole city was in terror. Angulimala&#146;s power and
    strength were unconquerable. Many had tried to capture the dreaded serial killer but had
    fallen victim to his vicious strength and inhuman cruelty. Angulimala began to enjoy his
    cruel life and was completely overtaken by his past dark life of killing and cruelty. No
    one dared to approach the forest for fear of death. Angulimala started to venture into the
    outskirts of the city to find his victims. He even started breaking into homes and raiding
    the city in the night to kill and obtain the fingers. The villagers, who were petrified,
    left their homes and fled to the capital of Savatthi. They camped outside the palace walls
    and complained to the king that more and more of the townspeople were being killed
    mercilessly by Angulimala. The king therefore prepared the army to capture him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At this time Angulimala had collected 999 of the thousand
    fingers required for his gift to the teacher. Angulimala&#146;s true name and descent were
    not known, as his appearance had changed. His beard and hair were matted and he was
    covered in stale, dried blood. The stench of death and raw meat surrounded him. He looked
    like a wild, fearsome killer. The mild-mannered Ahimsaka was unrecognizable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">News of the terror wrought by Angulimala had finally
    reached his parents. Suspecting that Angulimala was their son who had never come back from
    the Takkasila University, his mother pleaded with her husband to bring their son back. But
    Bhaggava had no use for such a son. He refused, saying, &quot;Let him be captured, let him
    be executed by the king&#146;s men&quot;. Mantani decided to venture into the forest alone
    to save her son. With the unconditional love that a mother has for her child she hoped to
    persuade Angulimala to mend his ways, as the king was preparing his army to capture and
    execute him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Angulimala was searching desperately for his last victim.
    He was tiring of his life of crime and had become eager to reach his goal. In the distance
    he saw a woman approaching his hide-out in the Jalini forest. Swooping down the mountain,
    he began chasing the old woman whom he soon realized was his mother.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At this time the Buddha, with his compassionate eye, was
    observing the world, looking for those with wisdom and in need to help. He saw Angulimala
    running after his mother for his final kill. He also saw that Angulimala had within him
    the goodness to attain emancipation. This was not His first encounter with Angulimala. In
    many past lives they had met and the Buddha had conquered Angulimala&#146;s strength of
    body with His strength of mind. Once Angulimala had even been the Bodhisatta&#146;s uncle
    (Jataka 513). He walked toward the Jalini forest to prevent the grave, hideous crime of
    matricide. Townsfolk tried to prevent the Buddha from continuing by telling Him of the
    murderous serial killer.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, disregarding their plea, ventured into the
    deep forest. Projecting himself between Angulimala and his mother, the Buddha attracted
    his attention. Seeing the calm and serene Buddha, Angulimala swerved. &quot;Why should I
    kill my mother,&quot; thought Angulimala, &quot;my last victim will instead be this
    ascetic who stands calmly in my way&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Swerving, he started after the Buddha. Angulimala
    brandished his sword as he thrashed amongst the foliage, intent on catching up with the
    Buddha. But despite his superhuman strength and fast pace he could not keep up with the
    Buddha. The Buddha did not seem to be running and yet, despite Angulimala&#146;s efforts,
    He remained a few paces ahead. Exhausted, Angulimala called out to the Buddha, &quot;Stop,
    recluse! Stop, recluse!&quot; The Buddha calmly replied, &quot;I have stopped, Angulimala.
    You too should stop.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Angulimala was perplexed by the Buddha&#146;s words.
    Stopping, he questioned the Buddha as to what He meant. The Buddha then explained:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Angulimala, I have stopped forever,<br>
      I abstain from violence towards all living beings<br>
      But you have no restraint towards things that breathe<br>
      So that is why I have stopped and you have not.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Angulimala heard these words a miraculous change
    occurred. His former good deeds and purity surfaced. He knew that the Compassionate One
    had come to the Jalini Forest solely on his behalf. Moved to the very core of his being,
    Angulimala threw down his sword, knelt before the Buddha with bowed head, and pledged to
    change.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>Oh at long last this Recluse, a Venerated Sage,<br>
      Has come to this forest for my sake.<br>
      Having heard your stanza, teaching me the Truth (Dhamma)<br>
      I will indeed renounce evil forever.&quot;</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha ordained Angulimala and took him back to the
    Jetavana monastery in Savatthi. The villagers, unaware of the transformation that had
    taken place, continued to complain to the king, who, together with his best soldiers, set
    off to the Jalini forest to capture Angulimala. On the way they passed the Jetavana
    Monastery. Being an ardent follower of the Enlightened One, King Pasenadi Kosala stopped
    at the monastery to pay respect to the Buddha. The Buddha, seeing the king in his battle
    gear with his best soldiers, asked him if he was going to war with a neighbouring kingdom.
    King Pasenadi replied that it was not a kingdom that he was trying to overthrow, but
    Angulimala, the dreaded murderer. He then added that even though he had selected his best
    soldiers to accompany him, he did not think that he would be successful in capturing the
    fierce murderer.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then asked the king how he would treat
    Angulimala if he had given up his murderous ways and taken to the Noble Order. The king
    replied that he would then honour and worship him as befitting the Noble Ones. The Buddha
    then asked Angulimala to come forward. A calm and serene, shaven monk walked towards the
    king. At the sight of Angulimala the king shook with fear. His being with the Buddha and
    wearing saffron robes did not alter the fact that he was a fearsome killer. The king
    backed away in terror.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then told the king that he had nothing to be
    afraid of, as Angulimala had given up killing to follow His path. The king then questioned
    Angulimala about his family and origin. Angulimala answered that he was the son of
    Bhaggava Gagga and Mantani. The king immediately recalled the day that Angulimala was born
    and the unusual happening in the night. But confident in the Buddha&#146;s acceptance of
    the former murderer, the king addressed him as Gagga Mantaniputta so that his association
    with the past should be forgotten. King Pasenadi offered to provide Mantaniputta (son of
    Mantani) his patronage and the requisites of a monk. Mantaniputta, however, had decided
    that he would practise austerities. He already had the three robes that a monk required.
    He refused the king&#146;s offer. Amazed at the transformation, King Pasenadi then praised
    the Buddha as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It is wonderful, Venerable Sir. It is marvellous how
    the Blessed One subdues the unsubdued, pacifies the unpacified, calms the uncalm. This one
    whom we could not subdue with punishment and weapons, the Blessed One has subdued without
    punishment or weapons.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Despite the king&#146;s acceptance of Mantaniputta the
    townsfolk feared the former killer. When Mantaniputta went on his alms round people ran
    away in fear. Even though he went on alms round each day, as it was the custom for the
    Buddha&#146;s monks to do, he hardly ever received alms. The villagers were also in fear
    that this precedent would result in seasoned criminals joining the Noble Order to escape
    from their punishment. Reflecting on their concern the Buddha realized that no one but
    Himself had the capacity to look into a person and view their innate goodness. There could
    in the future arise a misuse of the Noble Order by evil persons. Agreeing to their
    request, the Buddha declared that convicted criminals would not be allowed to join the
    order as a means to escape their punishment or jail term.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mantaniputta, who practised the Buddha&#146;s teaching
    ardently, had difficulties attaining his goal. Visions of his former victims pleading for
    their life, their cries of pain and torment, haunted him. He could not calm his mind or
    collect his thoughts when he remembered his evil past. He continued striving, and despite
    the fact that he did not receive alms, he joined the other monks in the daily alms round.
    On one such day he saw a woman in labour in intense pain, as she was unable to deliver her
    baby. Full of compassion for her suffering he went back to the Buddha and asked if there
    was anything that he could do to help the young woman.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then declared a stanza of Truth which is now
    commonly known as the Angulimala Sutta. The Buddha asked him to go to the woman and say
    the following:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Since I was with the Noble Birth,<br>
      I do not recall that I have ever intentionally<br>
      Deprived a living being of his life.<br>
      By this Truth may you be well and may your infant be safe.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As instructed Mantaniputta went back to the woman&#146;s
    home. He then declared the Sutta. The woman&#146;s suffering ceased and she gave birth to
    a healthy baby. The power of Truth and the resulting miracle spread across the city.
    Villagers lost their fear of Mantaniputta and started to accept him with compassion. He
    started to receive food when he went on his alms round.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha did not usually encourage His disciples to
    perform miracles or to heal through faith. Why then in this incident did He encourage
    Mantaniputta to help the woman through the power of Truth? It was because the Buddha knew
    that Mantaniputta did not receive any alms because the villagers did not have confidence
    in him. It was also to give Mantaniputta something positive on which to focus his mind so
    that he could put aside his past and concentrate on disciplining his mind. After this
    incident people started slowly to regain their confidence in Mantaniputta. He too was able
    to concentrate without constantly reliving his evil past. His compassion for the woman and
    his happiness resulting from this deed helped to calm his mind. Shortly thereafter, with
    diligent practice, Mantaniputta, the former murderer Angulimala, attained Arahanthship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The acceptance, however, was not complete. Many whose
    family members he had killed never forgave him. They hit him with sticks and stones and
    Mantaniputta often came back to Jetavana bleeding, in torn robes. He bore the torment with
    calm for he had finally attained his salvation. His body was subject to the brutal attacks
    for he had to reap the effects of his evil kamma, but his mind had achieved liberation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To this day Buddhists all over the world have great
    confidence in the Angulimala Sutta. It is common practice for the Sutta to be used for a
    safe and comfortable delivery when Buddhist women are in labour. From this point onwards
    Mantaniputta&#146;s compassion spread. He led a quiet life, living in forests and glades,
    practising austerities.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mantaniputta encourages his enemies and others who have
    done wrong and describes his transformation and gratitude to the Buddha thus:</font></p>
    <blockquote>

    left the palace to return to the monastery. Out of respect for the Buddha, Nanda followed
    Him with bowl in hand, thinking, &quot;Surely the Lord will take the bowl from me
    shortly.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, however, did not take back the bowl. Nanda,
    who respected His older brother, the Buddha, followed Him to the monastery. His betrothed,
    seeing him following the Buddha, ran after him in tears, saying, &quot;Return quickly, O
    Noble Lord.&quot; These affectionate words and his beloved&#146;s tears moved Nanda
    deeply. But so great was his reverence for the Buddha that he could not hand back the
    bowl.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On reaching the monastery the Buddha, who saw that Nanda
    had the potential of reaching Arahanthship, asked him if he would like to be ordained as a
    monk. Nanda was torn. He wanted to go back to his betrothed. But how could he refuse the
    Buddha? So great was his respect for his older brother, the Buddha, that he reluctantly
    agreed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nanda, the Bhikkhu, was not happy. He kept thinking of his
    bride-to-be. Finally, in desperation, he approached his fellow monks and related his
    troubles to them. Nanda informed them that he intended to give up the holy life and go
    back to the life of a house- holder.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The news of Nanda&#146;s decision soon reached the Buddha.
    Approaching Nanda, the Buddha questioned him as to the problem. Nanda informed the Buddha
    that he was distracted and worried because he had left his beautiful bride on their
    wedding day. The Buddha, who with His divine eye saw that Nanda, with a little effort,
    could reach the supreme happiness of enlightenment, thought of a way to keep him in the
    Holy Life which was in keeping with his present frame of mind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Using His psychic powers the Buddha transported Nanda to
    the Tavatimsa Heaven. On the way He showed Nanda a singed female monkey who had lost her
    ears, nose and tail in a forest fire. Pointing to the celestial nymphs the Buddha asked
    Nanda who was the fairer, the celestial nymphs or his bride-to-be. Nanda, enticed by the
    extraordinary beauty of the celestial nymphs, replied that his bride-to-be was like the
    singed female monkey that they had seen on their way, when compared to the celestial
    nymphs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, reading his immature mind, then said, &quot;I
    guarantee that you will possess the celestial nymphs if you persevere and follow my
    instruction.&quot; Nanda, who was totally obsessed with the beauty of the celestial
    nymphs, childishly agreed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nanda then informed his fellow monks of his decision to
    remain in the Holy order and the reason for his change of mind. Before long everybody knew
    that Nanda was following the Holy Order in the hope of possessing celestial nymphs. The
    young monks laughed and teased Nanda, calling him rude names. Their teasing brought Nanda
    to his senses. Ashamed of his base motives he set his mind towards enlightenment. Shortly
    after, by practising with diligence, Nanda achieved Arahanthship. Nanda describes his
    attachment, final deliverance and gratitude as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Because of unreasoned thinking,<br>
      I was addicted to ornament.<br>
      I was conceited, vain<br>
      And afflicted by desire for sense pleasures.<br>
      With (the aid of) the Buddha<br>
      Skilled in means, kinsman of the sun<br>
      I practised properly,<br>
      Plucked out my mind (desire)<br>
      For existence.&quot;</i><br>
      <i>-- (Theragatha 157,158)</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On realizing the exquisite happiness of Nibbana, Nanda
    approached the Buddha and thanked Him respectfully by saying, &quot;Lord I release you
    from your promise of celestial bliss.&quot; The Buddha then informed Nanda that He had
    been released from the promise the moment he had reached the supreme bliss of Nibbana,
    because the bliss of Nibbana was greater and transcended any celestial bliss.</font></p>

    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">16. Devadatta</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Devadatta, who was the son of King Suppabuddha and Queen
    Pamita, was the cousin of Prince Siddhattha and brother of Princess Yasodhara. He was a
    playmate of Prince Siddhattha but from a young age displayed signs of cruelty towards
    animals and jealousy towards the Prince. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a young prince, Siddhattha had always been
    everyone&#146;s favourite. He was obedient, kind and considerate. He also excelled in
    every skill and sport. Devadatta looked on, his heart filled with envy. Why was it that
    everyone obeyed Siddhattha and listened to Him? Why was He always singled out as the best?
    Could they not see how great he, Devadatta, was? His mean spirit could not understand that
    it was his own arrogance, cruel nature, and lack of consideration that turned people away
    from him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Siddhattha became the Buddha, Devadatta watched as
    Sakyan princes and princesses embraced His Doctrine. He, too, decided to give up his life
    as a prince and follow the Buddha&#146;s teaching. He entered the order together with his
    cousins, Ananda and Anuruddha. For a brief period his jealousy and envy were buried as he
    explored the new teachings with interest. Before long, he reached the first stage of Jhana
    by developing his keen mind through meditation. Sariputta, seeing his effort and progress,
    praised him for his diligence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, it was only a temporary reprieve. His old anger
    and envy poured back into his dark heart. Gripped with hatred and jealousy upon seeing the
    popularity and veneration the Buddha received, he began to form a plot. Seeking the help
    of King Ajatasattu, a cruel and greedy king, he planned the murder of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the first attempt to kill the Buddha, Devadatta&#146;s
    plan was foiled. The large rock he rolled down the mountain at Gijjhakuta bounced off
    another rock. A sliver detached and struck the sacred foot of the Buddha. The wound was
    deep and painful but not fatal. Devadatta plotted again. Feeding alcohol to the enraged
    king elephant Nalagiri, he let it loose on the path towards the Buddha. But the Buddha
    with His grace calmed the enraged elephant. Unable to bear his defeat, Devadatta sought to
    cause disharmony among the monks. He requested that the Buddha change the rules for the
    monks to include the following:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Monks should only live in the forest (as opposed to
      living in monasteries)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Monks should only eat food that they received through
      begging (as opposed to food eaten on invitation by laymen)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Monks should only wear robes that were made from cloths
      that were used to wrap dead bodies - pansukula (as opposed to robes given as gifts by
      laymen)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Monks should live at the foot of trees (as opposed to
      living in caves in forests)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. Monks should not eat fish or meat</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The compassionate Buddha, who saw that the above rules
    would cause unnecessary hardship to His monks while not adding any value to their reaching
    of enlightenment, refused. Instead, He said that any monk who wished to do so could adopt
    the above practice of austerities. This caused disharmony among the Sangha as some
    inexperienced monks, thinking that the only way to enlightenment was by the practice of
    austerities, left the Buddha and joined an order founded by Devadatta. With the start of
    these evil actions Devadatta lost the psychic powers and Jhana that he had developed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To understand fully the deep envy and hatred that
    Devadatta had towards the Buddha, we must look back in history to their first encounter.
    In the Seri Vanija Jataka, the Buddha revealed that many lifetimes before, Devadatta and
    He were both born as travelling merchants. Devadatta, who was an unscrupulous merchant,
    was travelling selling his wares when he was accosted by a poor peasant woman who did not
    have any money but needed merchandise. However, she had in her kitchen a large pot which
    was old and discoloured. Asking her granddaughter to bring forth the pot, she handed it to
    Devadatta and asked him to value it and give them merchandise in exchange for its value.
    On receiving the heavy pot, Devadatta realized that this was no ordinary vessel. It was a
    pot of gold, the value of which was greater than all the merchandise he carried in his
    cart. He also realized that neither the old lady nor her grand-daughter was aware of its
    value. Pretending that it was a valueless old pot he handed it back and ridiculed them for
    suggesting such a trade. His plan was to come back later and offer them a small amount of
    money, far less than the true value of the pot, and make it out to be an act of compassion
    that he had performed to help them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Shortly after, our Bodhisatta visited the same hut to sell
    His merchandise. The old woman once again brought out the discoloured old pot and
    requested a trade for the merchandise that she needed. The Bodhisatta, realizing the value
    of the pot, informed the old woman that this was a golden vessel, the value of which
    exceeded all his merchandise. He then offered all his wares in exchange for the pot. The
    grateful old woman thanked the Bodhisatta for His honesty and informed Him of the ridicule
    to which they had been subject by the former merchant. She then handed the pot over to
    him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Devadatta, however, was not finished with the poor woman.
    He came back hoping to trick her into giving him the pot for almost nothing. When he found
    out that the Bodhisatta had traded for the pot, his anger and envy were all-consuming.
    Raging after the Bodhisatta, he vowed enmity and revenge. Such deep anger and hatred is
    extremely dangerous. Devadatta carried his jealousy and anger towards the Buddha through
    many births. Many Jataka stories that the Buddha dispensed illustrate Devadatta&#146;s
    hatred and schemes to hurt the Bodhisatta. Unable to accomplish his goal, Devadatta&#146;s
    envy and hatred grew with each succeeding encounter with the Bodhisatta. This extreme
    hatred and past conditioning that had begun many years ago were carried through samsara
    and manifested in Devadatta&#146;s evil actions towards the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As he approached the time of his death, Devadatta repented
    and regretted his actions. He reflected on the impermanence of life and his oncoming
    death. A pang of fear gripped his heart. Why had he not heeded the teachings when he had
    the opportunity? How had he veered so far from the Truth? Stumbling to his feet, he walked
    toward Jetavana to beg forgiveness of the Buddha for the grave wrongs he had committed.
    But it was not to be. Red-hot flames engulfed his mind and body. Gasping for breath,
    Devadatta died in torment before he reached the Buddha, and was reborn in the Avichi hell.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Despite the evil acts performed by Devadatta, the Buddha
    predicted that his good kamma performed in the early years as a monk would eventually bear
    fruit. He said that in the distant future Devadatta would be a Pacceka Buddha by the name
    of Satthissara.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even though Devadatta was not one of the great disciples
    of the Buddha his story is worthy of note. It clearly illustrates that you are your own
    saviour. Even the Buddha, who must have had great compassion for his cousin, could not
    save him. That was something that Devadatta himself had to do. His story also illustrates
    the fact that there is hope for all. Even the extremely long lifespans in the lower worlds
    come to an end. Devadatta will one day reap the benefits of his good actions by becoming a
    Pacceka Buddha.</font></p>
