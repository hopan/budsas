    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">30. Anathapindika</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sudatta, a wealthy merchant, (better known as
    Anathapindika because of his generosity to the destitute), was visiting his brother-in-law
    in Savatthi when he noted that a celebration was being organized. When he inquired as to
    whom they were honouring, he was informed that the Buddha was visiting Savatthi and that
    the celebrations were in honour of the Exalted One. Upon hearing the name Buddha,
    Anathapindika became transformed with fervour and vowed to see the Blessed One.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Early next morning he set off to see the Buddha. The
    Buddha, realizing that His chief lay disciple was on his way to see Him, went to meet
    Sudatta. Seeing Sudatta in the distance, the Buddha greeted him by name. Realizing that he
    was in the presence of the Blessed One, Sudatta fell down at the Buddha&#146;s feet and
    honoured Him. Then, overwhelmed by the Buddha&#146;s presence, Anathapindika inquired if
    the Blessed One had slept well. Anathapindika glimpsed the real stature of the Buddha when
    he heard His reply to this question of courtesy. The Buddha replied:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Always indeed He sleeps well,<br>
      The Brahmin who is fully quenched,<br>
      Who does not cling to sensual pleasure,<br>
      Cool at heart is that acquisition.<br>
      Having cut off all attachment,<br>
      Having removed desire from the heart,<br>
      The Peaceful One indeed sleeps well,<br>
      For he has attained peace of mind.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then introduced Anathapindika to the Dhamma by
    using the method of graduated teaching known as anupubbikatha. He started with generosity
    and the benefits of giving. He then moved on to virtue and the benefits of virtue, and
    followed this with the bliss found in the heavenly realms. The Buddha then advised
    Anathapindika on the perils of vanity and the dangers of sense pleasures and introduced
    him to renunciation. Then, sensing that Anathapindika&#146;s mind was uplifted and serene,
    the Buddha taught him the Four Noble Truths which are the unique Teaching of every Buddha.
    On hearing the Buddha, Anathapindika, who was spiritually advanced, reached the first
    stage of sainthood, Sotapanna. Inspired and wanting to hear more, Anathapindika invited
    the Buddha to his brother-in-law&#146;s house for His noonday meal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the meal Anathapindika questioned the Buddha on a
    suitable place for His residence. On hearing that the Buddha was seeking a quiet place for
    His retinue and Himself to spend the rainy season, Anathapindika looked for a suitable
    park to make available to Him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The park which Anathapindika chose for the Buddha was the
    lush garden of Prince Jeta (King Pasenadi Kosala&#146;s son). The Prince, however, was not
    selling his beautiful park. When the persistent Anathapindika would not relent from his
    request to buy the park, the exasperated Jeta said, &quot;Cover the entire garden with
    100,000 gold coins.&quot; This was an unreasonably high price even for a park as beautiful
    as his. To his surprise, Anathapindika accepted and soon carts arrived bearing thousands
    and thousands of gold coins that he strew all over the garden. His curiosity now aroused,
    Jeta asked Anathapindika the reason for which he needed the park. On hearing that it was
    for the Buddha and His retinue he relented and handed over the park to Anathapindika.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Vinaya Pitaka describes the quarters Anathapindika
    built as a vast complex with monasteries, attendance halls, meditation cells, bathrooms,
    lotus ponds and walkways - a beautiful complex that would be worthy of the Buddha. In
    honour of the two men responsible for the compound, it was named Jetavana
    Anathapindikarama (Anathapindika&#146;s monastery in Jeta&#146;s grove ). Anathapindika
    asked the Buddha the appropriate way to gift the monastery to Him. The Buddha then
    requested Anathapindika to donate the park by dedicating it to the Sangha of the present
    and the Sangha of the future. The Buddha then encouraged others in the building of
    monasteries by highlighting the benefits of such a gift to the Sangha. He said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;They (monasteries) ward off cold and heat and
      beasts of prey,<br>
      Creeping things, gnats, and in the wet season, rain.<br>
      When the dreaded hot wind arises, it is warded off.<br>
      To meditate and obtain insight in a shelter, at ease<br>
      A dwelling place is praised by the Awakened One,<br>
      As a chief gift to the Order.<br>
      Therefore a wise man looking for his own weal,<br>
      Should have dwelling places built, so that<br>
      Learned Ones can stay therein.<br>
      To the upright, with mind purified,<br>
      Food, drink, robes, and lodging, he should give,<br>
      Then they will teach him Dhamma, dispelling every ill,<br>
      He, knowing the Dhamma attains Nibbana - canker free.&quot;<br>
      -- (Vinaya Pitaka)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anathapindika then provided the Sangha with rice gruel,
    alms bowls, robes and medicine and invited the monks to his seven-story mansion daily, to
    partake in the noonday meal. He also provided food and gifts for the townsfolk as part of
    the great donation. His mansion was thus a blaze of saffron robes enveloped by the
    soothing and calming Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every time the Buddha visited Savatthi, Anathapindika
    visited Him. At times, however, the Buddha was in residence elsewhere or was away helping
    another in distress. Anathapindika approached ananda and informed him of the
    disappointment of other devotees and himself who came to visit the Buddha. He informed
    ananda that he would like to build a shrine so that devotees would have a symbol of the
    Buddha to use to strengthen their minds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When ananda reported this to the Buddha He said that there
    were three types of shrines that could be used as a symbol of the Buddha. The first type
    was generally built after the Buddha&#146;s Parinibbana and was a stupa that contained
    relics of the Blessed One. The second was an object that had a connection with the
    Enlightened One and had been used by Him such as a robe or an alms bowl. The third was a
    visible symbol of the Buddha such as a picture or a statue. The first was not appropriate
    during the lifetime of the Buddha and so it was decided to use an object that had helped
    the Enlightened One. Statues of the Buddha seem only to have became popular as a symbol
    worthy of reverence about 300 years after His Parinibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Bodhi tree in Uruwela, Buddha Gaya, seemed appropriate
    and so it was decided that a sapling of the tree would be brought and planted in Savatthi.
    Maha Moggallana, using astral travel, brought the sapling and Anathapindika planted it at
    the Jetavana Park. Devotees at the time of the Buddha as well as present-day devotees
    honour the Bodhi Tree as they would honour the Buddha and use this object to strengthen
    their minds. It should be noted, however, that it is only saplings or branches that are
    offshoots of the original Bodhi tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment that
    are worthy of respect. Buddhists, however, have extended this to other trees of the same
    species, and made the Bodhi Tree (Religiose Faicaso tree), a symbol of the Buddha and His
    enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anathapindika and his wife Punnalakkhana had three
    daughters and one son. Two of his daughters, Big Subhadda and Little Subhadda, followed in
    their parents&#146; footsteps and were devoted disciples of the Buddha. They were both
    happily married and, like their father, had attained the first stage of sainthood,
    Sotapanna. Their youngest daughter Sumana surpassed the others in wisdom and attained the
    second stage of sainthood, Sakadagami. She did not marry but this was not because she had
    renounced the lay life. In fact when she saw the happiness of her two elder sisters she
    was overcome by depression and her spiritual strength could not sustain her. She wasted
    away, eating hardly anything, and passed away at a young age. She was reborn in the Tusita
    heaven as a goddess amidst great comfort and pleasures. The text did not specify why she
    had problems in finding a suitable partner. As arranged marriages were the norm it should
    not have been difficult to find a suitable partner for one who was so wealthy and
    spiritually advanced.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anathapindika&#146;s only son, Kala, was known as the dark
    one. He did not care for the Dhamma but immersed himself completely in affairs of
    business. He was completely absorbed in accumulating wealth. Anathapindika decided to
    trick his son into listening to the Buddha. He offered Kala one thousand gold pieces if he
    would observe the religious holiday with his family. Kala consented and soon found that it
    was relaxing to take one day off from business in the company of his family to observe
    religious rites. Then his father offered him another thousand gold pieces if he would
    visit the Buddha at the monastery, listen to the Dhamma, and learn a stanza of the Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kala agreed. He went to the monastery, saluted the Buddha
    respectfully and sat down to listen to the Dhamma. The Buddha, realizing that Kala was
    spiritually ready for the Dhamma, used His powers to make him misunderstand what he had
    learned. Just as Kala thought that he had mastered the teaching he had a doubt. He
    listened repeatedly with keen attention. Before long Kala was inspired by the Dhamma. He
    listened, enraptured by the teaching, and attained Sotapanna. After this he too, like his
    father, was absorbed in the practice of generosity and the Dhamma and was often called
    Little Anathapindika. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anathapindika, who was totally committed to the Dhamma,
    influenced many persons to follow the Buddha by his example. He did not force his ideas or
    beliefs on them, but seeing his devotion, kindness and generosity, many of his friends and
    business associates adopted his ways. His home became a centre of generosity and kindness
    and his example spread to the surrounding areas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha spent sixteen of the forty-five rainy seasons
    at the Jetavana Monastery in Savatthi. Because of this, many significant events took place
    and many discourses were dispensed by the Buddha at the Jetavana. When the Buddha was in
    residence Anathapindika visited the monastery twice a day to hear the Dhamma. He did not,
    however, feel that he should get any special treatment from the Buddha because he was His
    chief male lay benefactor. As such he often visited the Buddha and sat quietly awaiting
    instruction from the Buddha without question. If the Buddha was not forthcoming with the
    Dhamma he would relate an incident from his life and his response to it and wait for the
    Buddha to comment on the appropriateness of his actions. In this way Anathapindika related
    the day-to-day happenings to the Dhamma and ensured that he lived the Dhamma in all
    aspects of his life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha often dispensed to Anathapindika teachings
    suitable for the lay devotees. On one occasion the Buddha dispensed a sutta on the four
    kinds of bliss to be won by a house- holder. He said they were:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- The bliss of ownership: Wealth gained by hard work and
      energetic striving that was lawfully earned. And when he reflects on the ownership of such
      wealth he feels bliss and happiness.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- The bliss of wealth: Wealth should be enjoyed by the
      householder and he should enjoy sharing his wealth with others. And when he does he feels
      bliss and happiness.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- The bliss of debtlessness: He should not be in debt to
      anyone and as such would have no burdens or worries associated with repayment of debt. And
      when he reflects on his freedom from debt he feels bliss and happiness.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- The bliss of blamelessness: He should be blameless
      because he is free of blameless actions of body, speech and mind. And when he reflects on
      his blameless life he feels bliss and happiness. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also declared to Anathapindika that there were
    five desirable, pleasant and agreable things to a householder which are rare in this
    world. They are long life, beauty, happiness, fame and rebirth in a heaven. He then said,
    &quot;But of these five things, householder, I do not teach that they are to be obtained
    by prayer or by vows. If one could obtain these by prayers and vows then who would not do
    so?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;For a noble householder who wishes to have long
    life, beauty, happiness, fame and rebirth in a heavenly realm it is not befitting that he
    should pray for long life, beauty, happiness, fame and rebirth in a heaven or take delight
    in doing so. He should rather follow a path of life that is conducive to long life,
    beauty, happiness, fame and rebirth in a heaven. By doing so he will obtain long life,
    beauty, happiness, fame and rebirth in a heaven&quot;. (Anguttara Nikaya)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also instructed Anathapindika on the way in
    which one obtains long life, beauty, happiness, fame and rebirth in a heavenly realm. He
    said that one obtains these not by prayer but by perfection of confidence (in the Buddha,
    Dhamma, Sangha), perfection of virtue, perfection of generosity and perfection of wisdom.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And so we have in simple language a fundamental concept of
    the Buddha&#146;s teaching. The Buddha did not encourage His devotees to pray and take
    vows. Instead, He encouraged them to lead a moral, virtuous, and generous life in wisdom.
    The householder would then receive long life, beauty, happiness, fame and rebirth in a
    heavenly realm. The Buddha declared that Devas (Divine beings such as gods and angels)
    were compassionate beings who enjoyed helping the virtuous just as humans enjoyed doing
    so. They could not, however, change the kamma of any individual.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also explained to Anathapindika the effects of
    gifts given carelessly and with a lack of respect. The Buddha said: &quot;Whether one
    gives coarse or choice alms, if one gives without respect and politeness, not with
    one&#146;s own hand, gives only leftovers, and gives without belief in the result of
    actions, then when one is reborn, as a result of giving alms in this manner, one&#146;s
    heart will have no inclination for fine food and clothing, for fine vehicles, etc. A man
    will find that his wife, children and servants will not obey him, nor listen to him, nor
    pay respect to him. And why is that so? It is because that is the result of actions done
    without respect.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At one time Anathapindika had given all his wealth away
    and due to some unexpected misfortune did not have rich food as was customary to give to
    the Sangha and the needy. He continued, however, to give away whatever he had. The Buddha
    then addressed Anathapindika, who was rich in wisdom, and encouraged him in meditation by
    explaining the various benefits of wholesome actions. Comparing Anathapindika to a rich
    merchant named Velama of past eras who was equally generous, the Buddha said: ?More
    beneficial than large donations to the unworthy would be a single feeding of a noble
    disciple who is a Sotapanna. And progressively more beneficial than a single feeding of a
    Sotapanna is the feeding of a noble disciple who has attained Sakadagami, Anagami and
    Arahanthship. And even more beneficial than alms to a noble disciple who has attained
    Arahanthship would be the feeding of a Pacceka Buddha. And even more beneficial than
    feeding a Pacceka Buddha would be the giving of alms and building of monasteries for a
    Supreme Buddha. But better yet than gifts to the Buddha would be taking refuge in the
    Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha in confidence and observing the five precepts to perfection.
    And still more beneficial than taking refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha and
    observing the precepts to perfection would be one moment of all-encompassing radiation of
    compassion and loving-kindness to all living beings. Best of all, however, would be to
    cultivate, even for the time of a finger snap, insight into the impermanence of all things
    (insight meditation). And thus the Buddha explained the benefits of wholesome deeds and
    the supremacy of meditation on insight.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This also illustrates the Buddha&#146;s graduated method
    of teaching where He started a householder on generosity and moved him gradually to
    virtue, meditation on loving-kindness, and finally to insight. Without first mastering
    generosity and virtue and the all-encompassing meditation of loving-kindness one cannot
    contemplate the impermanence of all phenomena, for in the peace and quiet that is required
    for insight, pangs of conscience and other dark thoughts may arise.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha emphasized the importance of mental culture on
    another occasion. Anathapindika, together with one hundred noble men, had visited the
    Buddha at the Jetavana monastery, saluted Him, and sat respectfully awaiting His
    Teachings. The Buddha addressed them and said, &quot;Be sure you householders provide the
    monastic community with clothing, food, shelter and medicine. But you should not be
    satisfied with that. May you also from time to time strive to enter and abide in the joy
    of (meditative) seclusion.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also emphasized the necessity of virtue before
    one could embark on mental culture. He said, &quot;If the heart is corrupted then all
    actions, words, and thoughts are tainted. Such a person will be carried away by his
    passions and will have an unhappy death just as the gables, rafters and walls of a badly
    roofed house, being unprotected, will rot when drenched in rain.&quot; (Anguttara Nikaya)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On another occasion the Buddha explained to Anathapindika
    the attainment of Sotapanna, the first stage of sainthood. He explained that when the five
    fearsome evils have completely disappeared in a person, the four attributes of stream
    entry are present, and the noble method is wisely understood, a person could regard
    himself as a Sotapanna. The Buddha then elaborated on this brief statement. He explained
    that one who kills, steals, indulges in sexual misconduct, tells lies and takes
    intoxicants generates five fearsome evils both in the present and future and experiences
    pain and grief in mind. Whosoever keeps away from the five vices, for him the five
    fearsome evils are eliminated. The person possesses the four attributes of stream entry
    when he has unshakeable confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, observes the precepts
    flawlessly and has penetrated the noble method known as the doctrine of dependent
    origination. (Anguttara Nikaya)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anathapindika had a long and happy life in the Dhamma. One
    day when he was sick and in great pain, he requested the monks to visit him at his home.
    Sariputta and ananda, out of compassion for the great benefactor of the Sangha, visited
    him. Sariputta calmed Anathapindika&#146;s mind by reminding him that he was a Sotapanna,
    and as such on the path to enlightenment. He could not fall away from the Dhamma or obtain
    rebirth in one of the unhappy plains. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When one has confidence in the Tathagata,<br>
      Unshakable and well established,<br>
      And good conduct built on virtue,<br>
      Dear to the Noble Ones and praised,<br>
      When one has confidence in the Sangha,<br>
      And views that have been corrected,<br>
      They say that one is not poor,<br>
      That one&#146;s life is not in vain.<br>
      Therefore the person of intelligence<br>
      Remembering the Buddha&#146;s teaching,<br>
      Should be devoted to confidence and virtue,<br>
      To confidence and vision of the Dhamma.&quot;<br>
      -- (Samyutta Nikaya)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through the strength of this contemplation Anathapindika
    recalled his virtues and his confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. These thoughts
    relaxed Anatapindika&#146;s mind and gave him great happiness. The excruciating pain
    disappeared. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anatapindika was nearing death. Having great respect for
    Sariputta and confidence in him, Anatapindika requested his presence ?out of
    compassion.&quot; Sariputta, accompanied by ananda, gave an inspiring sermon on
    non-attachment. Anathapindika was moved to tears by the profound discourse, the likes of
    which he had never heard before. Sariputta then informed him that such profound discourses
    were usually taught to the Sangha, not to white-clothed lay disciples. Anathapindika then
    urged Sariputta not to restrict the advanced teachings just to the Sangha. He said, ?Let
    such talks on the Dhamma be given to white-clad lay disciples also, for there are those
    with just a little dust in their eyes. If they do not hear such teachings they will be
    lost. Some may be able to understand.? Shortly after Sariputta and ananda left,
    Anathapindika died and was reborn in the Tusita heaven as a Deva. His gratitude and
    reverence for the Buddha were so great that he was drawn to Jetavana where the Buddha was
    residing. That night he came in splendour to Jetavana to praise the glory of the Buddha,
    His Teaching, and His chief disciple. Saluting the Buddha he said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This indeed is that Jeta&#146;s Grove,<br>
      The resort of the Order of Seers,<br>
      Dwelt in by the Dhamma King,<br>
      A place that gives joy to me.<br>
      By action, knowledge and righteousness,<br>
      By virtue and an excellent life,<br>
      By this are mortals purified,<br>
      Not by clan or by wealth.<br>
      Therefore a person who is wise,<br>
      Out of regard for his own good,<br>
      Should carefully examine the Dhamma,<br>
      Thus he is purified therein.<br>
      Sariputta truly is endowed with wisdom,<br>
      With virtue and with inner peace,<br>
      Even a monk that has gone beyond,<br>
      At best can only equal him.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha declared Anathapindika to be His chief lay male
    benefactor. His generosity, virtue and exemplary behaviour are an example to all lay
    disciples. Many Buddhists emulate his lifestyle and use him as a role model.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">31. Visakha</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the City of Bhaddiya, in the kingdom of Magadha, there
    lived an extremely rich merchant named Mendaka. In a previous birth, during the time of a
    famine, he and his family had given their last provisions to a Pacceka Buddha. Resulting
    from this heartfelt gift, Mendaka and his family, (whom kamma had brought together again)
    had provisions in their home which could not be exhausted despite the fact that they still
    continued to practise generosity to the extreme. His son, Dhananjaya, and daughter-in-law,
    Sumanadevi, had an exquisitely beautiful daughter named Visakha. They lived in extreme
    wealth and comfort and were well-known for their generosity, which they practised to all. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, when Visakha was seven years old, the Buddha
    visited Bhaddiya with a large retinue of monks. When Mendaka heard of the Buddha&#146;s
    arrival he called his young granddaughter and instructed her to gather her maidservants
    and go out to greet the Buddha. Visakha did as she was told. She paid homage to the Buddha
    and prepared to listen to His teaching. The Buddha instructed Visakha on the Dhamma and
    established her and her entourage of 500 maidservants in the first stage of sainthood,
    Sotapanna. Mendaka, his wife, son, daughter-in-law and many other servants of the
    household who were present, also attained the first stage of sainthood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The kingdom of Magadha was ruled by the righteous King
    Bimbisara. King Pasenadi Kosala, feeling that such a generous and well-respected family
    would be an asset to his kingdom, asked his friend, King Bimbisara, if Dhananjaya and his
    family would move to Kosala where they could be an example to his subjects. King Bimbisara
    complied with his friend&#146;s request. Dhananjaya and his family moved to Kosala where
    they lived an exemplary life whilst practising the Dhamma. Visakha grew up in luxury with
    the opportunity to practise generosity and the Dhamma, to which she listened frequently.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that time, there lived in Savatthi a rich merchant
    named Migara who had a son named Punnavaddhana. Despite his parents&#146; pleas,
    Punnavaddhana had refused to marry, insisting that his bride should be an exquisite beauty
    who possessed the five maidenly attributes: beauty of hair, teeth, skin, youth and form.
    Her hair had to be glossy and thick, reaching down to her ankles. Her teeth had to be
    white and even like a row of pearls. Her skin had to be of golden hue, soft and flawless.
    She had to be in the peak of youth, about sixteen. She had to have a beautiful, feminine
    figure, not too fat and not too thin. Migara, in desperation, sent a team of Brahmins to
    search throughout the kingdom for one who possessed all of his son&#146;s requirements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At this time, the exquisitely beautiful Visakha,
    accompanied by her maidservants, was on her way to the river to bathe when they were
    caught by an unexpected storm. The maids ran for shelter while Visakha walked calmly and
    gracefully to the shelter. Migara&#146;s Brahmins, seeing the graceful Visakha, questioned
    her as to why she had not run to avoid getting wet. Visakha informed Migara&#146;s men
    that it was not appropriate for a maiden in her fine clothes to run, just as it was not
    appropriate for a king in royal attire, a royal elephant dressed for the parade, or a
    serene monk in robes, to run. Pleased with her reply and her exquisite beauty they went
    back and informed Migara that a suitable bride had been found for Punnavaddhana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Both families were happy with the arrangement. And so it
    was that Visakha, with great ceremony, was given in marriage by her father to
    Punnavaddhana. Her father, who was devoted to her, provided Visakha with many gifts and an
    exquisite jewelled headdress that reached all the way down her long hair to her feet, as a
    wedding gift. He also advised her on the appropriate conduct for a married woman. The
    advice he gave his daughter was as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. As long as you live with your in-laws you should not
      tell the faults of your husband and in-laws to outsiders.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. If any of your neighbours speak ill of your husband or
      in-laws it should not be encouraged or repeated to them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Lend money and articles to those who will return them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Do not lend anything to those who will not return them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. When a relative or friend is in need you should help
      them without seeking repayment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. When you see your husband or in-laws approach you
      should stand up with respect.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. You should not eat before your husband or in-laws.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. You should not go to bed before your husband or
      in-laws.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">9. You should regard your husband and your in-laws as a
      flame; carefully and with respect.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">10. You should look up to and respect your husband and
      in-laws as divinities.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whilst this advice that Dhananjaya gave to his daughter
    would not be acceptable to most modern women, it was what was expected of women at the
    time of the Buddha. Visakha, who abided by this advice and instruction, was considered a
    model wife.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As Visakha&#146;s beauty and generosity were well-known
    many well-wishers came to honour the beautiful bride and shower her with gifts. With her
    love for generosity,Visakha distributed these gifts to the needy in Savatthi. So pleased
    were the people with her act that she soon became everybody&#146;s favourite. As was the
    custom at that time, Visakha lived with her husband&#146;s family.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visakha&#146;s father-in-law, Migara, was a devotee of a
    clan of naked ascetics. Even though the Buddha and His disciples lived in a monastery
    close to their home, they were not invited to Migara&#146;s house. One day Migara invited
    the naked ascetics and asked Visakha to attend to their needs. Visakha was horrified at
    their lack of modesty and refused. This caused much anger among the naked ascetics who
    condemned Migara for bringing a female devotee of the Ascetic Gotama into his house.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Shortly after this incident, when Migara was eating rich
    rice pudding in a golden bowl, a Buddhist monk came for alms. Even though Migara could see
    the monk he ignored him and continued with his meal. Visakha, who was fanning her
    father-in-law, requested the monk to leave by saying, ?Pass on, Venerable Sir, my
    father-in-law eats stale food.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Migara, who ate rich, fresh food in a golden bowl, was
    furious at these words which he felt were an insult. He commanded Visakha to leave his
    house and go back to her parents. Instead, she called in an independent mediator to judge
    her conduct. She explained to the adviser that the rich food her father-in-law was eating
    were benefits resulting from his past good deeds. As such, instead of performing wholesome
    deeds which would ensure continued prosperity, he was &quot;eating stale fare&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Migara understood the meaning of Visakha&#146;s words
    he asked her forgiveness. Visakha, however, decided that she no longer wished to live with
    her husband&#146;s family. This was not the first time that she had been accused
    wrongfully by Migara. She decided to go back to her parents. Migara, who had finally
    realized the noble qualities of his daughter-in-law, was horrified. He begged her to
    remain. Visakha agreed to remain if she was allowed to invite the Buddha and His retinue
    to their home for meals. When Migara agreed, Visakha invited the Buddha and His retinue of
    monks for their meal and made arrangements for the preparation of rich food.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the meal the Buddha dispensed the Dhamma. Migara and
    his wife, who were both spiritually developed as a result of past meritorious effort, both
    attained the first stage of sainthood, Sotapanna. After this, Migara, who was deeply
    grateful to Visakha, called her Migara Mata, or mother of Migara, and respected her as he
    would his own mother. He also became a devotee of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In great joy, Visakha continued to perform generosity to
    the Buddha and His retinue of monks. She had ten sons and ten daughters whom she brought
    up in the Dhamma. Being fond of beautiful clothes and ornaments, Visakha indulged herself,
    always dressing her best in exquisite garments. One day she accidentally left her
    priceless jewelled head-dress at the Jetavana, the monastery in which the Buddha was
    residing. Feeling that an item left in the monastery should not be taken back, she offered
    it to the Buddha. On being told that priceless treasures were of no value to His retinue
    of monks, Visakha offered the jewelled head-dress for sale with the idea of building
    monasteries and providing the requisites with the money generated. Unable to find a buyer
    who could afford the exquisite jewelled head-dress, she bought it herself and used the
    money to build the Pubbarama Monastery (also known as the Mansion of Migara&#146;s Mother)
    to support the Buddha and His retinue of monks and nuns.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visakha was overjoyed with her gift to the Buddha. On the
    day that she gifted the monastery to the Buddha, she sang songs of joy and walked around
    the Pubbarama together with her children and grandchildren. The Buddha informed the people
    that Visakha was singing songs of joy because she had just fulfilled an aspiration made
    many world cycles ago to be the chief female lay disciple of the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha spent nine rainy seasons at the Pubbarama
    Monastery, during which time He dispensed many Suttas and helped many persons. On one
    occasion, He was residing at the Pubbarama when a disturbance attracted His attention. He
    saw a dishevelled Visakha in wet clothes running towards Him in tears. Visakha was bathing
    in the river when the news of the death of her favourite grandchild, Datta, reached her.
    Unable to control her grief, she ran to the Buddha for solace and comfort. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha questioned her as to the cause of
    Visakha&#146;s grief and was told that it was because her beloved grandchild had died. She
    went on to explain how much happiness the child had brought her. The Buddha then asked her
    if she would be happy if she had as many grandchildren as there were citizens in Savatthi.
    Visakha confirmed that she would indeed be very happy as her grandchildren brought her
    untold happiness. The Buddha then asked Visakha how many of Savatthi&#146;s citizens died
    each day. Visakha replied that many died each day. The Buddha then explained to her the
    impermanence of life. &quot;Death,&quot; he said, ?comes to all living beings. Think then
    how unhappy you will be, for you will have so many more grandchildren, some of whom will
    die each day. Surely then you will be coming like this to me for comfort many, many more
    times.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visakha reflected on the Buddha&#146;s words and realized
    that the stronger her attachment, the greater would be her grief at separation.
    Understanding through realization that all component things are impermanent, she composed
    herself and left the Buddha. Visakha was able to understand this because she had reached
    the first stage of sainthood, Sotapanna, at a young age after listening to the
    Buddha&#146;s teaching. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visakha also helped many noble ladies in the Dhamma. Once
    when she took a large gathering of ladies to hear the Dhamma she was horrified to see that
    they had consumed large quantities of intoxicants and behaved in an unladylike manner. She
    then asked the Buddha how humans had first become involved with intoxicants. The Buddha
    then dispensed the Kumbha Jataka, where a man had found fermented fruit and water in the
    crevice of a tree and started to consume the fermented liquid to obtain a false feeling of
    well-being.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also helped Visakha on another occasion, when
    she was upset at some unfair taxes that had been levied upon her. Visakha had mailed a
    parcel to some relatives and the border guards had charged an unreasonably high levy on
    the goods. Visakha had complained to the king but, due to pressures of state affairs, he
    had ignored her complaint. Annoyed and angry, Visakha visited the Buddha for solace. The
    Buddha calmed her mind by saying:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Painful is all subjection,<br>
      Blissful is complete control.<br>
      People are troubled by common concerns,<br>
      Hard to escape are the bonds.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These words of wisdom from the Buddha helped Visakha put
    this minor irritation in perspective. The Buddha&#146;s advice is as valid today as it was
    2,500 years ago. So strong are the bonds of craving and attachment that often we are
    angered and affected by small issues, quite a number of which are outside our control and
    trivial when compared to other issues of greater consequence that afflict mankind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visakha often questioned the Buddha on subjects that
    interested her, and the Anguttara Nikaya contains three suttas that the Buddha dispensed
    to her in answer to her questions. In one instance Visakha asked the Buddha what qualities
    in a woman would enable her to conquer this world and the next. The Buddha replied:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;She conquers this world by industry, care for her
      servants, love for her husband and by guarding his property. She conquers the other world
      by confidence, virtue, generosity and wisdom.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also instructed Visakha on the appropriate way
    to observe the religious holidays (uposatha). Visakha had observed the religious holiday
    and come to Him for instruction on the best way to observe the holiday. After first
    informing her of the wrong ways of observing the holidays, the Buddha informed her of the
    correct way by saying that she should observe the eight precepts, reflect on the greatness
    and good qualities of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, reflect on the virtues of the Devas,
    and reflect on her own virtues. The Buddha then went on to describe the happy and carefree
    life of the Devas and concluded by saying, &quot;Miserable is the glory of the humans
    compared to such heavenly bliss.&quot; The Buddha described the wonders of heavenly birth
    as He knew that Visakha, who was a Sotapanna, would at death enjoy such heavenly bliss.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day when the Buddha was residing in the Pubbarama,
    Visakha approached the Buddha and asked for eight boons. The Buddha informed her that The
    Perfect One was beyond the practice of granting boons. She then informed Him that these
    boons would be of great benefit to the Sangha and that they were allowable boons. With the
    Buddha&#146;s consent, Visakha asked the Buddha to be allowed to give the following gifts
    to the Order:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Robes for the rains, as monks trying to preserve their
      robes sometimes ran half-naked in the rains, which was not appropriate.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Food for arriving monks, as monks who had arrived in
      Savatthi after a long journey were tired and did not know the town. As such seeking alms
      would be difficult for them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Food for monks setting out on a journey, so that they
      would be strong and well-fed for the journey ahead.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Medicine for sick monks, as sick monks were in pain and
      suffering.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. Food for sick monks, as sick monks were not in a
      position to seek alms.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. Food for monks tending the sick, as they often did not
      get food because they went on the alms round after tending the sick and were late for
      their alms round.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. Regular distribution of rice gruel for the morning, as
      it was healthy and nourishing for the Sangha who do not partake in food after noon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. Bathing robes for nuns to bathe in the river, as nuns
      who did not have bathing robes often had to expose their bodies while bathing, which was
      not appropriate.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then questioned Visakha on what inner benefits
    she expected from the giving of these gifts. Visakha replied that often the Sangha who
    have spent the rains at different locations come to the Buddha and ask Him about a monk
    (or nun) who has passed away and question Him as to the place of rebirth. The Blessed one
    will then explain his (or her) attainment and place of rebirth. I shall approach the monk
    and ask, ?Lord, did that Bhikkhu (Bhikkhuni) ever come to Savatthi? And if he answers yes,
    I shall conclude that surely a rains cloth will have been used by this Bhikkhu, or
    visitors&#146; food, or food for one going on a journey, or food for the sick, or food for
    those tending the sick, or rice gruel. And when I reflect thus, I shall be glad and happy.
    When my mind is happy my body will be tranquil. When my body is tranquil I shall feel
    pleasure. When I feel pleasure my mind will become concentrated. This will result in the
    development of the spiritual faculties and powers and the enlightenment faculties. This,
    Lord, is the benefit that I foresee for myself.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Praising Visakha for asking the eight boons, the Buddha
    granted her permission to give gifts to the Sangha as requested. The manner in which
    Visakha gives gifts is noteworthy. Not only is the intention intense but she holds the
    intensity during the time of preparation (before), during the time of giving and when
    reflecting on the gift (after) the act of generosity. This intense happiness or volition
    before, during, and after the act of generosity ensures maximum results. Giving with the
    intention of purifying oneself, developing one&#146;s mind, and attaining Enlightenment is
    the proper way to give a gift and we should all learn from Visakha, the Buddha&#146;s
    chief female lay benefactor, on the appropriate way to practise generosity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of her generosity to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and
    the Sangha, the Buddha declared that Visakha was His chief female lay benefactor. In
    addition to providing the requisites to the Buddha and the Sangha, Visakha also helped
    with issues and disputes that arose among the nuns. She led a long and healthy life and
    passed away at the age of 120. Visakha, who possessed the five attributes of maidenly
    beauty, was said to have been exquisitely beautiful to the end, retaining her youthful
    form and beauty throughout her latter years.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">32. Citta</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Citta was a wealthy merchant who owned a small hamlet
    named Migapathaka and a forest named Ambarukkhavana. He presented the Ambarukkhavana to
    the Buddha and His disciples and built a monastery for the Noble One to use as a
    residence. Citta was one of the Buddha&#146;s model lay disciples. Just as the Buddha
    encouraged His monks to emulate Sariputta and Moggallana, He encouraged young men to
    emulate Citta, by saying, &quot;Should a devoted mother wish to encourage her beloved only
    son in a proper way, she may tell him to emulate the householders Citta and Hatthaka. They
    are the guiding students for my lay disciples.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When deciding on the Noble One foremost in expounding the
    Dhamma, the Buddha appointed the Bhikkhu Punna Mantaniputta (who helped ananda attain
    Sotapanna) and the nun Dhammadinna. Likewise, among the laity, the householder Citta was
    appointed by the Buddha as the lay disciple foremost in expounding the Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This was not Citta&#146;s first encounter with the Buddha.
    The Jataka stories relate that they were closely associated in a former birth. Citta was
    the Bodhisatta&#146;s servant in a past birth and followed his master into renunciation
    (Jataka 488). He was a disciple of Maha Kacchana and had learned analytical and
    organizational skills, which helped him to expound the Dhamma in a manner that people
    could very easily understand.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Citta paid great respect and reverence to a certain
    Bhikkhu named Sudhamma who had entered the Noble Order after hearing the Dhamma from
    Citta. One day Sariputta, Moggallana, Anuruddha, ananda and several other great disciples
    arrived at Macchikasanda, the city in which Citta lived. Citta approached them and
    listened to the Dhamma. Sariputta dispensed a profound discourse, which resulted in
    Citta&#146;s attaining the second stage of sainthood, Sakadagami. Citta immediately
    invited the distinguished elders for the following day&#146;s meals. Afterwards he
    realized that he had left out Sudhamma, to whom he had previously extended his hospitality
    consistently. Approaching Sudhamma, he let him know of the invitation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Sudhamma found out about Citta&#146;s invitation to
    others he was suffused with jealousy and reprimanded Citta for not having informed him
    earlier. Even though Citta had since invited him, Sudhamma scornfully declined. However,
    he could not refuse Citta&#146;s invitation. He joined the others as if nothing had
    happened and praised Citta&#146;s hospitality. But then he showed his true jealousy by
    adding scornfully that the meal would have been complete if Citta had offered cream cakes.
    Citta replied that his favourite monk&#146;s behaviour reminded him of a story of a hybrid
    of a cock and a crow. The story illustrated the fact that jealousy and the refusal of the
    invitation were inappropriate behaviours for a monk. And criticizing the food showed poor
    manners towards a householder. Sudhamma was insulted by this comparison and left abruptly.
    Citta asked him to visit the Buddha and explain what had happened.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sudhamma went to the Buddha and complained to Him about
    the unfavourable comparison made by Citta. The Buddha, however, admonished Sudhamma by
    saying that his behaviour was inappropriate for a Bhikkhu. Not only was it inappropriate
    for him to have refused Citta&#146;s invitation through jealousy, but it was also
    inappropriate that he should have insulted his generous host by complaining about the food
    served. The Buddha asked, &quot;How could you insult a faithful lay disciple like
    Citta?&quot; At a meeting of the Sangha where the Bhikkhus&#146; transgressions were
    discussed it was decided that Sudhamma should ask Citta&#146;s forgiveness for his
    behaviour. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sudhamma then set out to beg forgiveness but on reaching
    Citta&#146;s house turned back in embarrassment. When the Buddha heard that Sudhamma did
    not apologize to Citta He had another monk accompany Sudhamma to give him the confidence
    required to own up to his inappropriate behaviour.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From this incident we see a very significant aspect of the
    Buddha&#146;s teaching. The Buddha always encouraged persons who had done wrong deeds to
    ask for forgiveness. But forgiveness was asked from those whom one had wronged. The Buddha
    realized that people make mistakes and even Bhikkhus from time to time behave badly. He
    did not grant forgiveness for such deeds. Forgiveness for such deeds could only be granted
    by the person who had been wronged. The wrongdoer reduces the negative effect of his wrong
    act by genuine regret. But forgiveness can only be received from the wronged. Whilst one
    may feel better about the misdeed when admitting wrongdoing to a friend or colleague, they
    cannot reduce or mitigate the wrong. That can be done only through true regret to the
    wronged. The wronged should then graciously accept the apology and grant forgiveness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Forgiveness from the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha that
    Buddhists ask for in their daily reciting is a forgiveness for wrongs done to the Buddha,
    Dhamma and Sangha. Buddhists observe the precepts (modes of conduct) daily but often break
    the vows they have taken. As these vows are taken of their own free will Buddhists ask for
    forgiveness from the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha when they break the precepts. Forgiveness
    that Buddhists request is for transgressions of the precepts they take daily and for other
    wrongful deeds they may have committed against the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. Buddhist do
    not ask the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha for forgiveness for wrongful deeds they may have
    done to another person. Forgiveness for these should be obtained from the person to whom
    the wrongful deed was done.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first documented teaching by Citta relates an event
    where some senior Bhikkhus were sitting together in the entrance of the monastery
    discussing whether fetters and sense objects are one and the same. Some of the monks felt
    that they were the same, while some felt that they were not. Citta joined the gathering
    and the monks asked him his opinion. He declared that in his view fetters and sense
    objects were different not only in name but also in meaning.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Citta then used an example to illustrate his viewpoint. He
    said that just as a pair of black and white oxen tied to a cart were not fetters to each
    other but were both fettered by a single rope or yoke strap, the sense faculties do not
    bind the external objects. Instead, they are bound or yoked by craving. The Bhikkhus
    praised Citta&#146;s understanding of the Dhamma and said that he must surely possess the
    eye of wisdom.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On another occasion a Bhikkhu named Kamabhu recited a
    stanza dispensed by the Buddha and asked Citta for its meaning. The stanza with which he
    needed help was as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The faultless chariot with its one axle,<br>
      And white canopy rolls.<br>
      See him coming without blemish,<br>
      Without ties, the one who has crossed the stream.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After some reflection Citta explained that the Buddha was
    referring to an Arahanth, who, without blemish or ties, has crossed the stream. He has
    done away with greed, hatred and delusion and is safe from the ocean of craving. The
    chariot is the body, the one axle is mindfulness, the smooth, frictionless holding
    together of the parts (faultless) is virtue and the white canopy is the final deliverance
    of emancipation. Impressed by his explanation, the Bhikkhu Kamabhu thanked Citta and
    praised him by saying that he had surely achieved great wisdom to be able to explain such
    complex teachings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day after some Bhikkhus had partaken of alms at
    Citta&#146;s house, he accompanied them back to the monastery. It was an extremely hot and
    dusty day and the monks were perspiring freely. The youngest Bhikkhu, Mahaka, remarked
    that it was very hot and that wind and rain would certainly be welcome. In this instance
    Mahaka was not just making an observation. He, who had supernormal powers, was asking
    permission to use these powers to activate rain. When permission was granted and Mahaka
    did procure rain to refresh his companions, Citta was very impressed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Citta then approached Mahaka and asked him to demonstrate
    more of his supernormal powers. The Buddha had specifically forbidden monks to show off
    their supernormal powers to the householders for purposes of impressing them or creating
    awe. Mahaka, however, was very young. Enjoying the praise and attention he was receiving,
    he placed his coat on a bale of hay and went inside his meditation cell. Then, closing the
    door, he created a tremendously powerful beam that penetrated through the keyhole and
    burnt the hay while it left the coat untouched.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Impressed by the powers of one so young, Citta offered to
    support Mahaka for life. Mahaka, however, realized that he had disobeyed the instruction
    of the Buddha by showing off his powers. Refusing Citta&#146;s generosity, he left the
    city in search of a place where he would not be known.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Citta used his knowledge to help both believers and
    non-believers. A naked ascetic by the name of Kassapa, who was a family friend, decided to
    visit Citta when he visited Migapathaka. Citta questioned him as to how long he had
    practised this form of asceticism. His friend replied that he had been an ascetic for
    thirty years. Citta then asked Kassapa if he had attained any superhuman states of bliss
    or supernormal insight. Kassapa replied that he had not, that all he had done was to go
    about naked, shaving his head and dusting his seat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kassapa then questioned Citta on how long he had been a
    follower of the Buddha. When Citta replied that he had been a lay disciple for thirty
    years, Kassapa asked him if he had attained any superhuman states. Citta replied that he
    had most certainly attained the four Jhanas of mental ecstasy and that if Kassapa
    questioned the Blessed One He would confirm that no fetters bound him to the sense
    spheres. Kassapa immediately realized that Citta was Anagami or non-returner, for it was
    only those who had attained the stage of Anagami who were assured of birth in a non-sense
    sphere Brahma world. Kassapa was also surprised that his friend, who was a householder,
    had attained such a high stage of spiritual development when he himself, worn out through
    the practice of extreme austerities, had gained none. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Reflecting on his friend&#146;s achievements, Kassapa
    asked Citta to help him take the robes under the Blessed One. He was duly ordained and
    before long attained Arahanthship. Other friends of Citta&#146;s such as Sudhamma,
    Godatta, and Isidatta also became Bhikkhus after discussing the Dhamma with him. They all
    attained the supreme bliss of Arahanthship and surpassed Citta who reached only the third
    stage of sainthood. The text does not specify as to why Citta had not considered joining
    the Noble Order when he had encouraged many of his friends to do so. It is assumed that it
    is because of his personal life and some obligations he had that necessitated that he
    remain as a householder.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The laymen, Bhikkhus and Devas respected Citta as a great
    teacher. When he fell ill just prior to his death, the Devas appeared to him and urged him
    to aspire to be a world monarch in his next life. Citta then informed them that he was
    seeking something nobler and higher than to be a world monarch in his next life. He was
    aspiring for the unconditioned Nibbana. The Devas were obviously not aware that Citta had
    reached the third stage of sainthood. Those who attain Anagami are reborn in the
    Suddhavassa Brahma Realm where they eventually attain Arahanthship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Citta&#146;s relatives, unable to view the Devas, thought
    that he was delirious as it seemed as if he was talking to himself. He reassured them by
    affirming that he was talking to invisible divine beings. Then, at the request of the
    Devas, he gave his last advice to those gathered. Citta requested them to have trust and
    confidence in the Buddha and the Dhamma and to remain unswervingly generous to the Sangha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">33. Rohini</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rohini was one of the Buddha&#146;s cousins and the sister
    of Anuruddha. When the ladies of the court decided to follow Pajapati Gotami and join the
    order of nuns, Rohini declined.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Anuruddha visited Kapilavatthu with a large retinue
    of monks, all his relatives came to the monastery to pay their respects. Rohini, however,
    did not come. When Anuruddha inquired as to why his sister had not come he was informed
    that she was embarrassed to face people as she was suffering from an unsightly skin rash.
    Anuruddha asked that she be brought to his presence. Rohini came with her face covered by
    a veil. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anuruddha asked Rohini to construct an assembly hall for
    the monks and nuns, as her affliction was of kammic origin. As she did not have the money
    needed to construct an assembly hall, she decided to sell her jewels to obtain the
    required funds. With the help of her Sakyan cousins and under the guidance of the Ven.
    Anuruddha, an assembly hall was built for the Buddha and His retinue. Upon the completion
    of the structure, Rohini&#146;s unsightly rash disappeared. Rohini then invited the Buddha
    and His retinue for a meal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, having asked on whose account the assembly
    hall was built and who had provided the meal, was informed of Rohini&#146;s surprising
    story. He then informed her of the cause of her unsightly rash. Many births ago she had
    been the chief consort of the King of Benares. She had had a falling out with one of the
    king&#146;s dancing girls, whom he favoured. Rohini, who was jealous of the dancing girl,
    had secured scabs from an infected person, crushed them to a powder and spread them on the
    bed and over the face of the dancing girl. This had led to an infection that had caused an
    ugly rash on the skin of the dancing girl. The kammic effect of this unwholesome act was
    the ugly rash that Rohini had. The wholesome effects of the building of the assembly hall
    had helped to nullify the effects of this evil kamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After listening to the Dhamma, Rohini attained the first
    stage of sainthood, Sotapanna. She became a supporter of the Buddha and His monks and
    continued to perform many meritorious deeds. At death she passed away to the Tavatimsa
    Heaven where she was born as the very beautiful consort of Sakka, the king of the
    Tavatimsa Heaven.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">34. Jivaka</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Prince Abhaya, the son of King Bimbisara, was riding
    through the city when he saw a flock of crows circling and cawing loudly around a small
    bundle. Stopping his carriage, he investigated the sound and found a newborn baby boy who
    had been left to die amongst the garbage on the roadside. Upon inquiry he learned that a
    courtesan had discarded her illegitimate son whom she felt was a burden, and had left him
    to die. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Prince Abhaya was transfused with compassion for the
    newborn babe that still clung to life despite its ugly surroundings. He decided to adopt
    the baby as his own. The baby was named Jivaka Komara Bhacca &#150; Jivaka, meaning
    &#145;life&#146;, because of his will to live, and Komara Bhacca, which meant
    &#145;adopted by a prince&#146;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jivaka led a privileged life in the palace. His friends,
    however, often teased him as he had no mother. Jivaka, who was embarrassed by the teasing,
    questioned his father about his origin. When he heard about his origins and his will to
    live he decided that he would one day grow up to be a preserver of life. He felt that he
    had no real heritage or family as he was only the adopted son of the prince. Physicians,
    however, were treated with great respect. Determined to earn the respect he felt he lacked
    due to his birth, Jivaka decided to go to the University of Taxila to become a physician. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jivaka approached Disapamok, a well-known scholar, for his
    training. At this time Sakka, the King of the Heavens, was observing the world. He
    realized that it was time for Jivaka, who had in past births aspired to be the physician
    of the Buddha, to begin his training. Sakka, however, wanted to ensure that Jivaka had
    more than just the best training available in India. This was the young man who would have
    the privilege to be the physician of the Buddha. Sakka decided to take a hand in the
    training of young Jivaka so that he would have celestial knowledge in the art of medicine.
    With this in view, He entered the body of Disapamok. Jivaka excelled in his studies.
    Disapamok, however, soon realized that the training that he was providing was being
    influenced by celestial beings. The knowledge that was being imparted through him far
    excelled his knowledge of medicine. Jivaka quickly learned medicines and cures of which
    Disapamok himself had no knowledge. Jivaka completed in seven years the physicians
    training which usually took eleven years.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Realizing that Jivaka&#146;s education was complete,
    Disapamok asked him to go forth and bring back a plant, herb or root that could not be
    used for medicinal purposes for the preservation of life. After travelling far and wide
    Jivaka returned to his teacher to inform him that no such plant, herb, or root existed.
    All of nature&#146;s treasures were beneficial for the preservation of life. The joyous
    teacher then praised his pupil by informing him that his education was complete. Jivaka
    had surpassed his teacher in knowledge.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jivaka decided to go back to Rajagaha to his adoptive
    father. On the way he stopped to rest in a city named Saletha. He soon heard that the
    young daughter of the city&#146;s wealthiest nobleman was sick. Despite the ministering of
    many well-known physicians, she had suffered from severe headaches for seven years. Jivaka
    approached the nobleman, as he was confident that he could cure the maiden. The maiden,
    however, was not impressed by the very young man who claimed he could cure her when older,
    well-known physicians had failed. Offering his services for free, Jivaka continued to
    declare boldly that he could cure her.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Gathering herbs and roots, Jivaka prepared the medicine
    which he then administered to her through her nostrils. Before long the maiden&#146;s
    headaches disappeared. The grateful nobleman showered Jivaka with gifts and gold and
    provided him with a golden chariot. Jivaka approached Prince Abhaya&#146;s palace in great
    style. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Handing over his newly earned wealth to his adoptive
    father, Jivaka thanked him for his love, compassion, and caring. Prince Abhaya, however,
    returned all the wealth to Jivaka and informed him that he owed him naught as he was his
    true son and heir. He then told him that during his absence he had found out the full
    story of his origin. His mother, Salawathi, was the sought-after courtesan of the kings
    and nobility. Wanting to retain her freedom, she had discarded the baby whom she felt
    would be a burden to her. Prince Abhaya had unknowingly adopted his own child as he had
    loved his son dearly even prior to knowing that he was in fact his own child. Prince
    Abhaya built a palace to serve as Jivaka&#146;s residence and provided him with many
    servants.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jivaka&#146;s second patient was none other than his own
    grandfather, King Bimbisara. The king had a huge growth in his stomach that bled from time
    to time on his royal robe. So prominent was the growth that his consorts had started to
    tease the king by saying that he was with child. The king had been treated by all the
    great physicians of the country to no avail. Prince Abhaya informed Jivaka of his
    grandfather&#146;s plight.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Diagnosing the disease sight unseen, Jivaka immediately
    prepared the suitable medicine. Then hiding it on his person, he visited the king. After
    examining the king he administered the medicine that he had brought with him. Before long
    the king&#146;s growth shrank and his wound healed. The grateful king called his entourage
    of five hundred consorts who had teased him unmercifully by asking if his first-born was
    to be a boy or a girl, and commanded them to give all their jewellery as a gift to Jivaka.
    Before long a mound of precious jewellery higher than Jivaka himself was placed at his
    feet. However, Jivaka refused this payment and requested permission from the king to
    return the ornaments back to his consorts. Even more impressed by Jivaka&#146;s
    deportment, the king showered him with wealth, gifted him with the royal mango grove and
    made him the royal physician. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jivaka&#146;s reputation as a great physician grew
    quickly. He was the physician of kings, noblemen and the Buddha. The text mentions that he
    operated and successfully removed two tumours from the brain of a rich merchant who was a
    good friend of King Bimbisara. He also operated successfully to remove a blockage in the
    intestines of a nobleman. In one instance when the Buddha was afflicted with stomach
    problems, Jivaka prepared the medicine, and applying it on a blue lotus flower, offered it
    to the Buddha. Jivaka then asked the Buddha to inhale the essence emanating from the
    flower. The medicine which Jivaka had prepared with devotion and presented so beautifully,
    cured the Buddha&#146;s stomach ailment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jivaka had in one instance risked his life to attend a
    very cruel and vicious king named Chanda Pradyotha. One of the King Pradyotha&#146;s
    subjects had offered him a shawl that had been dropped by a Deva in the forest. Admiring
    the very beautiful shawl, the king had reflected that he should gift it to Jivaka who had
    risked his life to save him. Jivaka, however, felt that there was only one person worthy
    of such a shawl. He in turn offered it to the Buddha. The Buddha accepted the celestial
    shawl and, as requested by Jivaka, dispensed a sermon on the giving of robes. After
    listening to the discourse, Jivaka attained the first stage of enlightenment, Sotapanna.
    The Buddha felt that keeping such a valuable shawl in the monastery would attract thieves,
    which would endanger His monks. Addressing ananda, he requested that the shawl be cut into
    strips and resewn so that it would be of little value to thieves. This custom of wearing
    patched garments still remains among the Sangha. Even their new robes are made of strips
    of material that are sewn together so that even the robe they wear would help them in the
    practice of non-attachment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jivaka built a monastery in his mango grove so that he
    could be close to the Buddha when attending to His needs. It was Jivaka who attended to
    the Buddha&#146;sfoot when it was cut by the sliver of rock that Devadatta rolled down the
    hill at Gijjhakuta. It was also Jivaka who treated the Buddha in His last days, when He
    was overcome by stomach pains.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha dispensed the Jivaka Sutta when Jivaka
    questioned him on the controversial question of the kammic effects of eating meat. The
    Buddha explained that the eating of meat was not in itself an unwholesome act if the
    following conditions were met:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Adittha: </b>One has not seen the slaughtering of the
      animal.</font></p>
      <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Asuta: </b>One has not heard that it was killed for his
      or her consumption.</font></p>
      <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Aparisamkita: </b>There should be no doubt at all in
      the mind of the person consuming the meat that the animal was not killed for the purpose
      of his or her consumption.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Taking life, beating, cutting, binding, stealing,
      lying, fraud, deceit, pretence at knowledge, adultery; this is uncleanliness and not the
      eating of flesh.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When men are rough and harsh, backbiting, treacherous,
      without compassion, haughty, ungenerous and do not give anything to anybody; this is
      uncleanliness and not the eating of flesh.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anger, pride, obstinacy, antagonism, hypocrisy, envy,
      ostentation, pride of opinion, interacting with the unrighteous; this is uncleanliness and
      not the eating of flesh.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When men are of bad morals, refuse to pay their debts, are
      slanderers, deceitful in their dealings, pretenders, when the vilest of men commit foul
      deeds; this is uncleanliness and not the eating of flesh.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When men attack living beings either because of greed or
      hostility and are always bent upon evil, they go to darkness after death and fall headlong
      into hell; this is uncleanliness and not the eating of flesh.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jivaka, I have declared that one should not make use of
      meat if it has been seen, heard or suspected to have been killed on purpose for a monk. I
      allow the monks meat that is quite pure in three respects: if it has not been seen, heard
      or suspected to have been killed on purpose for a monk.&quot; -- </i>(Amagandha Sutta)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha&#146;s teaching is known as the middle path. He
    did not go to extremes or command anyone to do anything. While he gave permission for His
    monks to be vegetarians if they so wished, He did not state this to be a discipline rule
    as he felt that doing so would cause unnecessary hardship to His monks. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists should refrain from eating meat that has been
    seen, heard or suspected to have been killed for them. Buddhists should also refrain from
    killing, instigating others to kill or from a livelihood that involves the breeding of
    animals for killing. Monks have also been instructed in the Vinaya Pitaka to refrain from
    eating certain types of meat such as snake and elephant flesh, because wild animals are
    attracted to the smell of such flesh and tend to attack those who have partaken of such
    meat. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha has declared that <i><b>kamma is intention</b></i>.
    As such one should not condemn a person just because he is eating meat to sustain himself.
    This is not the same as a person who is eating meat as a result of intense greed for meat
    and enjoyment in killing for the palate. Neither should one discourage those who have
    chosen to refrain from eating meat. A balanced diet can be achieved without meat. Many
    Buddhists have opted to become vegetarians as it assists them in the practice of
    loving-kindness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was also at Jivaka&#146;s request that the Buddha
    established that monks should sweep the compound of the monastery and attend to other
    duties that would exercise their bodies. Jivaka, seeing the benefit of exercise for a
    healthy life, requested this and other mild duties to be performed by the monks to ensure
    their health. With foresight, love and compassion the devoted Jivaka took care of the
    physical health of the Buddha and His Sangha.</font></p>
