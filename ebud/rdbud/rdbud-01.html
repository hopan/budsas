    BUDDHA</font></h3>
    <p><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">1. King Suddhodana</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Suddhodana, who was of the Sakyan caste, was a
    righteous king who ruled over Kapilavatthu. As a young prince he excelled in warfare and
    swordsmanship. After a victorious battle his father, King Sihahanu, offered him a boon. He
    requested permission to marry the beautiful sisters, Maha Maya and Pajapati. Even though
    in many other kingdoms in India it was accepted for the king to have more than one
    consort, this was not the custom in Kapilavatthu. The Sakyans were monogamous and as such
    Prince Suddhodana had to receive special permission to marry the noble princesses who were
    of the Koliya caste. Prince Suddhodana wished to make both princesses his consorts as he
    had heard that one of the two sisters would give birth to a noble son who would bring
    great happiness to mankind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For many years his chief consort, Queen Maha Maya, had no
    children. Then, almost twenty years after their marriage, she gave birth to a baby prince
    whom they named Siddhattha, meaning <i>wish-fulfilled</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Suddhodana first recognized the extraordinary
    qualities of their child when the Sage Asita came to visit the baby. Asita, who was
    renowned for his wisdom and was a teacher to King Suddhodana, visited the palace on
    hearing of the birth of the prince. The king carried the baby to Asita for his blessing.
    To their surprise, the baby moved and placed His feet on Asita&#146;s head. The wise Asita
    then examined the markings on the baby&#146;s feet, and kneeling before the young prince,
    paid homage to Him. Asita then predicted that this noble baby would one day be a Buddha
    and show the world the path to the end of suffering. King Suddhodana, seeing the learned
    Asita salute the baby prince, followed suit, saying, &quot;Son, this is my first act of
    obeisance.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Suddhodana paid homage to the prince for the second
    time during the royal ploughing festival. It was the custom at that time to herald the new
    growing season with festivities. The nurses, observing that the baby prince was asleep,
    joined in the festivities and merry-making. When they returned they found the prince
    meditating while sitting cross-legged a few feet above the ground. Alarmed, they informed
    the king of the extraordinary feat. The king then knelt and saluted the baby prince for
    the second time, saying, &quot;Son, this is my second act of obeisance.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Despite the fact that two sages had predicted that the
    prince would be a Buddha, King Suddhodana wanted his son to be a king. Four others had
    said that the baby would be a Buddha or a Universal Monarch. The king decided that he
    would surround the prince with luxury and ensure that he was totally shielded from
    suffering so as to ensure his royal lineage of an Universal Monarch. King Suddhodana did
    not want the baby prince to be a Buddha. However, the prince&#146;s aspiration and effort
    over aeons of time had to be fulfilled. Prince Siddhattha left home in search of the Truth
    and attained enlightenment by realizing the path to the total destruction of suffering.
    After this, Prince Siddhattha was known as the Supreme Buddha Gotama.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was in Rajagaha when there arose a strong
    desire in King Suddhodana to see his enlightened son. He sent courtiers inviting the
    Buddha to visit the city of His childhood. However, on hearing the Dhamma, messenger after
    messenger decided to remain with the Buddha and be ordained. Enjoying the bliss of
    Nibbana, the courtiers did not convey the invitation to the Buddha. Finally, King
    Suddhodana sent his most trusted courtier, Kaludayi, a playmate of Prince Siddhattha, to
    bring the Buddha back to Kapilavatthu. Kaludayi agreed to give the message if the king
    gave him permission to be ordained as a monk.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha arrived in Kapilavatthu the proud Sakyan
    elders decided that they would not pay homage to Him. Instead, they sent the younger
    princes and princesses to pay homage. The Buddha, seeing the pride of the Sakyans and its
    hindrance to their attainment of spiritual development, performed the Twin Wonder. Red and
    blue rays that depicted fire and water radiated from either side of His body. The king,
    seeing the miracle, fell down on his knees and paid obeisance to the Buddha by saying,
    &quot;Son, this is my third act of obeisance&quot;. The Sakyan elders, their pride
    subdued, followed King Suddhodana&#146;s example and paid homage to the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Suddhodana assumed that the Buddha and His retinue of
    20,000 monks would come to the palace for their meals on the following day. As such he did
    not invite the Buddha to the palace. Without an invitation, the Buddha decided that He
    would examine what His ancestors, the Buddhas of the past, did when they first visited
    their home city. Did they go uninvited, to their previous home? He observed that the
    Buddhas of the past had not automatically invited themselves. They had instead gone for
    alms from house to house. The Buddha, with His retinue of monks, followed the age-old
    tradition of seeking alms from every house.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before long the message that his Son was begging for alms
    reached the king. Disturbed, he questioned the Buddha as to why He was insulting His
    father, the king, by begging for alms. The Buddha gently informed King Suddhodana that He
    was following the custom of His ancestors. The king replied, &quot;How could that be? You
    are a Sakyan Prince of the Solar Dynasty, with royal blood. None of our ancestors begged
    for their food.&quot; The Buddha corrected the king by saying, &quot;O King, you are
    referring to your lineage. I am of the Buddha lineage. The Buddhas of the past, when
    visiting their homecity for the first time, went from house to house seeking alms if they
    were not invited.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The humility of the Great Buddha is observed in this
    simple action. Not only did the Buddha when in doubt seek counsel from the traditions of
    past Buddhas, but He also did not see any need for arrogance just because He came from a
    royal caste. He was an ascetic, a Buddha, and as such even in His homecity, followed the
    customs of His ancestors.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Suddhodana attained Arahanthship in stages. He
    attained the first two stages of sainthood, Sotapanna and Sakadagami, on the Buddha&#146;s
    first visit after hearing a few lines on righteousness. The Buddha advised the king to
    lead a righteous, uncorrupted life, and that the righteous live happily in both this life
    and the next. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He attained the third stage of sainthood, Anagami, on
    hearing the Dhammapala Jataka. When the Buddha was practising self-mortification, He had
    reduced His food intake to such an extent that His body was wasted and He often fainted
    from lack of nourishment. An erroneous message was sent to King Suddhodana that his son
    had passed away. The king, however, refused to believe the message, saying his son would
    not pass away before attaining His goal of enlightenment. The Buddha, on hearing this,
    dispensed the Dhammapala Jataka, a previous life story of another instance when they had
    been father and son. At that time, bones had been brought back by a messenger with the
    claim that his son had died. In that birth also, King Suddhodana had refused to believe
    that his son had died.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Suddhodana attained the various stages of sainthood
    without renunciation. He chose to perform his royal duties and remain as the King of
    Kapilavatthu. Many years later, on hearing of His father&#146;s imminent death, the Buddha
    visited Kapilavatthu to give His last discourse to His father. On hearing the Dhamma, King
    Suddhodana attained Arahanthship. Seven days later he passed away. The Buddha was about
    forty years old at the time of His father&#146;s death. </font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">2. Queen Maha Maya</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Queen Maha Maya was the daughter of King Anjana and Queen
    Yasodhara of the Koliya caste. She was the chief consort of King Suddhodana and the mother
    of Prince Siddhattha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One night Queen Maha Maya had a strange dream. She dreamt
    that the Devas from the four directions of the earth took her to Lake Anotatta on top of
    the Himalayan Mountains. She was bathed in the lake and dressed in heavenly clothes and
    ornaments. A white baby elephant carrying a white lotus flower in its trunk trumpeted, and
    after circling around her three times, entered her body.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next morning she told King Suddhodana of her dream. He
    consulted sages who, on hearing of the dream, predicted that the Queen would have a wise
    and noble baby boy. The king and queen were very happy for they had no children and were
    longing for a child.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the custom of that time, Queen Maha Maya
    decided to visit her mother so that she could be with her at the time of the birth of her
    baby. On the way, she stopped at the Lumbini Pleasure Garden to rest. Under a
    sweet-scented Sala tree, on a full-moon day in the month of May, in the year 623 BC, the
    Prince Siddhattha was born.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seven days later Queen Maha Maya passed away. Her Sister,
    Maha Pajapati Gotami, who was the second consort of King Suddhodana, nursed and took care
    of the baby Prince. Queen Maha Maya was reborn as a male Deva by the name of Matu Deva
    Putta in the Tusita heaven. Later she passed away from the Tusita heaven to the Tavatimsa
    Heaven to hear the Abhidhamma, the Higher Teachings. The Buddha dispensed the Higher
    Teachings for three months in the Tavatimsa heaven to a multitude of Devas presided over
    by his former mother.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is said that Prince Siddhattha&#146;s mother, Matu Deva
    Putta, had appeared before Him and encouraged Him to persevere when he had fainted, weak
    from the practice of self- mortification. The Ascetic Gotama had practised
    self-mortification to its fullest degree and reduced His meals to just one mustard seed a
    day. His flesh and muscle had withered and His skin had clung to His protruding bones.
    Weak with hunger, the Bodhisatta had fainted momentarily. His former mother had appeared
    before Him and encouraged Him in His Noble Quest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The role of the mother of the Buddha is a sacred role that
    requires great effort. Queen Maha Maya aspired to be a mother of a Buddha one hundred
    thousand world cycles ago at the time of the Padumuttara Buddha, the fifteenth Buddha
    preceding our Gotama Buddha. She then performed meritorious deeds and kept the preceptsfor
    one hundred thousand world cycles to fulfil her aspiration.</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">3. Maha Pajapati Gotami</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pajapati Gotami was the younger sister of Queen Maha Maya
    and the second consort of King Suddhodana. She was called Maha (great) Pajapati as sages
    had predicted that she would be the leader of a large following. When her beloved sister
    passed away seven days after giving birth to Prince Siddhattha, she was desolated. They
    had been very close as sisters. She decided that she would bring up her sister's baby as
    her own.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Delegating the care of her own son, Nanda, to nurses, Maha
    Pajapati nursed the new-born babe. Both King Suddhodana and Maha Pajapati adored the
    gentle Prince. Prince Siddhattha grew up in luxury with His stepbrother and stepsister,
    Nanda and Nanda, Maha Pajapati's two children.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu and dispensed the
    Dhammapala Jataka to King Suddhodana, Maha Pajapati attained the first stage of sainthood,
    Sotapanna. After King Suddhodana passed away, Maha Pajapati decided that she too would
    enter the Noble Order and lead the holy life under the Buddha. Her son, Nanda, and
    grandson, little Rahula, had entered the Order under the great sage. Pajapati no longer
    had any desire for worldly pleasures. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was visiting Kapilavatthu to settle a dispute
    that had arisen between the Sakyans and the Koliyas regarding the waters of the Rohini
    River when Maha Pajapati first approached Him with the request to permit women to enter
    the Noble Order. Without stating the reason the Buddha refused, saying, &quot;O Gotami,
    let it not please you that women should be allowed to do so&quot;. Maha Pajapati, however,
    did not give up. A second and a third time she requested ordination for women. In each
    instance the Buddha gave the same reply.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then proceeded to Vesali to reside at the
    Mahavana in the Kutagara Hall. The determined Maha Pajapati was not discouraged. Cutting
    off her hair, she donned the yellow robes of a monk, and with a large retinue of Sakyan
    ladies, walked the 150 miles to Vesali. Covered in dust, her feet swollen and bleeding,
    she stood outside the hall, weeping. When ananda, the Buddha&#146;s personal attendant,
    saw her and heard the cause of her grief, he decided to approach the Buddha on her behalf.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The compassionate ananda pleaded on behalf of the ladies.
    When the Buddha refused, ananda asked Him if He felt that women were incapable of reaching
    spiritual heights and Arahanthship. The Buddha replied that women were as capable as men
    of attaining spiritual development. He then looked back into Maha Pajapati&#146;s past
    lives. Seeing that Maha Pajapati had made an aspiration many aeons ago to initiate the
    order of the nuns, the fulfilment of which was to occur during His dispensation, the
    Buddha relented, granted ananda&#146;s request, and formed the order of the nuns.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha did not give the reason for His initial refusal
    to Maha Pajapati. All the Buddhas of the past had had the order of the nuns. The Gotama
    Buddha would have seen this and realized that the female order was a part of every
    Buddha&#146;s retinue. As such, some speculate that He was testing Pajapati's
    determination and resolution, as the holy life for women, especially women of royal birth,
    would be difficult and entail many hardships. Some speculate that the initial refusal was
    also because of the society and its treatment of women at that time, and the Buddha's fear
    for the safety of the female order. In general, it is felt that the initial refusal was to
    strengthen the determination and resolve of the noble ladies and to prepare them better
    for the hardships they would have to face.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In India at the time of the Buddha, women were thought to
    be inferior to men. They did not have much freedom and were often not treated with
    respect. Women from noble families were carefully secluded and shielded from abuse. The
    men ensured the safety of the women. The Buddha's disciples often meditated in forests and
    walked alone from city to city on lonely roads, preaching the Dhamma. How was He to ensure
    the safety and protection of the nuns? How was He to ensure they would be treated with
    respect and fairness? How was He to entrust the safety of the nuns to monks who had taken
    the vows of celibacy? Would it not then be harder for the monks to be disciplined?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha dispensed eight extra disciplinary (Vinaya)
    rules for the nuns, mostly regarding the manner in which they would have to respect and
    honour the monks who through necessity, would have to protect them. He also prophesied
    that ordination of nuns would result in the shortening of the time span in which His
    teachings would remain on Earth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While some women in the modern world may find it difficult
    to accept some of these rules, we should place them in the context of the role and
    position of women at the time of the Buddha, to fully appreciate the bold radical change
    that the Buddha instigated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Eight Monastic Regulations applicable to women were:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. A Bhikkhuni (nun) should always respect a Bhikkhu
      (monk) even if the monk were junior to her in the order. Among the Bhikkhus the junior
      monks in the order respected the senior monks just as the junior nuns respected the senior
      nuns.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. A Bhikkhuni shall not spend the rainy season in a place
      where there are no monks. (The attitude prevalent in India towards women at the time of
      the Buddha necessitated this precaution for the safety of the nuns).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Twice a month the Bhikkhuni shall ask the Bhikkhus the
      time when the monastic discipline (Uposatha) is recited and request for a monk to come to
      advise and admonish the Bhikkhunis (who have deviated from monastic rules).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. At the termination of the rainy season retreat, the
      final ceremony shall be held in an assembly of both monks and nuns.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. Certain offences committed by Bhikkhunis should be
      dealt with by assemblies of both Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis. The assembly of Bhikkhunis deals
      with only minor transgressions and some of a personal nature to women.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. A novice Bhikkhuni shall receive higher ordination
      after a training period of two years. There are instances when monks were given higher
      ordination immediately after ordination.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. A Bhikkhuni should not rebuke a Bhikkhu under any
      circumstances.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. Even though Bhikkhunis cannot admonish Bhikkhus, a
      Bhikkhu can admonish a Bhikkhuni who has transgressed the monastic discipline.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Maha Pajapati and her retinue of Sakyan ladies accepted
    the eight extra discipline rules and received ordination from the Buddha. The Buddha was
    the first religious teacher to form the order of the Bhikkhunis (nuns). The nuns were then
    guided under similar monastic rules as the monks. The Buddha appointed two chief female
    disciples (as he had appointed two chief male disciples) to help with His growing
    congregation of nuns. Subsequent to this, new rules were added to the discipline as and
    when required by circumstance. For example, Bhikkhunis were not allowed to meditate and
    reside on their own in forests after an incident that occurred regarding the Bhikkhuni
    Uppalavanna.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha&#146;s monastic discipline (five books) for
    Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis is an exemplary democratic system from which we can still learn.
    The exceptionally high moral standards of the Sangha and the unsurpassed administrative
    system the Buddha instituted were well thought out and futuristic. Lord Zetland, a former
    viceroy of India, writes, &quot;And it may come as a surprise to many to learn that in the
    assemblies of the Buddhists in India, two thousand years and more ago, are to be found the
    rudiments of our own parliamentary practice of the present day.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before long, Maha Pajapati attained Arahanthship, as well
    as intuitive and analytical knowledge. Her retinue of Sakyan ladies too attained
    Arahanthship. Maha Pajapati was assigned the foremost place in seniority and experience.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In gratitude, Pajapati paid reverence to the Buddha and to
    her beloved sister, Maya, who had brought the Noble Baby into the world, as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>Buddha, Hero, homage to you,<br>
      O best of all beings<br>
      Who released me and many other beings from pain.<br>
      All pain is known: craving as the cause is dried up;<br>
      The Noble Eightfold way has been developed,<br>
      Cessation has been attained by me.<br>
      Formerly I was mother, son, father, brother and grandmother;<br>
      Not having proper knowledge<br>
      I journeyed on (in samsara) without expiation.<br>
      I have indeed seen the Blessed One;<br>
      This is the last body.<br>
      Journeying on from rebirth to rebirth has been eliminated;<br>
      There is now no renewed existence (for me).<br>
      I see the disciples all together,<br>
      Putting forth energy, resolute, always with strong effort.<br>
      This is homage to the Buddhas.<br>
      Truly for the sake of many,<br>
      May</i>a<i> bore Gotama.<br>
      She thrust away the mass of pain<br>
      Of those struck by sickness and death.&quot;<br>
      -- (Therigatha 157-162)</font></p>
      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Maha Pajapati aspired to institute the Order of the Nuns
    at the time of the Padumuttara Buddha. She had observed the Buddha Padumuttara confer a
    similar title on another nun. Inspired by that nun, she had wanted to hold a similar
    position at the time of a future Buddha. With this in mind she had given alms to the
    Padumuttara Buddha and His retinue and made an aspiration. The Buddha, foreseeing that her
    aspiration would be fulfilled, had prophesied that she would, at the time of the Gotama
    Buddha, be foremost among the nuns in seniority and experience and would start the Order
    of the Nuns. From this point onwards, Maha Pajapati had performed meritorious deeds and
    strived with effort to practise the Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next documented birth story takes place at a time when
    there was no Supreme Buddha. Pajapati was born to a wealthy family and was attended on by
    500 maidservants. She had observed five Pacceka Buddhas come to the city in search of
    shelter for the rainy season. Together with her maidservants, she had built five shelters
    for the Buddhas and furnished them. She had then invited the five Pacceka Buddhas, and
    together with her servants, had provided them with meals for the entire three months of
    the rainy season. At the end of the season, together with her maids, she had sewn the
    Kathina robes to be gifted to the Buddhas. At death Pajapati and her five hundred maids
    were reborn in a heavenly realm and enjoyed the pleasures of heavenly bliss for a long
    time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Her next documented birth is as Maha Pajapati, foster
    mother and aunt to Prince Siddhattha. With determination and tireless effort she had
    practised the Dhamma over countless aeons to fulfil the aspiration made one hundred
    thousand world cycles ago.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Licchavi Kings of Vesali built a large nunnery for
    Maha Pajapati and her retinue of five hundred Sakyan princesses. Pajapati was a role model
    for all the nuns but specifically so to other ladies of noble birth. She encouraged and
    helped them to adjust to the solitary austere life of a nun. She also assisted in the
    teaching and administration of novice nuns. As she approached her 120th year, Maha
    Pajapati realized that she had not long to live. It was time for her to pay homage for the
    last time to the Buddha, who had taught her the nectar of the Dhamma and helped her attain
    Nibbana. Approaching the Buddha she said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;O Lord! I brought up your physical body but<br>
      You brought up my spiritual body.<br>
      I fed you with breast-milk but<br>
      You fed me with the milk of the Dhamma,<br>
      To destroy suffering and Samsara.<br>
      It is a rare opportunity to see a Buddha.<br>
      I would like to view and pay homage<br>
      to your lotus-like feet.<br>
      Please stretch forward your feet.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha with compassion stretched out His feet, which
    resembled the pink lotus flower. Falling at His feet and revering the Great Markings that
    signified an Enlightened Being, Pajapati worshipped Him and begged forgiveness for any
    shortcomings she may have had. Then she requested permission to pass away.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The news of the imminent passing away of Pajapati spread
    far and wide. Monks and nuns gathered to pay respect and homage to her. Sariputta,
    Moggallana, Nanda, Rahula, ananda, Khema, Uppalavanna, and many others gathered at Vesali.
    ananda, who was as yet only Sotapanna, started to weep. Pajapati then consoled him by
    reminding him of the great service he had performed to her by speaking on her behalf to
    the Buddha to form the Order of Nuns. She then gently advised ananda not to weep, as it
    was not appropriate that the monk foremost in retentive memory should weep.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Despite the Buddha&#146;s acknowledgement of the
    intellectual capabilities of women, there were many men who were not willing to change the
    views that had been ingrained in them for years. The Buddha called Pajapati and said,
    &quot;O Gotami, it is very rare to see a lady like you (a former queen) attain
    enlightenment. Perform a miracle to dispel the wrong views of those foolish men who are in
    doubt with regard to the spiritual potentialities of women.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pajapati then rose in the air and came down and worshipped
    the Buddha. Three times she paid homage to Him thus, then she disappeared and reappeared
    before the crowd. Finally accepting permission from the Buddha to attain Parinibbana, she
    walked backwards with her eyes on the Buddha towards the nunnery. The Buddha then
    instructed all to join Him to follow her for her last send-off. Pajapati entered the
    nunnery and, seated in the lotus position, entered into deep meditation, attained the
    Jhanas, and passed away to the Bliss of Parinibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Licchavi kings placed the remains of Pajapati in a
    golden casket and carried it through the city in a grand procession. The respect that the
    Buddha had for His foster mother and mothers in general was seen at Maha Pajapati&#146;s
    funeral. The Buddha, who never walked behind anyone, walked behind the carriage that
    carried her body. In this way, by example, the Buddha showed us that we should respect and
    honour our mothers for the care and love that they have given us when we were too young to
    take care of ourselves. Hundreds of monks and nuns followed the carriage to the cremation
    ground. The casket was then placed on a sandalwood pyre and sprinkled with jasmine and
    other fragrant oils. The Licchavi kings then lighted the pyre.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The relics of Maha Pajapati are said to have turned white
    like glowing pearls. ananda collected the relics and handed them over to the Buddha and
    later to the Licchavi kings. A Stupa was built by the kings to enshrine Maha
    Pajapati&#146;s relics. Women from all over the world pay respect and homage to Maha
    Pajapati in gratitude for initiating the Order of Nuns.</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">4. Yasodhara</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yasodhara was the daughter of King Suppabuddha and Queen
    Pamita. As King Suppabuddha was one of King Suddhodana&#146;s younger brothers, she was
    one of Prince Siddhattha&#146;s cousins. Yasodhara was born on the same day as Prince
    Siddhattha. She was exquisitely beautiful, with golden skin and blue-back hair that
    cascaded down to her feet.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Prince Siddhattha was sixteen when His parents decided
    that it was a suitable time for Him to marry. As was the custom at that time, a great
    celebration was held and princesses from all over the country were brought in procession
    for the Prince to choose from. None of them attracted His attention. The Prince treated
    them with gifts but refused them all. The procession was almost finished when Yasodhara
    came rushing in, to inquire if there were any gifts left for her. The Prince then arose
    from His throne, and taking the pearl necklace that adorned His person, gently placed it
    around her neck. Prince Siddhattha chose His cousin, Yasodhara, to be His bride. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At first King Suppabuddha was against the marriage. He
    knew that the wise men had foretold that Siddhattha would leave the palace and His crown
    to become a Buddha. He also felt that the gentle, compassionate Prince might not be
    skilled in warfare, and as such, not be suitable for his daughter. The princess, however,
    wanted to marry no one else but Siddhattha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Suppabuddha, wishing to test Prince Siddhattha,
    arranged a tournament for Him to display His skills in archery, riding and swordsmanship.
    Sportsmen from all over the country gathered to challenge the Prince. Siddhattha, however,
    was an excellent sportsman. He excelled in all the events and ousted the best men in the
    country. King Suppabuddha therefore relented and gave his daughter in marriage to Prince
    Siddhattha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The relationship between Yasodhara and Prince Siddhattha
    was long and deep-rooted. It had started many, many years ago at the time of the Dipankara
    Buddha. At that time, the Prince (Bodhisatta) was born as an ascetic by the name of
    Sumedha. After an exceedingly long period of practising the ten virtues, the Bodhisatta
    Sumedha had finally completed the eight requirements to receive the definite proclamation
    of Buddhahood from the Dipankara Buddha. Yasodhara, at that time, was born as a noble lady
    by the name of Sumitra. She saw the Buddha Dipankara give the Bodhisatta eight handfuls of
    white jasmine flowers and the definite proclamation that He would be a Buddha by the name
    of Gotama, of the Sakyan caste, in the distant future. Cutting off her hair, she aspired
    to be His consort and helpmate and to support Him actively in His quest for Buddhahood.
    This strong aspiration and the meritorious deeds that she performed over a long period of
    time resulted in her being the Bodhisatta&#146;s consort and supporter throughout many
    births. During this very long period in which the Bodhisatta completed the virtues she
    actively supported His quest for perfection.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In fact, her dying words reflected this devotion. She
    referred to the fact that she had been the wife of no other but Him during the entire
    period and had helped Him to achieve in 100,000 world cycles and four infinite periods
    what other Buddhas take eight and sixteen infinite periods to achieve.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha visited the palace in Kapilavatthu for the
    first time, all but Princess Yasodhara came to pay homage to Him. She held back, thinking,
    &quot;Certainly if there is any virtue in me, the Noble Lord Himself will come to my
    presence.&quot; After the meal the Buddha, accompanied by His two male chief disciples,
    entered her chamber and sat down on the seat prepared for Him. He then said, &quot;Let the
    king&#146;s daughter reverence me as she likes.&quot; On seeing the Buddha, Yasodhara came
    forward quickly, and clasping His ankles, placed her head on His feet and paid reverence
    to Him as she wished.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yasodhara&#146;s devotion to the Buddha was heralded by
    her father-in-law, King Suddhodana. He informed the Buddha of her devotion by saying,
    &quot;When my daughter heard that you had taken to wearing simple yellow robes, she too
    gave up her jewels and wore yellow robes. When she heard that you had only one meal a day,
    she too had only one meal a day. When she heard that you slept on low, hard beds, she too
    gave up the luxurious palace couches and beds. And when she heard that you had given up
    garlands and perfume, she too gave up garlands and perfume. When her relatives sent
    messages of young men who wanted to support her she did not even look at a single
    one.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha acknowledged this devotion by saying that it
    was not only in this birth that she had been devoted to him. He then dispensed the
    Candakinnara Jataka, whereYasodhara had given her life to save His by jumping in front of
    a hunter&#146;s arrow.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, her love and devotion are best seen in the poem
    &quot;The Lion of Men&quot;. Pointing out the Buddha and His retinue of monks to their son
    from the palace balcony, with adoration she described the Buddha and introduced Him to
    little Rahula. The following are the words she used to describe the Buddha:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Lion of Men</font></p>

    </blockquote>
    </i><p><font face="Times New Roman">Yasodhara gave up the household life and entered the
    order of nuns at the same time as Maha Pajapati Gotami . She attained Arahanthship and was
    declared the chief disciple among the nuns who attained supernormal powers (Maha Abhiaaa)
    to recall infinite eras of the past. Only four of the Buddha&#146;s disciples had such
    powers. In general, the Buddha&#146;s disciples could only recall up to 100,000 world
    cycles. Yasodara, the Buddha&#146;s two chief male disciples and the Elder Bakkula,
    however, had supernormal powers and could recall incalculable eras. The nun Yasodhara
    passed away at the age of 78, prior to the Lord Buddha.</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">5. Rahula</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rahula was the only son of Prince Siddhattha and Princess
    Yasodhara. He was named Rahula by his grandfather because the first word Prince Siddhattha
    said on hearing about the birth of His son was Rahu, which means obstacle. An obstacle to
    His renunciation had arisen. It was on the day that Prince Rahula was born that Prince
    Siddhattha made the Great Renunciation. With a heavy heart Prince Siddhattha left His
    beloved wife and new-born son to seek the path to end suffering for the benefit of mankind
    and Devas (divine beings).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Prince Rahula saw His father for the first time at the age
    of seven. Princess Yasodhara pointed out the majestic Buddha with His retinue of monks to
    Rahula from the balcony of the palace. She then described his father, the Buddha, to her
    son in the Sutta known as &quot;The Lion of Men&quot;. After praising and describing the
    Buddha, the Princess requested her son to approach his father and ask for his inheritance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As instructed, Rahula approached his father and asked for
    his inheritance. He then looked at his father and said, &quot;Lord, even your shadow is
    pleasing to me.&quot; Rahula then followed the Buddha back to the Nigrodharama monastery
    where He was residing. The Buddha thought, &quot;Little Rahula asks for his inheritance.
    But worldly treasures and wealth cause suffering. I shall give him the most valuable
    treasure in the world. I will give him the Dhamma.&quot; Calling Venerable Sariputta, His
    chief male disciple, He asked him to ordain little Rahula.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Suddhodana was very sad when he heard of the
    ordination of his beloved grandson. He said: &quot;When the Lord renounced the world it
    was a cause of great pain to me. It was with deep sadness that I watched Nanda renounce
    the world. But it is especially painful when little Rahula renounces. The love of a father
    to a son is deep and cuts through the skin, flesh, sinew, bone and marrow. Grant, Lord,
    that Noble Ones will not ordain sons without permission of their parents.&quot; The Buddha
    readily agreed to this request and made it a discipline (Vinaya) of the Noble Order.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta and Moggallana were little Rahula&#146;s
    teachers. While Sariputta taught Rahula knowledge of the Dhamma, Moggallana concentrated
    on his conduct. Even though Rahula was only seven when he became a novice monk, he was
    very eager to accept instruction and was exceptionally cultured and obedient. Each morning
    he would rise and, taking a handful of sand, throw it up in the air saying, &quot;Today
    may I receive from my teachers as much advice and instruction as these grains of
    sand.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Shortly after Rahula&#146;s ordination the Buddha taught
    him the importance of telling the truth. This discourse is known as the Rahulovada Sutta.
    The Buddha placed truth as the highest of all virtues. The seekers of Truth, (those who
    have as their goal Nibbana) should not break the precept of Truth. The Buddha explained
    this in a way a young child would understand by using the following example.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rahula had just washed the feet of the Lord and prepared a
    seat for Him. Taking the vessel which now contained a little bit of water at the bottom,
    the Buddha showed it to Rahula and said: &quot;Rahula, do you see the small
    (insignificant) amount of water left in this vessel? Similarly, Rahula, insignificant (of
    little value) is the character of those who are not ashamed of telling lies.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then discarded this little bit of water and
    said; &quot;Rahula, do you see how I discarded the little bit of water in this vessel?
    Similarly discarded (set aside and not recognized) is the character of those who are not
    ashamed of telling lies.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He then overturned the pot that had contained the water
    and said, &quot;Rahula, do you see how easily I overturn this vessel? Similarly easily
    overturned (easily influenced and changed) is the character of those who are not ashamed
    of telling lies.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, the Buddha placed the pot upright, showed it to
    Rahula and said, &quot;Rahula, do you see this empty vessel that is void of any water?
    Similarly empty and void is the character of those who are not ashamed of telling
    lies.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said that the precept of truth was the most
    important of all the precepts, as a person who tells lies would very easily then break the
    other precepts and cover up his misbehaviour by telling lies. A person who always told the
    truth would not perform an act he would be ashamed to own up to later.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also instructed Rahula on reflecting and
    thinking before he acted to ensure that his actions were moral and conducive to the
    well-being of others and himself, by using examples and language a young child would
    understand.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Showing him a mirror, the Buddha asked Rahula what a
    mirror was used for. Rahula replied that it was for the purpose of reflecting. The Buddha
    then said: &quot;Similarly, Rahula, before you say or do anything, reflect. Reflect if
    this speech or action would be beneficial to others and yourself. If, when you reflect,
    you feel that it is not beneficial to others and to yourself, then refrain from saying and
    doing it. If you feel when you reflect that it is for the benefit of yourself and others,
    that such an action will not bring harm to another, that it is beneficial to others, then
    and only then should you perform this action. You should then perform this action again
    and again.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With this simple but easily understood example the Buddha
    introduced little Rahula to mindfulness and the discipline of the mind before action so
    that his thoughts, speech and actions would be moral and wholesome.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rahula was well-known for his obedience and truthfulness.
    As the son of the Buddha and because of his pleasing nature and young age he was
    well-liked by all. When Rahula was eighteen, the Buddha preached to him a very deep
    discourse on sense desire. He helped Rahula, who was pleased with his very handsome
    appearance, understand the dangers of vanity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, accompanied by Rahula, was seeking alms. They
    both looked exceedingly handsome, like a majestic royal elephant and his calf, a beautiful
    swan with his cygnet. Rahula, seeing the extremely handsome appearance of the Buddha,
    thought, &quot;I too am like my parent, the Exalted One. Beautiful is the Buddha&#146;s
    form and mine is similar.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha instantly read his thoughts and said,
    &quot;Rahula whatever form there is should be looked at as follows: &quot;This is not
    mine; this am I not; this is not my soul.&quot; Rahula then inquired if it was only form
    that should be regarded thus. The Buddha then said that all five aggregates should be
    regarded thus. In this way the Buddha introduced the very deep and difficult concept of no
    permanent soul (anatta) to Rahula.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rahula then chose not to seek alms and instead went back
    and sat in meditation reflecting on the words of the Buddha, trying to understand and
    penetrate the Truth of the Buddha&#146;s words. Shortly after, on hearing the Cula
    Rahulavada Sutta, he attained Arahanthship. The following words were uttered by Rahula on
    attaining Arahanthship:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">Being fortunate from both sides,<br>
      They call me &quot;Lucky Rahula&quot;,<br>
      I was the son of the Buddha,<br>
      The son of the Seer of Truth.<br>
      Blinded by sense desires spread over like a net,<br>
      Covered by a cloak of craving, <br>
      Bound by the kinsmen of heedlessness,<br>
      I was like a fish caught in the mouth of a funnel-net.<br>
      That sense desire I have burnt,<br>
      The bond of mara (death) I have cut.<br>
      Eradicating craving from its root,<br>
      Cool am I, peaceful am I.<br>
      Destroyed are all my corruptions,<br>
      There is no more rebirth for me,<br>
      An Arahanth am I, worthy of offering,<br>
      Possessed of threefold knowledge and a seer of the deathless.<br>
      -- (Theragatha 295-298)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rahula passed away before the Buddha, Sariputta and
    Moggallana. The Buddha declared that Rahula was foremost among the monks for his high
    standard of discipline and obedience. Rahula, who had entered the order at the tender age
    of seven, was a role model for the younger members of the Noble Order through his
    obedience and pleasing nature.</font></p>
