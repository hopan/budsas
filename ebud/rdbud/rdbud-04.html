    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">26. King Bimbisara</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Bimbisara was the Buddha&#146;s first Royal Patron.
    He ruled the kingdom of Magadha, the capital of which was Rajagaha, from the age of 15
    when he ascended the throne until his death at the age of fifty-two.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Bimbisara saw the Buddha for the first time prior to
    His enlightenment. The Ascetic Gotama was seeking alms in Rajagaha when the king saw the
    Great Ascetic of royal carriage and great bearing. Wishing to find out who this Great
    Ascetic was, the King with his royal entourage followed the Ascetic Gotama to
    Pandavapabbata, where He was resting after His meal. He then questioned the Ascetic Gotama
    on His birthplace and ancestry. Ascetic Gotama replied :</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Just straight, O King, upon the Himalayas, there is,
    in the district of Kosala of ancient families, a country endowed with wealth and energy. I
    am sprung from that family, which by clan belongs to the Solar Dynasty, by birth to the
    Sakyans. I crave not for pleasures of the senses. Realizing the unwholesomeness of sensual
    pleasures and seeing renunciation as safe, I proceeded to seek the Highest, for in that my
    mind rejoices.?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The King then invited the Ascetic Gotama to visit his City
    once He had attained enlightenment. In keeping with the promise that He had made, the
    Buddha visited Rajagaha after His enlightenment. Travelling from Gaya to Rajagaha, He
    stayed at the Suppatittha Shrine in a palm grove.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The news of the Buddha&#146;s arrival soon spread across
    the city. His reputation as a great teacher and the reverence with which His Teaching was
    heralded, had spread to Rajagaha. The King welcomed the Buddha with a large retinue of
    attendants He then paid reverence to Him and sat respectfully to the side. As both the
    Buddha and Maha Kassapa were in attendance some of the people were not sure who was the
    teacher and who the pupil. Reading their minds, the Buddha questioned Kassapa as to why he
    had given up fire-sacrifice, a Brahmanic ritual. Recognizing the doubts in the minds of
    the people, Kassapa said that he had given up fire sacrifice because he preferred the
    passionless, peaceful state of Nibbana. Then, falling at the feet of the Buddha, he paid
    reverence and said, ?My Teacher, Lord, is the Exalted One &#150; I am the disciple.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The people were inspired by Kassapa&#146;s devotion. The
    Buddha then dispensed the Maha Narada Kassapa Jataka, where in a previous birth the
    Bodhisatta had helped Kassapa in a similar way. On hearing the Dhamma, King Bimbisara
    attained the first stage of sainthood, Sotapanna. After taking refuge in the Buddha,
    Dhamma and Sangha, the king invited the Buddha and His retinue to the palace for their
    meal on the following day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the meal, King Bimbisara asked the Buddha what type
    of place would be suitable for His residence. The Buddha said that a place which was
    secluded and quiet, not too far but not too close to the city, would be pleasing to Him.
    Reflecting that his bamboo grove would be a perfect residence, the king donated the park
    to the Buddha and the Sangha. Even though the Buddha&#146;s new residence was known as
    Veluvanarama and arama is used to denote a monastery, there were no buildings or monastery
    at the bamboo grove. The Buddha and His monks resided under the shelter of the trees. The
    Buddha spent six years of the rainy season at Veluvanarama.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After His conversion the King led the life of an exemplary
    monarch. He had two consorts, Kosala Devi, who was the sister of King Pasenadi Kosala, and
    Khema, who later became the chief female disciple of the Buddha. His Queen, Kosala Devi,
    gave birth to a son whom they named Ajatasattu. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even though King Bimbisara led a righteous life he had a
    sad, pathetic death. Ajatasattu, led by Devadatta, attempted to kill his father to gain
    the throne. When King Bimbisara became aware of his son&#146;s plan, the compassionate
    king handed over the throne to his son and stepped down from the monarchy. The ungrateful
    son, who was under Devadatta&#146;s wicked influence, threw his father in prison with the
    instructions that he should be left without food, to starve to death. His mother alone had
    free access to the prison.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The loyal queen carried food in her waist pouch, but
    before long Ajatasattu became aware of his mother&#146;s efforts. When he forbade her to
    carry food in her waist pouch she carried food concealed in her hair knot. When this too
    was discovered and forbidden she applied a mixture of honey, butter, ghee, and molasses
    all over her body and let the king lick her skin to sustain himself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The cruel Ajatasattu then denied his mother access to
    visit the King. King Bimbisara was without any means of sustenance. But being a Sotapanna,
    he lived in meditative bliss and spiritual happiness. Ruthlessly, Ajatasattu ordered his
    barber to slash the old king&#146;s feet and place a mixture of salt and oil on the
    wounds. He then commanded him to walk on hot coals. Upon seeing the barber, King Bimbisara
    thought that his son had realized the folly of his behaviour and was sending the court
    barber to help cut his hair and beard so that he could be cleaned up for release. But it
    was not to be. The barber started the inhumane torture as instructed by the new king. The
    aged King Bimbisara died in extreme agony as the result of an unwholesome action performed
    in a past life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the same day that the old king died the news was
    brought to Ajatasattu that his wife had given birth to a baby son. Overcome by parental
    joy and happiness the king asked his mother if his father too had loved him as he did this
    new-born babe. His mother, Kosala Devi, then informed the cruel Ajatasattu of the great
    love that Bimbisara had had for him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ajatasattu&#146;s mother revealed that when she was
    carrying him there had arisen in her an inhuman desire to drink the blood from the hand of
    the king. She had concealed this desire but had withered away as it was a craving that she
    could not control. On hearing of her problem the king gladly cut open his palm to let her
    drink his blood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sages who could foretell the future had declared that
    this son would be an enemy of the king. The queen had then wanted to abort the baby but
    King Bimbisara, full of love and pride for the unborn child, had refused. Later, when the
    baby was born, the sages had again foretold that he would be an enemy of the king. For the
    second time the queen had wanted to kill the baby. For the second time the king had
    prevented her from killing her son. The queen had named the baby Ajatasattu, or unborn
    enemy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The queen then added that on one occasion when an infected
    boil on the baby&#146;s foot had made him fretful and angry she had taken him to the court
    to ask the king&#146;s advice. On hearing of the problem the king had placed the
    baby&#146;s foot in his mouth and sucked at the boil. The boil had then burst, spitting
    pus and blood into his mouth. The king, full of love and compassion, had swallowed the pus
    and continued to soothe the baby.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ajatasattu was filled with shame and regret upon hearing
    his mother&#146;s words. He sent a message to release his father but it was too late. King
    Bimbisara had closed his eyes forever, and was immediately reborn in the Catumaharajika
    Heaven as a god named Janavasabha. Influenced by the Dhamma, King Ajatasattu changed, and
    became one of the lay followers of the Buddha and the patron of the First Sangha Council.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">27. Queen Mallika</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mallika was the beautiful and talented daughter of the
    foreman of garland-makers in Savatthi. Mallika, who was sixteen, often went to the public
    flower gardens with her friends. One beautiful, clear day she packed a lunch of special
    rice and set out for the flower gardens to join her friends. As she was leaving the city,
    she saw the Buddha with a group of monks seeking alms.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So inspired was Mallika by the serenity and presence of
    the Buddha that she offered Him the lunch she had packed and prostrated herself at His
    feet. She had no idea that she was offering her food to the Buddha but was overjoyed and
    suffused with happiness by her impulsive gesture.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha accepted the gift and smiled. ananda, the
    Buddha&#146;s personal attendant, knowing that the Buddha would not have smiled without a
    reason, asked Him why he had smiled. The Buddha replied that this girl would reap the
    benefits of her gift the very same day by becoming the Queen of Kosala.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This seemed an impossibility for Mallika was of low caste.
    In India at that time the caste system flourished. It seemed very unlikely that King
    Pasenadi Kosala would choose a girl of low caste as his queen. King Kosala, who was one of
    the powerful kings of India, was at that time in battle with King Ajatasattu, the king of
    Magadha. Defeated in battle he was returning, downcast, when he heard sweet, melodious
    singing in the flower garden. Enchanted by the singing he rode into the flower garden to
    find the exceedingly beautiful Mallika. Mallika, who was overjoyed by her gift to the
    Noble One, was dancing and singing in happiness among the flowers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For some time King Kosala observed Mallika, who was a
    vision of beauty and grace. Then, dismounting from his horse, he spoke to her and asked if
    she was married. When Mallika replied that she was not married he talked to her about his
    misfortune in battle. Soothed by her consoling words and enraptured by her beauty and
    gentleness, he decided to make her his queen. Placing her carefully on his horse he took
    her back to her parents&#146; home. In the evening he sent an entourage to fetch her to
    the palace and made her his queen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the beloved of King Kosala, Mallika was respected by
    all and surrounded by luxury and a multitude of servants, who fulfilled her every wish.
    Soon it was known to all that Mallika the flower girl was elevated to the position of
    Queen of Kosala resulting from the effects of her heartfelt gift to the Buddha. Wherever
    she went people would joyously honour her, saying, &quot;There goes Mallika, our queen,
    who gives generously to the Buddha.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mallika in turn became a devoted follower of the Buddha
    and a supporter of the Noble Order. She was also an intelligent queen who questioned and
    analyzed her observations. Observing the different status of people, her elevation from
    poverty to wealth and power, and convinced that nothing happened without a cause, Mallika
    went to the monastery where the Buddha was residing with the following question:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why is it that some women are beautiful, wealthy
      and powerful,<br>
      While some are beautiful but without wealth and power,<br>
      And yet others ugly but wealthy and powerful,<br>
      And some ugly, poor and without power?&quot; </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then explained to her that those who are gentle
    and patient are born beautiful. Those who have given generously are born wealthy. And
    those that who not envious and rejoice in the success of others are born with power. Rare
    is the person who has performed all three of these deeds and as such, depending on their
    actions, one found a combination of these traits in persons. Mallika then decided that she
    would practise generosity, compassion and patience, and be happy at the success of others.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">She provided alms and requisites to the Buddha and His
    retinue and built an ebony hall for Dhamma discussion. She practised gentleness to her
    husband and servants and all others with whom she came into contact when performing her
    duties as queen. And when King Pasenadi Kosala decided to take a second wife, Vasabha
    Khattiya, she welcomed her and treated her as a younger sister without envy or jealousy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mallika also helped King Kosala, who was a follower of the
    Brahmins, to have confidence in the teachings of the Buddha. The king had had some
    disturbing dreams, which he felt represented some misfortune. Summoning the Brahmin
    priests the king asked them to interpret his dreams. Claiming that the Gods were
    displeased, they requested a huge animal sacrifice to appease the Gods. Mallika, who
    practised the Buddha&#146;s teaching of compassion and loving-kindness to all living
    beings, was horrified to find preparation for the slaughter of so many animals. She
    advised the King to seek the Buddha&#146;s counsel on the meaning of his dreams. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha informed the king that these dreams did not
    foretell any misfortune for him. As a result of his practice of meditation, the king had
    dreamt of the future in the matter that was closest to him, the royalty and the
    government. The Buddha said that these dreams signified the downfall in society that would
    occur as a result of moral deterioration of royalty and their governments. King Pasenadi
    Kosala became a devoted follower of the Buddha and a royal patron after this incident.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king also requested the Buddha to send a teacher to
    the palace to instruct his wives in the Dhamma. The Buddha delegated ananda to teach
    Mallika and Vasaba Khattiya the Dhamma. Mallika, with her keen mind, progressed rapidly,
    but Vasaba Khattiya (who was a relative of the Buddha) was inattentive, slow to understand
    and had difficulty in grasping the Dhamma. ananda approached the Buddha and informed him
    of the progress of the two royal ladies by saying that Queen Mallika grasped the concepts
    of the Dhamma and practised diligently what he taught, but that the Buddha&#146;s
    kinswoman had derived little benefit from the Dhamma. The Buddha confirmed ananda&#146;s
    assessment by saying that well-spoken words were fruitless to those who did not study and
    practise the Dhamma, just as a beautiful flower without scent, while the well-spoken words
    were fruitful to those who studied and practised the Dhamma, like a beautiful flower that
    was laden with scent.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even though the king and queen were a devoted couple they
    had their differences. In one instance the king had a falling out with Mallika regarding
    the way she was carrying out her royal duties. The Buddha then advised the king to
    reconcile their differences by relating instances from their past lives. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first instance was when they were born as husband and
    wife in the Deva world. They had been very attached to each other and one day had been
    separated due to a flash flood that prevented the king&#146;s return to their home. So
    worried and grief-stricken had they both been in their separation that they had vowed
    never to be separated again even for one day. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The other was when the king had been the crown prince and
    Mallika his consort. The prince had contacted leprosy and had decided to give up his
    kingdom and live in the jungle away from his subjects. The queen had decided that she
    would join him and had taken care of him and nursed him to health. When King Kosala heard
    these incidents from the past he forgave Mallika and reconciled their differences.
    Mallika, in gratitude to the Buddha for His counsel, said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With joy I heard your varied words,<br>
      Which were spoken for our welfare.<br>
      With your words you dispelled my sorrow.<br>
      May you live long, my Ascetic Bringer of Joy.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Though Mallika led a blameless life of generosity and
    loving-kindness she transgressed and indulged in sexual misconduct in one instance. When
    questioned by the king, without owning up to her inappropriate behaviour, she lied to
    cover up her disgrace.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This one incident, which occurred shortly before her
    death, must have worked on her mind because at death she was reborn for seven days in
    hell. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Kosala was grief-stricken at the death of his chief
    queen and visited the Buddha to find out her place of rebirth. Knowing that she was reborn
    in hell due to her misconduct and deceit, and not wanting to add to the sorrows of the
    king, the Buddha distracted the king by giving an inspiring discourse that took his mind
    away from the question. For six days the Buddha prevented King Kosala from asking the
    place of Mallika&#146;s rebirth by distracting him with inspiring teachings. On the
    seventh day he informed the King that Mallika had been reborn in the Tusita Heaven among
    the Devas of delight.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<b>28. King Pasenadi Kosala</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Pasenadi Kosala was the son of King Maha Kosala who
    reigned in the kingdom of Kosala, the capital of which was Savatthi. He had two consorts.
    His chief consort, Queen Mallika, was the daughter of a garland maker. His second consort,
    Vasabha Khattiya, was the daughter of Mahanama (one of prince Siddhatta&#146;s cousins and
    Anuruddha&#146;s brother) and a slave girl. He and Vasabha Khattiya had a son named
    Vidudhabha who, when he came of age, attempted to destroy the Sakyan race and capital.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Kosala&#146;s conversion from Brahmanism to the
    teachings of the Buddha seems to have occurred very early in the Buddha&#146;s ministry.
    King Kosala had questioned the Buddha, and the Buddha had dispensed a very interesting
    sutta on four objects that should not be disregarded or overlooked: a warrior prince, a
    snake, a fire, and a Bhikkhu. The Buddha had then gone on to explain that a warrior
    prince, though young, may ruthlessly cause harm to others if enraged, just as would a
    small, poisonous snake. A little fire may produce a conflagration and even a young monk
    could be an Arahanth. The king had been inspired by this sermon and had taken refuge in
    the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. However, his Chief Queen, Mallika, a very devout
    follower of the Buddha, was largely responsible for his religious enthusiasm.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Samyutta Nikaya there are many discourses that the
    Buddha had dispensed for King Kosala. They have been compiled and preserved as the Kosala
    Samyutta. Once when the king was in the company of the Buddha, a group of ascetics with
    long hair, beards, and long nails had passed. The king had got up, respectfully saluted
    them, and introduced himself by saying that he was King Pasenadi Kosala. When they had
    passed he had approached the Buddha and inquired as to whether they were Arahanths or
    those who were striving for Arahanthship. The Buddha explained that it was difficult for
    ordinary persons to ascertain if a person is an Arahanth. He had then explained that it is
    by association that one can judge a person&#146;s conduct, and only after a long time of
    association. He had then gone on to add that it is only a heedful and intelligent person
    who would be able to make such a distinction. His instruction is just as applicable today
    as there are among us many who hide impure thoughts behind a mantle of outward purity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Not by his outward guise is man well-known,<br>
      In fleeting glance let none place confidence.<br>
      In garb of refined, well-conducted folk<br>
      The unrestrained live in the world at large.<br>
      As a clay earing made to counterfeit,<br>
      Or a bronze halfpenny coated with gold,<br>
      Some fare at large, hidden beneath disguise,<br>
      On the surface comely and fair; within impure.&quot;</i><br>
      <i>-- (Kindred Sayings 104-106)</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By necessity the king was often at war to defend his
    kingdom. With wisdom, the Buddha consoled the defeated king and reminded him of the
    futility of conquest. His wisdom applies just as much today as it did over 2,500 years
    ago. The Buddha said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Victory breeds hatred,<br>
      The defeated lives in pain.<br>
      Happily the peaceful live,<br>
      Giving up victory and defeat.&quot;<br>
      -- (Dhammapada 121)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On another occasion the king was victorious in battle and
    confiscated King Ajatasattu&#146;s entire army, only sparing his life. When the Buddha
    heard of the king&#146;s victory He explained to him that anger breeds anger and explained
    the law of cause and effect (kamma) by saying:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;A man may spoil another,<br>
      Just so far as it may serve his ends,<br>
      But when he&#146;s spoiled by others,<br>
      He, despoiled, spoils yet again.<br>
      So long as evil&#146;s fruit is not matured,<br>
      The fool does fancy, now&#146;s the hour, the chance!<br>
      But when the deed eventually bears fruit,<br>
      He fareth ill.<br>
      The slayer gets a slayer in his turn,<br>
      The conquered gets one who conquers him.<br>
      The abuser wins abuse,<br>
      The annoyer frets.<br>
      Thus by the evolution of the deed,<br>
      A man who spoils is spoiled again.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha&#146;s advice to King Kosala on his
    disappointment when Queen Mallika gave birth to a baby girl is history making! The Buddha
    advised the king that a well brought-up girl could be even better than a son and
    counselled him to take care of her and bring her up with love and devotion. When she grew
    up, Queen Mallika&#146;s daughter, Princess Vajira, became the Queen of Magadha. No
    religious teacher had made such a bold statement, especially in India at a time when women
    were considered to be inferior to men and often treated with disrespect.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also helped the king overcome his grief at the
    death of his beloved grandmother by reminding him of the impermanence of all things. King
    Kosala approached the Buddha and informed Him that he would give anything within his means
    to save his grandmother, who was like a mother to him. The Buddha consoled him by saying,</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;All beings are mortal, they end with death;<br>
      They have death in prospect.<br>
      All vessels wrought by the potter,<br>
      Whether they are baked or unbaked,<br>
      Are breakable - they end broken;<br>
      They have breakage in prospect.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Reminded of the impermanence of all phenomena King Kosala
    strengthened his mind and left.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Observing the generosity of the Buddha&#146;s chief
    benefactor, Anathapindika, King Kosala decided to follow his example. He invited five
    hundred monks daily to the palace for their noonday meal. At the start he was very
    enthusiastic and arranged for everything with great fervour, but later, busy with state
    affairs, he left it to his servants to entertain the monks. After some time he was
    surprised to find that the monks were taking the food and giving it to other lay devotees,
    who in turn offered it back to the same monks. The king approached the Buddha and asked
    Him the reason for this strange behaviour by the monks. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then informed King Kosala that his servants
    were offering the rich food in a careless manner. Often they insulted the monks and called
    them parasites and asked them to work and earn their own food. &quot;The monks&quot;, He
    said, &quot;were not comfortable in accepting the food under these conditions.&quot; The
    lay devotees, however, unable to afford such food to give to the monks themselves, were
    eager to use this opportunity and offered the food back with fervour. The Buddha then
    explained to the king that when persons like Anathapindika and Visakha gave to the monks
    they gave with great devotion and fervour, and the monks, who could sense their happiness
    in giving, were comfortable in accepting. They welcomed the monks and treated them as
    spiritual friends who lived for the welfare and benefit of all beings. He then said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;A dish may be insipid or savoury,<br>
      The food may be meagre or abundant,<br>
      Yet if it is given by a friendly hand,<br>
      Then it becomes a delicious meal.&quot;<br>
      --(Jataka 346)</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Kosala was a strong supporter of the Buddha and used
    every opportunity to listen to the Dhamma. However, despite his benign and compassionate
    influence, his son, Vidudhabha, was a rebel. King Kosala had an unfortunate death at the
    hands of his cruel and greedy son.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king often visited the Buddha to hear the Dhamma. When
    he did, he was in the habit of removing his crown at the monastery gate. The king then
    left some of his guards at the entrance to ensure the security of his crown. Vidudhabha,
    who was familiar with his father&#146;s behaviour, used this opportunity to steal the
    crown. Seizing the crown, he had his men kill the king&#146;s guards. He then left a
    servant at the entrance to inform King Kosala that he was now the ruler and that the king
    was no longer welcome in the kingdom.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king was dismayed to hear from the servant about his
    son&#146;s behaviour. Since it was late in the night and starting to get cold, he walked
    to a neighbouring kingdom, but the city gates were closed for the night. He then walked
    back to Savathi hoping that his son would let him into the city, only to find the gates
    closed. The old king lay down in a hut outside the city gates in the extreme cold and
    wrapped his robe around him to keep warm. But his heart was weak. He could not tolerate
    the cold or the sorrow of his son&#146;s conduct. King Kosala died in loneliness outside
    the city walls, in a hut, alone with one servant</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vidudhabha ruled the kingdom ruthlessly. On finding out
    that his mother was the daughter of a Sakyan prince and a slave girl and that his father
    had been tricked into marrying her, Vidudhabha was furious. Vowing to wash his hands in
    the blood of the Sakyans just as the chair which he had sat had been washed in milk to
    cleanse it of his non-Sakyan bloodline by the blue-blooded, arrogant Sakyans, Vidudhabha
    waged war. On his third attempt he killed the majority of the Sakyan royalty in
    Kapilavatthu. The remainder fled to form a new city. Vididhabha and his men in turn met
    their death on the banks of the river during a flash flood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">29. Samavati</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the time of the Buddha there lived a man and woman who
    had a beautiful daughter named Samavati. They lived in harmony and happiness until the
    plague broke out in their city. Fearing for their lives, they decided to travel to
    Kosambi, the capital of Vamsa, where they hoped to seek support from Ghosaka, the Finance
    Minister of King Udena, who was a family friend.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The municipality had set up a public alms hall to cope
    with the refugees left homeless as a result of the plague. Samavati went there to obtain
    food for her parents and herself. On the first day she asked for three portions of food,
    on the second day she asked for two portions of food, and on the third day she asked for
    one portion of food.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mitta, the man who was distributing the food, asked her
    sarcastically if she had finally realized the capacity of her stomach. Samavati replied
    quite calmly that on the first day there were three of them for whom she was taking food.
    Then her father succumbed to the plague and died. On the second day she was bringing food
    for her mother and herself. Then her mother succumbed to the plague and died. And so,
    today, she only needed one portion of food.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mitta felt badly about his sarcasm and thoughtless remark.
    He offered to adopt Samavati as his foster child. Samavati agreed. She then joined her
    foster father in helping in the distribution of alms. Before long Samavati, who was very
    capable and intelligent, had organized the chaotic and noisy alms hall into an orderly,
    well-run operation. So much so that Ghosaka, the Finance Minister, was surprised at the
    change and complimented Mitta on his organization. Mitta modestly gave the credit to his
    adopted daughter and introduced Ghosaka to Samavati.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Ghosaka found out that Samavati was his departed
    friend&#146;s daughter he decided to adopt her and bring her up as his own. Even though
    Mitta loved her dearly and did not want to lose his foster daughter he realized that she
    would have many luxuries as the Finance Minister&#146;s daughter that he could not
    possibly afford. Not wanting to stand in the way of Samavati&#146;s good fortune, he
    agreed. As Ghosaka&#146;s daughter, Samavati became heiress to a large fortune and moved
    among the nobility.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king of Kosambi, King Udena, had two beautiful
    consorts. He had married the first, Queen Vasuladatta, for political reasons, and his
    second queen, Magandiya, for her intelligence. Neither of his consorts, however, provided
    him with the love, compassion and gentleness that he wanted from a wife. In fact, if
    anything Magandiya was rather cold, self-centred and harsh.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day the King saw the beautiful, gentle and
    compassionate Samavati. Captivated by her beauty and gentleness, he decided to have her as
    his third consort. Ghosaka, who loved his adopted daughter dearly and knew the temperament
    of the king, refused. King Udena was furious. He dismissed Ghosaka from his position as
    Finance Minister and confiscated his mansion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Samavati was desolate at the misfortune that her adopted
    father had to face on her behalf. Even though she did not want to marry the king she
    agreed to his proposal providing that Ghosaka was reinstated and given back his mansion.
    The King agreed. Samavati soon became the King&#146;s favourite consort.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In keeping with her position, Samavati had a large retinue
    of servants who took care of her every wish. Among them was a servant named Khujjuttara.
    Each day the queen gave Khujjuttara eight gold coins to buy flowers. Each day Khujjuttara
    pocketed four of the gold coins and bought flowers with the remainder. One day when she
    went to buy flowers the florist informed her that he had invited the Buddha and His monks
    for alms and asked her if she would like to stay and participate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Khujjuttara agreed. She stayed on to help and after the
    meal listened attentively to the Buddha&#146;s discourse. Khujjuttara was transformed by
    the Buddha&#146;s teaching. She had a keen mind developed over countless years. By the end
    of the discourse she attained the first stage of sainthood, Sotapanna. Regretting her
    former deceit, Khujjuttara bought eight gold coins&#146; worth of flowers for the queen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The moment Queen Samavati saw Khujjuttara she noticed a
    difference. Khujjuttara looked serene and exuded an inner radiance. She was also perplexed
    as to why there was double the quantity of flowers. The queen questioned Khujjuttara about
    her transformation and the extra flowers. Khujjuttara confessed the truth and her previous
    deceit and begged for forgiveness. She then informed the queen about the discourse of the
    Buddha that had changed her life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Impressed by Khujjuttara&#146;s inner transformation the
    queen decided to find out more about the Buddha and His teachings. She appointed
    Khujjuttara as her personal attendant and requested her to visit the monastery every day.
    She instructed her to listen to the Dhamma and come back and teach what she had learned to
    the queen and her court.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Khujjuttara, who had an outstanding memory, repeated the
    Buddha&#146;s teaching word for word. The queen and her ladies were inspired by the Dhamma
    and Kujjuatara&#146;s gift to them. Placing her on a higher chair and themselves seated on
    lower seats, they listened to her with respect and gratitude.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Queen Samavati, who was totally inspired by the Dhamma,
    asked the king&#146;s permission to invite the Buddha and His disciples to the palace for
    their daily meals. Unable to attend Himself, the Buddha sent ananda as His representative
    to the palace. Each day (whilst the Buddha was in residence in Kosambi), ananda accepted
    his noonday meal from Queen Samavati and taught her and the ladies of her court the
    Dhamma. Before long Queen Samavati attained the first stage of sainthood, Sotapanna. Many
    of the ladies of the court also attained higher stages of sainthood. Her foster father,
    Ghosaka, embraced the doctrine and built a large monastery in Kosambi named Ghositarama
    for the Buddha and His retinue.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Queen Samavati continued to grow in the Dhamma. Her most
    outstanding trait was her immense love and compassion for all living beings. Samavati was
    the embodiment of compassion and loving-kindness and radiated it to all with whom she came
    in contact. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, the Queen&#146;s popularity and the fact that she
    was undoubtedly King Udaya&#146;s favourite did not please Queen Magandiya. She had
    accepted Samavati as it was common practice for the King to have more than one consort.
    But she could not accept Samavati&#146;s veneration of the Buddha and the Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a young girl Magandiya had been exceptionally
    beautiful. Her parents when looking for a suitable partner for her had looked for an
    exceptionally handsome and cultured man. One day the Buddha had visited their house in
    seek of alms. Not recognizing the Buddha, but pleased with his deportment and countenance,
    they had offered Magandiya in marriage to Him. The Buddha had refused the offer and
    dispensed a sutta on impermanence and the loathsomeness of the body for which He had no
    desire. Magandiya, however, who was vain and proud of her beauty, took His discourse
    personally and felt slighted at being refused. Seeing Samavati venerate the Buddha who she
    felt had slighted her made her remember the old wounds. She decided to focus her anger and
    jealousy on Samavati. She tried many times to break the faith and love that King Udena had
    for Samavati by making false accusations. But Samavati remained calm and full of
    compassion and loving-kindness. Nothing that Magandiya did changed the strong love that
    the king had for his favourite queen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In desperation Magandiya decided to kill the queen. With
    the help of some greedy relatives she planned to set fire to her quarters on a day when
    she herself was away from the city. Magandiya was aware of the king&#146;s wrath and
    wanted to ensure that no blame could possibly be directed at her. Queen Samavati and the
    majority of her court perished in the fire. The queen, however, remained to the end full
    of compassion and loving-kindness. She encouraged her ladies, who were engulfed by flames,
    to concentrate and abide in the Dhamma by saying:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It would not be an easy matter,<br>
      Even with the knowledge of the Buddha,<br>
      To determine exactly the number of times<br>
      Our bodies have thus been burnt by fire<br>
      As we have passed from birth to birth<br>
      In the beginning-less round of existence.<br>
      Therefore be heedful.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Inspired by her words the ladies of the court meditated
    and achieved mental development so that at death all among them had entered the various
    stages of sainthood. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On hearing the sad news the monks questioned the Buddha as
    to the place of rebirth of the queen and her ladies and the cause of their tragic death.
    The Buddha then informed them that all of the ladies had reached either the first, second
    or third stage of sainthood and as such were reborn in the Deva and Brahma Realms from
    which they would in due course attain Arahanthship. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He then went on to explain that in a previous birth
    Samavati had been born as Queen of Benares and had gone to the river to bathe with her
    ladies. Feeling cold, she had instructed her maids to set the bushes that surrounded them
    on fire. Too late they had realized that a Pacceka Buddha was meditating there, hidden
    from view among the bushes. Afraid that she would be admonished for her careless act if
    the Pacceka Buddha lived to tell His story, she had instructed her maids to pour oil over
    Him in the hope of killing Him. They had not succeeded in killing the Pacceka Buddha, but
    the premeditated murder had resulted in Samavati&#146;s and her ladies&#146; present
    demise.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Despite Magandiya&#146;s devious plan the king realized
    that she had instigated Samavati&#146;s murder. Maddened by his grief he instructed
    Magandiya and her relatives to be tortured and burned to death as punishment. Later the
    king regretted his revenge. He kept seeing the compassionate Samavati and felt that he was
    even more distanced from her due to his act of revenge than resulted from her death. He
    embraced the teachings of the Buddha that had transformed Samavati and became one of his
    royal patrons. The Buddha declared Samavati to be foremost among the female lay disciples
    who practised loving-kindness.</font></p>
