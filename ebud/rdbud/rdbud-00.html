    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="foreword"></a><font color="#800000">Foreword</font></font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I admire Mrs. Radhika Abeysekera&#146;s fifth book in her
    series of Buddhist books. She is an untiring writer who writes on Buddhadhamma with
    confidence. She tries to fulfil the Noble Path of Right Effort and her efforts have become
    very fruitful. Her past four books are very popular among readers. Now her readers have a
    new book to enjoy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As I see it, the reason for the popularity of her books is
    her confidence (sradha) in the Buddhadhamma. Many authors write about the Buddhadhamma and
    how it relates to modern society. Even though the Dhamma (Truth) applies to the past,
    present and future, if the author does not have a clear understanding of the changing
    nature of the world &#150; the nature of impermanence, it is not easy to explain the way
    of the Dhamma to modern society.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The teaching of the Dhamma must be done with understanding
    and confidence. When we go to a doctor and request treatment for our ailments, we have
    confidence in the doctor&#146;s treatment. We have to approach the Dhamma in the same way.
    Only then can we see the real way of the Buddha&#146;s teachings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we have confidence in the Dhamma, we see the real
    nature of the Dhamma. When we explain the Dhamma in writing, we must write with full
    knowledge and compassion so that others can acquire that same understanding. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this book, and in Mrs. Abeysekera&#146;s previous
    writings, she inspires the reader with her confidence in the Dhamma. This particular
    characteristic of her writing captures the attention of the readers. When you read her
    stories you can see how she presents the Dhamma in each story. When you read her stories
    you feel as if you are listening to a virtuous, Buddhist woman explaining the teachings
    with complete confidence in the Triple Gem &#150; the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we do not have many books like this written in English,
    this work is a generous contribution towards the understanding of the Dhamma for students
    living outside of Sri Lanka and other Buddhist countries. We need more books like this
    which will help children to develop the correct knowledge required to live with wholesome
    values in this modern society.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is a pity that the modern world does not recognize the
    importance of these human values that existed in the past: values that brought calmness
    and contentment to the minds of all people in society. These values are slowly
    disappearing from use and practice. Many good values such as patience, forbearance,
    tolerance, generosity, morality, gratitude, loving-kindness, sympathetic joy, altruism and
    such other noble human qualities are missing from our daily practice. They are not taught
    to our children in the modern world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Children are not taught to be tolerant, patient and
    generous; instead they are taught that it is acceptable to retaliate, to be unforgiving
    and selfish. We can see in many children&#146;s television programs that producers do not
    think about the development of good values in the children&#146;s minds. We cannot see
    evidence of even the slightest attention being paid through programming efforts to
    children&#146;s moral development. As a result, future generations will develop into
    societies lacking in good qualities. The world will miss wholesomeness and society will
    have no real human values.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The degeneration of human values is seen everywhere in
    society. To avoid this, we should encourage our children and adolescents to read more
    about religious and historical characters such as are found in this book. How can we
    expect a peaceful and happy society when we neglect the moral education of our children?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is very important to understand that good values can be
    easily forgotten. It is difficult to develop good values in the minds of people who
    possess dormant unwholesome qualities such as greed, anger and delusion in their inner
    minds. Our fault today is that we expect happiness and peace by spending money but we have
    no time to reflect and don&#146;t try to understand how to acquire true happiness or
    peace. Unhappiness and absence of peace appear but we do not understand how to get rid of
    them. Without knowing the root cause we try to treat the symptoms of the disease.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha&#146;s advice for this is to understand,
    discipline the mind, and eradicate the cause, or the root of the disease. It is good to
    understand before attempting to uproot the cause. It is not wise to ignore, suppress or
    run away from the problem. Our children are unfortunate in that they are not given the
    instruction that will teach them to correct these characteristics in school.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the old days people had time to teach this to children.
    Unfortunately, modern children are missing this opportunity. They are not given this
    instruction at home, in school or at church. Adults expect calm and peaceful behaviour
    from children without first teaching them to behave and live in peace and harmony.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The average modern American child gets only ten minutes a
    day to talk with his parents as the parents are busy with their daily work. How can we
    expect innocent children who know nothing of the realities of this world to do as we want
    if we do not take the time to teach the values required to accomplish this?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Without first instructing our children or teaching them
    through example, we describe the concept of human rights and we speak about their rights.
    We encourage them to search for their rights. What rights can they earn without first
    learning to respect their parents and elders? It is the duty of the parents who brought
    the children into this world to teach them good qualities at home. Teaching them how to
    earn money only does not complete their education. It is also important to teach them the
    manners and human qualities and values that will allow them to live peacefully and happily
    as productive members of society. They have no other way of acquiring this knowledge if we
    do not teach them, for they came to this world without knowing the true nature of the
    world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This point must be understood by scientists, psychologists
    and educators. Those who perform research in education have forgotten this important
    aspect. This is a missing and often neglected concept in modern society and in the field
    of education.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We are thankful to Mrs. Radhika Abeysekera, who tries to
    educate our adults as well as our children by teaching the Dhamma as our ancestors did in
    Sri Lanka. A strong sense of learning and effort in Sri Lanka enabled people to build,
    even without modern machinery, great reservoirs, nine-story buildings and magnificent
    temples, the ruins of which can still be seen today, two thousand or more years later. I
    would like to draw our educators&#146; minds to think about this and to suggest an
    arrangement that would fulfil this missing aspect of our innocent children&#146;s
    education.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I hope our readers, who have been waiting to read Mrs.
    Abeysekera&#146;s writings on the Dhamma, will be happy to gain the knowledge of the
    practical human values that are slowly vanishing from our society. My good wishes and
    loving-kindness to all. May all beings be well and happy!</font></p>

    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="preface"></a><font color="#800000">&nbsp;Preface</font></font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Relatives and Disciples of the Buddha</i>, which is the
    second book in the series of Buddhism books that I have written, is my fifth publication.
    Once the students have knowledge of the life story of the Buddha, they need to be
    introduced to His relatives and disciples. Parents or educators should introduce the
    students to the appropriate life stories as they mature in the Dhamma. They will then have
    a strong foundation and background, which will enhance their studies in the Dhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This book is also written for the purpose of encouraging
    young students to emulate the lives of these heroic men and women. It has been written
    using plain language, structured in short chapters, and illustrated by some of the young
    children of Canada and Sri Lanka so as to appeal to the younger reader.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The positions held by the Buddha&#146;s close relatives
    and disciples were not chance happenings. They were positions that each of them had
    aspired to many aeons ago. They were positions of honour towards which each of them had
    worked tirelessly over many life cycles. As such, I wanted to include in each of these
    life histories the true beginning &#150; the point at which the aspiration was made. I
    have researched and attempted to document the true beginning of many of the Buddha&#146;s
    close relatives and disciples. It should be noted, however, that the Buddha had eighty
    great disciples on whom He conferred titles, and many thousands of disciples. As it was
    not possible to include all of them, a selection was made based on their contribution to
    the preservation of the Dhamma and on availability of material.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I was inspired and suffused with happiness when I worked
    on these life histories. These great men and women had worked tirelessly over many
    lifetimes, so that many years later we could still have access to the Dhamma by practising
    the teaching that they preserved and by following their example. I was inspired, not only
    because of the fortitude and effort displayed by the Buddha&#146;s disciples, but also
    because of their determination to renew their aspiration through countless life cycles.
    They each had the same goal &#150; to help the Buddha in His mission to enlighten men and
    gods by showing them the path to eradicate suffering. But because of the nature and
    disposition of each person, each chose a different role and made different aspirations in
    keeping with their natures.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mahà Màyà aspired to be the mother of the Buddha. Her
    aspiration, made many aeons ago, was to bring to birth a child who would be The
    Enlightened One. Yasodharà, His wife, aspired to be His helpmate. Over countless lives
    she worked tirelessly, supporting His every decision, and actively participated in helping
    Him complete the ten perfections. Mahà Pajapati, on the other hand, aspired to institute
    and form the order of the nuns (Bhikkhuni). Sàriputta aspired to be the Buddha&#146;s
    first chief disciple and foremost in wisdom. He was the true son of the Dhamma and
    assisted the Buddha in setting in motion the Wheel of Wisdom. Mahà Moggallàna chose to
    be His second chief disciple and foremost in supernatural powers. By using His
    supernatural powers and his ability to teach he helped many thousands to have confidence
    in the Dhamma and strive for emancipation. Kassapa aspired to be foremost in austere
    practices. After the Buddha&#146;s Parinibbàna they needed a role model who was pure and
    austere. It would have been easy to fall into lax practices and materialism. But Mahà
    Kassapa was there to help guide and preserve the Dhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each of the great disciples chose a different attribute in
    which to excel. Then, using this attribute, they helped the Buddha in the teaching and
    preservation of the Dhamma for future generations. What wonderful role models for our
    children! Researching the life stories of these great persons gave me added strength to
    continue in my mission of teaching the Dhamma and assisting in its preservation for future
    generations. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha had many supernatural and psychic powers. In
    general, however, He did not resort to miracles and psychic phenomena when teaching the
    Dhamma. This is because the attainment of psychic powers is not the Buddhist goal. The
    Buddhist goal is Nibbàna - the total destruction of suffering. He did not want His
    followers, enticed by miracles, to seek psychic powers as opposed to the supreme bliss of
    Nibbàna. There were, however, instances when He used his psychic powers to prepare His
    audience for the Dhamma. At times the pride of the people or their need for the
    supernatural had to be addressed first. And so we have instances like the Twin Wonder
    (Twin Miracle) that the Buddha performed to destroy the pride of the Sakyans.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Though the powers of the Buddha far exceeded those of His
    disciples, many of them also had supernatural and psychic powers. In attaining
    Arahanthship the great disciples acquired the ability to see into their past births in
    100,000 world cycles. Four of His disciples, Sàriputta, Mahà Moggallàna, Yasodharà and
    Bakkula, could see back into infinite periods of time. Arahanths like Mahà Moggallàna,
    Mahà Kassapa and Anuruddha had the power to visit the celestial and Brahma realms at
    will. Anuruddha could also view 1,000 world systems.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this book I have included instances of such
    supernatural powers. I have also attempted to cross-reference such instances by comparing
    the teachings of the Buddha to those of the great disciples. Over time, it is possible for
    the original words of the Buddha to be changed through translation errors and poetic
    embellishment of authors. The Buddha, who recognized this possibility, left us a set of
    instructions to follow before we accepted His teachings as absolute. I have also included
    in this book the way in which the Arahanths preserved the Dhamma. This will help the
    reader to form an opinion on the authenticity of the material. The Buddha&#146;s
    instruction, known as the Mahàpadesa, and by which His words should be tested, is as
    follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;A Bhikkhu may say thus - From the mouth of the
      Buddha Himself have I heard, have I received thus: This is the Doctrine, this is the
      Discipline, this is the Teaching of the Master. His words should not be accepted or
      rejected. Without either accepting or rejecting such words, study thoroughly every word
      and syllable and then put them beside the Discourse (teachings) and compare with the
      Monastic Disciplinary Rules. If, when so compared, they do not harmonize with the
      Discourses and do not agree to the Disciplinary Rules, then you may come to the
      conclusion: Certainly this is not the word of the Exalted One, this has been wrongly
      grasped by the Bhikkhu. Therefore you should reject it. If, when compared and contrasted,
      they harmonize with the Discourses and the Disciplinary Rules, you may come to the
      conclusion: Certainly this is the word of the Exalted One, this has correctly been grasped
      by the Bhikku. Let this be regarded as the first reference.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then went on to dispense the second, third and
    fourth reference by substituting the words<i>, &quot;Heard from the mouth of the
    Buddha&quot;, with,&quot;Heard from the mouth of the Sangha, Heard from the mouth of the
    Thera, and Heard from the mouth of Theri.&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It should also be pointed out that the reader has the
    choice of accepting or not accepting these events. <b>In the Jnànasàra-samuccaya the
    Buddha said, &quot;As the wise test gold by burning, cutting, and rubbing (on a piece of
    touchstone), so are you to accept my words after examining them and not out of regard for
    me.&quot; As such, we should always examine and question the Teachings and accept that
    which appeal to our reason</b>. The acceptance or non-acceptance of such phenomena does
    not in any way affect a person&#146;s ability to attain Nibbàna. It does, however, add to
    a better understanding of the spiritual development of the minds of Arahanths.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to introducing the reader to some of the close
    relatives and great disciples of the Buddha, this book illustrates the exceedingly long
    time it takes (about 100,000 world cycles) to fulfil a great aspiration and attain
    Arahanthship. The majority of these persons received the definite proclamation regarding
    the certainty of the fulfilment of their aspirations at the time of the Padumuttara
    Buddha. Yasodharà and His chief male disciples took even longer to fulfil their
    aspirations, as the level of perfection required was greater. And even though
    documentation was not available, the possibility exists that these great disciples were
    striving for these positions and completing virtues even prior to their encounter with the
    Padumuttara Buddha. It seems very plausible that a certain level of wisdom and spiritual
    development would have been required for the Padumuttara Buddha to be able to prophesy the
    certainty of their achieving their goal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I hope this book will inspire the reader to understand how
    fortunate we are that these great disciples had the courage and determination to perfect
    themselves over aeons of time to assist us in our emancipation<b>. Their goal was not just
    to attain Arahanthship. It was to attain Arahanthship with great attributes which would
    assist the Buddha in His aspiration to help humanity for many generations, by showing them
    the path to the total destruction of suffering.</b> It is hoped that this book will
    inspire others to make similar aspirations, so that future generations may benefit by our
    efforts just as we are benefiting by the efforts of these great disciples.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This book was not written for the purpose of introducing
    the Buddha&#146;s teaching. However, it would have been remiss of me not to use the
    opportunity to introduce the teachings when documenting the life history of Mahà
    Kaccàna. Mahà Kaccàna was foremost in explaining in detail the profound sayings of the
    Buddha to help novice monks and lay disciples who were not spiritually mature. To
    illustrate Mahà Kaccàna&#146;s contribution to the world, I have included some examples
    from Mahà Kaccàna&#146;s teachings. As Kaccàna was consulted to explain profound and
    complex teachings, these are for the advanced student. I have attempted to simplify the
    teachings but it must be recognized that these are teachings from the Abhidhamma and as
    such are more suitable for the advanced student than the beginner.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr. Dewaràja, who presented a paper at the University of
    Western Australia on &quot;The Positions of Women in Buddhism&quot;, studied the women of
    Sri Lanka, Thailand, Burma and Tibet over a period of time before the impact of Western
    influence and compared them to women in other Asian Countries. <b>She concluded that
    &quot;Buddhism saved the daughter from indignity, elevated the wife to a position
    approximating to equality, and retrieved the widow from abject misery.&quot;</b> I have
    attempted to bring out the enormous service that the Buddha performed to women when He
    instigated the order of the Nuns and proclaimed that women were as capable as men of
    attaining spiritual heights. The position of women and the beliefs at that time were such
    that women were treated with great disrespect. I have attempted to bring to light
    society&#146;s treatment of women at the time of the Buddha and the gratitude that His
    female disciples felt towards Him for giving them the opportunity for emancipation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This book, as the other books I have written, is my
    contribution towards the preservation of the Dhamma for future generations. May I, through
    this work, continue to develop wisdom, analytical skills and clarity of vision, so that I
    can transfer the knowledge I have acquired to others with ease, with a view to Nibbàna. <b>I
    also hope that reading this book will inspire others to make similar aspirations, because
    what one person has done another person can do.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whilst I researched many books to obtain the material
    required for this book, special mention needs to be made of some of the pioneers who
    translated the Pàli text to English. Professor Rhys Davids, whose father was a Christian
    clergyman, decided to study the Pàli language and Buddhism for the purpose of proving the
    superiority of the Christian faith. Instead, Professor Davids modelled his life on the
    Buddha&#146;s Noble Path and, together with his wife, Mrs. Davids, left a beautiful legacy
    of the Pàli text in English. As many as possible of the Theragàthà, or sayings of the
    elders, were taken from the book <i>Psalms of the Brethren</i>. Due to difficulties in
    obtaining the original translation<i>, The Elders Verses I, Theragàthà </i>and <i>The
    Elders Verses II, Therigàthà</i> by the Pàli Text Society of Oxford, as well as the
    beautiful work, <i>Great Disciples of the Buddha,</i> of the American-born Bhikku, Bhodi,
    were used as supplements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Compilations of the lives of the great disciples of the
    Buddha by the German-born monk, Ven. Nyànaponika, and the German scholar, Hellmuth
    Heckle, were also invaluable in my research. My grateful appreciation to these forefathers
    for their dedication in translating the Pàli text into English, for the purpose of
    preserving the Dhamma. Through this book, these international pioneers have contributed to
    the Dhamma knowledge of many more generations of international students.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many people contributed their time and effort to make this
    book special. Children of Canada and Sri Lanka, many of whom are my students, enhanced
    this text with their beautiful drawings. The children&#146;s perspective of the stories
    adds a touching depth which brings to life the great persons who preserved the Dhamma so
    that it would be available for them to study many years later. Their contribution, which
    has made this book a living memory of my Dhamma classes, is greatly appreciated. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As in the past Ven. Kurunagoda Piyatissa (Nàyaka Mahà
    Thera) encouraged me in my efforts by writing the foreword and reviewing the book for
    accuracy and improvement. His vast knowledge of the Dhamma continues to be an invaluable
    resource in my work. His strength, patience and selfless devotion to the Buddha Dhamma is
    greatly appreciated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">My good friend, Adrienne Bouchard Langlois, has worked
    tirelessly in enriching this text with her careful editing. She has undertaken the editing
    of this book at a time when great demands were being made on her free time. Despite her
    other commitments, she has ensured the quality of this book by going over this material
    again and again. The editing of a book is meticulous work that requires countless hours of
    concentrated effort. Her contribution to this book cannot be measured. Her friendship is a
    constant source of strength and her determination, inspiration and high standards are now
    an integral part of my work. My appreciation of her labour of love is boundless.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">My friend, Jay Jawroski, has made this book a work of art
    with her expertise and graphics design. She has designed the cover to reflect the wisdom
    and compassion of the many disciples and retained the importance of impermanence in the
    Buddha Dhamma. She has formatted the entire book to enrich its visual impact and has spent
    countless hours to make it attractive and appealing to the reader. She has scanned the
    children&#146;s drawings and enriched them thorough her expertise, to reproduce in vibrant
    colours. Her beautiful work has enhanced the children&#146;s illustrations and helped to
    bring to life the stories of the great disciples. Her generosity, compassion and
    experience of life have helped to strengthen my resolve and commitment in the preservation
    of the Dhamma for future generations. Words cannot describe my appreciation of her efforts
    and support.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">My books are now available on the Internet so that readers
    from all parts of the globe will have free access to them. Even with the generous help of
    sponsors, I was experiencing great difficulties in keeping up with the costs of free
    distribution. The demand far exceeded my supply of books. My friend, Masoud
    Moradi-Teleghani, has selflessly shared his technical expertise and developed my web site
    so that students all over the world now have access to my books. The beautiful title page
    was Masoud&#146;s representation of my work. With his title &quot;From Turmoil to
    Peace&quot; he effectively captured what I hoped to give to future generations through the
    Buddha Dhamma. The countless hours he spent formatting this work in HTML, a language that
    does not have Pàli fonts, is greatly appreciated. His technical and artistic abilities,
    compassion and quiet strength have been an invaluable resource in my work. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And last but not least I would like to thank my family for
    their consistent support of my work. The many hours I spend on my work is time away from
    them. By becoming involved in my work they have shared in my contribution to the
    preservation of the Dhamma. Together with many others they have encouraged me in my
    struggle to balance my career, family and writing. With understanding and patience they
    have provided the environment I need for research, teaching and writing. My grateful
    appreciation for their encouragement, understanding, and patience.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This book has been dedicated to my family, good friends
    and relatives who have supported me throughout the years in the preservation of the Buddha
    Dhamma. May I have the opportunity to assist them throughout samsara in their journey to
    enlightenment. May all beings find peace and lasting happiness!</font></p>
