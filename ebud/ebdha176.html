    face="Times New Roman">espite Buddhism's growing presence in the West, most Americans
    still badly misunderstand this ancient world religion. The leaders of Philadelphia's Thai
    community were rudely reminded of this unpleasant fact during the 1980s when they set out
    to buy land for a Buddhist temple and monastery not far from the City of Brotherly Love.
    After searching nearly a year, the Thais were delighted to find a lovely 10-acre site
    overlooking a lake in southeastern Pennsylvania's Chester County. All that was needed was
    the local zoning board's permission to use the site for religious purposes. </font><p><font
    face="Times New Roman">Arriving on the appointed day for their hearing before the board,
    the group's leaders were surprised to find an angry, standing-room-only crowd packing the
    room. One after another during the long evening, impassioned residents rose to vent their
    fears about the Buddhists' plans. A Buddhist presence would destroy the community's
    Christian and American values, some speakers said. Others worried that proselytizing
    Buddhists would brainwash their sons and daughters and lure them into esoteric religious
    practices. Buddhism to these Americans was barely distinguishable from the Hare Krishnas
    and other cults, an exotic threat to their world. The dismayed Thais immediately withdrew
    their application. No one had asked them about their intentions or aspirations. Nor did it
    seem likely that anyone would. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, the opponents of the Buddhist temple in
    Chester County were no worse informed about the nature of Buddhism than most other
    Americans. To be sure, the view of Buddhism as a mystical religion far removed from the
    realities of the workaday world has been a major part of the faith's appeal in the West.
    Yet whether this picture of Buddhism-as-esoteric-religion is seen in a negative or
    positive light, it is still a flawed and one-dimensional portrait. It is a portrait,
    however, with a long history. Some of the earliest Western explicators of Buddhism, such
    as W. Y. Evans-Wentz in Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrine (1935) and Alexandra David-Neel
    in Magic and Mystery in Tibet (1929), painted Tibetan Buddhism in shades of the exotic and
    esoteric. During the 1950s, D. T. Suzuki's depiction of Zen Buddhism as antirational and
    iconoclastic had great appeal to Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac (author of The Dharma Bums
    [1958]), and other members of the Beat Generation. The appeal spilled over into the
    counterculture movement, which made books such as Alan Watt's Way of Zen (1957) and Herman
    Hesse's Siddhartha (1922; translation 1951) part of the young's standard equipment. Today,
    Buddhism is probably personified for most people by the Dalai Lama and celebrity followers
    such as actor Richard Gere. (That is only the beginning: the Dalai Lama is featured in two
    upcoming Hollywood movies.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The view of Buddhism held by many Westerners is one-sided,
    but not totally without foundation. From its very beginning some 2,500 years ago, there
    has been within Buddhism a tension between the this-worldly and the other-worldly. This
    tension was at the heart of many early doctrinal controversies about such matters as the
    nature of Nirvana, the purpose of monastic life, and the character of the relationship
    between monks and the laity. Its origins go back to the life of the founder, Siddhartha
    Gautama, known as the Buddha, or the Enlightened One. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism emerged in what is now southern Nepal during the
    sixth century B.C.E. The traditional dates of the Buddha's life are 563-483 B.C.E.,
    although some modern scholars place his lifetime more than 100 years later. It was a time
    of unusual upheaval and change throughout the world, as the widespread adoption of iron
    tools and weapons revolutionized farming and warfare. During the Buddha's lifetime, the
    vast plains of northern India nourished by the Ganges River and its tributaries were being
    remade. The region's thick forests were disappearing as an expanding population claimed
    more and more land for paddy rice and other cultivated crops. New towns and cities sprang
    up, and with them came a radically new political order as powerful rulers absorbed the
    region's many small, autonomous states into larger kingdoms and empires. The Buddha
    himself lived to see the land of his clan, the Sakyas, overrun by another kingdom, which
    itself later fell to an even larger empire. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Elsewhere in the ancient world, similar changes were
    bringing forth other thinkers and prophets, from Confucius and Lao-tse in China to Thales,
    Heraclitus, and other pre-Socratics in Greece. In India, the Buddha and other mendicant
    truth seekers including Makkhali Gosala and Mahavira, the respective founders of the
    Ajavikas and the Jains - attracted small groups of disciples who followed an informal code
    of religious discipline and shared many of the same religious concepts. They set
    themselves against the dominant Brahmanism, which elevated a priestly caste to prominence.
    The charismatic challengers, although not revered as divine, were honored both for their
    teachings and for magical feats achieved through the disciplines of yoga, meditation, and
    asceticism. Solid facts about the Buddha's life are scarce. The earliest sacred
    biographies, such as the Buddhacarita (The acts of the Buddha), written in the second
    century B.C.E., are mostly myth and legend. Buddhism's many different traditions have
    different versions of the Buddha story, and there even are variations within each
    tradition. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the version accepted by Theravada Buddhists, who are
    predominant in Southeast Asia, the Buddha was born Prince Siddhartha Gautama, the son of
    the ruler of the Sakya clan in the foothills of the Himalayas. Shortly after his birth,
    eight learned fortunetellers predicted that Siddhartha would become either a universal,
    world-conquering monarch or a fully enlightened Buddha. Distressed at the prospect that
    his son might not succeed him, Siddhartha's father surrounded him with material pleasures
    and possessions. At the age of 16 the prince married, and his father built him three
    splendid palaces, one for each season, where he was attended by servants and concubines
    and no less than 40,000 dancing girls. During the next 17 years, according to legendary
    accounts, Siddhartha was &quot;wholly given over to pleasure.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The story takes a dramatic turn when the prince encounters
    a decrepit old man, a grievously ill man, a corpse, and finally an ascetic. These
    experiences threw Siddhartha into despair. His palace, &quot;as splendid as the palace of
    the chief of the gods, began to seem like a charnal ground filled with dead bodies and the
    three modes of existence [past, present, future] like houses of fire.&quot; He vowed to
    live the life of a wandering ascetic in a quest for an eternal truth beyond the transient
    truths of ordinary sense perception and beyond the inexorable realities of aging,
    sickness, and death. For six years he wandered northern India with five disciples (one of
    whom was one of the original eight fortunetellers). To no avail, he studied the teachings
    of the great philosophers and masters of yoga and practiced extreme forms of renunciation
    and asceticism, at times living on a single grain of rice per day, at others going
    completely without food. These years, says one Buddhist text, &quot;were like time spent
    in endeavoring to tie the air into knots.&quot; Finally, after he collapsed during a long
    fast and was given up for dead by his followers, the Buddha abandoned this path. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After he regained his health, the Buddha seated himself
    beneath a tree and resolved not to rise until he had found enlightenment. To achieve it he
    was forced to confront Mara, the lord of the senses, who is strongly associated with
    death. Again, accounts of this epoch battle between good and evil vary, but in the end
    Siddhartha defeats the hosts his foe sends against him, calling on the power of Mother
    Earth to defend himself. He spends the rest of the night in deep meditation, finally
    attaining insight into the nature of suffering, its cause and its cessation - a state of
    understanding and equanimity called Nirvana. The tradition dates this event to 528 B.C.E.,
    and the Buddha's first words uttered after his enlightenment have been passed down in
    poetry and legend: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Long have I wandered; <br>
      Long bound by the chain of life. <br>
      Through many births <br>
      I have sought in vain <br>
      The builder of this house [mind and body]. <br>
      Suffering is birth again and again. <br>
      O housemaker [craving], I now see you! <br>
      You shall not build this house again. <br>
      Broken are all your rafters, <br>
      Your roof beam destroyed. <br>
      My mind has attained the unconditioned, <br>
      And reached the end of all craving. </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's victory represents the core teaching of early
    Buddhism: suffering and death can be overcome only when ignorance and desire have been put
    aside. This message was encapsulated in the Buddha's first post-enlightenment teaching,
    Setting the Wheel of the Truth in Motion. This discourse, delivered to his five disciples
    at what is now the Deer Park in the holy city of Benares, enumerated the Four Noble
    Truths: that life's pleasures and satisfactions are ultimately unsatisfactory or
    unfulfilling, that this sense of dissatisfaction is rooted in selfish attachment and greed
    based on an erroneous perception of ego; that a deeper sense of purpose and meaning
    (Nirvana) is achieved when the false sense of ego is transcended, and that the way to this
    saving knowledge is by means of the Noble Eightfold Path. The Path's eight elements are
    right understanding, right intention, right speech, right conduct, right vocation, right
    effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before the five followers would accept his teaching,
    however, the Buddha had to persuade them that in casting off his life as an ascetic he had
    not merely embraced its opposite, a life of pleasure. The path to enlightenment, he told
    them, required following a Middle Way, avoiding the extremes of self-mortification and
    self-indulgence. The Middle Way is a life of simplicity, not discomfort. When the
    skeptical disciples finally accepted the Buddha's teaching they became the first members
    of the sangha, or religious order. They, too, eventually became, like the Buddha himself,
    arhat (perfected ones), though their enlightenment was not the equal of the full and
    perfect enlightenment of the Buddha. Soon the sangha had 60 members, all of whom traveled
    to spread the Buddha's teaching within an area of perhaps 200 square miles in northern
    India, and all of whom became arhat. Their leader himself spent 45 years as a mendicant
    teacher. According to Buddhist accounts, he attracted followers from many social classes
    and walks of life, including merchants, aristocrats, and even ascetics such as the great
    yogi Kasyapa, whom the Buddha converted through feats of levitation and clairvoyance.
    After some debate, the Buddha reluctantly allowed women to undertake the monastic life.
    Mahaprajapati, who was the Buddha's aunt as well as his stepmother, became the first
    Buddhist nun. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Western scholars and travelers who took up the study
    of Buddhism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were enthralled by this story of the
    Buddha's renunciation and enlightenment. In their writings they implicitly contrasted
    Buddhism with the faith-based theism of Christianity, portraying it as a rational
    religious philosophy pursued through a quiet life of renunciation and meditation. A few of
    these early observers emphasized the more mystical and esoteric aspects of Buddhism, but
    they shared with other Westerners a focus on what the famed German sociologist Max Weber
    called religious &quot;virtuosos&quot; - the Buddhist monks who performed heroic feats of
    fasting and meditation in pursuit of absolute truth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is largely because of these earlier writers, especially
    Weber, that the West has acquired a skewed portrait of Buddhism as a world-denying
    religion. Idealizing the sangha as a company of renouncers, they tended to dismiss the
    everyday devotional Buddhism of the faith's many ordinary adherents - including such
    things as their veneration of the sangha and of Buddha images and relics - as a corrupt
    form of Buddhism that arose as illiterate peasants throughout Asia embraced the faith
    after the Buddha's death. In these writers' hands, Buddhism was made to appear a faith
    virtually without historical, sociological, and political dimensions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the &quot;worldliness&quot; of Buddhism may be said to
    have begun with the Buddha himself. He was, after all, a man of considerable charisma who
    worked ceaselessly after his enlightenment to show others the way to the truth. Among his
    most important early supporters were local kings and nobles in northern India, men who had
    been moved by his words and deeds, such as King Bimbisara, the ruler of the kingdom of
    Magadha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha himself is said to have warned his followers on
    more than one occasion against worshiping him. In the Samyutta-Nitkaya, he sends away an
    overly attentive disciple named Vatkali, saying &quot;What good to you is this body of
    filth? He who sees the dharma [teachings] sees me.&quot; Yet in his own lifetime the
    Buddha received generous offerings from devoted lay followers, and veneration of his
    bodily relics may have begun immediately after his death (apparently from dysentery) and
    cremation in 483 B.C.E. According to Buddhist sources, the Buddha's cremated remains were
    divided among eight Indian rulers, who enshrined them in reliquary mounds (stupas) in
    their kingdoms. Legend also recounts that King Asoka, who ruled Magadha from about 273 to
    232 B.C.E. and eventually extended his dominion - and the influence of Buddhism - over
    much of the Indian subcontinent, re-enshrined these relics at 84,000 locations throughout
    India. As Buddhism later spread throughout Asia, ever more elaborate and beautiful stupas
    were built. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The cult of stupas was one of the earliest forms of
    Buddhist devotional religion. The stupa not only symbolized the Buddha but in a magical
    sense made him present. Freestanding images of the Buddha that began to appear as early as
    the first century B.C.E. served a similar purpose. In his own lifetime, the Blessed One
    and the sangha received offerings from their lay followers, who came not only to hear
    religious teachings but hoping to gain some boon or benefit - if not in this life then in
    some future one. After his death, pilgrims traveled to the stupas in order to be in his
    presence, bringing offerings of incense, flowers, and material goods. Monks, who were
    originally respected chiefly as teachers of the Buddha's dharma, came to be revered as
    representatives of his sacred wisdom and repositories of his power. They, too, were
    showered with offerings by hopeful laypeople. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ordinary religious practice developed along different
    lines in different countries, but it generally combines a concern with otherworldly
    affairs with a very ordinary interest in such things as good health and good crops. The
    faithful may worship at home before their own shrines and at weekly temple rituals.
    Throughout the Buddhist world, ceremonies and festivals mark major events such as the
    lunar New Year, Buddha's Day, and changes in the agricultural cycle. Some holidays are
    unique to certain locales or specially attuned to local tastes. Chinese, Korean, and
    Japanese Buddhists honor their ancestors during All Souls feasts. In Tibet, the new year
    festival includes a ritual exorcism of evil; in Chiang Mai, in northern Thailand, an image
    of the Buddha is paraded through the streets in hopes of ensuring the onset of the monsoon
    rains. A day at a temple fair with the raucous noise of hawkers and entertainers would
    convince most outsiders that Buddhism is not all about withdrawal and meditation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These rituals, ceremonies, and festivals elevate life from
    the mundane and give meaning to the seemingly random nature of human experience by
    connecting it to a Buddhist narrative framework. Buddhism also helps to define social
    ethics for laypeople, upholding the virtues of generosity and loving kindness toward
    humans and animals and placing a high value on honesty and uprightness. All Buddhists are
    expected to embrace the Five Precepts - which forbid killing, stealing, lying, adultery,
    and the consumption of alcohol. From the renunciant elements of Buddhist practice comes an
    emphasis on the values of simplicity, equanimity, and non-violence. These values are not
    confined to the monastery. Lose your temper in a 20th-century Chiang Mai market, and
    ordinary Thais will soothe you with the words jai-yen (literally, have a cool head). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While Buddhists have evolved various conceptions of
    salvation, early Buddhism did not look for release in an eternal hereafter. The Buddhist
    conception of existence is cyclical, with escape from the pain of worldly existence
    possible only for those who attain Nirvana after many lifetimes of effort. In Buddhism
    there is rebirth but no reincarnation. The Buddha taught that the idea of a self or soul
    is an illusion (a teaching that has caused endless debate among his followers). What is
    reborn is a consciousness conditioned by the sum of all past actions, or karma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism's concern with earthly affairs began, in a sense,
    at the top. As it spread through Asia during the centuries after the Buddha's death, it
    owed much of its success to the support of powerful kings, many of whom were attracted to
    Buddhism because it provided a cosmological scheme legitimating a powerful, centralized
    rule, a scheme rooted in a cyclical view of history. In the golden age, a universal
    monarch presided over a realm free from poverty, violence, and wrongdoing. But in a world
    marked by strife, hostility, and greed, kings must maintain order in the secular realm, by
    force if necessary, while the sangha presides over spiritual life and guides monarchs to
    further the welfare of their subjects. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Probably not by accident, many of the important legends
    concerning kingship date from about the time of Buddhism's most famous royal patron, King
    Asoka. In about 264 B.C.E. Asoka conquered Kalinga, the most powerful kingdom in India
    still independent of his rule, but was so appalled by the horrors his armies had inflicted
    on the Kalingans that he embraced the Buddha's teaching of nonviolence and compassion.
    Asoka became convinced that the only true conquest was not by force of arms but by the
    force of the teachings of religion. If his heirs should also become conquerors, he wrote,
    &quot;they should take pleasure in patience and gentleness, and regard as (the only true)
    conquest the conquest won by piety.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Asoka himself may not have been a practicing Buddhist, but
    there is no doubt that he was an active supporter of the faith. He generously subsidized
    the monastic order and did much to aid the spread of Buddhism. He was, by all accounts, a
    wise and humane ruler, and tolerant of other faiths (as were many later Buddhist rulers).
    On rocks and stone pillars he erected throughout the lands under his control - a number of
    them still standing - he engraved edicts extolling virtuous behavior, commending specific
    Buddhist texts, and encouraging his subjects to make the pilgrimage to Bodh-Gaya, the
    Buddha's birthplace. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A religion that lives by royal patronage can also die
    without it. Little more than 50 years after King Asoka's death in 232 B.C.E., when his
    empire passed into the hands of Hindu successors, Buddhism began to wane in the land of
    its birth. It would revive under royal patronage, but after the 10th century C.E. its last
    lights in India would flicker out under the combined assaults of a resurgent Hinduism and
    invasions by the followers of Muhammad. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Throughout Asia, the relationship between state and sangha
    would be vitally important to Buddhism's condition. In north China, Buddhism flourished
    until the Northern Wei emperor decreed in 446 C.E. that all Buddhist temples and stupas
    were to be destroyed. The religion was later revived but fell again after 846 when a T'ang
    imperial edict led to the destruction of some 4,600 monasteries and 40,000 temples and
    forced more than 260,000 monks and nuns to return to lay life. Buddhism by then was too
    thoroughly integrated into Chinese life to disappear, but it would never regain the
    vibrancy it had once enjoyed. Today, in other parts of Asia, the state's role remains
    important, for better and for worse. In Thailand, Buddhism flourishes as the state
    religion, while in Cambodia, the faith is still recovering from Pol Pot's murderous
    assault on monks and religious institutions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Asoka's patronage, however, was especially important in
    the history of Buddhism, for he not only sustained the faith at an important point in its
    development but spread it far beyond his own borders. According to Buddhist accounts, two
    of his children brought Buddhism to Sri Lanka, and another carried it to Central Asia. It
    was chiefly from Sri Lanka, especially around the 12th century C.E., that Buddhism spread
    to Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, and Vietnam. But Buddhism also traveled by
    many other routes. Central Asia became a major center of Buddhism by the first century
    C.E., and from there the faith spread along the Silk Road and into China and Korea. It
    also traveled from India across the Bay of Bengal to the region around Thailand. It was a
    two-way traffic. Pilgrims also journeyed to India from China and other far-flung regions
    in search of knowledge from the source. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">They did not always find the same Buddhism - and for good
    reasons: the Buddha's teachings were not even written down until several centuries after
    his death, and sanghas existed in widely scattered locales, many nurturing their own
    distinctive interpretations and producing their own texts. Tradition has it that there
    were 18 different schools of Buddhism in these early days. But the main division, arising
    as early as the first century B.C.E., separated Hinayana Buddhists and reformist Mahayana
    Buddhists, who took for themselves the mantle of &quot;Greater Vehicle,&quot; sticking
    their rivals with the &quot;Lesser Vehicle&quot; label. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are within these great schools many lesser
    divisions. Theravada Buddhism, with roots in the Hinayana tradition embraced and
    transmitted by Asoka, is predominant in Southeast Asia. Mahayana Buddhism includes many
    schools - including Zen in China, Korea, Vietnam, and Japan, and Vajrayana in Tibet, and
    Jodo Shin Shu (or the Pure Land) in Japan. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Theravada-Mahayana division has its origins partly in
    disagreements over the all-important rules of conduct governing monks, and partly in
    disputes over the meaning of certain Buddhist teachings about the nature of the self and
    the Buddha. Theravada Buddhists are said to be &quot;original&quot; Buddhists in that they
    adhere to the notion of the historical Buddha and the faith's early emphasis on monks
    striving for enlightenment. Mahayana Buddhism offers a more metaphysical reading of the
    Buddha, placing more emphasis on his previous lives as bodhisattva, or aspirant to
    Buddhahood. Many interpreters insist that Mahayana Buddhism makes the prospect of
    achieving Buddahood more of a possibility for laypeople as well as monks, and that it
    encourages all Buddhists, as bodhisattvas, to work for the liberation of other people,
    just as the Buddha did. But this distinction is debatable. What can be safely said is that
    Mahayana Buddhism blurs the distinction between monk and laity far more than classical
    Theravada did. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Everywhere it took root, Buddhism assumed a different
    coloration, engaging the world as it adapted to local cultures and religious practices. In
    many places, relatively simple and unorganized animistic faiths prevailed, offering
    relatively little resistance to Buddhism. In Thailand Buddhism encountered the phi, in
    Myanmar the cult of nats. In Tibet, a form of Tantric Buddhism (itself related to mystical
    Hindu Tantrism) that arrived in the 8th century C.E. blended with the local Bon shamanism,
    creating a unique form of Buddhism. By the end of the 16th century, Tibet had become a
    Buddhist theocracy ruled by the Dalai (great ocean) Lama (teacher), revered as an
    incarnation of Avolokitesvara, the kingdom's protective deity. The current Dalai Lama is
    the 14th in this line. Buddhism was most profoundly altered in China, Korea, and Japan,
    where Mahayana Buddhists faced well-established and sophisticated doctrines. In all of
    these countries, the monastic structure of Indian Buddhism gradually yielded to a more
    laity-based religious practice. In China, for example, Buddhism clashed with the secular,
    pragmatic doctrines of the Confucian elite, who could hardly have seen the
    &quot;otherworldly&quot; Buddhist pursuit of enlightenment and Nirvana as anything but
    alien and threatening. The withdrawal of monks from family and society, their dependence
    on others for their support, and their claims of independence from worldly government all
    cut distinctly against the Confucian grain. Chinese Taoism, too, with its emphasis on the
    living and on achieving harmony with the forces of nature, did not readily give way before
    Buddhism. So Buddhism in its many forms accommodated itself to China, attaching itself to
    existing doctrines where it could and adapting in other cases. In the meditative
    traditions that developed in India, for example, enlightenment is a goal realized only
    after many lifetimes of arduous practice under great teachers, while in the most
    authentically Chinese forms of Zen, enlightenment is a sudden, spontaneous experience. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The coming of Western colonialism and Christianity
    beginning in the 16th century cast a pall over the Buddhist world. In Sri Lanka, for
    example, by the time the Portuguese were expelled (by the Dutch) in 1658, some 150 years
    after their arrival, only five ordained Buddhist monks remained. In places where the
    Westerners were less zealous in their efforts to convert those they conquered or where
    other circumstances were more auspicious, Buddhism fared better, but only Thailand and
    Japan completely escaped colonization. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By the 19th century, resistance to colonial rule in many
    Asian nations was beginning to coalesce around a new Buddhist nationalism. In 1918, the
    leaders of the Young Men's Buddhist Association in Rangoon used the British colonials'
    refusal to remove their shoes when entering Buddhist pagodas to launch a campaign for
    Burma's independence. The country's first leader after independence in 1948, prime
    minister U Nu, saw himself in the tradition of the classical Buddhist kings, and like
    other Buddhist nationalists often evoked Asoka's name. Before he was displaced in a 1962
    coup, he tried to create a Buddhist socialism under which the basic material needs of all
    citizens would be met by the state, freeing them to pursue higher spiritual ends. Today
    many Buddhist monks risk prison or death to publicly support Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung
    San Suu Kyi, the leader of the democracy movement that struggles against the military
    dictatorship established after U Nu. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To Americans, modern Buddhism's engagement with the world
    was most memorably demonstrated in South Vietnam, where Buddhist protesters helped bring
    down the corrupt Ngo Dinh Diem regime in 1963. That year, the Venerable Thich Quang-Duc,
    one of many politically active Buddhist monks, set himself on fire in Saigon to protest
    the Diem regime's anti-Buddhist policies, an event engraved in the world's consciousness
    by photojournalist Malcolm Browne's famous photograph. The mobilization of Vietnam's
    Buddhist monks during the war years helped lay the foundation for a new kind of Buddhist
    involvement in the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the past four decades, an international, ecumenical
    Buddhism has emerged, led by a trio of remarkable men. The chief inspiration for the
    worldwide &quot;engaged Buddhist&quot; movement, as it is known, has been Thich Nhat Hanh,
    a Vietnamese Zen master and founder of the Tiep Hien Order of Interbeing, an international
    organization of laypeople, monks, and nuns headquartered at Plum Village, a meditation
    retreat in southern France. Sulak Sivaraksa, a Thai layman, has led efforts to fight rural
    poverty, prostitution, AIDS, and drug abuse in his native country - often battling the
    Thai government as well - and is the founder of the International Network of Engaged
    Buddhists. The groups in this alliance are transforming a monastery-based religion into a
    force against environmental degradation and the economic pressures that are destroying the
    social and cultural fabric of many developing countries. While friendly to Christianity
    and other faiths of the West, the leaders of this movement are critical of traditional
    Western views of nature and Western materialism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The world's most widely recognized representative of
    engaged Buddhism is plainly the Dalai Lama. Living in exile in the northern Indian city of
    Dharamsala, where he fled two years after communist China occupied Tibet in 1957, he has
    gained worldwide stature. He lectures around the world on human rights, economic justice,
    and environmental protection, and challenges the international community to bring pressure
    to bear on China to end its policies of ethnic cleansing and ecological and cultural
    genocide in Tibet. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, the Dalai Lama
    dispelled any sense one might have of Buddhism as solely an otherworldly religion. His
    speech included concrete proposals for Tibet and the world, including the demilitarization
    of his native country and a ban on the manufacture, testing, and stockpiling of nuclear
    weapons around the world - a ban that is coming closer to realization every day. His was
    not the speech of a monk locked away from the world in a meditative trance. Indeed, he
    closed his address with a short prayer that exemplifies the Buddhist spirit of engagement
    with the world: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>For as long as space endures, <br>
      And for as long as living beings remain, <br>
      Until then may I, too, abide <br>
      To dispel the misery of the world. </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Engaged Buddhism thus joins a long and honorable roll of
    Buddhisms that have been born during the more than 2,500 years since the nativity of the
    founder. It is this very heterodoxy and diversity - so extreme that not all Buddhists bow
    to the same Buddha - that have proved to be the faith's great strength over the
    centuries./. </font></p>
