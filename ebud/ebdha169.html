      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i> (Canada) of Saturday
      October 14, 2000 printed an article in the Faith page entitled, <i>Is evolution based on
      illogical premise?</i> by John M. Craig of Winnipeg. In the article Mr. Craig gives his
      reasons for not believing in evolution. The main reason given is the lack of fossils of
      transitional creatures (half fish/half amphibians). He then goes on to surmise that as
      such, creation must be accurate. No reasoning is given to prove that creation is accurate.
      After assuming that creation is accurate, Mr. Craig concludes his article as follows:</font></p>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In conclusion, we are raising a generation of
      young people to believe that there is no God and that they are just accidents evolved from
      algae! What does this belief do to the value of human life and the basis for morality? If
      we are nothing but evolved animals, then why shouldn&#146;t we live like animals?
      Isn&#146;t the rise in bloodshed of the last century just &#145;survival&#146; of the
      fittest. Aren&#146;t teen pregnancies, mass abortions (30 million in the US alone since
      Roe V. Wade&quot;) and STD&#146;s including AIDS simply the end product of a philosophy
      that has people living with no foundation for morals?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Evolution is a 19th-century philosophy that has been
      destroyed by 20th-century science, yet the myth continues to be perpetrated, not on
      scientific grounds, but because it is what justifies our immoral society today. If people
      admitted their was a creator then they would become morally responsible to that creator.
      Too many people today don&#146;t want to be morally responsible to anyone, other than to
      their own ego.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Christians and Jews can be confident that the first 11
      chapters of geneses records actual history, especially the six literal days for
      creation.&quot; -- </i>John M. Craig, Winnipeg.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">There was a host of scientific literature in response to
      the above article by professors and scientist who supported the theory of evolution. The
      following article which was from a moral and ethical point of view as opposed to a
      scientific point of view was not printed by the <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i> due to lack of
      space.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I </font>found the article &quot;Is
    evolution based on illogical premise?&quot; in last Saturday&#146;s Winnipeg Free Press,
    by John M. Craig quite interesting and would like to share my views with your readers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many world religions claim that their holy books state
    that God created the universe and man. The interesting point is that each of these holy
    books claim that it is their God and only their God that created the universe and each
    holy book then describes an interesting story as to how this was accomplished.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Looking at the different holy books impartially, it is
    only fair to say that they all have an equal chance of being accurate. Each of these holy
    books have been read and researched by many of its followers who are convinced of the
    Truth found in their book. As acceptance is based on a book written many years after the
    death of its founder as opposed to direct experience, they all have equal right to their
    claim. As such if we had four religions that claim that their holy book is correct they
    each have 25% chances of being accurate just as if we had five religions that made such
    claim they each have 20% chances of being accurate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to be fair by all the holy books, one could also
    presume that all of these Gods had a hand in the creation of the world. After all the
    universe is very complex. Unfortunately none of the holy books talk of such cooperation
    and harmony. And as such, it is doubtful if any of the theist religions are willing to
    accept such a possibility.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The possibility also exists that it is the same God that
    each holy book refers to with different names. The problem with this is that each holy
    book has a different account of how creation took place and a different description of the
    characteristics of their God. Some portray God as being compassionate while others portray
    God as being jealous and cruel. Different books may have different names for God but which
    of the books has the authentic version? It would be arrogant for any one to claim that his
    and only his holy book is correct, just because he happened to be born into a particular
    religious tradition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I personally have no issue with any religion that wants to
    take the responsibility for creation so long as the said God takes full responsibility for
    His creation. If a scientists creates an advanced robot with super intelligence that
    benefits mankind he gets credit and accolade for his creation. But if his robot
    malfunctions and starts maiming and killing indiscriminately, the scientist is held
    responsible for its actions. Similarly a manufacturer of any item is fully responsible for
    its defects and the result and suffering that may be caused by its defects just as he
    enjoys the profits and accolades of his success.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As such it is logical that which ever God created the
    universe should be held fully responsible for His creation. The earth quakes, volcanoes,
    floods and famine that take countless lives and cause untold suffering are the results of
    the flaws in the creation of the world. And just as we can credit the creator God for the
    gentle rain and sun that resulted in a good harvest we can credit the creator God for the
    untold misery. Similarly the blind and the handicapped, the sick and the lame can credit
    God for their suffering and misery just as they credit God for their talents and good
    health. We could even go as far as to place all evil and good on Gods shoulders. After all
    God created man. Even if He decided to give free-will to man it was His sole decision and
    as such He should take responsibility for any lack of wisdom in such a decision. As an
    all-knowing God, I am sure he was aware that some of his creations would cause more
    suffering and misery than joy and happiness. (<i>Beyond Belief</i> - A.L. De Silva;
    BuddhaSasana web site).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The question then arises is God compassionate or is he
    omnipotent? All the misery and suffering in the world leads me to believe that He can not
    be both? Most people would like to assume that God is better than us and that our goal is
    to be as God like as possible and as such use Him as a role model. And yet, if we were
    omnipotent would we cause such misery? We now live in a society where we are taught to
    help our children grow with love and understanding as opposed to spanking and hitting. How
    does one relate to a God who kills and maims to teach us to grow? As I have previously
    indicated, despite my non-belief in creation, I have no issue with religions claiming that
    their God created the world. They have to, however, in my opinion take full responsibility
    for His creation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I do, however, take exception to Mr. Craig&#146;s
    concluding statements. He writes, &quot;In conclusion we are raising a generation of young
    people to believe that there is no God and that they are just accidents evolved from
    algae. What does this belief do to the value of human life and the basis of
    morality?...&quot; Mr Craig implies that one can not be moral or value human life if one
    does not believe in a creator God. There are many people who do not believe in creation or
    an omnipotent creator God, who are moral. Compassion, loving kindness, generosity,
    tolerance, and universal responsibility exists in followers of every religion and in those
    that do not subscribe to any religion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I would like to draw the reader&#146;s attention to
    Buddhism, one such religion that has boundless compassion and wisdom that does not believe
    in an omnipotent creator God. And this is what the great scientist Albert Einstein says of
    Buddhism (<i>What intellectuals say about Buddhism</i> - Dr. K. Sri. Dhammananda):</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The religion of the future will be a cosmic
      religion. It should transcend a personal God, avoid dogmas and theology. Covering both the
      natural and spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience
      of all things natural and spiritual and a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this
      description. If there is any religion that would cope with modern scientific needs it
      would be Buddhism.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The tolerance and compassion found in Buddhism has been
    acknowledge by all informed religious leaders just as the compassion found on the Sermon
    on the Mount is acknowledged by all religious leaders. In fact the similarities found in
    the Sermon on the Mount and the Dhammapada of the Buddha have been the authorship of many
    scholars and academics.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr. Roy. C Amore, professor of religion at the University
    of Windsor in his book<i> Two masters one Message</i> has done a wonderful comparison of
    the startling similarities and differences of the two religions and has come to some
    enlightening conclusions. Morality exists in both religions despite their different
    beliefs on creation. Is this just coincidence or is it possible that one religion borrowed
    from the other? Interesting reading especially as the Buddha was born more than 500 years
    before Christ. Gruber and Kirsten in their book, <i>The Original Jesus - Buddhist Sources
    of Christianity</i> goes into an in-depth study of not only the similarities in some of
    the teachings on morality but the historical beginning and spread of the teachings. These
    are but few of the books that address some of the similarities in two of the world&#146;s
    leading theist and non-theist religions both of which contain deep compassion..</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr. Paul Dahlke of Germany in his <i>Buddhists Essays</i>
    states, &quot;It is the knowledge of the law of cause and effect, action and reaction,
    that urges a man to refrain from evil and gather good. A believer in cause and effect
    knows only too well that it is his own actions that make his life miserable or
    otherwise&quot;. Dr. Dahlke is referring to the Buddhist doctrine of kamma, where
    intentional wholesome and unwholesome actions have wholesome and unwholesome reactions at
    the opportune time and the doctrine of rebirth. Many scholars and academics have
    researched rebirth.<i> Many Lives Many Masters </i>- Brian Weiss MD, <i>Rebirth as
    Doctrine and Experience</i> - Francis Story, <i>Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation</i>-
    Ian Stevenson, and<i> Many Mansions</i> - Gina Cerminara are some that point towards
    rebirth and kamma. In this instance Dr. Dahlke shows that knowledge of the operation of
    the law of kamma and rebirth also leads its believers to morality. It is clear that belief
    in an omnipotent creator God is not an essential requirement for morality.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jack Kornfield in his book A<i> Path with Heart</i> and
    Howard Cutler MD. and His Holiness The Dalai Lama in their book the <i>Art of Happiness</i>
    effectively convey the boundless compassion and loving kindness found in Buddhism &#150; a
    religion that does not believe in an omnipotent God or creation. Buddhism is a
    non-violent, compassionate religion, and throughout its peaceful existence of over 2500
    years, not a drop of blood has been shed in the spread of the teaching of the Buddha.
    Unfortunately history does not support Mr. Craig&#146;s claims that belief in a creator
    God is required to value human life. Many theist religions have used the sword to spread
    their religion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The compassion found in Buddhism extends to all living
    beings. Not only are Buddhists to refrain from killing all living beings but Buddhists are
    advised by the Buddha to refrain from any livelihood that is harmful to living beings such
    as the selling of animals for killing and manufacture and sale of weapons and armaments
    used in war fare. Practising Buddhists accept these precepts or modes of discipline (which
    are not commandments) after careful examination and understanding. And then with effort
    they try to live up to their commitment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I believe that it is prudent to study all world religions
    before one claims that belief in an omnipotent God and creation are necessary for one to
    be moral. It is understandable for one who is brought up in a particular religious
    tradition to view the holy scriptures of that religion as being authentic. We must
    remember, however, that the frog in the well thinks it is the whole world. As we embark on
    the 21st century it is prudent that we study all world religions to find truth, compassion
    and tolerance. One will then see that morality and wholesomeness exists in every religion.
    All we need to do is to seek out the religion/philosophy/path that appeals to one&#146;s
    intellect and heart. Once one has confidence, gained through question and analytical
    examination of one&#146;s chosen path, one will practice with effort in order to reach
    one&#146;s spiritual potential. Human beings are varied and have different needs. Is it
    not wonderful that we have so many religious traditions to assist us in reaching our full
    spiritual potential?</font></p>
