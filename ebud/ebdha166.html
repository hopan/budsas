    reaching the threshold of the twenty-first century, a question of global character is on
    the minds of many people: &quot;What new era will be awaiting us in the history of
    humankind?&quot; In the years that hinge the two centuries what kinds of experiences and
    lessons are we having that make us feel more secure and more confident?</font><p><font
    face="Times New Roman">First of all, we have realized the global character of a number of
    crucial problems that are confronting us. Thus, we will be able to mobilize the wisdom and
    the strength of the peoples of the whole world to solve them in a better way. Examples are
    the problem of war and peace, the problem of building up a new economic order and a new
    world moral order, the problem of protecting our environment and so forth. The scope of
    these problems surpasses each and every nation and outreaches the hands of the specialists
    and authorities. A problem such as war which concerns the survival of humankind cannot be
    entrusted to a handful of militarists and politicians. This explains why the world peace
    movements were and are attracting a large number of people from many different strata.
    Nearly every country in the world, all continents, all races, all age groups, all
    professions, all political ideologies and all religious denominations have representatives
    in the peace movement. Only such a peace-protecting force, so mighty and so dynamic, has
    the power to stop the danger of a nuclear war, to fight against devilish warmongers, and
    to guarantee the victory of peace and progress. Only with such a global outlook towards
    the problem of war and peace can the peace movements score such an historic victory.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The danger of a global nuclear war has mobilized the world
    peoples' force against its occurrence. The last years of the twentieth century were and
    are witnessing some historic steps towards an era without nuclear and chemical weapons.
    Humankind seems relieved by the agreement on disarmament of medium-range missiles between
    the Soviet Union and the United States. But we cannot lessen our vigilance. Although the
    danger of a nuclear war has been lessened, wars with all their cruel and inhuman
    manifestations are still prevalent. Political and military violence persists among a
    number of nations, among peoples of racial differences and even among peoples of the same
    ideology and of the same political outlook, among comrades and friends in arms. In recent
    years, the relations between nations have undergone a major change, being characterized
    more and more by &quot;peaceful coexistence, mutual understanding, negotiation instead of
    confrontation, market frontiers rather than war frontiers.&quot; As to the internal
    political situations of many countries there has been a positive trend towards more
    democracy, the avoidance of oppression and cultural and intellectual coercion, and more
    respect and understanding towards different ways of thinking. We earnestly hope that this
    trend towards more democracy and towards more humanism in politics in the national and
    international relationship will be strengthened and deepened from now till the year 2000.
    Thus we are preparing for an era of real peace, peace for the whole planet, not only for
    some regions, but peace for all human beings. All kinds of wars, not only nuclear war,
    should be banished. All these manifestations of violence should be done away with forever.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We see that, and this is our second lesson, every crucial
    and critical problem of global character should be solved not only with a global outlook
    and a global force, but deeply and thoroughly from within every being. And here, with its
    special deep psychology and deep insight, Buddhism can offer many contributions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">First of all, Buddhism welcomes all peace movements and
    exhorts its practitioners to participate in these movements. To protect peace is to
    protect life and that is to put into application the first moral precept of Buddhist
    ethics. Buddhism is against all expansionist wars, which always include annexation of
    territory and wealth and interference into the internal affairs of other countries and
    nations. This is a violation of two very important moral precepts of Buddhist ethics: not
    to take what is not given, and not to commit actions that bring demerit. Buddhism denies
    all violent actions and manifestations under any pretext except in legitimate
    self-defense. All remember the following teachings of our Lord Buddha, Gatha Number Five,
    in the Dhammapada:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Hatred cannot put an end to hatred,<br>
      In this world this never happens.<br>
      Only non-hatred can bring hatred to an end,<br>
      This is an eternal law.&nbsp; </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism advocates any collective or individual endeavor
    which aims to create an atmosphere of mutual understanding, trust and respect among
    people, nations and human beings. Buddhism encourages dispelling prejudices, inferiority
    and superiority complexes, all of which are very harmful to human dignity and human
    values.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We Buddhists consider it of primordial importance to build
    up a new economic order and a new moral order which would mitigate the anger and turmoil
    of the present international political atmosphere. We envision a healthier more humane and
    more meaningful era.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We think that the current economic situation polarized
    between a few industrialized, well-developed and wealthy countries, and many poor
    countries, famished and underdeveloped, is built upon unfair trade, with raw materials
    purchased at a very cheap price, and with manufactured goods sold at a very high rate.
    This unfair trade cannot be continued any longer because it nurtures war and violence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We believe that to wipe out this present polarized economy
    and to build up a new world economic order with more justice and equality we should set up
    a new moral order based upon a new way of thinking and on some humanitarian principles
    readily accepted by humankind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Without a world moral order serving as an ethical
    foundation it would be very difficult to successfully establish a new world economic
    order. Even if it were to be successful, it would not be able to last long. The polarized
    situation would re-establish itself once again, even worse than before. That is why, to
    our thinking, priority should be given to establishing a new moral order based upon some
    basic humanitarian principles accepted by the world community. In the current crisis,
    Buddhism with its tradition as a religion for peace will be able to offer its worthy
    contributions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We think that one of the greatest contributions Buddhism
    can make to a new world moral order is its theory of &quot;no self.&quot; This theory
    plays an important positive role towards building up a moral way of life for the person of
    our times. The sickly psychic tendency of the modern person is to seek sensual pleasures
    and the accumulation of wealth. In order to guarantee individual enjoyment one tries to
    secure as much material property for oneself as possible. However, material property is
    limited while the greed of humans is unfathomable. That is why there is no way to escape
    from disputes and fights between human and human, between nation and nation, between
    people and people. And in this lies the root cause of war. With the theory of &quot;no
    self,&quot; we can say that Buddhism has dug up the very root of wars, conflicts and
    contentions. With an insight into &quot;no self&quot; a Buddhist once enlightened will
    escape the grip of both greed (lobha) and anger (dosa). One is greedy of something for
    oneself, but when the self is not there greed loses its target and has no incentive to
    exist. The same goes for anger. When the self is contradicted unsatisfied anger will
    arise. But when the self is not there anger will automatically disappear.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another expression which has a similar connotation is
    &quot;for the sake of others.&quot; Emphasis here is placed upon concrete help to others.
    A Buddhist who is imbued with the principle of &quot;no self&quot; would devote his
    thoughts, words and bodily activities towards bringing about the happiness and welfare of
    all sentient beings as his own aim and objective. During Lord Buddha's lifetime and even
    afterwards, in India, the birthplace of Lord Buddha, or in any other country where
    Buddhism had a presence, the ideals of &quot;no self&quot; and &quot;for the sake of
    others&quot; are the norms of a Buddhist moral way of life, whether one be a religious
    person or a lay person. As we all know, the Bodhisattva ideal of Mahayana Buddhism is
    nothing but a continuation of the principle of &quot;no self&quot; and &quot;for the sake
    of others&quot; which was found in the original Buddhism. In the Pali-Nikayas Lord Buddha
    urged his disciples as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Oh monks you should go forth, for the welfare of the
      many, for the happiness of the many, out of love and compassion for the world, for the
      happiness of the deities and men. . . . You should preach the Dhamma excellent in the
      beginning, excellent in the middle, excellent in the end, complete in meaning and in
      words. You should promote the holy life, extremely good and extremely pure. -- Mahavagga
      19</em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, the Buddhist theory of &quot;no self&quot;
    has deep implications in substance and in emancipation. Everything in this world is
    impermanent, with no self, with no substance whatsoever. So in ultimate reality, be it of
    glorious beauty, be it of the highest fame, or be it of wealth in plenty like forest and
    ocean--all are impermanent with no self, with no inner substance. There is nothing to be
    greedy for; there is nothing worth securing or possessing for oneself. Any person who has
    delved deeply into the spirit of no self is an emancipated person. Although he or she
    lives in the world he or she will not be bound by the world, and in behavior will always
    be calm, serene, undisturbed and self-mastered.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha was venerated as a messenger of peace for
    excellence. When asked by the wanderer Dighajanu what the gist of his teachings was, he
    replied explicitly:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;According to my teachings, among the world of
      the Devas, Maras and Brahma, with crowds of recluses and Brahmanas, deities and human
      beings, there will be no quarrel whatsoever with anyone in the world&quot; (M.I. 109 A).
      Further, he declared: &quot;Oh Bhikkus, I do not quarrel with the world, only the world
      quarrels with me. Oh Bhikkus, a speaker of the Dharma quarrels with nobody in the
      world&quot; -- (SN III, 165)</em>. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha made it very clear that his purpose in
    preaching the Dhamma was not to quarrel with other religious leaders nor to compete with
    any antagonistic doctrine. There was no quarrel in his teachings. He just showed the way
    out of suffering, the way to enlightenment and to liberation. To those who were beset with
    anger, he taught metta or compassion to subdue anger. To those who were prone to
    harmfulness he taught karuna or loving kindness to turn them into harmless ones. To those
    who were not happy over other peoples' successes, he taught mudita or joyfulness so that
    they knew how to share their happiness with others. To those who were addicted to hatred
    and enmity, he taught upekkha or equanimity so as to neutralize their vindictiveness. So
    he has specific cures for many mental diseases and ills of the world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the past in Vietnam under the Buddhist dynasties of Ly
    and Tran, there were kings who were Dhyana masters like King Tran Thai Tong. He had
    declared that he considered his royal throne as torn shoes, to be given up at any moment.
    Tran Thai Tong's grandson, King Tran Nhan Tong, after having gained victory over the
    struggle against the Nguyen Mong invaders, had donned the monastic robe and became the
    founder of the first Vietnamese Dhyana sect called Truc Lam Yen Tu. He composed a very
    famous poem in nom character which ended with four lines in Chinese characters. These
    lines clearly show his calm, undisturbed bearing when confronted with the ups and downs of
    the world:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>In life, we enjoy religion, according to
      circumstances,<br>
      When hungry we eat, when tired, we at once sleep,<br>
      With a treasure within oneself, there is no need to go in search of it,<br>
      When confronted with challenge, we keep our mind undisturbed and composed,<br>
      So there is no need to ask for meditation!</em> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last two lines of this short poem show the undisturbed
    and composed behavior of the king. &quot;When confronted with challenge, we keep our mind
    undisturbed and composed.&quot; This means that against the impermanent nature of the
    objective world the king's mind was always serene and composed, without any ripple. This
    sentence also clarifies a basic Buddhist belief that every human being already has a seed
    of enlightenment within himself/herself. In Buddhist terminology it is called Buddheity.
    He/she already has enlightened wisdom, shining and brilliant. So there is no need to turn
    outside to find happiness and enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The basic shortcoming of humankind in our times is the
    trend to forsake one's true self and run after the false self with all its terrific thirst
    and insatiable longing. Although in this most materialistic civilization the modern person
    lives a life of material opulence his spiritual life and mental aspirations remain
    unsatisfied. One constantly feels insecure, disturbed, and unbalanced. Such a mentality
    leads many people to narcotics, to mental hospitals, and sometimes to suicide.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Naturally, Buddhism does not praise a life of poverty and
    asceticism. Nor does Buddhism extol a low and bestial way of life of running after
    material sensual desires which reduces one into a weakling in body and a dullard in
    mentality. On the other hand, Buddhism has great appreciation for mental joy and
    happiness, dedication to moral living, and an exultation of enlightened bliss and
    liberation. Buddhism advises people to return to their own true self, to their own true
    personality, and to a way of life in harmony with society. Harmony should be engendered
    between oneself and nature, body and mind, compassion and wisdom, and feeling and
    intellect. Buddhism affirms that all people are capable of achieving such a harmonious
    inner way if only one so desires and if one acts in accordance with Lord Buddha's
    teachings and in conformity with the Buddhist way of life of virtue and wisdom. It extols
    a way of life that avoids the two extremes of indulgence in vulgar, low sense desires and
    bodily mortification and asceticism--a way of life leading to lasting joy and happiness.
    This is a way of life that all people from the East and from the West, male and female,
    young and old, religious and non-religious are able to lead and enjoy. That is the most
    famous eightfold way of life--a way that encompasses virtue, meditation and wisdom.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such a moral way of life will bring about concentration of
    inner mind (meditation). Such a concentration of inner mind will guarantee the clarity of
    wisdom. And a person of wisdom will be able to look at things as they truly are. Thanks to
    such an attitude humans are in a position to be their own master, to be the master of
    objective things instead of being their slaves. It is regrettable that this message of
    virtue, meditation and wisdom of Lord Buddha has become a victim of man himself, who has
    covered it with a cloak of mysticism, superstition, rites, ceremonies and scholasticism to
    such an extent that the spirit and the wording of this shining and simple message has
    become distorted, deformed, and far from humanity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now it is time for scholars and Buddhists to return the
    basic principles of Buddhism to their original brilliance and simplicity. Thanks to this
    brilliance and simplicity, Buddhist principles can enter deeply into the hearts of people
    and are welcomed and accepted by a large portion of people in this world, becoming their
    basic principles of life. The principles are converted into their daily bodily, vocal and
    mental activities. They become an invincible material force to change this world of war
    and insecurity into a world of peace and happiness, and thus to convert the era of the
    twenty-first century into an era of humanity, an era in which humanistic values will be
    the yardstick, the criteria of all values. Happiness or unhappiness of humans will be the
    red thread, the dividing line, clearly distinguishing truth from untruth, victory from
    defeat, right view from wrong view--an era in which man himself will become the supreme
    enlightened judge evaluating all political and social systems. Humankind will decide which
    system is best and which most full of vitality, which will be ultimately outmoded and
    withdrawn from the historic arena.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The motto &quot;inwardly-oriented,&quot; that is to say,
    the return, the coming back to oneself, to one's real self, should not be misinterpreted
    as a negative, pessimistic, and unsocial way of life. On the contrary, this is the most
    realistic guideline, the most vital and dynamic force for changing society and the world.
    Buddhism has also spoken of building a Nirvana in this very world. The whole problem
    hinges upon the question: From whence to begin? To begin with society to convert society?
    To begin with the world to convert the world? Buddhism is of the view that such a
    beginning is not realistic. It would be to put the cart before the animal. Buddhism is of
    the opinion that people should begin with themselves, making themselves thoroughly aware
    of themselves. One should understand oneself, convert oneself, purify oneself, and change
    oneself for the better in a tireless struggle every hour, every day, and in all aspects of
    one's life. Only then will society and the world become healthy, more lovely and more
    meritorious. If there are no healthy people, how can we expect healthy social
    relationships, morally good and lovely? If the thoughts of peace, happiness and harmony
    are not imbued deeply into the inner self of every human being, how do we expect to have a
    peaceful, happy and harmonious world?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Please allow me to quote some words of Lord Buddha, very
    simple words yet full of wisdom and loving kindness:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Victory brings out hatred,<br>
      Defeat leads to suffering,<br>
      To live an undisturbed and happy life,<br>
      Leaving behind both victory and defeat. -- Dhammapada 201</em> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A Buddhist who understands thoroughly the doctrine of no
    self does not put himself into antagonistic relationships with others, nor does he enter
    into disputes with other people. This explains his balanced and serene attitude, standing
    above board, leaving behind all victory and defeat. The Buddhist considers it of utmost
    priority to be victorious over greed, anger and delusion which are still dormant. He/she
    considers them to be the three most dangerous enemies because they are enemies from
    within. Not only do they make oneself suffer, they also are the source of the unhappiness
    and suffering of others.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Better it is to conquer oneself<br>
      Than to conquer others,<br>
      None can undo the victory<br>
      Of one who is self-mastered<br>
      And always acts with self-restraint,<br>
      Though one conquers in battle<br>
      A thousand times a thousand men,<br>
      Yet the greatest conqueror is<br>
      One who conquers self. -- Dhammapada 104-103</em> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In conclusion, I would like to offer the following new
    moral order, formulated from the teachings of Lord Buddha and applicable to this modern
    age. Such a moral way of life will minimize the risk of a nuclear war and usher in an era
    in which peace, security and harmony will become the norm. All humane values will be
    appreciated and respected.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Five Principles for a New Global Moral Order</strong></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman">First, dedication of our life to the welfare of all
          sentient beings, and to work for peace, disarmament and international brotherhood.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman">Second, the living of a frugal, healthy and contented life
          so as to devote more time and energy to peace and to the welfare of all living beings.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman">Third, abstinence from any action which leads to disputes
          and wars; performance of any action which leads to peace, harmony and international
          understanding.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman">Fourth, respect for the life of all sentient beings, for
          the life of our planet, and for the purity of our environment!</font></li>
