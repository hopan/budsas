    Buddhism has been in close connection with Ceylonese nationalism throughout Ceylonese
    history. This connection was even stronger during the British colonial period. Under
    British rule, the monasteries lacked official status and were unable to defend their land
    or rights. One report claimed that 800,000 acres of temple property were confiscated. The
    colonial government and the Christian missionaries took the entire school system out of
    the hands of the Buddhists. The Buddhists became second-class citizens, while the
    Christians and the English-educated rose to the best positions in the colonial
    administration. Only Christian Sundays and feast days and the British national holidays
    were celebrated in this Buddhist country. There were various anti-colonialist uprisings
    and prominent Buddhist monks were condemned to death. Threats of religious, national and
    cultural effacement like these led to the Buddhist revival in Ceylon.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 2382/1839, <font color="#0000FF">[1]</font> a parivena <font
    color="#0000FF">[2]</font> a Buddhist seminary or institution of higher learning, called
    the Parama-Dhammacetiya Parivena, was founded. Among the important Buddhist leaders
    produced by this parivena was H. Sri Sumangala Thera. In the years 2415/1872 and 2419/1876
    two more parivenas were established, the Vidyodaya in Colombo and the Vidyaalankaara at
    Kelaniya near Colombo, which were raised to the status of universities in 2502/1959.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, the learned Buddhists led by Ven. H. Sri Sumangala
    Thera and Ven. M. Sri Gundnanda Thera demonstrated their opposition to Western ideas,
    values and social practices by arranging public disputations with Christian missionaries.
    In these Buddhist -Christian controversies, the Buddhists considered the utter defeat of
    Christianity easy and certain, while the Christian missionaries could fairly estimate the
    difficulties of their position and day by day they had to commend themselves in prayer to
    God and confide in Him for wisdom and direction at every step.<font color="#0000FF">[3]</font></font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Reading the account of such a controversy published in the
    Ceylon Times in 1873, Colonel Henry Steel Olcott, an American Civil War officer, came to
    know of the Buddhist conditions in Ceylon. Then, in 2423/1880, he came to Ceylon to take
    part in the defence of Buddhism. He travelled around the country encouraging the people to
    revive their historic religion reorganized the Buddhist educational system on modern
    principles and founded the Theosophical Society of Ceylon. Within a few years he opened
    three colleges and 200 schools, and exercised considerable influence over the younger
    generation. One of the Young men who came under his influence was David Hewavitharne
    (mentioned earlier), who later became a great Buddhist leader called Anaagaarika
    Dharmapaala, the founder of the Maha Bodhi Society (2434/1891) and the Buddhist revival
    movement in India. The movement initiated by Col. Olcott also adopted a Buddhist flag and
    succeeded in making the Vesak a public holiday once more.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meanwhile, in the field of Buddhist studies, some of the
    British officials, who served in the Civil Service of Ceylon, through their private study
    and research, developed an appreciation of the Buddhist culture of Ceylon. Among these was
    Professor T.W. Rhys Davids who later founded the Pali Text Society in London in 2424/1881
    and wrote, edited and translated voluminous Buddhist literary works. By rendering the
    Buddha's teachings admirable in European eyes, he 'gave confidence and pride to the
    peoples who had preserved them'.<font color="#0000FF">[4]</font> He has been one of the
    two Westerners especially revered in Ceylon, the other being Col. Olcott.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Among Ceylonese scholars, it should be noted that lay
    Buddhists have played no less important a part in Buddhist literary activities than the
    monks. One of the best known or, probably, the best known, should be Professor G.P.
    Malalasekera, the compiler of the <i>Dictionary of Pali Proper Names</i>
    (2480-2481/1937-38) and Editor-in-Chief of the <i>Encyclopaedia of Buddhism</i>, the first
    fascicule of which was published in 2504/1961. The Encyclopaedia is a work of
    international collaboration and several regional committees have been set up for the
    better coordination of the work, the largest of these being the Japanese committee.
    Smaller committees also function in China, Burma, Thailand, Germany, France, Italy and the
    Netherlands. Some 2,000 pages of the Encyclopaedia have been published so far.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Among monk-scholars, the following names should be cited:
    Aggamahaapa.n.dita A.P. Buddhadatta, author of <i>Concise Pali-English Dictionary,
    English-Pali Dictionary, New Pali Course,</i> etc.; Dr. Vajira~naa.na Mahaathera, writer
    of Buddhist Meditation; Ven. Naarada Thera, an active Buddhist missionary and voluminous
    author; Ven. W. Rahula, author of <i>What the Buddha Taught</i> and <i>History of Buddhism
    in Ceylon</i>. Of no less importance and distinction than these scholars is Ven.
    Nyanatiloka, a German Buddhist monk of Island Hermitage in Ceylon who wrote <i>Guide
    Through the Abhidharnma Pitaka</i>, <i>The Word of the Buddha, Buddhist Dictionary</i> and
    other valuable works in German, English and Pali. Of his pupils, Ven. Nyanaponika, a
    German monk learned in the Abhidharnma, and Ven. ~Naa.namoli, an English monk with
    voluminous translated Pali works, are among international Buddhist scholars. In presenting
    Buddhist teaching and practice to the modern world, these scholars have been active in
    relating them to modern thought and much attention has been paid to the Abhidharnma and
    meditation. .</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>II. Nationalistic and International
    Buddhism</b></font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">A</font><font face="Times New Roman">fter
    Independence in 1948, the identification between Buddhism and nationalism continued and
    even led to the politicization of the Ceylonese Sangha. Several factors were accountable
    for this. Firstly, other religions, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity, were imported to the
    island by occupying powers during various colonial periods. Secondly, the fact that, by
    the British constitution, the Queen of England is the head of the Anglican Church and
    Defender of the Faith, caused in the Buddhists opposition to Ceylon's constitution of
    1946-47. They would ask, &quot;How can the Queen of England be defender both of the
    Christian and of the Buddhist religions?&quot; Thirdly, religious conflicts during the
    British colonial period increased in the Ceylonese love of their native culture,
    stimulated a desire to turn back to a golden past when Ceylon was under Buddhist kings,
    and thus led to the demand for the reestablishment of Buddhism as the state religion and
    the planning of educational and cultural policies under the guidance of Buddhist
    principles. Moreover, the fact that in Ceylon temple lands and monasteries are the private
    property of the monks who have interests in them may also have some connection with the
    matter. As a result of the politicization of the Sangha, every politician tries to win the
    support of the monks and the winners are those who attract the greater number of monks to
    their cause. Today, monks may be seen actively campaigning for a political party candidate
    or politicians making speeches with monks at their sides.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This politicization has, however, caused reactions,
    especially since the assassination of Ceylonese Prime Minister Bandaranaike in 1956. There
    has been a public demand for the purifying and reforming of the Sangha. Thus, there are
    trends to put an end to the politicization and secularization of the Ceylonese Sangha, and
    to restore it to the purely spiritual character of monasticism.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another trend worthy of interest is the involvement of
    monks in community development projects and programmes for rural uplift. Organizations and
    movements have been formed for the participation of monks in various kinds of work for the
    spiritual and material welfare of the people and for the improvement of the living
    conditions of the villagers, such as the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement (organized in
    2501/1958) and the Ceylon Farmers' Association (founded in 2509/1966). This trend can also
    be seen in other Southeast Asian countries, especially Thailand.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 2515/1972, Ceylon adopted a new constitution under
    which the country became a republic and its name was changed to Sri Lanka.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At present, there are three main sects of the Sri Lankan
    Sangha the largest and oldest, <i>Siam Nikaaya, </i>which is divided into two principal
    chapters, Malwatta and Asgiriya; the <i>Amarapura Nikaaya, </i>founded in the 19th century
    with about 20 percent of monk population; and the <i>Raama~n~na Nikaaya, </i>founded by
    reformist members of the Siam sect. While the former Siam sect derived its ordination from
    Thailand, the latter two are the recipients of ordination from Burma. There are no
    fundamental or doctrinal differences between these sects.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the population of 15,000,000 (est. 2524/1981),
    Buddhists make up 67 percent, while, of the rest, 18 percent are Hindu, 8 percent
    Christians, and 7 percent Muslims. There are almost 6,000 monasteries with about 17,000
    monks and 14,000 novices in residence.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Among the Theravada Buddhist countries, Sri Lanka has been
    the most advanced in modern Buddhist studies. Besides the two monastic parivenas of
    Vidyodaya <font color="#0000FF">[5]</font> and Vidyaalankaara <font color="#0000FF">[6]</font>
    which have been elevated to university status, admitting lay students as well as monks,
    the older secular University of Sri Lanka offers courses in Pali and Buddhist studies both
    for the lower and for the advanced degrees to all students, Sri Lankan and foreign,
    including monks.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sri Lanka has made great contributions to the progress of
    international Buddhism. Besides the above-described Maha Bodhi Society, Sri Lanka gave
    birth to another great international Buddhist organization, that is, the World Fellowship
    of Buddhists (WFB.) in 2493/1950. Professor Malalesekera who initiated the idea was
    elected the first president of the organization. Now the organization has its permanent
    headquarters in Thailand. In addition, until 2518/1975 Sri Lanka had sent abroad a far
    greater number of Dhammaduutas than any other Buddhist country, except Japan. Sri Lankan
    monks can be found residing in their vihaaras or residences in London, Washington, West
    Berlin and other Western cities, as well as in India. The Buddhist Publication Society of
    Kandy, established in 2501/1958, has regularly published two useful serial publications
    called 'The Wheel' and 'Bodhi Leaves', which have enjoyed a world-wide readership. Sri
    Lanka's monthly journals such as World Buddhism, meet with increasing numbers of readers
    in the English-speaking world. So far, as Trevor Ling says in his <i>A History of
    Religion: East and West</i>, &quot;Ceylon has also played a larger part than any other
    Buddhist country in making known to some of the non-Buddhist areas of the world the
    principles and practice of Buddhism.&quot;</font> </p>
