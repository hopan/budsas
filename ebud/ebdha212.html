        Sivaraksa of Bangkok, Thailand (or Siam, as he prefers to call his
        country), is probably that country's most prominent social critic and
        activist and a major contemporary exponent of socially engaged Buddhism.
        Now sixty years old, he has for the last thirty years combined
        provocative and innovative intellectual work with continual grass-roots
        organizing. He has founded rural development projects as well as many
        nongovemmental organizations dedicated to exploring alternative models
        of sustainable, traditionally rooted, and ethically and spiritually
        based development.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Periodically, Sulak (as he is known to
        his friends) has been persecuted; mostly dictatorships have ruled
        Thailand since 1932. In 1976, Sulak was forced into exile for two years.
        In 1984, he was arrested by the government for Ie-majestic (defamation
        of the monarchy), but after an international campaign on his behalf, he
        was released. In September 1991, he was again charged with lese-majeste
        and also with declamation of the army commander and Sulak went
        immediately into exile. In December 1992 he returned to face trial. It,
        March 1993, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. In June 1993,
        his trial, slated to last several months, began.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sulak's main works include Siamese
        Resurgence (1985), Religion and Development (1986), A Socially Engaged
        Buddhism (1988,), Siam in Crisis (1990), and Seeds of Peace (1992a).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This conversation took place between
        Sulak Sivaraksa and Donald Rothberg at Berkeley, California, in July
        1992.</font></p>

        <p><strong><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">WORK AND MAIN
        INFLUENCES</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Rothberg:</strong> How did
        your own work in Siam develop?</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sivaraksa:</strong> I started
        very small. In 1961, I returned to my country, having been in England
        eight or nine years, and then in 1962, I started working with the
        University Press in Bangkok. I started a journal called the Social
        Science Review in 1963 and got many people to write for it. Now my
        country was under a dictatorship since 1947, which had become much more
        severe since 1957; most social studies available were nothing but
        government propaganda dominated by American capitalism and militarism.
        Overnight, this journal became the central intellectual journal. Young
        people were attracted to it, although I had originally intended it for
        my peers and for those educated abroad. I started meetings for young
        people, using a temple in Wat Bovornives [a monastery in Bangkok, also
        housing a Buddhist university].[1] We explored alternative ways of
        thinking, and these young people began to become political; many of them
        were successful in changing the government in 1973. I also started a
        bookshop, which also became a meeting place. Everywhere I went, I
        started publications, printing presses, magazines, and books. I gave
        lectures, and I made many more friends, as well as more enemies. This is
        how I work.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I started in my own country with
        Buddhists, then worked with Christians, Muslims, and agnostics. Later, I
        expanded to my neighboring countries--Southeast Asia, South Asia, Japan,
        and America. My work has developed by interconnections on the basis of
        friendship.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I organized the Komol Keemthong
        Foundation in 1971 in order to promote the idealism of the youth; it was
        named after one of the young people working with me that I admired very
        much, who was killed by the Communists. Of course, this notion of
        promoting youthful idealism is too abstract; we actually use a number of
        concrete ideas taken from many places--from Thich Nhat Hanh, Ivan
        Illich, Paulo Freire, Dr. Ariyaratne of Sri Lanka. We still often work
        with this foundation. I also founded the Sathirakoses-Nagapradipa
        Foundation, named after two of my teachers, which works on environmental
        issues, on questions of conservation and natural resources, and also
        attempts to help artists and poets. At the Wongsanit Ashram outside
        Bangkok, connected .with this foundation, young people and artists can
        come for retreats, for periods of reflection and learning, as well as
        for meditation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have also founded ecumenical
        organizations, like the TICD [the Thai Inter-Religious Commission for
        Development], in which we work with Christians and Muslims on questions
        of alternative development, and the CGRS [Coordinating Group on Religion
        and Society]. I'm good at starting organizations; this is my strength. I
        like to give ideas to people; I find committed people, and soon I often
        have little to do with the organization!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Rothberg: </strong>What have
        been the main influences on your own connection of Buddhism with social
        action?</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sivaraksa:</strong> I have been
        very much personally influenced by Thich Nhat Hanh. He has suffered more
        than have most monks and has been involved more for social justice. In
        Vietnam in the 1950s and 1960s, he was very exposed to young people, and
        his society was in turmoil, in crisis. He was really in a difficult
        position, between the devil and the deep blue sea--the Communists on the
        one hand, the CIA on the other hand. In such a situation, he has been
        very honest--as an activist, as a contemplative monk (not unlike Thomas
        Merton), as a poet (again like Merton), and as a clear writer. Most
        important to me have been his teachings on &quot;interbeing&quot; (Nhat
        Hanh 1987a), and poems like &quot;Please Call Me. By My True Names&quot;
        (Nhat Hanh 1987b, 63-64). Of course, his work really rests on the
        traditional Buddhist teaching of paticca samuppada [&quot;dependent
        origination,&quot; the inter-relatedness of all phenomena] brought into
        a very contemporary setting.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have also been very influenced by
        Gandhi and by the Quakers. Gandhi experienced and responded to the
        dreadful suffering connected with the British occupation of the
        subcontinent. His radical approach was to be with the poor and to use
        nonviolent approaches, to use spiritual strength. Later, I came across
        the Quakers. I was especially interested in the radical Quakers and the
        idea of a religious society of friends. The Quakers regard friendship as
        central, just as did the Buddha. I was also very attracted by the Quaker
        notions of the sacredness of a human being and nonviolence. I found the
        Quakers more articulate than Buddhists on the need to question and
        resist the powers of the state, to question the status quo; Buddhists
        have been coexisting with the state for too long.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The new Western Buddhists and groups
        like the Buddhist Peace Fellowship really have been good for me.
        Particularly helpful have been people who have had a radical (and
        sometimes Marxist) background before they become Buddhists, who come to
        Buddhism with critical social awareness. For me, the Marxist systemic
        analysis of society, of the seeds of oppression, is very useful,
        provided it is placed in a nonviolent context. Perhaps radicals
        (including Marxists) can learn from Buddhists to be more humble, more
        mindful, to have some spirituality.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Johan Galtung,[2] a European who became
        a Buddhist, was the first one to lead me into serious thinking that
        Buddhists must take on the system rather than focus on individuals.
        Schumacher (1973) helped us in particular to think about the development
        of economic systems not based on greed and consumerism. Here, radicals
        and Marxists can also learn from us; we hate the dreadful system, not
        the people. In Christian language, we hate sin, not the sinners.</font></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">A BUDDHIST
        APPROACH TO SOCIAL ACTION IN THE CONTEMPORARY WORLD</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Rothberg: </strong>In your
        essay on &quot;Buddhism and Contemporary International Trends&quot;
        (Sivaraksa 1992b), you wrote that traditional Buddhist approaches and
        categories have not yet been adequately translated into modern terms.
        What do you think has to be done to make Buddhism relevant for modern
        social problems?</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sivaraksa:</strong> In making
        Buddhism more relevant for the contemporary world, it is important not
        to compromise on the essentials, such as the ethical precepts (sila).
        However, these ethical precepts need to be rethought in order to make
        sense of life in contemporary societies. Buddhists traditionally have
        lived in rather simple societies, largely agrarian, as is still often
        the case in Southeast and South Asia. In such societies, ethical issues
        may also be simple. One can say, &quot;I am a good person. I don't kill.
        I don't steal. I don't commit adultery. I don't lie.&quot; But, when the
        society becomes much more complex, these simple interpretation of
        ethical norms don't work so well.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, to follow the first
        Buddhist ethical precept, to refrain from killing living beings, is not
        so simple now; social reality in the modern world has become much more
        complex and interconnected. We have to ask questions like these: Do we
        allow our tax, money to go for armaments? Do we keep ourselves separate
        from the political realm and not challenge the government? Should we
        breed animals for consumption?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our understanding of the second
        preception to refrain from taking what is not ours, must also be
        extended. We may not literally steal in our face-to-face interactions,
        but do we allow the rich countries to exploit the poor countries through
        the workings of the international banking system and the international
        economic order? Do we allow industrial societies to exploit agrarian
        societies? The First World to exploit the Third World? The rich to
        exploit the poor generally?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can ask similar questions on the
        basis of the third precept, to refrain from improper sexual behavior. We
        need to think not just about adultery and hurting others, but also to
        think more broadly about other sexual and gender issues, about male
        domination and the exploitation of women. For instance, we use women for
        advertising in ways that promote sexism, lust, and greed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In fact, to participate in the system of
        consumerism is already to violate the first, second, and third precepts.
        Following the fourth precept, to refrain from improper speech, is also
        very difficult. Think of all the advertising and all the political
        propaganda, all the lies and exaggerations in the media and in
        education. We have to challenge all this even when it is legal.
        Buddhists in Asia often have liked to coexist side by side with the
        state and legal system. I think we have to reexamine ourselves.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist social ethics traditionally
        have been entirely personal. We have not looked at the system that is
        violent, that is oppressive, that in fact, involves theft.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist notion of enlightenment and
        understanding [or wisdom, Pali: panna] also needs to be extended so that
        enlightenment is not always internal enlightenment; here also Buddhism
        has been weak. Panna must involve a real understanding of yourself and
        of society. If your society is unjust, exploitative, and violent, how do
        you respond? With all the paramitas [or &quot;perfections&quot;] of a
        Bodhisattva, one dedicated to the liberation of all beings: humbly,
        seriously, without much attachment, with awareness, with vigor, with
        patience, with a great vow to change things.[4] But Buddhists have too
        often been &quot;goody-goodies&quot; and not really responded to all the
        suffering in society.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We also need a different understanding
        of suffering and the causes of suffering (the first two &quot;Noble
        Truths&quot; taught by the Buddha). Suffering at the time of the Buddha
        was certainly often dreadful, but it was simpler to understand; the
        interrelatedness of all phenomena that is a main teaching of the Buddha
        was simpler then and is much more complex now. We Buddhists need help
        from the social scientists: from sociologists, psychologists,
        anthropologists, etcetera. We should be very open and translate the
        findings of these disciplines into Buddhist understandings. Of course,
        one must have the right view of things and use these sciences to help
        against greed, hatred, and delusion; otherwise, all these methodologies
        and sciences could lead one astray. But without the work of these
        disciplines, we may become deluded and think that Buddhist practice can
        solve everything. It doesn't, Without transforming the Buddhist sense of
        wisdom to bring in understanding of and response to social reality,
        Buddhism will not be so relevant and might only appeal to the middle
        class. If we are not careful, it will become a kind of escapism.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Rothberg:</strong> Sometimes
        when I read Buddhist texts or talk to Buddhists, even many socially and
        politically concerned Buddhists, they often seem to suggest that the
        basic problem is internal greed, hatred, and delusion, as if working on
        the individual is most fundamental. According to this way of thinking,
        whatever problems there are with societies or systems are just an
        expression of what is &quot;inner.&quot; There is little sense of a more
        &quot;dialectical&quot; relationship of individual and system, of how
        greed, hatred, and delusion are formed by systems, while the systems are
        then supported further by greed, hatred, and delusion. Of course, there
        is much traditional Buddhist emphasis on sangha [community] and ethics,
        but the assumption commonly is that changing the inner leads to outer
        change. How might we develop a vision of socially engaged Buddhism as
        integrating inner and outer work more fully so that the one informs the
        other?</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sivaraksa:</strong> Ambedkar,
        the leader of the untouchables in India. who became a Buddhist at the
        end of his life, challenged the Buddha in a wonderful way.[5] He said
        that it was not enough to speak of the cause of suffering as being
        greed, hatred, and delusion; that is only to speak of more
        &quot;internal&quot; causes. The social structure is also a cause of
        suffering; as an untouchable, he could see that yew clearly.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's intention was certainly to
        change individuals; the ultimate aim was liberation. However, he
        intended to help liberate not only individuals but the whole society,
        His method was to create the sangha, the community, as a kind of
        alternative society within the larger society that would influence the
        larger society indirectly.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But we should also remember thin the
        larger society at that time was not all that wicked. The system wasn't
        too rigid. One changed individual could make a big impact. A rich man, a
        kind of banker at the Buddha's time, Supata, who became Anathapindika,
        became the supporter of all the poor in the region. In our time, you can
        get one good banker and nothing particularly changes. Now you have to
        change the whole system of banking! We must be very demanding in
        transforming ourselves, but I think we would be deluded unless we also
        have a clear understanding of how to change the oppressive society.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Bodhisattva vow to save all sentient
        beings is a special challenge to all Buddhists. Without that vow, we may
        become very selfish. We may not be able to change the world right now,
        but we can begin by encountering, understanding, and sharing the
        suffering of others, and wishing to help. Of course, we must do this
        with equanimity and detachment. This is compassion, karuna, our basic
        attitude guiding both our more internal and our more external work.
        There must be a balance of the internal and external; to stress one at
        the expense of the other is for me a betrayal of Buddhism.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Rothberg: </strong>When I
        visited earlier this year the monastery of Pah Ban That (in northeast
        Thailand) founded by Ajahn Maha Boowa, I had several conversations with
        Bhikkhu Pannvaddho, an English monk who is probably the senior Western
        monk in Thailand. He questioned whether it was real]y, possible for
        persons socially engaged to live fully the spiritual life, no matter
        hob' helpful they might be. For him, to live this life is to work for
        liberation by uprooting the &quot;defilements&quot; that block one's
        basic love and understanding. Flowever, this requires living in a highly
        supportive environment, like that of a war [monastery]. The life of
        social engagement will very likely not have the spiritual depth that is
        possible for a monk in such an environment as a monastery.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>This is a major concern for many
        people in the West. Our intention is to work socially in a way that
        brings much spiritual depth, as well as social depth, rather than
        somehow act superficially in both dimensions.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sivaraksa:</strong> Of course,
        it is a great danger that those who are socially engaged lack spiritual
        depth, inner calm, and peace; some activist Buddhist monks (for
        instance, in Sri Lanka and Burma) have sometimes even become violent*
        But what Pannavaddho said is applicable only to a small minority of
        monks, those who are convinced that their prime duty is to get rid of
        defilements. It is unrealistic to expect that all monks should have
        these intentions. Even at the time of the Buddha, many monks did not.
        Monks should act somewhere between the minimum (following the basic
        ethical precepts) and the maximum (practicing for liberation); most are
        in between. Beyond following the minimal ethical precepts, the monk
        should make some contribution. In the Theravadin Buddhist tradition,
        there is the custom of having town monks, who help and lead the people
        in various ways, for instance, in education and medicine; this is the
        traditional expression of socially engaged spirituality.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Without the spiritual dimension,
        however, those working socially will burn out. We must have joy, peace,
        and rest for ourselves, in our families, among our neighbors. If we are
        to connect ethical norms and social justice, we must have time for
        spiritual development, time to meditate, time to integrate head and
        heart, and then time for renewal and retreat several weeks a year,
        sometimes with teachers who help us and question us. This is why centers
        of renewal like Buddhadasa's Suan Mokkh, the &quot;Garden of
        Liberation&quot; [in south Thailanda], Thich Nhat Hanh's Plum Village
        [near Bordeaux, France], or the center I myself started, the ecumenical
        Wongsanit Ashram, are so important.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Without this kind of inquiry and
        practice, those trying to transform society will be more likely to be
        greedy, wanting to be big shots, or full of hate, wanting power, or
        deluded, wanting an impossibly ideal society or being a naive do-gooder.
        Meditation and critical self-awareness help one to see these
        questionable motivations or at least to ask oneself: &quot;Am I doing
        that out of greed or hatred?&quot; even if there is no clear answer.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But meditation alone is not
        sufficient--because people suffer so much. One must also act; one must
        do what one can.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The basic understandings of the three
        founding patrons of the International Network of Engaged Buddhists
        [INEB, founded by Sulak], the Dalai Lama of Tibet, Thich Nhat Hanh of
        Vietnam, and Buddhadasa Bhikkhu of Siam, are all very relevant.[6] Each
        of them, representing one of the three main Buddhist traditions
        (Vajrayana, Mahayana, and Theravada), meditates regularly and is very
        concerned about developing &quot;dhammic&quot; societies, societies
        based on wisdom and compassion. Each of them has faced suffering very
        directly and responded very fully, in ways from which we can learn.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dalai Lama has been exiled for over
        thirty years from his native Tibet. He uses meditation and compassion,
        teaching us to love the Chinese government and Chinese individuals who
        have often committed atrocities against the Tibetans, killing,
        destroying temples, and so on. His teaching is very relevant for my
        young bhikkhus [monks] in Sri Lanka, in the middle of a civil war; how
        car, they learn to love the Tamils? I have not been successful yet. But
        many of these monks are now starting to meditate and joining in
        traditional monastic practices, like collecting alms.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thich Nhat Hanh has also been a great
        help. In Thailand, for example, he helped the Vietnamese refugees, who
        have often been very badly treated by Thais in their refugee camps; some
        of the refugees have been raped by That pirates. Thich Nhat Hanh worked
        with them, teaching them not to hate Thais. He has also helped the
        refugees when they've settled in America and in Australia, helped them
        especially with their wounds from the war. For Trier Nhat Hanh, to help
        others is to help oneself. Those of us who have been to Plum Village,
        the spiritual community in France that Trier Nhat Hanh started, can see
        how meditation and social awareness both flourish there.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhadasa may not have been persecuted
        as much as the other two leaders, but he has been often attacked. He has
        been called a Communist by some; some Sri Lankan monks called him a goat
        and a propagandist for the Christians. A well-known Buddhist scholar
        criticized him as a non-Buddhist and called him, a senior monk (now
        eighty-seven) all kinds of names, largely because he was open to
        approaches from outside the Buddhist tradition. Buddhadasa is very much
        based in Buddhist tradition, of course; he is very strict in following
        the Theravadin ethical precepts. At the same time, he has embraced
        Vajrayana and Mahayana Buddhism as valid paths. His Holiness the Dalai
        Lama went to visit him. He has also admired the work of Thich Nhat Hanh.</font></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">THE IMPORTANCE
        OF COMMUNITY</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Rothberg:</strong> A life
        integrating social engagement and spiritual work in the West is quite
        hard for many reasons, especially because there are not so many support
        structures. At the Buddhist Peace Fellowship summer institute in July
        1992, you spoke about community as an important form of nonviolent
        resistance, as a support for questioning consumerism and the structures
        of domination and oppression.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sivaraksa:</strong> It is
        important that daily life be lived in community. The present daily life
        in industrialized societies, so much based on separation, individualism,
        and consumption, is not conducive to socially engaged spirituality. The
        Buddhist tradition, on the other hand, emphasizes the centrality of
        community life based on simplicity. There is the old tradition that
        monks should not have more than three robes, only one bowl, one thread,
        one needle, and one pair of sandals. We are also taught not to be
        attached or give great significance to money even if we lay people need
        money for survival). The more we ate self-reliant, growing our own food,
        and so on, the less money becomes important. Whatever we grow we are
        willing to share with others. That is why I think that you need to live
        close to nature and be with people. In our traditional society, it has
        always been like this. Whatever you cook, you share with others. It
        would be good for this approach to come back. I think that this is
        possible, if people think seriously and question consumerism, promoting
        nonagreed, nonhatred, and nondelusion, educating people about
        alternatives to materialism and about how to make capitalism more sane.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In our society, especially in the
        countryside, we still have extended families in most of the country,
        except in Bangkok, which is just like any Western city. We still respect
        our parents and grandparents and have feelings for the poor, the blind,
        and the mentally retarded; we don't feel ashamed if we have mentally
        retarded people in the family. We have to reinforce what is positive in
        the traditional approach (in areas like agriculture, medicine, food, and
        dress); otherwise, modern trends will wipe everything away.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Rothberg:</strong> In the
        United States, Buddhism is often interpreted very individualistically.
        Gary Snyder (Ingram, Gates, and Nisker 1988, 5) once said that Sangha is
        the least developed of the &quot;Three Jewels&quot; of Buddhism [the
        &quot;Three Jewels&quot; are the Buddha, or the example of the liberated
        person; the dhamma, or basic teachings about liberation; and the
        sangha).</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sivaraksa:</strong> When my
        teacher, Ajahn Buddhadasa, reached the age of eighty-four, the end of
        the seventh cycle of his life according to our custom, I produced the
        book Radical Conservatism (Sivaraksa, Hutanuvatra, Chaemduang,
        Sobhanasiri, and Kholer 1990). I think that the title is important. As a
        Buddhist, if one is not radical and does not work to eliminate
        suffering, one may end up only taking a little bit of Buddhism for one's
        individual ego. But Buddhism is not often radical; it coexists too
        easily with capitalism and consumerism. If Buddhism is not radical here
        in the United States, it will one day simply become a kind of
        Americanism and not make much of a contribution, just as Buddhism is
        often a mere decoration in Japan.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many intentions to create community in
        this country have failed, largely because individualism has become so
        strong and because communities have not been firmly based on ethical
        guidelines. I think of Locke, and your Declaration of Independence, that
        would make possible &quot;life, liberty and the pursuit of (what they
        call) happiness.&quot; Too often, of course, the pursuit of happiness is
        really the pursuit of property, The traditional member of the Buddhist
        sangha has no property whatsoever. All members are equal economically
        and socially. Lay people can look at the sangha as a model and try to
        have less property, not be so attached to what they do have, and work
        for greater economic and political equality.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The community must also be based on
        ethical precepts. Of course, ethics is not just about not killing or
        stealing or abusing another sexually; it is also about respecting
        others, sharing our resources, seeing how we can contribute, living
        harmoniously, and so on. If we can develop Buddhist communities that
        rest on simple living, are close to nature, and that encourage serious
        thinking that challenges consumerism and the status quo, that would be
        an important contribution.</font></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">FIRST WORLD AND
        THIRD WORLD: WORKING AND LEARNING TOGETHER</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Rothberg:</strong> At the
        present time, there is much more interaction of &quot;First World&quot;
        and &quot;Third World&quot; socially engaged Buddhists. How can we best
        work with each other? What car, we learn from each other?</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sivaraksa:</strong> Again, the
        essential point is that each person must develop critical
        self-awareness, humility, seeds of peace, and then dialogue is possible,
        listening is possible, good friends are possible. Once we work together,
        particularly in relation to suffering, then the gaps between rich and
        poor, First World and Third World, North and South, are gone; we become
        partners and friends. Alone you can't do very much, but with your
        friends, you can do a great deal. If you want to gain exposure to the
        South, then you need people from the South to help you. If I want to go
        to Sri Lanka or Burma, then I need friends from those countries to help
        me, so that I can learn from them, and they can learn from me. I need to
        respect them, be genuine and sincere, and be at their level, not wear a
        big cap.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The conditions in the United States for
        socially engaged spirituality are difficult. Consumerism, greed,
        loneliness, manipulation of political power, and hatred have become so
        strong. Worst of all, the people are so deluded, most of the time
        unknowingly. Working with us in Asia may be helpful, working for half a
        year, or a year, helping the Tibetans, or the Ladakhi, or the Thai, or
        the Burmese. But this shouldn't be escapism. You might work in Asia and
        see that the source of suffering there is perhaps in the First World.
        When you come back here, after you have lived with them in community and
        close to nature, you may have more motivation to live like this in your
        own country.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It can also be helpful to be exposed to
        a society where it is clearer that there is delusion, where power is
        clearer. In my society, for example, you can see that the generals kill
        people openly. In this country, the generals never kill your people.
        They're much more clever, and the people stay deluded; the wars are all
        supposed to be just, great for the American flag, for the open society,
        the liberal West, and so on.</font></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">OPPRESSION,
        RECONCILIATION, AND THE MIDDLE PATH</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Rothberg:</strong> Although
        engaged Buddhists may identify systems of domination and oppression,
        they often question the tendency among many leftists to polarize
        oppressors and oppressed; Buddhists more often emphasize reconciliation.
        How do we identify systems of oppression, as well as those concrete
        persons who are in many ways responsible for oppression, without forming
        a rigid distinction between &quot;good&quot; people and &quot;bad&quot;
        people?</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sivaraksa:</strong> This is the
        most difficult question. This is where you need serious spiritual
        practice. It is easy to condemn the oppressors, but actually when you
        condemn others, you also condemn yourself. Right now in my country, this
        difficult problem is very central [following the demonstrations and
        killings of hundreds in the streets in Bangkok in May 1992]. Of course,
        it is very easy to pass judgment and believe in right on one side and
        wrong on the other. But here you have to have a deeper understanding
        that is often difficult to explain, of karma and interdependence over
        vast periods of time and space. We must cultivate this deeper
        understanding, thinking also about the nature of social systems, rather
        than just focusing on the persons.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you get attached to right and wrong.
        you become so tiresome and full of haired. and ultimately you may have
        to kill; in Christian terms, you become God. We must develop more mercy
        and compassion. Here, the West can learn from the Buddhists. Our ability
        to forgive is our strength. But, of course, you have to practice; you
        have to go deeper and radicalize yourself, going beyond thinking about
        &quot;an eye for an eye.&quot;</font></p>

        <blockquote>

          have been added by the interviewer.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Johan Galtung is currently a
          political scientist and peace researcher at the University of Hawaii.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. The five basic ethical precepts in
          Theravada Buddhism include guidelines to refrain from killing,
          stealing, &quot;false&quot; speech, improper sexuality, and
          intoxicants that cloud the mind. Sec Saddhatissa (1987).</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Traditionally, there are six
          paramitas: giving or generosity (Pali:dana), ethical integrity (sila),
          patience (khanti). vigor (virya), meditation (somadhi), and wisdom
          (parina).</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar (1891-1956),
          after a careful survey of the world religions, came to the conclusion
          that Buddhism was best suited to meet the ethical, social, and
          spiritual needs of both the untouchables in particular and the
          contemporary world generally. He converted publically shortly before
          his death, and since then perhaps twenty million former untouchables
          in India have followed in converting to Buddhism. For a short account
          of Ambedkar's life, see Queen (1993).</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. For representative works of these
          authors, see Dalai Lama (1984, 1990), Nhat Hanh (1987b, 1992), and
          Swearer (1989). Buddhadasa (1906-) may be the least known of these
          three figures in the West, but he is probably the best-known monk in
          Thailand of the twentieth century. He is the founder of an innovative
          as well as highly traditional community of forest monasteries and is
          known for his questioning of religious orthodoxy, his deep interest
          both in meditation and in social change, and his prolific writings.</font></p>
