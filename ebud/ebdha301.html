      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT>n all Theravada countries chanting 
      is a large part of the religious observance, both for the laity and in the 
      monastic life. Morning and evening chanting is pretty well universal in 
      the monasteries in Asia. What&#39;s usually chanted are passages either taken 
      directly from the suttas or worked over a bit for phonic and mnemonic 
      reasons to create a chant that has some musical quality to it.
      <P>The act of chanting is a devotional meditation practice. It is a form 
      of contemplation. The centerpiece of our own morning and evening chanting 
      is built around the contemplation of the Three Jewels or Three Refuges: 
      Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. These contemplations are three of the forty 
      contemplations listed in the commentarial texts, so they are very 
      traditional. </P>
      <P>The benefits of contemplating the Three Jewels are manifold. We 
      experience an uplifting sensation in the heart as we align ourselves with 
      that which is higher and nobler. We&#39;re tuning in to the frequency of our 
      highest potential -- the Buddha being representative of a human being who 
      achieved his full potential; the Dhamma being the expression of ultimate 
      truth; and the Sangha being the body of enlightened beings, past, present 
      and future. </P>
      <P>By aligning the deepest aspect of ourselves with the highest potential 
      through the contemplation of the Three Jewels, we overcome negative 
      mind-states. Buddhanusati, the contemplation of the Buddha, is one of the 
      meditations called the Four Protections. They protect us from all manner 
      of unwholesome mind-states, lift us out of dullness and depression, and 
      bring us into joy and light. Joy is a very strong characteristic of 
      devotional practice. It helps us to overcome the self-view and 
      ego-clinging through the surrender to that which is the highest potential.
      </P>
      <P>So, I thought I&#39;d go through the words for what&#39;s called <I>&quot;The Mirror 
      of the Dhamma,&quot;</I> which is the chant that begins with <I>&quot;itipi so.&quot;</I> 
      It is the formal contemplation of the Three Jewels and occurs in our 
      evening chanting. </P>
      <P>The basis for this passage occurs several times in the Pali Canon. 
      Perhaps the most important is in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta of the Digha 
      Nikaya, the sutta concerning the death, or parinibbana, of the Buddha. At 
      that time, when he was close to death, many of the bhikkhus were asking 
      the Buddha what happened to such and such a monk or nun who died last 
      year. The Buddha replied, &quot;Well, she was an anagami; she&#39;s gone to the 
      highest heavens and will have one more life there and then go on to final 
      liberation.&quot; Or, &quot;He was a stream-enterer; he has seven more births.&quot;He 
      then went on to explain the characteristics of a sotapanna, a 
      streamenterer. In this formulation he described four traits, the first 
      being very good morality, or sila, and the other three being faith in the 
      Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha and their attributes. He listed these attributes, 
      and this is the passage that begins <I>&quot;itipi so bhagava araham.&quot;</I> </P>
      <P>I&#39;ll start with the attributes of the Dhamma, which is the shortest 
      list. </P>
      <I>
      <P>Svakkhato bhagavata dhammo</I>. The Dhamma is well expounded by the 
      Blessed One. The Dhamma is well expounded because it&#39;s meant to be perfect 
      in meaning and perfect in letter. It&#39;s quite an amazing body of literature 
      -- a huge corpus of texts with a very high degree of internal consistency, 
      a brilliant structure, and a lot of natural cross-references between 
      teachings. When you study the texts in depth, you&#39;ll find all kinds of 
      nuances: the way the different elements in a list of dhammas are ordered, 
      the rich and very evocative similes and metaphors, even humor. Take 
      advantage of this feature: the well expoundedness of the Blessed One&#39;s 
      teachings. I encourage everyone to dip into this treasure house of 
      spiritual literature and read the Pali Canon. </P>
      <P>The next characteristic of the Dhamma is <I>sanditthiko</I>, which is 
      translated as apparent here and now. This is a slightly loose translation. 
      Basically, it means &quot;visible.&quot; The root -- ditthi -- is &quot;view.&quot;The Dhamma 
      is something that can be seen. It&#39;s not some abstruse theory; it&#39;s 
      immediate reality, and we can experience it. </P>
      <I>
      <P>Akaliko</I> is timeless. That&#39;s a very literal translation. There are 
      many levels and layers to this word. The Dhamma is timeless because it 
      expresses universal truths that were valid 2,500 years ago, are valid 
      today, and will be valid 2,500 years from now. The Buddha made it clear 
      that the Dhamma was not something he invented; it&#39;s something timeless 
      that he discovered. He gives the analogy of uncovering a lost city in the 
      jungle -- overgrown with creepers and discovered by archeologists. This is 
      what the Buddha did; he discovered an ancient truth. </P>
      <P>Another meaning of timeless is that the Dhamma is immediate. The 
      realization of nibbana is always just an instant away. The ultimate Dhamma 
      is also timeless in the sense that it is outside of samsaric concepts such 
      as space and time. It is completely &quot;other&quot;; it can&#39;t be framed in terms 
      of time. </P>
      <P>The literal meaning of <I>ehipassiko</I> is come and see. <I>Ehi</I> is 
      an imperative verb that means &quot;come.&quot; There is another use of this verb in 
      the Canon; it&#39;s what was called the &quot;<I>ehi bhikkhu</I>&quot; ordination. In 
      the early days of the Buddha&#39;s teaching, he would simply say, &quot;Come, 
      bhikkhu.&quot; It&#39;s said that the person would miraculously lose all their hair 
      and have robes. So the verb ehi is an invitation. Passiko is another form 
      of the verb to see. It means &quot;come and see.&quot; </P>
      <P>The quality of Dhamma is that it&#39;s inviting us to check it out. This is 
      a very strong characteristic of the Buddha&#39;s teaching. There&#39;s no 
      heavy-handed demand: &quot;Believe this.&quot; The faith element doesn&#39;t have the 
      same role as in some other religions. We&#39;re asked, we&#39;re invited,to 
      examine the teachings to see whether they fit. This is also an expression 
      of the confidence that the Buddha and arahants had in their Dhamma; they 
      realized it for themselves and know that we can, too. </P>
      <P>The translation of <I>opanayiko</I> is undecided in our community; it&#39;s 
      either leading onwards or leading inwards. I&#39;m not quite sure what&#39;s the 
      current &quot;high church&quot; dispensation on the issue, but both inwards and 
      onwards are quite reasonable. In terms of the Dhamma the two are almost 
      synonymous. It&#39;s a characteristic of the Dhamma that it leads us into our 
      depths, which is where truth and liberation and relief are found. They&#39;re 
      not found anywhere else. </P>
      <I>
      <P>Paccattam veditabbo vinnuhi&#39;ti</I> is all one phrase. It means that the 
      Dhamma is realizable for oneself by the wise. The Dhamma is of benefit for 
      those with little dust in their eyes. </P>
      <P>Taken together, these characteristics of the Dhamma emphasize its 
      immediacy and possibility. This is very important. </P>
      <P>Next, I&#39;d like to speak about the characteristics of the <I>Sangha</I>. 
      The meaning and usage of the term sangha is sometimes a bit confused and 
      controversial. The original meaning of the word was simply &quot;community&quot; in 
      the loosest possible sense. In some modern Indian languages it&#39;s still 
      used in a similar way. But like many common words of the time, the Buddha 
      gave them technical meanings. In the Pali Canon these are two: there&#39;s the
      <I>Bhikkhu Sangha</I> and the <I>Ariya Sangha</I>. The Bhikkhu Sangha is 
      the order of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, the monks and nuns, the fully 
      ordained ones. The Ariya Sangha, or the Noble Sangha, has a higher 
      meaning; it&#39;s the sangha of beings who have obtained some degree of 
      enlightenment on the Buddhist path. These are the stream-enterers, 
      once-returners, non-returners, and arahants, whether they are lay or 
      ordained, male or female, past or present. </P>
      <P>The current American Buddhist usage of the term refers to the people we 
      practice with -- our sangha. Some &quot;purists&quot; object to that usage because 
      it&#39;s looser than the narrow, technical meaning. But it&#39;s close to the 
      original broad meaning of sangha, so I really don&#39;t have an issue with it. 
      But in terms of this passage in our chanting, the reference is clearly to 
      the <I>Ariya Sangha</I>, and this will become clear below. </P>
      <P>The first characteristic of the Sangha is <I>supatipanno bhagavato 
      savakasangho</I>, the Blessed One&#39;s disciples who have practiced well. The 
      word savaka literally means &quot;one who listens, one who hears.&quot; Those beings 
      who became enlightened from following the teachings of a buddha are 
      classed as savakas. Among the classes of enlightened beings there are also 
      paccekabuddhas and buddhas. A paccekabuddha and a buddha are beings who 
      became enlightened by their own effort without hearing a teaching, so they 
      had a more difficult path. Well-practiced means they practiced the 
      eightfold path to its completion. </P>
      <P>The word <I>uju</I> means &quot;straight,&quot; as in upright as opposed to 
      crooked. In English the word crooked has the connotation of being criminal 
      or dishonest. The opposite is straight or upright. It has that sense in 
      Pali, too. </P>
      <I>
      <P>Nyaya</I> is &quot;with knowledge&quot; or &quot;with wisdom.&quot; The disciples of the 
      Blessed One have practiced with knowledge. Samicipatipanno: they practice 
      the Eightfold Path completely. The description of enlightenment in some 
      contexts -- particularly in the commentarial and Abhidhamma texts -- is 
      based on two moments. The path moment occurs when the factors of the 
      Eightfold Path are perfected and reach into the transcendental level, 
      which results in the fruition moment. The path moment is considered 
      karmically active, and the fruit moment is considered karmically 
      resultant, or passive.</P>
      <P>This leads to the next line: <I>Yadidam cattari purisayugani attha 
      purisapuggala</I>. That is the four pairs, the eight kinds of noble 
      beings. This refers to the four levels of enlightenment -- stream-enterer, 
      once-returner, non-returner, and arahant -- multiplied by two since each 
      level has a path moment and a fruit moment. There is an interesting and 
      controversial technicality here. In the orthodox Theravada interpretation, 
      fruit moment always follows path moment instantaneously, so in any given 
      moment the odds that there&#39;s anybody at path moment are pretty small. Some 
      of the other early schools of Buddhism taught that it was possible for a 
      path moment and fruition moment to be separated, that there may be beings 
      who have perfected the path at one of the levels and are waiting for the 
      fruition moment. In that sense, there could be eight types of noble 
      beings. This is controversial, speculative stuff, which probably leaves 
      you just as confused as ever! </P>
      <I>
      <P>Ahuneyyo pahuneyyo dakkhi-neyyo anjalikaraniyo</I>. Worthy of gifts, 
      worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect. Anjali is 
      the gesture of placing one&#39;s palms together in respect. </P>
      <I>
      <P>Anuttaram puññakkhettam lokassa&#39;ti.</I> They give occasion for 
      incomparable goodness to arise in the world. Khetti means &quot;field,&quot; like a 
      farmer&#39;s field. The metaphor that&#39;s being alluded to here is that gifts, 
      offerings, or respect given to noble ones is like throwing seeds into a 
      field. They will fruit into meritorious karma or an &quot;incomparable field of 
      merit.&quot; Some texts describe the multiplication factor of giving: if you 
      give food to an animal, the karma is such that the results will come back 
      to you 100 times; if to an unworthy human, 1,000 times; if to someone who 
      is practicing on the path to liberation, 100,000 times; and if to an 
      enlightened being, myriads and myriads of times. </P>
      <P>Finally, I saved a discussion of the characteristics of the Buddha for 
      last because it&#39;s in some ways the most interesting of the three. <I>
      Buddhanusati</I>, or contemplation of the Buddha, is a highly recommended 
      meditation. It&#39;s one of the protective meditations. When we contemplate 
      the Buddha, we&#39;re contemplating the highest potential of a human being. 
      What I find inspiring about the Pali Canon&#39;s descriptions of the Buddha is 
      that they combine the attributes of a very human individual with those of 
      a marvelous, liberated mind. </P>
      <P>There is a discourse by the medieval Zen teacher Dogen in which he 
      talks about seeing the Buddha and seeing the old man Shakyamuni at the 
      same time. That is, when you see the old man Shakyamuni, do you also see 
      the Buddha? And when you see the Buddha, do you also see the old man 
      Shakyamuni? </P>
      <P>In a certain phase of Buddhist history -- medieval times -- there was a 
      tendency in India to reify and deify the Buddha. It was a gradual thing. 
      First, they said that his feces didn&#39;t stink, next that he didn&#39;t defecate 
      at all, then that he didn&#39;t need to eat but did so only out of compassion 
      for sentient beings to allow them to make merit by offering him food. At 
      the extreme, one particular text describes the Buddha as appearing 
      miraculously on this earth -- he had been enlightened from beginningless 
      time -- sitting in full lotus in a golden pavilion, remaining there for 
      forty years without moving a muscle, continually emitting a single tone in 
      which all the teachings and discourses could be heard by highly evolved 
      beings who then wrote them down. This is an exaggerated example of seeing 
      the Buddha but not seeing the old man Shakyamuni. There&#39;s no contact with 
      humanity left in that sort of conception. </P>
      <P>In modern times, I fear that some are swinging to the other extreme. 
      There&#39;s a kind of mean-spiritedness; people love debunking and knocking 
      their heroes down off the pedestal. It&#39;s almost a fanatical 
      egalitarianism: if people raise their head above the common level, we&#39;ve 
      got to drag them back down. I&#39;ve heard people say things like, &quot;Well, the 
      Buddha was, after all, a man of his times. He had some opinions that were 
      incorrect because they didn&#39;t know any better in those days, and he didn&#39;t 
      rise above that.&quot; This despite the Pali Canon&#39;s teaching that there&#39;s 
      nothing the Buddha isn&#39;t enlightened about and that the teaching is 
      perfect in word and letter. Whether one believes that or not, it loses the 
      point if all we see is the old man Shakyamuni without seeing the Buddha.
      </P>
      <P>The attributes of the Buddha included in the chanting emphasize the 
      marvelous, but it&#39;s important to bear in mind that the vehicle for these 
      attributes was a human being. He suffered in his old age from backaches 
      and dysentery -- very human, earthy experiences -- and he obtained his 
      enlightenment after great struggle and sacrifice. Yet a buddha is someone 
      who has reached the full, absolute human potential, and the idea behind 
      this is that our deepest level is intrinsically pure. The Buddha is 
      someone who has removed all the obscurations and demonstrated the 
      potential of a human life. </P>
      <P>The first characteristic is <I>araham</I>, which is another grammatical 
      form of the word arahant. This word was used prior to the Buddha&#39;s time in 
      general Indian religious discourse to mean &quot;a perfected one.&quot; It&#39;s 
      technical meaning in the Buddhist texts is &quot;someone who has eliminated all 
      the defilements,&quot; or someone who has reached the state of great purity and 
      perfection. Gotama Buddha is a special arahant because he&#39;s a buddha. All 
      buddhas are arahants, but only a few arahants are buddhas. </P>
      <I>
      <P>Sammasambuddho. </I>Fully enlightened by himself. In the classification 
      of enlightened beings there are paccekabuddhas and sammasambuddhas. A 
      paccekabuddha is someone who does not establish a teaching, sometimes 
      called &quot;silent&quot; or &quot;solitary&quot; buddhas. They may teach in a small way -- 
      perhaps to a few individuals -- but they don&#39;t establish a dispensation 
      and are forgotten after their own time. Whereas a sammasambuddha 
      establishes a teaching -- a Dhamma and a Sangha -- and their influence 
      survives their time. The influence of Gotama Buddha is still vast in the 
      world today. </P>
      <I>
      <P>Vijjacarana-sampanno.</I> Impeccable in conduct and understanding. 
      Carana literally means &quot;walking fair in traveling.&quot; The Buddha walks 
      through the world perfectly. This includes the concept of keeping 
      perfectly all ethical principles, but it goes beyond that. It also 
      includes being perfectly mindful. The Buddha makes no mistakes; he is 
      flawless. Vijja-sampanno means &quot;perfect in knowledge.&quot; </P>
      <P>This leads into areas that are somewhat controversial historically. 
      There&#39;s been debate within Buddhism about the range of a buddha&#39;s 
      knowledge. To my mind, it is a particularly pointless discussion for those 
      of us who are not buddhas to speculate on the range of a buddha&#39;s 
      knowledge. There is a strong tendency within the Theravada to want to give 
      the Buddha one form or another of omniscience. In the commentaries, the 
      official definition of the range of the Buddha&#39;s knowledge is that 
      anything he wanted to know he could know -- like the number of fish in the 
      Ganges. He didn&#39;t automatically know it to start with, but if he turned 
      his mind toward that question, he could find the answer. </P>
      <P>What the Buddha actually said about his own knowledge is marvelous 
      enough. He spoke particularly about the Three Knowledges he obtained on 
      his enlightenment night. The first was the penetration of his past lives 
      for hundreds of thousands of world eons. He saw the pattern of his own 
      karma and the enfoldment of his journey in great detail and in great 
      depth. In the second watch of the night he obtained the knowledge of the 
      rising and falling of beings, seeing beings taking rebirth in various 
      lower and higher realms. This was a generalization of the first knowledge 
      -- of his own special case to universal law. In the final watch of the 
      night, he came to the knowledge of the extinction of the asavas, sometimes 
      called the taints or out-flows.He knew that he had destroyed all the 
      defilements to the depths. This was the moment of attainment. </P>
      <P>This points to the Buddha&#39;s understanding that the mind is 
      intrinsically enlightened -- intrinsically void, blissful, and 
      immeasureably, infinitely radiant -- but obscured. We don&#39;t experience the 
      mind&#39;s radiance all the time because of defilement on the surface of the 
      mind. There are lists and lists of unwholesome mind-states, but they all 
      boil down to ignorance, desire, and ill will. Not knowing, wanting, and 
      repelling. In fact, they all really boil down to ignorance, not knowing. 
      At that point, the Buddha had eliminated all the defilements. That&#39;s 
      essentially all he did for buddhahood to arrive. It was not something 
      created, something new. It was just allowing the deepest truth of his own 
      nature to shine forth through the extinction of the asavas. </P>
      <I>
      <P>Sugato</I> means &quot;well-going.&quot; Su is &quot;well, good,&quot; and gato is the verb 
      &quot;going&quot; or &quot;walking.&quot; This is a very commonly used epithet of the Buddha 
      in the Canon. It is sometimes translated as the well-farer. </P>
      <I>
      <P>Lokavidu. </I>The Knower of the Worlds. This again points to the 
      Buddha&#39;s knowledge and his penetration.Whether or not we take it that he 
      was omniscient, the potential that he unleashed with buddhahood allowed 
      him to know and experience many, many things and have a wide range of what 
      we would call psychic powers, which are really just a natural potential. 
      He could know things like whether someone coming to the discourse that 
      evening that was ripe for enlightenment. If that person was late for some 
      reason, the Buddha would make everybody wait until this one person arrived 
      because the Buddha knew that he or she was just on the brink. </P>
      <I>
      <P>Anuttaro purisadamma-sarathi.</I> Anuttaro means &quot;supreme, without a 
      superior.&quot; Sarathi is a charioteer. Purisadamma is a compound word meaning 
      &quot;human, person.&quot; Damma is not the same as dhamma with a dh. It&#39;s a 
      different word entirely and is used to refer to horses and cattle and so 
      on. The metaphor is of a trainer of horses. The Buddha came out of the 
      noble warrior class, so this sort of imagery occurs fairly commonly. The 
      idea is that his teaching is like a training, and as a charioteer trains 
      horses, so he trains men and women to practice and attain on the path. </P>
      <I>
      <P>Sattha deva-manussanam.</I> Teacher of gods and humans. Sattha is a 
      word meaning &quot;teacher,&quot; and it&#39;s pretty well restricted to references to 
      the Buddha. When you see &quot;The Teacher&quot; in texts, it&#39;s a translation of 
      sattha. That the Buddha was a teacher of gods and humans is very 
      significant praise. There are many, many places in the Canon describing 
      the Buddha teaching in the various heavenly realms. He spent an entire 
      Rains Retreat in Tushita Heaven teaching the Abhidhamma.Whether or not you 
      want to follow the mythology, it&#39;s very evocative. I encourage you not to 
      be too dismissive of these stories, because we don&#39;t know the full range 
      and potential of this universe and what other kind of possible existences 
      there may be. In the Buddhist conception of the universe, the Buddha is 
      the teacher of the gods. This was an important statement for religious 
      understanding at the time, and later. Human beings were not helpless pawns 
      of the gods, and the gods had something to learn from the Buddha. </P>
      <P>The attribute <I>buddho </I>is the same form as buddha. This is a 
      particularly beautiful word; it simply means &quot;awake.&quot; This is what we call 
      the Buddha today. It&#39;s an oddity, though, that in the Canon he is seldom 
      referred to by this epithet. In the Canon he refers to himself as 
      Tathagata, and other people refer to him very often as <I>Bhagava</I>, or 
      Blessed One. If you want a simple form for contemplation of the Buddha, 
      repeat the syllables bud-dho while visualizing the Buddha and thinking of 
      &quot;awake.&quot; One of the times this term does occur in the Canon is shortly 
      after his enlightenment. A wanderer asks him, &quot;Are you a god?&quot; And he 
      replies, &quot;No, I&#39;m not a god.&quot; Then, &quot;Are you a demon? &quot;&quot;No, I&#39;m not a 
      demon.&quot; Then, &quot;Are you a human being?&quot;&quot;No, I&#39;m not a human being.&quot;And 
      finally, &quot;Well, what are you?&quot; And he says, &quot;I am Buddho.&quot; </P>
      <P>The final attribute is<I> bhagava</I>, which means &quot;the Blessed One.&quot; 
      In the Indian languages it is a very common title of respect for holy 
      people. One aspect of this term is that the Buddha was blessed by the 
      previous buddha or, to be more accurate, by a previous buddha many, many 
      buddha&#39;s ago not even on this earth. The Theravadan understanding is that 
      the Bodhisatta vow is only considered binding when it&#39;s made before a 
      fully enlightened buddha. The Buddha made his supreme Bodhisatta vow 
      before Dipamkara Buddha many eons ago, and Dipamkara said, &quot;Yes, indeed, 
      you shall attain.&quot; So, this was the seal, this was the esoteric 
      transmission that goes back beyond the origins of this earth. That&#39;s one 
      meaning of <I>bhagava</I>, but the more mundane level of meaning is simply 
      as a title of respect for a Holy One. </P>
      <P>So, taken together, this entire <I>&quot;Itipi so&quot;</I> passage that we 
      chant, this list of attributes, is a formula of recollecting the Three 
      Jewels. When we recite this chant, we are practicing a form of 
      contemplation of Buddha, contemplation of Dhamma, and contemplation of 
      Sangha.</P>
