        first met Ajahn Sumedho at the Centre for Higher Tibetan Studies in
        Switzerland in the spring of 1979. He had just finished giving a ten-day
        course in the mountains near Berne, and was invited to spend a couple of
        days at the Centre by its Abbot, Geshe Rabten.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One person who attended Bhikkhu
        Sumedho's course liked to be around him because 'he is just such a nice
        guy'. It was heartening for me to see a monk who kept strictly the rules
        of discipline, the Vinaya, yet maintained a softness and naturalness
        behind his observance of them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To illustrate Sumedho's resoluteness
        about the importance of practice and meditation: While we were both
        walking around the hillside near the Centre, overlooking the French and
        Swiss Alps with Lake Geneva below, he asked me whether I had a desire to
        return to India. I answered that I would go if it were for the purpose
        of improving my Tibetan. I could then return to the West and act as an
        interpreter for a Tibetan master or work as a translator of Tibetan
        texts. His only response to that was: 'Why don't you just get
        enlightened?'</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Ajahn Sumedho ('Ajahn' is the Thai
        equivalent of the Pali/Sanskrit <i>Achariya</i>, or 'Master') came to
        the Insight Meditation Society in May of 1981, he conducted an eight-day
        work retreat. As the following interview will show, there is nothing
        special that is cultivated in the meditation; there is no particular
        technique that is taught. One's only responsibility is to remain mindful
        in all activities throughout the day. Live simply, be natural and watch
        the mind are the keys to his practice.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the retreat the students
        performed various tasks around the Centre for two hours every afternoon.
        Some painted, some cleaned the building, others worked in the garden. We
        chanted prayers every morning and evening, and I was rather surprised to
        see how the twenty-five participants (most of whom were new to
        meditation) so quickly and easily adapted to the bowing and ceremony
        that the two monks, Sumedho, and the young English monk, Sucitto, who
        accompanied him, asked them to perform.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ajahn Sumedho inspired the retreatants
        with his three daily impromptu talks, and casually spent his lunch hour
        and the one and one-half hour tea break willingly answering their
        questions about Dhamma practice and entertaining them with stories about
        monastic life in Thailand.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What was most encouraging for me was to
        see that there are monks who have the determination and the motivation
        to maintain the purity of a tradition. Many of the questions that I
        raised in my paper concerning the shortcomings of conformity and blind
        obedience to spiritual organizations and teachers were skilfully and
        wisely dealt with by Ajahn Sumedho. I appreciated his humour and
        patience with my persistent questions concerning organised religion. His
        views on the values of tradition and monastic life enabled me to see
        this matter from a different perspective.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The following is the major part of our
        three interviews.</font></p>
        <hr width="25%" noshade color="#000000" align="center">
        <p align="center"><strong><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman" size="5">1.</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: What attracted you to Buddhism?
        What did you feel it had to offer?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> The path of liberation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Had you tried other paths or
        methods as well?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> At one time I was quite a
        devout Christian, yet I later became disillusioned with Christianity,
        mainly because I did not understand the teachings and was not able to
        find anyone who could help me to comprehend them. There did not seem to
        be any way to practise Christianity, other than just believing or
        blindly accepting what was said.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What impressed me about Buddhism was
        that it did not ask one merely to believe. It was a way where one was
        free to doubt. It offered a practical way of finding out the truth
        through one's own experience, rather than through accepting the
        teachings of other people. I realised that was the way I had to do it,
        because it is my nature to doubt and question, rather than to believe.
        Therefore, religions that asked one to accept on faith were simply out.
        I could not even begin to get near them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When I discovered Buddhism, it was like
        a revelation for me, since I saw that one's religious inclinations could
        be fulfilled in this way. Previously, I felt a sense of sorrow in the
        fact that I knew the material world was not satisfactory for me and yet
        the religion I had been brought up in offered no alternative way of
        practice other than just blind faith. Buddhism was quite a joyous
        discovery.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">[Ajahn Sumedho mentioned being inspired
        by D.T. Suzuki's books, and having encountered Buddhism in Japan while
        in the navy during the Korean war.]</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Upon completion of your naval
        service, did you remain in California or did you return to Asia?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> After I left the navy, I went
        back to the University of Washington to finish my bachelor's degree in
        Far Eastern Studies. I then went to the University of California at
        Berkeley for an M.A. in Asian Studies. When I completed that in 1963, I
        went into the Peace Corps.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: What attracted you to Thailand
        more than to Japan, for example, where Suzuki's teachings originated?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Well, I was in that part of
        the world. Also, I remembered the cold winters of Japan. Since Thailand
        had such a nice, sunny climate, I felt I might as well see what it had
        to offer, because I dreaded having to live through those cold winters.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Did you immediately go to Ajahn
        Chah's monastery?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> No, I went first to Bangkok
        where I practised meditation as a layman. During the mornings I taught
        English at Thammasat University and in the afternoons I went off to
        practise meditation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I later decided to ordain, but I did not
        want to live in Bangkok because I did not find it very suitable for me.
        While I was on vacation in Laos, I met a Canadian monk who recommended
        that I ordain in a Thai town across the Mekong River. So, I followed his
        advice and ordained at a temple in Nong Kai. That year I mainly
        practised on my own, without a teacher. The following year I met a
        disciple of Ajahn Chah, a Thai monk who spoke English. He then took me
        to meet Ajahn Chah.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: And you remained at Ajahn Chah's
        monastery for ten years?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Yes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: You mentioned that it was the
        doubting aspect of Buddhism that attracted you to it. One was able to
        doubt. It very often happens that people are attracted to the Tibetan
        tradition because of the personality or wisdom of the teacher. Does the
        teacher have such a significant role in the Theravada tradition?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> No. They try to de-emphasize
        that; yet people are often attracted to teachers, which is very natural.
        However, the discipline itself is arranged so that one is not to adore a
        teacher. One keeps within the discipline by respectful attitudes and
        compassionate actions towards any teacher or anyone. I was not really
        looking for a teacher. I did not have the feeling that I needed a
        particular kind of teacher. Yet I had confidence in the Buddha's
        teaching. When I met Ajahn Chah, my confidence in him grew when I
        realised what a wise man he was. At first I liked him but I did not feel
        any great devotion. But I stayed there and I really do not know why
        because there were many things I did not like about the place. Yet, I
        just seemed to stay there... for ten years!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RS: How would Ajahn Chah instruct the
        disciples under him?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Ajahn Chah set up a monastery
        which provided the opportunity for people to ordain and practise
        Buddhist meditation. So mainly what he offers is a place, a conducive
        environment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The teaching itself is just the
        traditional Buddhist teaching of the Four Noble Truths. He adheres to
        the Vinaya discipline. Part of the agreement to live there is that the
        monks adapt their behaviour to the traditional discipline. I felt that
        was what I needed very much. It was an opportunity to live under a
        convention of that kind. My background was very permissive and
        freewheeling and I realised that was a great weakness in my nature. I
        resented authority and did not know how to conform to discipline in any
        way. So I was quite glad to have the opportunity to do that. It was a
        good challenge for me and I knew that was what I needed to do. Much
        conceit still existed in me, wanting to live on my own terms. Ajahn Chah
        was very strict. We had to live on the terms established by the
        monastery. I learned to do that there.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ajahn Chah does not stress method. He
        stresses just being aware during the day and night, being mindful and
        watching the impermanence of conditions as one experiences life.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the first year while I was in
        Bangkok, I meditated alone. Since I understood the meditation technique,
        when I went to Wat Pah Pong [the name of the monastery], Ajahn Chah just
        encouraged me to keep doing what I had learned in Bangkok. He did not
        demand that I adapt my behaviour to any particular form or technique
        other than the Vinaya discipline of the monks.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: I would like to read to you
        something from Krishnamurti concerning tradition. He says: 'To carry the
        past over to the present, to translate the movement of the present in
        terms of the past destroys the living beauty of the present. There is
        nothing sacred about tradition, however ancient or modern. The brain
        carries the memories of yesterday, which is tradition and is frightened
        to let go because it cannot face something new. Tradition becomes our
        security and when the mind is secure it is in decay. One must take the
        journey unburdened, sweetly, without any effort, never stopping at any
        shrine, at any monument, or for any hero, social or religious, alone
        with beauty and love.'</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Now, Sucitto's and your presence here
        has been an obvious display of the carrying on of a tradition that has
        been going on for over 2500 years. Concerning this quotation, I wonder
        if one could get too caught up in form, missing the intended purpose?
        Or, another way of stating it, how does one avoid getting caught up in
        form?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Well, it is like driving a
        car. One could dismiss the convention of a car and say, 'I am not going
        to depend on that because it is from the past. So I'll just walk on my
        own to New York City.' Or, 'I'll invent my own car, because I don't want
        to copy someone else and take something that is from the past and bring
        it into the present.' I could do that, and maybe I would succeed. I
        don't know.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The point is not so much in the vehicle
        that is used, but in getting to New York City. Whether one goes slow or
        fast, one should take what is available, whatever vehicle one finds
        around oneself. If there isn't any, invent one, or just walk. One must
        do the best one can. But if there is one already around, why not learn
        to use it? -- especially if it is still operable.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, tradition is like that. It is not...
        clinging. One can also cling to the idea that one does not need
        tradition, which is just another opinion or view. Quotations like that
        are tremendously inspiring, but they are not always very practical
        because one forms another opinion that traditions are wrong or harmful.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The problem, you see (I am sure
        Krishnamurti must realise this) does not lie in the tradition, but in
        the clinging. This body is a conventional form that came from the past.
        The language that we use, the world we live in, and the societies we are
        a part of are all conventional forms that were born in the past. So, one
        could say that one does not want anything to do with them. In that case
        one should stop talking completely. Krishnamurti should stop having
        books published.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: He asks his listeners, 'I don't
        know why you buy these books.'</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> We live in a conventional
        world. It is not a matter of depending on conventions, but learning how
        to use them skilfully. We can use language for gossip, lying, and
        becoming obsessed speakers; we can become perfectionists, fuss-budgets
        with language. The important thing to understand is that language is
        communication. When I communicate something to you, I try to speak as
        directly and clearly as possible. It is a skill. But if my tongue were
        cut out, I would just learn to live without speaking -- that's all. That
        would not be any great sorrow, but a bit of an inconvenience -- for some
        things; it might be convenient for many other things.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Religious traditions are just
        conventions that can be used or not, according to time and place. If one
        knows how to use it through the tradition, one is much better off than
        another who does not know, who thinks that they are all just a waste of
        time. One can go to a Christian church, a Theravada monastery or a
        Synagogue, and respect, get a feeling for the convention that one finds
        oneself with, without feeling that it is bad or wrong. It is not up to
        us to decide about that. They are all based on doing good, refraining
        from doing evil. Therefore, if one clings to them, then one is bound to
        them. If one regards religion as just a convention, then one can learn
        how to use it properly. It is the raft that takes one across.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: You mentioned that traditions can
        be used according to the time and place. I noticed that you and Sucitto
        go on 'alms round' in Barre in the morning. On the one hand, I find this
        quite admirable. On the other hand, I wonder what kind of effect this
        has on a society that is not Buddhist. To the average householder, a
        person wearing orange or red robes could be anything from a Hare Krishna
        devottee to -- whatever.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Is following the tradition, at this
        time and in this place, doing more harm than good? Could it be offensive
        to these people? Would it have been offensive for me to go and listen to
        Krishnamurti in Saanen wearing my robes (which, in that context, I chose
        not to do)?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Well, the intention is good,
        the time is now, and the place is here. Some people will be upset; some
        will find it very nice. In England it upsets some people, but sometimes
        people need to be upset. They need to be shaken a bit, because people
        are very complacent in these countries.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Going on alms round also attracts good
        people, who seem to like it. Since our intention is not to shock or
        harm, how my appearance affects others is their problem. I am modestly
        covered and am not out to lure them into any kind of relationship or
        harm them in any way. On the contrary; it gives them the opportunity to
        offer <i>dana</i> (charity) if they are so inclined.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In England, admittedly, most people do
        not understand it. Yet it seems to me that making the alms round is one
        of the religious conventions that is worth maintaining, because the
        people in countries like this have forgotten how to give. It is like
        putting juice back in the religious body again. It is getting monks
        moving within the society.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha was a prince [before he
        was enlightened], he left the palace and saw four messengers who changed
        his life. The first one was an old man, the second was a sick person,
        the third was a corpse and the fourth was a monk meditating under a
        tree. I look at this as a message. I do not carry it around as a duty I
        have to perform, but just part of my life, the way I live my life. If
        people object and find it very wrong, if it is causing people all kinds
        of problems, then I will not do it. That has not happened yet.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">People thought that I should not go on
        alms round in the village. They thought it was stupid. Some English
        people, as well as Buddhists, felt that we should adapt to the English
        customs. However, I decided to take it as it came. Rather than deciding
        whether or not I should adapt to the English customs, I simply brought
        the tradition and played it by ear. I felt it would take its own form,
        accordingly. If one trims the tradition down before even planting the
        seed, one often severs or slightens its whole spirit. The entire
        tradition is based on charity, kindness, goodness, morality... and I am
        not doing anything wrong. I may be doing things that people do not
        understand...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: In my own mind, and I imagine in
        the minds of others as well, the alms round might seem to be a type of
        clinging to form, to tradition.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Then one is not being
        mindful. It would just be clinging to a method. Yet it is still better
        than what most people cling to, isn't it?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: I am not sure. Is it possible to
        place a value judgment on clinging? However how does one keep the mind
        awake, day and night? While performing certain rituals, chanting or on
        alms round, how can one avoid the repetitive, mechanical routineness of
        our daily existence?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Daily existence is mechanical
        and routine. The body is mechanical and routine. Society is that way.
        All compounded things just keep doing the same thing over and over. But
        our minds do not have to be deluded by those habits anymore.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Krishnamurti says that 'religious
        people, those who live in a monastery, in isolation, or go off to a
        mountain or a desert, are forcing their minds to conform to an
        established pattern.' You said earlier that at Ajahn Chah's monastery,
        you were conforming to an authority because you felt that previously...</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> One is conforming one's
        bodily action to a pattern. That is all.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Yes, Krishnamurti says: 'forcing
        the minds to a pattern.' Minds do conform to an established pattern, not
        just the body. They are dependent.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Right. That is <i>samatha</i>
        [tranquility, concentration] practice: believing in doctrines and
        absorbing into conditions. But that is not the purpose of Buddhist
        meditation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Samatha practice is conforming to
        doctrines?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> If one believes in doctrines,
        the thoughts in one's mind to accept certain doctrinal teachings, and
        reject those which do not fit. Then there is also the <i>samatha</i>
        practice of tranquility, where one trains the mind to concentrate on an
        object This practice calms and steadies the mind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: And you are calling that 'an
        established pattern'?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Yes. The normal rhythm of
        one's breath is an established pattern that you cling and are attached
        to, isn't it? It gives some tranquility to the mind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: One does not 'cling' to the
        breath. Breathing happens naturally. One might say that one observes the
        breath...</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> One focuses solely on the
        breath. At one particular moment one is concentrating and not noticing
        any other object.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: I do not quite follow. What does
        that have to do with the mind habitually following dogma?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Whatever is a pattern or a
        condition [<i>sankhara</i>], if one believes in that <i>sankhara</i>,
        one becomes that. If one attaches to any object, then one becomes that
        object. So, when one is concentrating on the normal breath, then one
        becomes that normal breath. Mentally, one's form takes that, one becomes
        one with that object for as long as the concentration lasts.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same holds with doctrines. They are
        the worlds of forms, conventions and habits. One can be likened to a
        (doctrinal) belief in the thoughts of others, in teachings and creeds,
        in what other people say, in Krishnamurti (which is the problem with his
        disciples).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness is not clinging. What
        Krishnamurti is pointing to is the awareness of the changing nature, the
        way things really are in the moment. But he seems to delude people by
        the fact that he started [teaching] from a very high place. Most people,
        even if they think about what he is teaching, cannot understand it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is something one knows through
        letting go -- even of believing in Krishnamurti, or of trying to figure
        out what he is talking about. One has to come down to a very low level
        of humility, what Ajahn Chah calls an earthworm, just being very simple
        and not expecting any results. Doing good and refraining from doing evil
        with body, speech and mind, and being mindful.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Why do religions degenerate?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Because they are only
        conventional truth. They are not ultimate truth.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: But people do not practise. They
        practise mechanically. When a teacher conducts a course here, the
        question often arises, 'Buddhism is known as a peaceful religion, and it
        is said that a war has never begun in the cause of Buddhism.' But look
        at Tibet and Cambodia. People were massacred. In Laos the monks are
        working in the field. One visiting Cambodian monk said that, basically,
        people do not practise, and that is why it falls apart, why there is so
        much trouble.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Well, why is the world as it
        is? Why did they annihilate two million Cambodians? One can speculate.
        But the only thing that one can know is that the conditions of one's
        mind -- greed, hatred and delusion -- are the reflection of the world,
        the way it is. The world has murders, death, atrocities and destruction
        because we do it all the time in our minds, too.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What did you do before you ordained, or
        even while you are ordained? You try to annihilate a lot of things out
        of your mind, don't you? If you have anger, jealousy, nasty thoughts,
        you annihilate them, because you think that is the way to solve the
        problem. One annihilates that which one thinks is the cause of one's
        suffering.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now apply that to a country like
        Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge government believed that the middle class
        bourgeoisie was the cause of all suffering so the government annihilated
        it. It works on the same principle.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist teachings are non-violent. One
        does not annihilate the pests, but understands that even the pests of
        the mind are impermanent and non-self. They will disappear on their own.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many things that we are frightened of
        are really our best friends -- like fear itself. We are afraid of the
        unknown, but the unknown is the way to enlightenment. Not-knowing is
        what brings terror into people's lives. Many people spend much of their
        life just trying to find security in some form or another, because of
        fear. Fear drives them to become this, or get hold of that, to save up a
        lot of money, to seek pleasure or a safe place to live, or to find some
        ideal person they hope will make them happy forever. That is fear of
        being alone, fear of the unknown -- of that we cannot know. In
        meditation, when one is mindful, that very fear -- seeing it as it
        really is -- leads us into the deathless, the silence. Yet fear is
        something that we react to very strongly.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, if one cannot be at peace with the
        pest of one's mind, one cannot very well expect a stupid government like
        the Khmer Rouge, or most elements of the world, to be any better. We
        have no right to point the blame at such things as big as society. To
        find fault with America -- that is easy to do -- or with Cambodia or
        Tibet... because the monks did not practise hard enough or the Cambodian
        people were not good Buddhists... that is a bit silly, actually.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What are you doing about it? That is
        what I am saying. I cannot help Mr.Pol Pot's screwed-up version of the
        world. How he intended to solve the problem was idiocy. But I have seen
        that very same idiocy in myself: the desire to wipe out that which I do
        not like or that which I think is the cause of the world's or my own
        suffering. That is where one can see what the problem arises from. One
        can say, 'Oh, the monks weren't good enough', but that is not fair,
        really.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">[The next question was not recorded].</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> I have had a very fortunate
        experience with a Buddhist monk, Ajahn Chah, and I see what a very
        happy, tolerant and harmonious being he is. Of course, many of his
        disciples do not understand what he is teaching, either. Yet he
        certainly makes it all very clear and offers them every occasion to
        practise and find out.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When one talks about <i>dukkha</i>
        [suffering], the first noble truth, one is not talking abstractly about <i>dukkha</i>
        out there, that exists as some sort of nameless thing. I am talking
        about that very feeling in one, in here [points to himself], that does
        not feel quite happy or feels a bit upset, worried, discontented,
        insecure, or ill-at-ease. One experiences the first noble truth within
        oneself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One is not pointing to <i>dukkha</i> as
        some sort of vague thing that hovers over the world. If one really looks
        at one's mind, one finds discontentment, restlessness, fear and worry.
        That is something one can see oneself. One does not have to believe. It
        would be idiocy to say 'I believe in the first noble truth', or, 'I
        don't believe in the first noble truth. I believe that everything is
        wonderful.' It is not a matter of believing or disbelieving, but rather
        one looks inside and asks oneself, 'Do I always feel wonderful and
        happy? Is life just a constant source of joy and gaiety? Or do I
        sometimes feel depression, doubt, fear, etc?'</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just speaking from my own experience, I
        could very much see the first noble truth. It was not that I wanted a
        more depressing ideology to accept. I recognised that there was fear,
        uncertainty and uneasiness in myself. Yet the first noble truth is not a
        doctrine. It is not saying 'life is suffering', but rather it is just
        saying, 'there is this'. It comes and goes. It arises (the second noble
        truth), it ceases (the third noble truth), and from that understanding
        comes the eight-fold path (the fourth noble truth), which is the clear
        vision into the transcendence of it all -- through mindfulness. The
        eight-fold path is just being mindful in daily life.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Yet mindfulness itself is not a
        wholesome factor.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Neutral. It does not belong
        to anybody. It is not something one is lacking; it is not a personal
        possession.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: There are wholesome and
        unwholesome mental factors, and there are factors which are always
        present, like mindfulness. Mindfulness is not innately good.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> It is awareness of good and
        evil as change. By using the wisdom factor of discriminating alertness (<i>satipanna</i>),
        one sees the conditions of good and evil as impermanent and not-self.
        This mindfulness liberates one from the delusion that these conditions
        tend to give.</font></p>

        <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;RW: I would like to return for
        a moment to the role of tradition. Do you feel that adherence to a
        particular tradition would naturally tend to separate one from another
        tradition that has a certain set of values?</font></i></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Well, on the level of
        convention, everything is separate anyway. You are separate from me as a
        person, as a body. That can only be solved when we merge by developing
        wisdom. With conventional form there is only separation. There will
        always be men and women and innumerable religious conventions. These are
        all on the level of sense perception, which is always discriminative and
        separative. It cannot be otherwise. Yet if one is mindful, those very
        conventions take one to the deathless, where we merge. There is no 'you'
        or 'me' there.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: 'Deathless' -- how do you use
        that term?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> It just means that which is
        never born and never dies. There is nothing more one can say, really,
        because words are birth and death.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Could one say that the deathless
        is synonymous with the end of clinging and grasping?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Non-attachment to mortal
        conditions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: I find it more the case than the
        exception that when belonging to a group, there is a tendency to feel
        secure, and to condemn, belittle or speak condescendingly to those who
        do not share one's own religious beliefs or philosophical dogma. I was
        quite concerned about these matters when I left the Centre in
        Switzerland... How does one overcome this feeling of separation, form
        versus the essence? How can one be free from getting enmeshed in form,
        whether it be in a study or meditative environment?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Well, just be enlightened. It
        would solve all your problems.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Thanks a lot.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> One has to make the best of
        all these things. Even here [at the Insight Meditation Society] the
        meditation is kind of spoon-fed. It is like sitting in a high chair and
        having your mommy come and dish it to you on a little plate. It is
        idealistic. For meditators there is hardly any friction; everything is
        secure and provided.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In places like Tharpa Choeling [the
        Tibetan Centre in Switzerland] there is more friction, much more to
        forgive, much more confusion to the mind. Chithurst is a good example of
        being neither the best nor the worst place. It is adequate. Some people
        will make use of it, some will not. I do not want it to be too perfect
        or ideal, because people need friction. Otherwise they become complacent
        and dull. One has to give people space to work through their biases and
        hang-ups.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In my own life I saw how I became
        attached to the teacher, the tradition and the rules. If one is serious
        and watching <i>dukkha</i>, then one begins to see that and let it go.
        That does not mean one has to throw away the tradition; it just means
        that one can be at ease with it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I enjoy monasticism. I like being a
        monk. I think it is a very lovely way to live as a human being. But if
        it does not work anymore, when the time comes to end it -- it will end.
        That is it. It does not matter that much.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yet there is no need to throw away the
        ordination either. I have grown because of it. I have not as yet seen a
        better way to live one's life. So I stay with this one until it is time
        to change. When the time for change comes, it will have to come on its
        own. It is not up to me to decide, 'Well, I'm fed up with this. I'm
        going to try something else.'</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One can see the whole tenor of the life
        of a monk is very good. It is harmless, it is honourable; it is useful
        in society too. I know how to use it. I can teach through this
        tradition. I can teach people how to use the tradition, which I think is
        a good thing to know how to use. One can learn how to use conventions
        instead of just rejecting them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If I give you a knife, you can use it
        for good or bad. It is not the knife's problem, is it? If you use it to
        murder me, would you say, 'The knife is bad'? The knife might be a very
        good knife, a well-made and useful tool. The same with the Theravada or
        Tibetan tradition; it is learning how to use them skilfully -- and that
        is up to you!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One has to recognise that Asian teachers
        come from a society (Tibet, for example) where everything is more or
        less taken for granted. They have been raised in a society that thinks
        and lives Buddhism. Whether they are devout or not does not make any
        difference. Nevertheless, it affects their whole outlook on themselves
        and the world. Whereas you come from a country which is materialistic,
        and where the values -- based on greed and competition, and trust and
        faith in conceptual learning -- have affected your mind. Our faith in
        America is in books, isn't it? In universities. In science. In
        conceptual learning. In being reasonable.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Do you find that type of learning
        to be invalid? Or can that also be used properly?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> No. Right. It is learning how
        to use things like that correctly, with wisdom. Nothing in the universe
        is a waste. It is all perfect. There is nothing in it that needs to be
        rejected or added. There is nothing wrong, really.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One is looking for perfection, yet it is
        in the imperfect where most people go wrong. If one is looking for
        perfection in a Buddhist teacher or in a Buddhist tradition, one will be
        greatly disillusioned by it. If one looks for perfection in Krishnamurti
        or in anyone, or in the perfection of one's own body and the conditions
        of one's mind... it is not possible! One cannot force the mind to think
        only good thoughts, or to be always compassionate and kind, without
        giving rise to even an impulse of aversion or anger.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mind is like a mirror -- it
        reflects. So the wise man knows the reflections as reflections, and not
        as self. Reflections do not harm the mirror at all. The mirror can
        reflect the filthiest conditions and not be dirtied by it. And the
        reflections change. They are not permanent.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Filth and dirt also play an important
        part. Hatred and all the nasty things in one's mind are like manure.
        Manure stinks. It is not nice and one is not happy to be around it. Yet
        it does give a lot of good nourishment to the roots of the plants so
        that they will have beautiful flowers. If one is able to look at the
        manure and see it for what it is, rather than saying, 'Ugh, get it out
        of there! I don't want anything to do with it', then one can appreciate
        its value.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even hatred is Dhamma teaching us that
        it is impermanent and not-self. Everything takes us into the ultimate
        truth, through seeing that whatever arises passes away. So even the
        dirtiest thought in one's mind is just that; it is merely that condition
        changing. If one does not resist or indulge, it arises up from the void
        and goes back into the void. It is perfect. There is nothing that is
        wrong and that is why there is nothing to fear.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one starts trying to think of ways to
        change the world so that it will be perfect, one will become very bitter
        and disappointed. People get very upset when I say that, because they
        think that I am just not going to do anything. What needs to be done, I
        am doing. What does not need to be done, I leave undone.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just this condition: One does good and
        refrains from doing evil. That is all I can be responsible for. I cannot
        make the world (my concept of world) anything other than it is. That
        concept of world will change as we arouse wisdom within ourselves. We
        will then be able to look at the world as it is, rather than believe in
        the world as we think it is.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The truth is not Buddhist. It is not
        that Buddhists have any special insight into the truth. It is just that
        it is a way that works.</font></p>

        culture and language. In that situation one has to give up practically
        everything that one is accustomed to in one's own life.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: How did you deal with that?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> I just did it, actually. I do
        not quite know how to say how I dealt with it. If one wanted to stay and
        learn from that place, one just did what one had to do. I managed to
        change my ways to adapt to their ways.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Thai monks were always very kind. It
        was not a place where people made things difficult for one. There was
        always generosity and kindness. It was just getting used to doing things
        in different ways, eating strange food and speaking a different
        language.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Sometimes, when people from two
        different cultures meet, a kind of cultural arrogance may arise from one
        side or the other, or both. Did you encounter this?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Well, yes. The Thai people
        have feelings like anyone else about their culture and society. However,
        we all shared in common living in a monastery, where the emphasis is not
        on cultural inheritance but rather on the Buddha's teaching. So the
        cultural differences did not seem to be of any great significance to
        anyone.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I was much more sophisticated than they
        were. I had travelled a great deal and had lived in different places and
        knew much more about the world in general. Their superiority to me was
        in their ability to live so well and to coordinate in the only tradition
        that they knew. Oftentimes I felt very clumsy and foolish, like a very
        oafish person, because I did not tend to have the physical coordination
        or agility in bodily action that they had.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: We were talking the other day
        about traditions and routines, and how a complacent attitude may arise
        towards one's practice. There is often the tendency for a young monk to
        be very strict about his vows and to keep a strict discipline. Later one
        finds one is not really digging in or doing the practice seriously. One
        tends to become mechanical in one's actions and maybe that will to
        discover the truth becomes stifled by the weight of the organisation or
        the tradition. Did you find that kind of degeneration at Wat Pah Pong?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Well, I did not find it for
        myself, because I had plenty of motivation on my own -- and I did not
        let any tradition stop me. Yet I could see that some monks were not very
        motivated. They were in it just because it is their tradition.
        Therefore, they tend to sink into habitual living as a monk.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ajahn Chah is quite an expert at pushing
        people out of ruts. Yet he cannot keep doing that all the time. One
        cannot expect him to play nursemaid to all the monks. I think he did
        that very much at first. I noticed that he now takes it all much easier
        and leaves it pretty much up to the monk to develop. That is the way it
        should be. This is a very mature practice. The teacher should not be
        constantly called up to prod and arouse the students. We should do that
        ourselves. Yet there are Thai and Western monks who just seem to sink
        into habits. They would do that anywhere they were. They do not have
        that 'urgency' in their lives.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: I think you are poking fun at
        me... Krishnamurti says, 'The guru's role is to point out. Finished.
        Then let the person learn. If he inquires, he will find out. But if you
        tell him everything, then you are treating him just like a child. There
        is no meaning to it.'</i></font></p>

        <p><i><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;RW: In your position as abbot,
        how would you instruct your monks to prevent the possibility of taking
        things for granted, especially receiving charity from lay supporters?
        How do you advise them to guard against things becoming routine, matter
        of fact, secure; the feeling that it is just a nice, comfortable life?</font></i></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Well, it is not exactly a
        comfortable life. In England the problem does not lie in sinking into a
        routine, because there is no tradition there to sink into. It is new and
        fresh. So, it is not a case that one can really sink into anything.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In England there is not the security
        that there is in a Buddhist country. Life as a monk in Britain is risky,
        a chance; it is not guaranteed. One then needs to be much more alert,
        whereas in Thailand one can take it all for granted because it is so
        established and secure there.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">All one can do is to encourage and keep
        reminding people -- because they forget. But how they develop is really
        up to them. As they say, 'you can take a horse to water...' And that is
        all one can do.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Yet for some people there might
        be a gap between their own tendencies and inclinations, and the ideology
        that they are following. How can that gap be bridged?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> That is why one has to allow
        people space. That is the real value of the monastic life. One has to
        allow people time and the opportunity to develop, rather than to expect
        them to make great changes all at once. Some people understand
        immediately; for others it will take years. That does not mean that one
        will teach only the ones who understand immediately -- they do not need
        to be taught very much!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One can also provide in the monastery a
        place for people to live at least a good life in a wholesome way.
        Eventually something will filter down to them. At least it is good
        kammically. One is not doing any harmful actions. That kind of
        environment encourages one to do good and refrain from doing evil. It is
        a moral environment. The emphasis is on paying attention, being alert,
        and watching; confronting one's life as one experiences it, looking at
        it, and learning from it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">How determined and resolute one is in
        that practice is an individual matter. Some are very quick, others are
        very slow; some are neither quick nor slow. In the monastery one can
        allow for the fast and slow. It is not that one is selecting only the
        best, the quick ones. The advantage of having a monastic community is to
        have the opportunity for many beings to develop. Some may not ever be
        enlightened but at least they can develop harmlessness in their lives.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Thai monasteries, sometimes very
        'heavy' people ordain, criminals and the like. Monastic life is a refuge
        for them where they are all the time encouraged to do good. Whether they
        attain enlightenment or not, who knows? At least it is a more skilful
        way of dealing with these types of people (who have enough faith that
        they would ordain) than to lock them up. Some monks tell of their past,
        which can be quite shocking. When one asks them why they ordained, they
        answer: 'I have faith in the Buddha's teaching and it is the only way
        that I can break from my old ways and habits.' In worldly life they tend
        to get pulled back into their old patterns.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: You would not think, then, that a
        community of monks would be like a crutch or a bondage, preventing a
        person from growing?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> No. Anything can be a crutch
        or a bondage. It all depends on whether one uses it or leans on it.
        People think that having crutches is bad. Crutches themselves are not
        bad. Sometimes we need them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Imagine saying to a new-born baby, 'You
        have two legs. Get up and walk! I'm not going to pick you up, feed you
        or do anything for you. You're now in the world. You have to learn to
        take care of yourself!' The baby is just not ready yet. Understanding
        the situation, one feeds it and takes care of it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As soon as the baby starts crawling, one
        would not say, 'If you depend on crawling, you are going to crawl the
        rest of your life and never get anywhere. Get up and walk!' But the baby
        cannot. He is not ready. He is not strong enough.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">By crawling and waving his arms and
        legs, pulling himself up on the chair, and mommy taking his hand, etc.,
        he is developing strength and growing until it is time to take his first
        step. When he starts to walk on his own, he does not want to use
        crutches anymore, naturally. When children learn to walk independently
        they throw away their crutches. They do not want to hold mother's hand
        anymore.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the spiritual path, too, sometimes
        crutches and refuges are deliberately provided for strengthening. When
        one is strong enough, one starts walking independently.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: You gave the analogy of a baby
        crawling, developing slowly, gradually. A person who is within the
        system, just conforming to the pattern of it without really digging in
        -- how can that system or organisation help to shake him out of the rut
        he is in... Well, I am just talking about myself, you know... Sometimes
        I feel it is necessary to make a break for the sole purpose of shaking
        up what can be a complacent life-style.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Life itself is ever-changing.
        It is not that structures and conditions themselves change. Some monks
        have to disrobe and leave. Some, after years, find nothing in it for
        themselves and seek something else to do. All that one can ask them to
        do is to try to be as honest as possible about their intentions. Each
        individual has to work out his own life...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If someone feels one has had enough of
        monastic life and wants to do it another way, that is quite alright; it
        is one's choice. But one should be honest about one's intentions rather
        than just using an excuse. That is important. The only thing that is not
        nice to hear is when someone leaves [the monastic order] but is not
        honest about why one is leaving. One may justify one's leaving by
        putting down the tradition. Yet sometimes people leave for justifiable
        serious doubts.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: As Abbot of Chithurst, how do you
        advise your monks to view ceremonies and rituals that might seem rather
        remote to the actual practice?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> I personally like rituals.
        They are quite pleasant to do; they are calming. One does them with a
        group of people. It is doing something that is pleasant, together and in
        unison. The intention is always good: to radiate kindness and to chant
        the teachings of the Buddha in Pali. It tends to uplift and inspire the
        minds of many people. That is its only function as far as I can tell.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I think ceremony makes life much more
        beautiful. I have seen Dhamma communities which do not have ceremonies.
        They are a bit gross, actually.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Gross?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Gross. People just do not
        have a sense of etiquette, a kind of refinement, a lovely movement, a
        sense of time and place that one has when one understands the value of
        precepts and ceremonies. They have their beauty.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhu form is a kind of dance one
        does. One learns to move. It has its own beautiful form, which is a way
        of training the physical form in beautiful movement, the mental and the
        physical combined. However, it is not an end in itself. It can become
        silly if it is an end in itself. And it is not necessary, either. If it
        does not fit or if people do not want it, then one just does not use it.
        It is something one can use or not use according to time and place.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one has never used ceremony or does
        not understand its purpose, then when one is faced with a ceremony, one
        might reject it, thinking, 'I don't like it', or 'ceremonies are wrong'.
        But they aren't! There is nothing wrong with ceremonies, they are quite
        alright to have. To feel one should not have ceremonies is just as much
        an opinion as to feel one should. It is not a matter of having to say
        one should or should not have them. They are a part of our tradition, so
        we use them if they are appropriate. If they are not appropriate, we do
        not use them. It is a matter of knowing, rather than of having opinions
        about it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: How do you view your role as
        abbot? How do you see yourself as a figure of authority at Chithurst?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Well, I really do not think
        about it. I act very much like the abbot. It is my nature to appreciate
        dignity and hierarchical structures. I do not find those unbearable.
        Actually, I find [the role of abbot] great fun. It is a pleasant
        position to be in. It has its disadvantage in the sense that one gets
        everything thrown at oneself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yet I quite like serving others, too. I
        like to go back and be number ten in the line. In Thailand it was very
        nice to be nobody, without always having to be up in front of everybody.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, our training is to adapt, not
        to choose. It was not easy to be an abbot at first. It was difficult for
        me to accept that position because many feelings of inadequacy and
        self-doubt arose. So I penetrated it. I worked with these feelings,
        making them my meditation to the point where my position became easy for
        me. I adapted to the position rather than believing the thoughts, 'Oh,
        I'm not ready for this', or 'I don't want to do this'. Becoming attached
        to the role of abbot would also be an easy thing to do; that is, taking
        oneself to be someone important.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one is mindful, one is checking and
        watching; these things are just the changing conditions of <i>samsara</i>.
        Sometimes one is the abbot, sometimes the servant -- everything is
        changing. If one has no preferences, then one has no suffering when
        conditions change. But if one is determined not to be an abbot or to
        take a position of responsibility, then when conditions arise where one
        is supposed to do that, one suffers.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, if one wants to be
        someone important, but is only number ten in the line, one also suffers,
        because of feeling resentful and jealous of those who are above oneself.
        So one also has to watch for that.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The point of Buddha's teaching is to
        have that awareness of suffering. Everyone suffers, so we all have to
        watch this. It is not to choose any position in the line as 'mine'. One
        has to be able to move up or down or stay, depending on time and place.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: How did you meditate on this
        'inadequacy' that you felt? How did you confront that?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> I just watched. I just
        brought up and listened to the complaining, whining conditions of my
        mind that kept nagging, 'I'm not ready' ...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Again, during this morning's
        meditation anger and resentment were arising. This time I just let it
        come, watched it, looked at it... arising and passing... without
        identifying with it, without getting caught up in it. And it went (and
        will surely come back again!) Is that all the practice is: a continuous,
        steady, constant watching of the arising and passing away of phenomena?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS: </i>It is just awareness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: And these hindrances will just
        peter out, dissolve after some time?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Right. If one is not acting
        on it, the habit will just fade away.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: But even though one is not acting
        on it, because the propensity or tendency is present for a particular
        mental disturbance to arise, is there not action being created from
        that?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> One cannot help the
        conditions that are present which make that delusion arise in one's
        mind. One of two actions may follow: either one reacts by getting caught
        up in the action or one represses it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one tends to repress the unpleasant,
        listen to the guilt or self-hatred. Bring up the mood, 'Oh, I'm
        hopeless, stupid, I can't do anything right, I'm wasting my life...'
        Just listen to it! Keep bringing it up and listening to it. One sees it
        by skilfully bringing it up and looking at it. And it goes away.
        Otherwise one tends just to repress it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Even though the delusion or
        emotion is not arising at the time, because one knows that it is a
        predominant condition that causes one continuous agitation, does
        'bringing it up' simply mean letting it arise?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> I would even go seek it.
        About seven or eight years ago I had a problem of jealousy. I hated the
        jealousy. I had the insight that jealousy was a problem so I tended to
        try to annihilate it. When that condition would arise I would think, 'Oh
        God, here it is. I've got to try to deal with this now. What do I do?'
        Well, one is supposed to have sympathetic joy (<i>mudita</i>) for those
        of whom one is jealous. So I would think, 'I'm really happy for
        so-and-so. I'm really happy he's successful.' But I did not mean a word
        of it. I was just lying through my teeth. It was not solving the
        problem. I would repress it, annihilate it, and it would always come
        back bashing on me.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, I realised that the problem was
        not with jealousy, but with my aversion to it. I just hated myself for
        having that. I felt I should not have that condition; I was ashamed of
        it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When I had that insight I started being
        jealous of everything. I started bringing it up, thinking of everything
        that made me jealous. I kept looking at it. After doing that for some
        time, the problem was no more there.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lust is something we have greed for, it
        is something we enjoy. One does not have to keep bringing up lust to
        look at, because one will get lost in it; it is too easy to absorb into
        lust.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, emotions like anger and
        jealousy are a nasty kind of experience for me. I simply do not like
        them and do not want them. So instead of pushing them away, I had to
        bring them to me, just so I could see them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I deliberately thought of past
        experiences with jealousy; I just brought up all the memories that that
        particular problem caused. I did not analyse it and try to figure out
        'Why?', but simply looked at the impermanent nature of it. This movement
        toward neutralised the habit I had developed of pushing away. Then there
        was no more problem.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is why wisdom (<i>panna</i>) is
        necessary. When one understands the movements of attraction and
        aversion, then one really knows how to practise. Finding the balance
        between drawing near and pushing away comes from trusting the wisdom
        here [points to his heart]. I am just giving a guide to consider using.
        See if it works!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: How do your monks relate to you?

        clothes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Then, no advice is necessary.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Unthinkable. But generally,
        it is a very individual thing. One has to take into account many things.
        However, the whole point is to get the monk to know his intention, to
        know what he is doing, rather than forcing, compelling or conditioning
        people.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We are just using these particular
        customs and traditions as a standard of reflection, as a way of looking
        at ourselves. It is not a matter of making everybody obey the rules, but
        to try to arouse the honour in a person, to be responsible for his
        conduct in the community and in the world. One can make people, out of
        fear, obey rules. They would be afraid to break them because they would
        be caught, chastised and humiliated. But that is not arousing integrity
        and honour in a man.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, one does not want to
        make it lax, either, letting everyone just do what he wants. One wants a
        kind of strictness, an impeccable standard, from which one can learn.
        Otherwise, people tend to think, 'Oh well, the robes don't make any
        difference', 'Oh well, eating in the afternoon is ok', 'Oh well,
        carrying money is alright'. One can rationalise anything.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are good reasons for breaking all
        the rules as far as I can see. What if a family next door is starving to
        death? Why should I not be able to go steal a loaf of bread from a rich
        man to give it to them? There is always a good reason to justify the
        action. So it is not the rationalising that we are trying to develop,
        but the sense of honour and wisdom. That can only be done by
        conditioning them through fear, binding them to a set of rules that are
        so inflexible and rigid that they just become rats in a maze.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: I used to think that Theravada
        monks interpreted the vows very literally. Yet when I observe you and
        Bhikkhu Sucitto, I see that the Vinaya can be used as a lesson in the
        development of mindfulness. That is all it is.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Right. It is really quite a
        good vehicle.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: But as you mentioned, precepts
        can become a neurotic discipline.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Right. At first it has to be
        like an exercise. One trains oneself. When one learns to play the piano,
        it is not possible to start with the variations of themes. First one
        must learn the themes. In the beginning one needs to develop skill and
        become coordinated. One has to do repetitious things, like sitting for
        hours, until one acquires the skill. One can then play the standard
        themes simply by following. Eventually, as skill increases, one does not
        have to follow or imitate anymore. It is natural. Then one can play the
        variations, and it becomes a joy to listen to. But if one tries to play
        variations before one knows the theme, it can become very unpleasant --
        for everybody.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is why Vinaya discipline is like
        piano exercises. The first few years are boring. One has to listen to it
        over and over: everything has to be done in a certain way. Although it
        all looks a bit fussy and irrelevant to anything grand, once one learns
        how to do it, one does not have to think about it, wondering, 'Should I
        press this key or that one?' It is automatic. One already has the skill
        with that particular instrument. From that point on, one is free from
        it; one can use it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some monks, like piano players, just
        play the standard theme over and over because they are afraid to let go
        of the standard. They are not confident; they lack wisdom; they have
        only conditioned themselves. The point of the Vinaya is not to condition
        one but to give one complete freedom -- not freedom to follow desire but
        freedom to be spontaneous. One can only do this through wisdom and not
        through desire. One cannot be spontaneous with desire; one just becomes
        overwhelmed by it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Vinaya is a way of training body and
        speech, of giving them beauty and form, and of establishing relationship
        with others. For example, many people criticise the rules concerning
        women: 'Why can't monks touch women?'; 'Why can't monks be alone in a
        room with a woman?'; 'Why can't I have a woman up here and talk to her
        alone in a private interview?'; 'What is it about women? -- Was Buddha a
        male chauvinist pig?' Questions like this often come up. It is a matter
        of establishing a proper relationship so that the Dhamma can be taught.
        (Most women here have forgotten how nature works. The female attracts
        the male. It is a natural condition).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also, if I have a woman up here in the
        room, even though thinking 'I don't have a problem with lust anymore',
        how would that look to others? If Bhikkhu Sucitto sees a naked woman
        walking out of my room... well, it looks bad. It is a way of protecting
        women, of keeping their reputation from being gossiped about.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, women often fall in love with
        teachers and figures of authority. For monks who are still very
        attracted to women, women have a tremendous power to draw them in,
        especially if the women are discussing their own personal problems. One
        can easily get emotionally caught up in that.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha did not say that a monk cannot
        teach women. He said that a monk should establish a relationship in
        which teaching can be given. This I have found very helpful in training
        the monks at Chithurst. There are no scandals or problems there. When
        women come, they know the conditions for instruction and accept them.
        Therefore, the teaching of the Dhamma can be given without emotional
        involvement and all kinds of gossipy problems.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many bhikkhus in England, both Thai and
        Western, have lost their reputation due to their laxity with regard to
        women. That is a very strong natural force. When I went to England, I
        also thought it would be a problem. I felt that Western women were going
        to hate and resent the regulations. But they do not. When they
        understand them, they respect them very much. Our four nuns at Chithurst
        are more meticulous than we are. They are very careful about the Vinaya
        because they really want to do it correctly.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In our monastic community there is no
        jealousy about women. Such as, Venerable Sucitto has a girl friend or
        favours one of the nuns! Situations like this, where jealousy arises is
        a traditional world problem, isn't it? Men fighting over women is a
        natural condition, too, This kind of training avoids those difficulties.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: You teach everyone equally, don't
        you?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Yes. In Chithurst the nuns
        are very much a part of the monastic community. They come to all the
        functions and have the same training.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><big><big><font face="Times New Roman">*&nbsp; *&nbsp;
        *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</font></big></big></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: Do you feel that Westerners are
        more suitable to the satipatthana practice than to the study of
        philosophical analysis?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> <i>Satipatthana</i> is the
        whole point of the Buddha's teaching. One need not spend much time
        reading about it. I certainly do not feel it is necessary [to study],
        even though it is quite alright to do that. I have nothing against it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, some people feel inclined
        toward scholarship and approach the practice in that way. I can only
        speak from my own experience. I felt that just the basic training was
        enough: the Four Noble Truths and the <i>satipatthana</i> practice. I
        needed the Vinaya discipline and the <i>satipatthana</i> practice in
        order to know the Buddha's teaching through experience rather than
        through theory. Otherwise, it is like reading maps all the time without
        going anywhere.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: In Tibet, however, the practice
        seemed to develop quite differently. There was much memorisation of root
        texts and commentaries, and the debating upon them.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> Not having been born or lived
        in Tibet, I cannot very well speak for a Tibetan. Yet they obviously
        must have their reasons for their ways. I can only speak of my own
        experience. But to this day, the idea of spending years just studying
        about the Dhamma... I would not do it. I just would not! To me it is
        like reading cookbooks without preparing any meals.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: I mentioned to you about the
        Lam-rim: a systematic outline of the Buddha's sutra teaching. It is a
        graduated series of meditations that is taught as a method for attaining
        liberation. By studying and integrating it in one's mind, habituating
        the teachings to one's thinking, investigating though critical analysis
        -- do you feel this approach can cut through mental distortions?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> I really cannot say. I just
        don't know about it. I have never tried it out.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: I find the Lam-rim to be an
        excellent framework for the satipatthana practice. Having taken a number
        of courses here during these past six months, it is possible to do the
        sitting and walking practice, but I wonder if there is a deep
        understanding of what one is doing and why one is doing it. A conceptual
        framework can give one a good basis for understanding what the practice
        is all about. The reflective meditations are also a good motivating
        force, helping one to understand the rarity and meaning of having taken
        a human form, its impermanent nature, and the sufferings of cyclic
        existence.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> I agree. This type of study
        is very good. I cannot see why the two cannot go together. I cannot see
        myself just studying it without doing it. In Thailand I have seen monks
        study and learn Pali for forty years, not doing the actual practice, and
        then even disrobing. But that is their problem.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fact is that one does not need to
        know an awful lot. The teaching is so simple. That is why for many
        people the practice is enough. Yet I also seriously doubt whether people
        understand the point of the walking and sitting practice. It is still
        rather spoon-fed when people are dependent upon being told what to do
        and having everything arranged for them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When I now read the Suttas and
        Abhidhamma, I can understand them. I know what is being said. Before I
        practised meditation, I read many of the texts but just could not
        understand what they really meant. When one is practising, one is
        actually taking the teachings of the Buddha and really looking at
        oneself. When one investigates the nature of suffering, one is not
        taking someone else's definition but is looking at the experience in
        here [points to himself]. The Four Noble Truths, the Eight-fold Path and
        Dependent Origination all become very clear when one meditates upon
        them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I do not want to be quoted on any
        opinions because they are just that. I can only speak from my
        experience. Some people seem to be able to get great benefits from
        studying Abhidhamma. Now I have just no interest in Abhidhamma as a
        subject that I would study.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>RW: In Tibet, the study of Abhidhamma
        came last on the list. However, the process of debate, as a skilful
        means for sharpening the mind -- two people confronting each other in a
        quick, concentrated exchange -- is like taking a dull knife (the mind)
        and sharpening it so that it can then be used as a sword to cut through
        ignorance.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Presumably, many Tibetans have
        attained realisations through using philosophical analysis as a tool to
        prepare their minds for meditation. The Gelug tradition, however, is
        often ridiculed by the other three sects of Tibetan Buddhism for its
        heavy emphasis on study. For those who are capable of pursuing such a
        system of learning, it seems quite valuable.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>AS:</i> In your life here at the
        Insight Meditation Society, you will find your Tibetan tradition to be
        more meaningful and useful if you learn to use it and have more
        confidence in it. So do not be just blindly attached to the <i>satipatthana</i>
        practice. You are already established in a tradition and trained in it.
        So when you have had enough of sitting and walking...</font></p>
