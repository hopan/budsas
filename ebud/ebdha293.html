      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">B</FONT>uddhism teaches <B>causation</B>, 
      that the whole universe is a web of interrelated causes and effects. There 
      are two types of causation -- <B>natural causation</B> and <B>moral 
      causation</B>. Natural causation has nothing to do with people being good 
      or bad, it is simply a matter of the various forces in the universe acting 
      on each other. A rainstorm or crops ripening would be examples of natural 
      causation. Natural causes can of course have an effect on us -- being 
      caught in a rainstorm can give us a bad cold. But suffering from a cold 
      has nothing to do with moral or immoral past actions -- it would be a 
      natural effect of a natural cause.
      <P>Moral causation is about how people think, speak and act and how they 
      feel as a result. The Buddha&#39;s teaching of <B>Kamma </B>is only concerned 
      with moral causation. Being helpful to someone, having them thank you and 
      feeling happiness because of that; stealing something, getting caught and 
      then experiencing embarrassment or shame, would be examples of <B>moral 
      causation</B>. The person&#39;s happiness or discomfort are a direct result of 
      how they have acted. The person is not being &#39;rewarded&#39; or &#39;punished&#39; for 
      their actions, their happiness or discomfort is simply a <B>result</B> of 
      their actions. Now let us have a look at the recent tsunami in the light 
      of the doctrine of Kamma. </P>
      <P>A tsunami is an example of an event caused by <B>natural causation</B>. 
      The tectonic plates on the earth&#39;s surface move causing an earthquake, the 
      energy released creates huge waves which, if they hit the coast, cause 
      devastation. The people in the area where the recent tsunami hit are 
      experiencing two types of suffering -- suffering caused by <B>natural 
      causation</B> and suffering caused by moral causation, i.e., <B>Kamma</B>.<B>
      </B>During the deluge a person might have been hit by a falling tree, cut 
      by a piece of metal or smashed against a wall. These would be examples of 
      the painful effects of natural causes and would have nothing to do with 
      past moral or immoral actions. </P>
      <P>Kamma concerns peoples&#39; intentional thoughts, speech and actions 
      (kamma) and the <B>effects</B> of those reactions (vipaka). I will give 
      examples of different ways people could react to the tsunami and the 
      effects they could have. Lets say there are two people -- a man and women 
      -- both are injured in the tsunami and loose their home and means of 
      livelihood. The man falls into despair, &#39;Why me?&#39; he cries. &#39;If only I had 
      been out of town today&#39;, he said in anger and regret. By thinking like 
      this he compounds his suffering. But soon his thoughts change. He notices 
      that his neighbor&#39;s home is little damaged and he thinks, &#39;That dog, I 
      never liked him, it&#39;s a pity his house wasn&#39;t destroyed.&#39; He is further 
      compounding his suffering and as well as reinforcing ugly and negative 
      states of mind. Later he thinks, &#39;Well, it&#39;s every man for himself,&#39; and 
      he starts walking around seeing if he can steal anything from abandoned 
      houses.&#39; Now the man&#39;s negative thoughts and feelings are leading to 
      negative actions.</P>
      <P>Now let us have a look at the woman&#39;s reactions. After she recovers 
      from the initial trauma her first thought is, &#39;How fortunate I am to have 
      survived.&#39; She has suffered but she has not added to her suffering by 
      being regretful, despairing or angry. Then she thinks, &#39;There must be 
      others much worse off than me. I must see what I can do to help,&#39; and she 
      starts looking around for injured people. Thinking of others gives her a 
      degree of detachment from her own circumstances and thus, once again, this 
      does not add to her suffering. The next day she manages to get some food 
      which is being distributed by the government and as she walks away she 
      notices a child who did not get any. She comforts the child and shares her 
      food with him. Seeing that the child is all by himself she decides to look 
      after him. After a few days the child&#39;s father sees him and is 
      tremendously grateful to the women for having looked after him. The father 
      is now living with his sister in a nearby town unaffected by the tsunami 
      and invites the woman to come and stay with him where she gets food and 
      shelter. The woman&#39;s positive thoughts and actions have now had a concrete 
      positive effect on her life.</P>
      <P>Now why did the man react in one way and the women in another? <B>
      Because of how they have reacted to their various experiences in the past</B>, 
      i.e. because of their past <B>Kamma</B>. The man&#39;s negative mental habits 
      in the past (kamma) have meant that he has negative mental habits now and 
      these in turn make it more likely that he will have negative mental habits 
      in the future. These mental habits make him suffer more than he would have 
      otherwise ( vipaka). The woman (she might be a Muslim, a Buddhist, a 
      Christian or of no religion) has been taught and has always believed that 
      it is important to have a good thoughts and actions and has always tried 
      to cultivate them. Her positive mental habits in the past (kamma) have 
      meant that she has positive mental habits now and these in turn make it 
      more likely that she will have positive mental habits in the future. These 
      mental habits minimized her suffering and led to her being looked after by 
      the father of the child. In other words, her positive past actions (kamma) 
      have had a positive effect (vipaka) now.</P>
      <P>So according to Buddhism the physical pain that the victims of the 
      tsunami experienced is the outcome of various <B>natural causes</B>. How 
      they are reacting to these natural causes is their <B>Kamma, </B>the 
      results of their negative or positive reactions in the future (tomorrow, 
      next month, next year, perhaps next life), will be their<B> vipaka</B>. As 
      human beings of finite knowledge and power we have only limited influence 
      over natural causes. We do, however, have the ability to mold and 
      influence our reactions to situations. If we make no effort to develop our 
      minds in positive ways we might, in the future, find ourselves overwhelmed 
      by unexpected circumstances. If we do make the effort to develop our 
      minds, particularly through meditation, we may be better prepared to 
      endure and even triumph over future adversity. </P>
      <P>The news is full of examples of both. People ask, &#39;How is it possible 
      to remain free from grief, anxiety and fear under such terrible 
      circumstances?&#39; But some people do. A man in Sri Lanka lost his wife and 
      two children and of course was devastated. However, being a practicing 
      Buddhist, he recovered from his grief about two days later when he found 
      two children, starving, crying, with their dead parents nearby, and 
      decided to adopt them. Apparently, other people had seen the children but 
      had done nothing to help. When the man was interviewed he said that his 
      two adopted children have given his life new meaning and the strength to 
      go on despite the difficulties. We read other storied of people taking 
      advantage of the disruption to loot, rob and steal. Each of us chooses to 
      act the way we do and we will experience the results accordingly. When a 
      Singaporean man heard of the disaster he loaded up his van and drove to 
      Thailand with the intention of distributing food and water to the victims. 
      Sadly, on the way his van skidded and he was killed. People ask, &#39;Why did 
      he suffer despite his good deeds?&#39; But such a question shows a confusion 
      between <B>natural causation</B> and <B>moral causation</B>. This man&#39;s 
      swift and practical response to the suffering of others shows a great deal 
      of compassion and will have very positive results in his next life. His 
      accident had nothing to do with his good or bad deeds -- it was a result 
      of <B>natural causation</B> -- a momentary lack of attention, faulty 
      breaks, a slippery road due to rain, etc. Being good does not mean that we 
      will never suffer due to natural causes, it means that when we do suffer 
      due to natural causes we will be less likely to react in negative ways 
      that increase our suffering. </P>
      <P>Some uninformed Buddhist might say that the death and injury caused by 
      the tsunami are the result of peoples&#39; past bad Kamma. It need hardly be 
      stated here that this is contrary to what the Buddha taught. In the 
      Devadaha Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya,II,214, also Anguttara Nikaya,I,173 ) the 
      Buddha says that the belief that every experience we have is due to past
      <B>Kamma</B> (sabbam tam pubbe katahetu) is a wrong and false view (miccha 
      ditthi). In the Sivaka Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya,IV,228) he says that the 
      suffering we sometimes experience can be due to <B>Kamma </B>but it could 
      also be due<B> </B>to sickness, to weather, to carelessness or to external 
      agents (opakkamikani). The tsunami would be a good example of the third 
      and the last of these causes. All <B>Kamma</B>, whether positive or 
      negative, certainly has an effect, but not all effects are due to <B>Kamma</B>.
      </P>
      <P>But what of us who have been fortunate enough not to be involved in 
      this disaster? How can the Buddha&#39;s teaching of Kamma be relevant to us? 
      Like the man and women mentioned above, our reactions to the tsunami could 
      be either negative or positive. A person might read about the tragedy, 
      shrug his shoulders and then turn to the sports page. When asked for a 
      donation for the victims he might refuse to give anything, saying that he 
      is short of cash this week. Or he might make a donation but then go around 
      telling everyone hoping to get their praise or approval. He has been 
      presented with an opportunity to react differently from how he has always 
      done but the has failed to take advantage of it. He has failed to grown or 
      changes, he has simply allowed himself to be carried along by his old 
      habits of thoughtlessness, greed, pride and lack of compassion. </P>
      <P>But lets say a person has always been rather uncaring and self-absorbed 
      but when he sees the victims of the tsunami on the television he feels a 
      twinge of compassion. Then, rather than ignoring this flicker of 
      compassion as he has always done in the past, he decides to act upon it. 
      He goes to Red Cross and makes a really generous donation. While there he 
      sees a sign asking for volunteers and on the spur of the moment he signs 
      up and for the next few weeks spends all his free time collecting 
      donations and helping out in other ways. As a result of this he would have 
      weakened his selfish mental habits and strengthened positive ones, he 
      would have grown and changed to some degree. If in the future he continued 
      to act in such positive ways whenever he had the opportunity, he would 
      gradually become a much more pleasant person and probably a much happier 
      one too. </P>
      <P>Thus even a tragedy like the tsunami can actually have a positive side. 
      Firstly, it can be an opportunity to develop generosity, care and 
      compassion. Secondly it can be an opportunity for us to contemplate the 
      truth of Dukkha, the Buddha&#39;s teaching that life in the conditioned world 
      is unsatisfactory. Such contemplation can wake us from our complacency, 
      remind us that no matter how comfortable our life might be, it can change 
      at any time. This can help turn us from frivolous worldly pursuits to 
      meaningful spiritual goals.</P>
