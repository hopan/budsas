    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thank you Bhante for talking to us. Could
    you tell us about your early years, where you were born, your lay name, your parents'
    names?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- I was born in NYC in 1944, my civilian
    name was Jeffrey Block, and my parents were a middle class Jewish family living in
    Brooklyn.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Could you tell us where you went to
    school, your primary education?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- I went to a public elementary school
    quite close to the family house, also to junior high school, high school in the
    neighborhood, which is Borough Park, in Brooklyn. And then I went to Brooklyn College ... </font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And you got your bachelors degree?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- I got a BA degree in Philosophy.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What year would that be?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- I completed my BA degree in 1966.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And then after that?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- And then I went to Claremont Graduate
    School. This is in Claremont, California.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Southern California?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Yeah. Again I specialized in Philosophy
    and completed my doctorate degree in 1972.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">You were telling me earlier that you had
    met a Vietnamese Buddhist monk which was probably your first introduction to Buddhism?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Actually I had become interested in
    Buddhism in my junior year in college, mainly just by strolling in bookshops and looking
    at book titles and then somehow I became interested in a few books on Buddhism that I
    could find there. I think this interest in Buddhism arose from the kind of surge or quest
    for some deeper understanding of human existance that was offered by the materialistic
    philosophy of modern American civilization, and I wasn't satisfied with my ancestral
    Jewish religion, and also I didn't find much long term value in Christianity. But I was
    drawn at an early period, say during my junior year of collage to the religions of the
    east.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I began reading some of the Upanishads,
    Bhagavadgita, then I found in the bookshops some books on Buddhism. These were by D.T.
    Suzuki and Alan Watts so they were mainly on Zen Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism. Then when
    I went to Claremont Graduate School my interest in Buddhism continued and I felt
    increasingly a deeper need to lead a spiritual life. At the same time I always had an
    underlying doubt or skepticism about any type of spiritual philosophy.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But finally when I was in graduate school I
    met a Buddhist monk from Vietnam who was attending the same school and living in the same
    residence hall in which I was living. I became friends with him, and I approached him as a
    teacher and from him I received my first instructions in Buddhism and meditation.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Do you remember his name?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- His name is Thich Giac Duc. I have not
    heard from him in many, many years, so I'm not sure whether he is still alive. In fact,
    when I was still living in Washington D.C. at the Washington Buddhist Vihara he was in the
    Vietnamese temple, which was a few blocks right up the street, and he was the monk in
    charge of that temple.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Is that the temple that's on the same
    street as the Washington Buddhist Vihara?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- The one on the same street as the
    Washington Buddhist Vihara, not the Jetavana temple.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">No, no, but there is a Vietnamese temple
    just right down the street from the [Washington Buddhist] Vihara and has a very big Kuan
    Yin [image located] in the precincts there. Is that the same temple?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- It must be the same temple. It was
    called ... something like ... the Vietnamese Buddhist Church of America, or something like
    that.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, that's probably it.</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Yeah, he was in charge of that at the
    same time that I was in the Washington Buddhist Vihara, just by pure coincidence that we
    wound up on the same street after several years of separation. But he was getting into an
    increasingly antagonistic relationship with the Vietnamese community. I think mainly
    because of the different political affiliations ... because Vietnamese monks had very
    strong political affiliations.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And this was at the time the United States
    was involved in the ... </font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- No, this was years after the Vietnam
    War - this was 1981, perhaps early 82. He came to the United States in 1975 just at the
    very time that Saigon collapsed and fell to the Viet Cong. And that he was educated in the
    United States and he had somewhat pro-western sympathies compared to those monks who took
    a more radical stance against the United States. His life was in danger because once the
    Viet Cong took power they would have singled out or weeded out those monks who were known
    to be sympathetic to the west, or to the United States, and [would have] eliminated him
    physically and so he had to escape Vietnam immediately.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Were you practicing any type of Vietnamese
    meditations [at this time]?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- He started me off with Anapanasati.
    What is interesting is Vietnamese Buddhism is Mahayana but I think because of the
    proximity to Cambodia, or perhaps because they've also received a stream of transmission
    from Indian Mahayana, not only Chinese Mahayana coming down from south China to Vietnam,
    Vietnamese Mahayana Buddhism tends to have a stronger strain of classical Indian Buddhism
    within it. So the meditations he taught me were basically mindfulness of breathing, the
    meditation on loving kindness, and a meditation based on the Four Foundations of
    Mindfulness which is ... its sort of a line, each foundation of mindfulness links up with
    a particular one of the four perversions or distortions. To contemplate the body as being
    essentially impure - asubha, to contemplate all feelings as being suffering, to
    contemplate every state of mind as being anicca - impermanent, and to contemplate all
    dhammas as being without self.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And you were ordained as a samanera?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Yeah, after I became friends with him
    and I began the practice of meditation, through the practice my skepticism and doubts
    about Buddhism or the spiritual life dissipated. I became convinced that this is the
    proper path for me to follow. And so then I asked my friend, teacher, if he could give me
    ordination as a monk. Also, I have to confess that there was an underlying pragmatic
    motive as well. I wouldn't say that was the main reason why I wanted ordination, but this
    was a period when America decided it had to beef up its armed forces and it was expanding
    its roll-call of people subject to the draft. And so I also thought it might be an extra
    security measure to have a formal ordination as a monk in order to be able to submit some
    kind of document to receive exoneration from the obligation to serve in the armed forces.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Conscientious objector?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- It wouldn't have been conscientious
    objector, it would have been a ministerial deferment.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And you were ordained for about two months
    before you went to South Vietnam?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- No, I was ordained by him only as a
    samanera in May 1967, five years before I left for Asia.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Where?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- In the United States.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And then ... ?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- And I remained as a samanera for five
    years in the United States.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I see. And then you traveled straight to
    Vietnam?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- I was planning to go to Asia all along,
    from the time that I received ordination. It was not exactly certain where I would go for
    ordination or training, though my teacher, my Vietnamese teacher, had some contact with
    Sri Lankan Buddhists ... with Ven. Narada - famous monk Venerable Narada. And he was
    always constantly advising me to go to Sri Lanka to ordain and to receive training.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But as a Vietnamese monk ... or?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- At that time it was unclear but I think
    he thought I should take reordination as a Theravada monk but then eventually I should
    come back to Vietnam and then ordain again in the Mahayana Order as a Bhikshu.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So how long were you in South Vietnam?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Okay, so this is after I completed my
    graduate studies and then I had to teach for two years ... this was while I was working on
    my dissertation, I was teaching in order to earn money to pay back debts that I had
    incurred from loans to support my education.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So you were already a samanera, and you
    were working, and you were still working on your dissertation ... </font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Yeah, yeah, I was completing my
    dissertation. Then when I completed it ... I completed it in February 1972 and I continued
    to work through the end of that academic year, then I was ready to leave for Asia. And by
    this time I had also come into contact several times with Sri Lankan Buddhist monks who
    were passing through Los Angels. After my first Vietnamese teacher left the United States
    he had a friend, another Vietnamese monk who was living in Los Angeles. He had originally
    gone to teach Buddhism at U.C.L.A. and then he established a Buddhist meditation center in
    Los Angeles.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Do you recall his name?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- His name is Dr. Thich Thien An. He died
    from cancer in 1980. In 1971 I went to stay and live at that meditation center with Dr.
    Thich Thien An. And while I was staying there I got to know a Buddhist monk from Sri Lanka
    who was passing through Los Angeles and we invited him to come to stay at our meditation
    center and to give a series of talks over a period of a week. This was Venerable Piyadassi
    of Vajirarama in Columbo.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I became friendly with Venerable Piyadassi
    and I drove him around Los Angeles. I introduced him at talks and I brought him to my
    classes at the university to teach, to give lectures. And then when we parted at the Los
    Angeles airport he suggested to me that some time I should come to Sri Lanka and he could
    arrange for me to stay at a Buddhist monastery.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And then some time later I met another monk
    named Venerable Ananda Mangala who is actually a Sri Lankan monk but he was stationed in
    Singapore. Then I became friendly with him, he stayed with us also for about a week. Then
    there was Dikwella Piyananda who was at the time chief monk at the Washington Buddhist
    Vihara, he also came to stay with us for a few days and I became friendly with him. And so
    it seems I have some deep underlying karmic connection with Sri Lanka, which was getting
    reinforced by these visiting monks.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And so then when I decided to go to Sri
    Lanka, I wrote to Venerable Piyadassi and told him about my intention and asked him if he
    could recommend a place I could go to ordain and study. Then he recommended to me a monk,
    Venerable Balangoda Ananda Maitreya,</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Who later became the Sangha Nayaka ... ?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Actually, at that time he was the
    Mahanayaka of the United Amarapura Nikaya. He had become already the Mahanayaka Thera of
    the Amarapura nikaya, this would have been in early 1972. I think he received that
    appointment ... it must have been 1969 or 1970. Because I remember he was the holder for a
    five-year period and then he relinquished ... that period came to an end in 1976. So he
    might have had the appointment in 1971.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I was under the impression that after you
    gained samanera ordination in the Vietnamese tradition you left California to visit your
    monk friend in Vietnam.</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Actually I hadn't reached that point
    yet in my narrative. I had written to Venerable Piyadassi and he gave me the name of
    Venerable Balangoda Ananda Maitreya. I wrote to Venerable Ananda Maitreya asking if I
    could come and stay with him to ordain and to study and he wrote back saying I was
    welcome. So then in August 1972, I left the United States and my plane came first to
    Thailand and so I spent one week in Thailand at Wat Pleng Vipassana. From there I went to
    Vietnam in order to visit my friend, the first Buddhist monk that I had contact with. This
    was Venerable Thich Giac Duc.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Then I stayed in Vietnam for two months,
    mostly in Saigon, a few weeks I went up to Hue in central Vietnam.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Were there any meditation centers in Hue
    or were you just sight-seeing?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- It was more sight-seeing. There were
    monasteries in Hue but everything was in a rather hectic and chaotic state at that time
    because of the Vietnam War. The monks were very uncertain about the future of Buddhism and
    the future of the country itself.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So from Vietnam you ... ?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Then from Vietnam I went to Sri Lanka.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But at this point, I want to make it clear
    you were a Mahayana samanera.</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- I was a Mahayana samanera still and I
    arrived in Sri Lanka wearing my Vietnamese style robe. My teacher wanted me to wear the
    yellow robe when I came to Sri Lanka since with the brown robe I might not have been
    recognized as a Buddhist monk. So I wore this flowing yellow robe. Then, after a week or
    so in Colombo I went out to Balangoda to stay at the monastery of my ordination teacher -
    Venerable Balangoda Ananda Maitreya. Then a few weeks later I took a new ordination into
    the Theravada Order as a samanera.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">How long did you remain a samanera in the
    Theravada tradition?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- The samanera ordination took place in
    November 1972, then I took the Upasampada ordination in May, 1973. So it was six months.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Can you give us you preceptor's name?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- My preceptor was Venerable Bibile
    Sumangala Nayaka Thero. He was a prominent monk in the upcountry Amarapura Nikaya. But he
    was not known outside of the upcountry Amarapura Nikaya. He did not have an international
    reputation.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Did you have a relationship with him?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- No, no. No relationship at all. His
    function as the upajjhaya at the upasampada ceremony was purely ceremonial or a formal
    function. My real close relationship was with Venerable Ananda Mettreya.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Can you tell us about that relationship?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Well, I came to him because he had a
    great reputation as a scholar and also as an outstanding monk. When I first came to him
    and found out that he was 77 years old I was a little apprehensive because I was coming
    here as a young monk and I thought that I would have to spend five years of study with him
    and I was worried that at the age of 77 he might die at any time. But he wound up going on
    to live till the age of almost 102 and he was very strong and vigorous.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And while I was staying with him I found out
    one of the secrets of his excellent health was going for long walks several times a week,
    about twice a week. His temple was located about two miles in one direction from the town
    of Balangoda itself, in a village, in one direction and he also had a pirivena, a monastic
    school, two miles in the other direction, on the other side of Balangoda. But by that time
    he had retired from his function as the principle of the monastic school and he left it in
    the charge of his pupils.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But he kept his library there. He was a very
    avid reader, always doing research on different subjects. And so twice a week he would
    walk from his temple to the pirivena, the monastic school, with a bunch of books under his
    arm. And quite often he would ask me to go along with him and so we would walk about four
    miles in one direction - four miles going and then we would rest and have a cup of tea,
    then walk back another four miles. And he was quite fit and vigorous I was quite
    surprised.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So he was a very influential person in
    your life?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- I would say so, definitely so. And it
    was with him I began my study of Pali and Buddhism. Though I have said pretty much I
    learned Pali on my own, he didn't give me formal lessons in the grammer. But I'd work with
    some textbooks and he would check my exercises. Then once I'd learned enough Pali to start
    going through the texts ... we went through certain texts together.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Such as ... ?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- We started with the first part of the
    Samyutta Nikaya, the collection with verses, then we went through some suttas in the
    Majjhima Nikaya, then he took me through the Abhidhammatthasamgaha.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And you would translate what was already
    Pali into English or vise-versa?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- I would just translate it to myself. At
    that time I was not yet doing written translations.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So you were reading the Romanized Pali?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Actually, he wanted me to learn the
    Burmese script, which I did, because he had the entire Burmese Sixth Council Edition in
    his library. He was one of the monks who participated ... in fact, he was like the leader
    of the Sri Lankan delegation during the Sixth Buddhist Council. And so he urged me to
    learn the Burmese script, which I did and then we worked through texts ... those texts in
    the Burmese script.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I think I remember reading somewhere that
    you had a very close relationship with Venerable Nyanaponika?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Venerable Nyanaponika each year would
    go to Europe for a month or two, he started making these trips in the late 1960s up till
    1980. I had met Venerable Nyanaponika first when I made a visit to Island Hermitage. This
    was shortly after my ordination. Just by coincidence he happened to come down there. He
    was staying in Kandy, at Forest Hermitage, but each year at the time when the Island
    Hermitage held its Kathina ceremony, he would go down to Island Hermitage. And so just at
    the time I made my visit to Island Hermitage he was visiting there and so I had some talks
    with him.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Then occasionally when I had questions about
    points on Dhamma, I would write to him to get his views. Then in 1974 when he was going to
    Europe, he asked if I would come and look after the Forest Hermitage in his absence. And I
    agreed to do that, and in this way I became friendly with him. And then in 1975 I left Sri
    Lank and I went to India, to Bangalore, and stayed in Bangalore for ten months at the Maha
    Bodhi Society there, which was under Acariya Buddharakkhita.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It happened that while I was staying with
    Venerable Ananda Mettreyya in Balangoda, an Indian monk came to stay at the same
    monastery. His name was Saddharakkhita and I became friendly with him and he told me that
    his home monastery was the Mahabodhi Society in Bangalore. And so when he had completed
    his studies in Sri Lanka, and decided to go back to Bangalore, he suggested that I go
    along with him. And also I wanted to go to India because I wanted to make a pilgrimage to
    the Buddhist Holy sites.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And so I came along with him to Bangalore and
    I stayed altogether for ten months at the Mahabodhi Society there which I found quite
    inspiring because his teacher, Venerable Acariya Buddharakkhita spoke English very
    fluently, had very good understanding and knowledge of Dhamma, and each week he would give
    very very good Dhamma talks. At that time there were three western monks staying with
    him... er... I'm sorry, actually there were five or six monks there. One of them received
    ordination only toward the end of my stay there under the name Sangharatana. But later he
    came to Thailand and became reordained as Silaratana, staying with Ajaan Maha Bua. I think
    you know him. They call him Phra Dick now - Richard Byrd.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, I know him very well.</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- So he was there, and then there were
    two young Indian monks, and a Sweedish monk who was even senior to myself named Lakkhana.
    And Venerable Buddharakkhita ... Actually, at that time Venerable Lakkhana was very into
    Abhidhamma, and I was into the study of suttas. And so he had Venerable Lakkhana teach the
    Abhidhamma to all the monks and he had me teach the suttas to all the monks, even though I
    didn't have much knowledge at the time, but it really forced me to prepare talks on the
    suttas and to study the suttas carefully and learn how to explain them. And then
    occasionally Acariya Buddharakkhita would ask us to give the Sunday public Dhamma talk in
    place of himself, and that forced us to learn how to give public discourses.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">While I was staying in Bangalore, it became
    clear that our visas would not be renewed another year so I had to find another place to
    go. And meanwhile the Venerable Nyanaponika wrote to me and told me that if I decided to
    come back to Sri Lanka I would be welcome to stay with him, and so I decided to do so. So
    then I came back at the very end of 1975, I came back to Sri Lanka and went to stay with
    venerable Nyanaponika. Actually in the place right next to ... there are two places about
    100 meters apart within the same precincts. One is the Forest Hermitage where venerable
    Nyanaponika stays, the other is called Senanayakarama, where Venerable Piyadasi would stay
    when he came to Kandy.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And so I was staying in Senanayakarama since
    Venerable Nyanaponika had only one guest room, and he was expecting to come within a few
    months none other than, Venerable Phra Khantipalo. And so then I stayed ... Anyway, I
    stayed all together close to two years with Venerable Nyanaponika in that place. And
    Venerable Khantipalo stayed with us for about a year.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When I took ordination, my parents were
    extremely upset with this. And they would write to me frequently, sometimes angry letters,
    sometimes letters of grief and sorrow, sometimes letters critical of Buddhism and of
    myself, sometimes letters pleading with me to go back. And so I actually decided that I
    wouldn't be able to continue as a monk and that I would disrobe and go back to the United
    States. And I told this decision to Venerable Nyanaponika and he regretted it very much.
    But he thought that I had to make my own decisions so he didn't try to compel me, though
    he felt that I would have been justified in continuing as a monk rather than conceding to
    my parent's wishes. But I felt that maybe this was necessary to do. I actually fixed the
    date that I would disrobe. I was already making arrangements with my parents to get the
    ticket for the trip back to the United States.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It was about two or three weeks away from the
    time I was scheduled to disrobe and one day I was sitting up in my room ... at this point
    I was living in the Forest Hermitage with Venerable Nyanaponika - this was after Venerable
    Khantipalo left Sri Lanka. Then I was just thinking that the whole purpose of my life was
    to live as a Buddhist monk and if I were to disrobe just to satisfy my parent's wishes it
    would be like nullifying all that was of value and of meaning, of significance in my own
    life, just to fulfill their expectations. So I told this to Venerable Nyanaponika and he
    said 'in that case go back but go back as a monk', and I thought 'why not'.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So then I went back, this was in August 1977,
    then I went back to the United States as a monk. And when my parents, who were expecting
    me to come down in lay clothes, saw me coming in my saffron robes with an alms bowl on my
    back and the monk's umbrella in my hand ... this is what my father told me later, they had
    seen me before I saw them. My mother said to my father, 'that's not our son, let's go' and
    she actually started to walk away from the airport but my father held her back and they
    took me...</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So they took you home?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Yeah, yeah. But of course they were
    very unhappy with this.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And this was in NY or this was in ... ?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- At this time they were living in Long
    Island, outside NYC.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But you went to stay for some time at the
    Sri Lankan Buddhist Vihara, so was this at the very beginning of that stay?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- No. You see the first place I stayed
    when I went back to the United States was called the Lamaist Buddhist Monastery of
    America.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- It's in New Jersey. In a place called
    Washington, New Jersey. It was established by a Kalmuk lama named Geshe Wangyal who was
    one of the first ... You see there was a Kalmuk community which had come to the United
    States, I think during the period when Stalin was persecuting the Kalmuk Mongolians, or it
    could even have been immediately after the Bolshevik revolution - I'm not sure when. But
    they had come to the United States and settled in southern New Jersey.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">..and set up a center?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- The Buddhist centers would have come
    some time later. And Geshe Wangyal he was a Kalmuk Mongolian. He had studied in Tibet and
    China then they had set up a monastery for him and he attracted to himself some of the
    first Americans who studied Tibetan Buddhism. Later they became quite prominent scholars
    of Tibetan Buddhism, like Robert Thurman, Jeffrey Hopkins - they were originally students
    of Geshe Wangyal.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So how long did you visit your parents?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Well, I stayed with my parents a couple
    of weeks then I went to stay at this Lamaist Buddhist monastery. And I wanted also to
    study some aspects of Indian Mahayana Buddhism through the Tibetan. So actually I studied
    Sanskrit and Tibetan there - to some extent. But then I visited Washington D.C., this
    would have been Vesak 1978, and I visited the Washington Buddhist Vihara and met monks
    there.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some of the lay followers, the American lay
    followers of the Washington Buddhist Vihara, then requested me to come and take up
    residence at the Washington Buddhist Vihara. And so then I left New Jersey and I came to
    settle in Washington D.C. This would be in May 1979. Then I stayed at the Washington
    Buddhist Vihara for three years till 1982.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Then I felt that I wanted to go back to Asia
    in order to do more intensive training and meditation. My original plan was to go to Burma
    and to practice meditation with Mahasi Sayadaw. And I started to make plans to go to
    Burma. Several years earlier, Burma started to loosen up its visa policy and they were
    giving long term residence visas to foreigners who would come and stay at Buddhist
    monasteries and meditation centers just for the purpose of practicing meditation, or
    studying Buddhism. And so I was hoping to ride in on that wave. But just when I started to
    make the application, then Burma went through one of these paranoid phases and threw all
    the foreigners out of the country and was refusing to give any long term visas.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, I remember that. They ordered all
    foreigners to leave the country within 48 hours.</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Yeah, yeah.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, I remember that very clearly.</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- I think that there were some Americans
    who said that they had planned to come to Burma for the purpose of meditation and then
    after they would do a period of meditation then without permits, without the approval of
    the authorities they would just on their own started to travel about. And then the Burmese
    government became afraid that these were spies going about disguised as monks. And they
    started to ... the safest policy was to just get them all out of the country. Okay, so
    then I had to reroute my trip and so I decided to come back to Sri Lanka. It was in May
    1982, that I arrived back in Sri Lanka.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When were you made head of the B.P.S.?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Well, I became the editor of the B.P.S.
    in 1984. When I first came back to Sri Lanka, I spent my first Vassa together with
    Venerable Nyanaponika. But after the Vassa I went to a different monastery. This was a
    meditation monastery called Nissarana Vanaya, Mitirigula Nissarana Vannaya ... and I
    stayed.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Is that Mitirigula?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- That's Mitiri ... yeah. A place called
    Mitirigula. But now there are two monasteries in Mitirigula.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So Mitirigula is the name of an area?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Mitirigula is a village, and the
    monastery itself is called Nissarana Vanaya - Nissarana Vana, the Grove, or Forest, of
    Deliverance. But then on the hill just beyond Nissarana Vanaya, another monastery was
    started. Originally, that was to be a study monastery but the study program never worked
    out there ... never worked out successfully. Then the Burmese monk, the pupil of Pa Auk
    Sayadaw named U Agganya was invited to go there and give meditation training to Sri Lankan
    monks. And he was very popular, quite successful. Because now this other monastery that
    was originally set up as the study center turned into an intensive meditation center
    teaching the Pa Auk system of meditation.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The other monastery still functions more or
    less as a meditation monastery but after the death of Venerable Nyanarama the quality of
    meditation training there has declined. It is virtually turning into an old-age home for
    monks, rather than a place for younger monks who are really keen on intensive practice.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">During Venerable Nyanaponika's last years
    you were ... he was living with you... or?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Well, I'd say that I was living with
    him. While I was at Nissarana Vanaya I stayed with him on and off for about two years ...
    close to two years. Then in 1984 Venerable Nyanaponika was already was in his 80s, getting
    quite weak, and I felt that I should go to stay with him to look after him.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And then about a month after I came to stay
    with him he told me that he would like to pass on the editorship of the BPS to me. I
    wasn't quite prepared to take it but I agreed to do so. And so he retired as editor but he
    remained president for another four years till 1988 then he decided to retire from the
    presidency and he asked me to succeed him as president, which I did. But he continued to
    live on till 1994, he was 93 at the time of his death.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So you've brought us up to 1984 ... can
    you bring us up to the present? Any other interesting anecdotes or events in your life?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Okay, well in 1984 then I took over as
    editor for the Buddhist Publications Society. In 1988 I became president then I lived on
    constantly there with Venerable Nyanaponika, very rarely leaving the Forest Hermitage, in
    looking after him quite diligently. He remained in quite good health up till the last few
    weeks of his life, because he was getting weaker and his eyesight had deteriorated. His
    eyesight really started to go in 1988 and by about late 1989 he was not able to read
    anymore. So each evening we would have our evening tea and I would read to him for about
    one hour from various books and I would also record what I read so that later he could
    listen again. And I tried to obtain tapes from various teachers for him to listen to. My
    own life I think is rather flat.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I don't think so! I think its event
    packed.</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- No, if I were to write a biography from
    that period on it might be difficult to fill two or three pages.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So you've completed several very important
    translations from the Pali Canon ... being the Majjhimanikaya and the two volume set of
    the Samyuttanikaya</i>.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Yeah, yeah.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So that's quite ... and some other
    editions that I haven't mentioned, some smaller booklets, and you do the very important
    ... uh..is it the B.P.S. newsletter?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Yeah.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Is that four times a year?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Well, now it comes out three times a
    year.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">That I wouldn't call flat ... </font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- How the edition of the Majjhimanikaya
    came about ... Well actually the proposal for the Samyuttanikaya came out even earlier
    than the Majjhimanikaya. And it was none other than Phra Khantipalo, who initiated that.
    He felt that there was an urgent need for a new translation of the Samyuttanikaya, and I
    had already started this practice of translating Canonical suttas from the Canon and
    attaching to them translations of large portions of the commentary and sub-commentary.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The first work in this genre that I did was
    the Brahmajala Sutta together with its commentary and sub-commentary. I did this on the
    urging of Venerable Nyanaponika, he was very keen to have this done. And many years
    earlier he had translated large portions of the commentary and sub-commentary to the
    Brahmajala Sutta, which he had kept in a notebook. So I really learned very much, to read
    and understand the commentaries and sub-commentaries from these notebooks of Venerable
    Nyanaponika.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The style of the commentaries and
    sub-commentaries, particularly the Tikas can be quite difficult ... because the
    sub-commentator writes in the style of the classical Sanskrit commentator. You know, like
    Shankhara, well he preceded Shankharacariya, but its in a similar style, very terse, using
    very complex sentences with a lot of abstract nouns linked together by various indirect
    cases. So it's quite a project to translate the sub-commentary sentence by sentence ... I
    really learned to understand the sub-commentarial style from these notebooks of Venerable
    Nyanaponika. And then I put together this Brahmajala Sutta with the commentary and
    sub-commentary.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And that was printed by itself once.</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- It is, it still is printed by itself.
    It's called the Discourse on the All Embracing Net of Views. Then after that I did the
    first Discourse of the Majjhimanikaya, this is the Mulapariyaya Sutta and its commentary
    and sub-commentary, then the Mahanidana Sutta, that's the Great Discourse on Causation,
    and the Samannaphala Sutta, the second discourse in the Dighanikaya -- The Discourse on
    the Fruits of Recluseship.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So Venerable Khantipalo liked my translations
    and he proposed to me that I do a new translation of the Samyuttanikaya for the Pali Text
    Society. But I was somewhat doubtful that the Pali Text Society was interested in taking
    on new translations. Bhikkhu Khantipalo wrote to Richard Gombrich who was then the
    secretary of the P.T.S. asking him to write to me to assure me that they would be
    interested in new translations. And Gombrich did so. This was in 1985. But just about that
    same time Wisdom Publications had written to Venerable Nyanaponika ... you see, Venerable
    Khantipalo had put together 90 suttas from the Majjhimanikaya that were translated by
    Bhikkhu Nyanamoli and these were published in Bangkok in three volumes by Mahamakut Press
    called A Treasury of the Buddha's Words.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Nick Ribush of Wisdom Publications found out
    about those three books, these three volumes, and he had the idea to have an entire
    translation of the Majjhimanikaya published. He asked Venerable Nyanaponika if he would be
    able to edit the remaining 32 discourses of the Majjhimanikaya that Venerable Nyanamoli
    had translated. But Venerable Nyanaponika, at this point, was in his mid-eighties already
    and he thought it was just too much for himself to take on. And he asked me if I would be
    willing to do it and I said okay.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And so I started doing this in 1985 and as I
    went through then I felt that some of Venerable Nyanamoli's terminology had to be altered.
    He was using a rather experimental terminology, which would not have been so readily
    comprehensible to an ordinary reader in English. I made these alterations with the
    approval of Venerable Nyanaponika who totally endorsed them. So I worked on that from 1985
    till about early 1989 because I wasn't able to do this full time. I also had to do the
    editing for the Buddhist Publications Society. It was April 1989 that I sent the completed
    manuscript off to Wisdom Publications and it remained in limbo with them for about three
    years since they couldn't find anybody to oversee the project. This was the age before
    computers had come into general usage, at least in Sri Lanka. And so what I submitted to
    Wisdom was a typed script, typed on a manual typewriter. And so, they had various people
    enter the text into computer format using different computers and different editorial
    styles. And then they needed someone to oversee the whole project but they couldn't find
    anybody for several years and it remained in limbo till one person named John Bullitt came
    along and he took the responsibility for overseeing the text preparation, copy editing of
    the whole work. So finally it came out in 1995.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">After I finished the Majjhima, several months
    later I started translating the Samyuttanikaya ... this would have been about June 1989. I
    started doing the Samyuttanikaya not with the first volume, which is the collection of
    verses, since the verses can be very difficult and I thought that if I started doing the
    verses first I would quickly get discouraged and give up on the project. And so I started
    with volume two, the first of the prose volumes and so I did volume two and three pretty
    quickly but then I got involved in other projects, books at the B.P.S. had to be edited,
    also various things came, even for several years I couldn't return to the Samyuttanikaya
    for so many years. Then I would return to it for periods then back to other things. Not
    that I was wasting my time or throwing my time away on trifling enjoyments, but various
    other projects called for my attention and deflected it away from the Samyutta. So I
    couldn't return to that, sometimes for several years, then I would work on it.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I must have finished the first draft in 1993.
    Then I had to prepare the notes and the verse collection was very, very difficult I went
    through it several times making drastic alterations, as I compiled the notes then I saw
    places where I interpreted certain verses wrongly and I had to retranslate the verses. And
    the preparation of the notes was very time consuming, a year was spent on the notes alone.
    And so it was completed ... I was ... diddling on again accepting invitations to various
    projects, to various engagements, and so on.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So finally, Wisdom Publications gave me a
    deadline, which was in a way a lifesaver, in that it forced me to put my attention
    wholeheartedly on the Samyutta and complete it. I think the deadline was something like
    September 21st, 1999, and I completed all of the work ... you know, everthing that had to
    be done ... and put everything on disks and sent the disks off to them by courrier on
    September 17 so that the disks arrived at their office on September 21.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">That's what we call a close call.</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Yeah, but nothing would have happened
    if I missed the deadline. They wanted to enter it into their catalogue for a particular
    release date. So if I missed the deadline then it wouldn't have gotten into the catalogue
    and so their release would have been postponed for another season. Their releases are done
    three times a year, so that it would have had to have been postponed from I think a spring
    or summer release to a fall or winter release. It wouldn't have meant that I would have
    been killed [laugh] ... for missing the deadline.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So you've brought us up to the present ...
    </font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- But one thing I didn't mention is the
    problem with the headache. This seems to be some type of karmic destiny that I've had
    which is ... I've repeated this story so often to different doctors it gets boring to
    repeat it in detail over and over. But starting in 1976 early 77 I started to get this
    headache condition which gradually grew worse, and I consulted various doctors.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">First, the problem developed around the eyes
    so I thought something might be wrong with the eyes so I saw optometrists and they led me
    on to EMT specialists who thought that there could have been inflammation in the sinuses
    and they passed me on to neurologists thinking that something could have been wrong with
    the nerves. But none of these doctors could find anything organically wrong. Then I tried
    different types of medical treatment, not only western medicine but Ayurvedic medicine,
    traditional Sri Lankan herbal medicine, Chinese acupuncture, homeopathic medicine, Tibetan
    medicine. Now here in Singapore, along with western medicine I'm also trying Chinese
    herbal medicine and massage therapy. So this headache has been quite a major obstruction
    to my work and other activities through the years.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So hopefully through the power of your
    punna these will soon come to an end.</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- It seems that it will take a lot of
    punna [laugh].</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One of the reasons that I wanted you to
    tell us your story is that in the past there have been many western monks, this is not a
    new thing, and with the passing of Venerable Nyanaponika ... I think that we lose a lot
    without asking pertinent questions at the right time. So I'm very glad that you've agreed
    to tell us your story. And he [Suchao Ploychum] wanted me to ask you about your views of
    Buddhism in Sri Lanka ... what are your impressions, do you think it will remain a vital
    place for westerners to seek ordination and training there?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Okay, well rather sadly I have to say
    that my impression of Buddhism in Sri Lanka is that to a large extent it has deteriorated.
    In the older generation you could find monks who were quite good scholars and sincere
    practitioners. Now, because of various changes, political changes in the country, economic
    changes the large impact of westernization I would say that the quality of the monastic
    life has declined a lot.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are still pockets of monks who are very
    good, very earnest, very dedicated. Particularly within this community or organization
    called the Sri Kalyani Yogashrama Sanstava which is a distant cousin of the Dhammayut
    nikaya in Thailand.</font></p>
    <i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Could you repeat that name clearly?</font></p>
    </i><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Okay, Sri Kalyani Yogashrama Sanstava.
    Sanstava is something like association of the Yogashramas ... meditation monasteries. Sri
    kalyani ... I think its name comes from the Kalyani river in Burma in which the
    ordinations were performed by the monastic community which is the parent of the
    Ramanyanikaya ... it must be in the Ramanyadesa of Burma. This was a kind of association
    of monasteries established by one Venerable Jinavamsa who is still alive today at the age
    of ... could be 95, 96, and Venerable Sri Nyanarama who was the meditation master at
    Mitirigula Nissarana Vanaya monastery.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The original motivation for the starting of
    this organization was to revive the true monastic life in Sri Lankan monastic Buddhism
    based on close adherence to the Vinaya, study of the texts ... very precise and careful
    study of the text, and the practice of meditation. And this particular monastic community
    has been in rather close contact in recent years with Pa Awk Sayadaw in Burma and some of
    the monks from this organization have gone to Burma to practice with Pa Auk Sayadaw, and
    others are studying in Sri Lanka under Pa Auk Sayadaw's disciple U Agganya. So I'd say
    that this is a quite healthy stream within the Sri Lanka sangha.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Otherwise, ... outside of this organization
    there are other good monks here and there. But by and large I have to say that monasteries
    have become rather depressing places. Many of the younger monks get ordained solely for
    the purpose of pursuing their education, if they are capable they go to the universities,
    get their degrees, then disrobe. Others remain as monks but they work at salaried jobs as
    teachers, which I would say is not so condemnable in itself but other monks who are rather
    clever and enterprising become involved in various activities which go quite against the
    whole grain of the monastic life, involvement in business, finance, politics.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So for westerners who wish to ordain and
    receive proper training I find it rather difficult to recommend Sri Lanka. Though there
    are a few places I could suggest, like Nissarana Vanaya, if a monk is capable of taking
    care of himself with a little outside guidance, then its still a suitable place. The other
    place connected with the strict meditative training ... I say that its too narrow in its
    focus for a new monk who needs a broader base of training, some guidance in the monastic
    rules, a general introduction to the teaching, the Dhamma, in a place like that one
    doesn't find the training, one finds only the exclusive teaching of meditation according
    to a particular technique. A place like that is suitable for a monk who has already
    completed his basic training and wants some intensive practice in meditation.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So the opportunities for a foreigner coming
    to Sri Lanka ... there are opportunities to ordain ... often monks will have no hesitation
    to give the formal ordination to a candidate but once they get ordained they largely have
    to make out on their own to get proper instruction in the Dhamma.</font></p>
