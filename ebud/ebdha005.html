    <p><strong>Introduction by Rick StClair (</strong><a
    href="mailto:stclair@mit.edu"><strong>stclair@mit.edu</strong></a><strong>):</strong></p>
    <p>At this location I post an important Buddhist Ecumenical
    statement which was formulated by the Venerable Walpola
    Rahula, a Buddhist highly esteemed by all schools of Buddhism
    in our time. In this statement entitled &quot;Basic Points
    Unifying the Theravada and the Mahayana,&quot; Ven. Rahula
    provides the Buddhist world community with a blueprint of
    tolerance and a positive way of viewing one another. If we
    are to make Buddhism in action the Great Vehicle which it is
    in the sutras, I feel we need to practice gentleness,
    patience, tolerance and support for one another. Without
    these attributes, our Buddhism is as tinkling brass. This is
    not simply a matter of &quot;image-polishing&quot; for the
    non-Buddhist world at large, but is part and parcel of what I
    feel Buddhism is all about, namely, the way to the cessation
    of suffering. What better way to begin this process than by
    ceasing the suffering which is generated when we wrangle over
    the differences between our practices and beliefs? </p>
    <p>Stephen Evans, who contributed this posting to the
    talk.religion.buddhism newsgroup, reported the following:
    &quot;The World Buddhist Sangha Council was first convened by
    Theravadins in Sri Lanka in 1966 with the hope of bridging
    differences and working together. The first convention was
    attended by leading monks, from many countries and sects,
    Mahaayaana as well as Theravaada. The following, written by
    Ven. Walpola Rahula was approved unanimously.&quot; </p>
    <p>Here then follows the text: </p>

    <h3 align="center"><font color="#800000">Basic Points
    Unifying The Theravada and The Mahayana <br>
    <em>by Ven. Walpola Rahula</em></font><em> </em></h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>1. The Buddha is our only Master. </p>
        <p>2. We take refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
        Sangha. </p>
        <p>3. We do not believe that this world is created and
        ruled by a God. </p>
        <p>4. Following the example of the Buddha, who is the
        embodiment of Great Compassion (mahaa-karu.naa) and Great
        Wisdom (mahaa- praj~naa), we consider that the purpose of
        life is to develop compassion for all living beings
        without discrimination and to work for their good,
        happiness, and peace; and to develop wisdom leading to
        the realization of Ultimate Truth. </p>
        <p>5. We accept the Four Noble Truths, nameley Dukkha,
        the Arising of Dukkha, the Cessation of Dukkha, and the
        Path leading to the Cessation of Dukkha; and the
        universal law of cause and effect as taught in the
        pratiitya-samutpaada (Conditioned Genesis or Dependent
        Origination). </p>
        <p>6. We understand, according to the teaching of the
        Buddha, that all conditioned things (sa.mskaara) are
        impermanent (anitya) and dukkha, and that all conditioned
        and unconditioned things (dharma) are without self
        (anaatma). </p>
        <p>7. We accept the Thirty-seven Qualities conducive to
        Enlightenment (bodhipak.sa-dharma) as different aspects
        of the Path taught by the Buddha leading to
        Enlightenment. </p>
        <p>8. There are three ways of attaining bodhi or
        Enlightenment, according to the ability and capacity of
        each individual: namely as a disciple (sraavaka), as a
        Pratyeka-Buddha and as a Samyak-sam-Buddha (perfectly and
        Fully Enlightened Buddha). We accept it as the highest,
        noblest, and most heroic to follow the career of a
        Bodhisattva and to become a Samyak-sam-Buddha in order to
        save others. </p>
        <p>9. We admit that in different countries there are
        differences with regard to the life of Buddhist monks,
        popular Buddhist beliefs and practices, rites and
        ceremonies, customs and habits. These external forms and
        expressions should not be confused with the essential
        teachings of the Buddha. </p>
