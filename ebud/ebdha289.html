      <TD WIDTH="100%"><B></B><B>At the Turn of Two Centuries</B><P>As the end 
      of 19th century approached, Siam was faced with the powerful force of 
      westernization, which brought great excitement and anxiety to the Thai 
      elites. Equally dramatic was the change of Siamese society in response to 
      this external pressure. One interesting aspect of that change was the 
      transformation of Thai Buddhism in general and of the Thai Monastic Sangha 
      [1] in particular. There was no change in the history of Thai Buddhism as 
      powerful and intense as the one that occurred around the turn of the 20th 
      century.</P>
      <P>Two years before the end of the 19th century, the Thai Sangha, under 
      the leadership of Prince Wachirayan, was at the forefront of introducing a 
      modern education system throughout the country. Schools were built in many 
      wats (monasteries). Wats all over Siam became centers for the 
      dissemination of new ideas and information to the people. A new syllabus 
      introduced rural youth to Western style mathematics and science. 
      Standardized script and language replaced local languages. It should be 
      noted that while such a syllabus was promoted enthusiastically by the Thai 
      Sangha, it was doggedly resisted by its Burmese counterpart. [2]</P>
      <P>Three years after the dawn of the 20th century, the Thai Sangha was 
      thoroughly reorganized as never before. All monks in the kingdom were 
      incorporated into the same structure under a centralized leadership in 
      Bangkok. The centralized and bureaucratized administration system, then 
      considered &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;effective,&quot; was introduced to one of Siam's 
      oldest institutions.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the Sangha's education system was overhauled. New 
      curriculum, new teaching and learning methods, and new texts were 
      developed. Buddhist teachings were reinterpreted, leading to a new 
      &quot;scientific&quot; orthodoxy. One innovation that should be mentioned was the 
      introduction of Siamese script to replace Khmer in writing religious 
      texts.</P>
      <P>It is apparent that Thai Buddhism and its Sangha at the turn of the 
      century were highly dynamic and vibrant. It was an important agent of 
      change not only in the area of Buddhism itself but also in other aspects 
      of Siamese life. The role of the Sangha in the creation of a modern nation 
      state, for example, is beyond dispute.</P>
      <P>Such dynamism is in sharp contrast with the state of the Thai Sangha at 
      the turn of the 20th century. Instead of being an agent of change, it has 
      becomes a hindrance to it. The Sangha education system, especially the 
      ecclesiastical one, is obsolete. Its hierarchy and governing structure, 
      modeled after colonial administrations, are out-dated and squelch monks' 
      creativity at every level. Under the present structure, any real reform 
      can take place only at the &quot;periphery,&quot; and stops there because of the 
      strong resistance inherent in the hierarchy. Instead of leading, the 
      Sangha is merely a follower, and not a very competent one at that. 
      Innovation is possible only through individual monks, never by the Sangha 
      as an institution.</P>
      <P>Despite the stark differences, the conditions of the Sangha at the end 
      of both centuries are closely connected. The obsolete systems of the 
      current Sangha, such as, the educational and administrative, are in fact 
      the legacy of the changes of one hundred years ago. Over time the reform 
      led by Prince Wachirayan has become an obstacle to any real change, even 
      when that change is vital and necessary.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the Sangha fails as a moral force. The morality and 
      behavior of monks are increasingly questioned, while virtuous monks 
      struggle to strengthen the morality of society as a whole. Moral decline 
      manifesting in widespread crime, corruption, drugs, and various social 
      problems, throughout the country and in the wats themselves, indicates the 
      failure of the Sangha as a moral force.</P>
      <P>Worse than that, Thailand's moral decay reflects a more worrisome fact: 
      Buddhism as it is generally practiced in this country has failed. It's not 
      true that Thai society has become increasingly secularized as was 
      anticipated by some theorists. The fact that meditation has become popular 
      and widespread among the middle class, and the rapid expansion of some 
      schools, Dhammakaya, for example, are signs of a Buddhist revival. Thai 
      society is increasingly religious. The question is why morality in Thai 
      society is increasingly debased. Apart from questioning the role of the 
      Sangha, we need to investigate Buddhism as currently practiced, also.</P>
      <B>
      <P>The Lost Ultimate</P>
      </B>
      <P>Without the reform initiated by King Mongkut, and further developed by 
      his son the Prince Patriarch, the beliefs about Buddhism of Thai people 
      today would be much different. The reform that he began as a monk in the 
      early part of the 19th century has shaped modern Buddhism with its 
      rationality and scientific orientation. The kind of Buddhist teachings 
      that he propagated through his Thammayutika sect left almost no room for 
      superstition or transcendental worlds. Reference to heavens and hells 
      according to the three worlds paradigm was greatly reduced and belief in 
      them was downplayed in its significance. He only recognized the heavens 
      and hells of the mind. [3]</P>
      <P>While abandoning the three worlds paradigm that had informed Thai 
      Buddhist belief for many centuries, King Mongkut placed more emphasis on 
      achievementsthat can be fulfilled in this life. He was the first Thai king 
      to turn his back on the aim of being reborn as a Future Buddha. This does 
      not mean, however, that he was more concerned about attaining nibbana in 
      this life. Though he referred to nibbana occasionally in his writings, he 
      seemed to regard it as a remote ideal beyond the reach of people. His 
      teachings, especially for the laity, instead stressed worldly and 
      practical achievements. [4]</P>
      <P>Although a wave of westernization was sweeping Thailand at the same 
      time, King Mongkut's Buddhist reform was not aimed at making it more 
      responsive or adaptable to modernity. His objective was to purify Buddhism 
      through the process of returning to the &quot;roots,&quot; making it true to the 
      original teachings and practices of the Buddha. But while rejecting 
      traditional Buddhism as a distortion and deviation, the Buddhism he 
      introduced was western influenced in its empirical approach and its stress 
      on this-world achievements.</P>
      <P>Western influence was even more apparent in the teachings of later 
      Thammayutika leaders, especially Prince Wachirayan. Nibbana, the ultimate 
      reality which was treated as a remote ideal by King Mongkut, was virtually 
      ignored in the age of Prince Wachirayan. There was no room for the 
      ultimate truth-reality in the kind of Buddhism which he propagated among 
      the general people. In Nawakowat, his primer that has been the standard 
      and fundamental text of Thai Buddhists for the last 80 years, the section 
      &quot;gihipanipatti&quot; (code of morality for the laity) mentions nothing about 
      the ultimate goal (paramattha). In discussing &quot;attha&quot; (goal or benefit), 
      only temporal and mental goals are referred to. He considered nibbana 
      unnecessary, not only for the laity, but also for the monks. This resulted 
      in the phrase &quot;nibbana realization&quot; being removed from the vow of 
      candidacy in the ordination ceremony. [5] In his teaching, the benefit of 
      morality was emphasized only in temporal terms, without indicating any 
      connection to the ultimate or spiritual goal. Meditation has also been 
      ignored in the entirely bookish modern Sangha education system. [6]</P>
      <P>Attempts at returning to &quot;the original&quot; always end up back with &quot; the 
      new,&quot; since one inevitably looks at the past through the eyes of the 
      present. Returning to origins invariably involves processes of 
      interpretation and selection. What one sees and brings back is always 
      different from the original. In other words, the original remains the same 
      only if it is left as it was. Once we interact with or &quot;contact&quot; it, 
      however respectfully and carefully, it becomes something new, smeared with 
      our &quot;fingerprints.&quot;</P>
      <P>The &quot;Original Buddhism&quot; that King Mongkut discovered after intensive 
      study of the Tipitaka is therefore a Buddhism mixed with his own opinions 
      and influenced by his world view, consequently mirroring the ideas 
      existing in the social milieu in which he was embedded. Further, his 
      version of Buddhism would not have become so widespread without the 
      reforms of his son, Prince Wachirayan, the Supreme Patriarch in the reign 
      of King Rama the Sixth.</P>
      <P>His unification of the Sangha was successful not only in terms of 
      administration but also in shaping along the same lines the understanding 
      of Buddhism among Thai monks. For the first time in Thai history, the 
      different teachings and practices of Buddhism based in different 
      localities, were replaced by a &quot;standardized&quot; orthodoxy introduced from 
      the expansion minded capital. [7] The new centralized structure not only 
      enabled the standard Buddhist curriculum to be adopted effectively 
      throughout the kingdom, but also gave rewards and punishments to local 
      monks based on their response to the central policy. No less important 
      were the texts for propagating the new orthodoxy, still in use, ninety 
      percent of which were written by one person, Prince Wachirayan. [8] King 
      Mongkut's Buddhism, previously confined to his small sect, thereby became 
      the official orthodoxy of the Sangha.</P>
      <P>Prince Wachirayan, however, did more than popularize the teaching of 
      his father. As the new nation-state was forming, Buddhist teachings were 
      interpreted and selected which fit the needs and agenda of the nation's 
      rulers. [9] Obligation to the state and its rulers was emphasized as a 
      supreme Buddhist value. Even Thailand's active engagement in the first 
      World War was encouraged and sanctioned by the Prince as a virtuous act, 
      conforming to the teaching of the Buddha. This justification of war was 
      later reinforced by King Rama the Sixth when he declared that waging 
      defensive war was not against Buddhist morality. Under his reign, Buddhism 
      was used to energetically promote and support nationalism.</P>
      <P>The highest goal of Buddhism is to attain spiritual liberation and be 
      free from suffering. However, since the age of Prince Wachirayan, this 
      liberating aspect of Buddhism has been increasingly overlooked. Buddhism 
      has been reduced to a code of morality, concerned with only good and bad. 
      [10] Such moral Buddhism was popularized further through the modern 
      curriculum introduced by the Ministry of Education to every school 
      throughout the country. [11] Moreover, such morality is merely memorized 
      but not practiced and therefore is not internalized.</P>
      <P>It is apparent that in the past hundred years, Buddhism has been 
      transformed to fit with modernity. Ironically, while superstition was 
      supposedly removed from Buddhism in the process of purification, western 
      rationality, scientism, and nationalism replaced it, resulting in the 
      removal of transcendental and ultimate aspects. In other words, 
      traditional superstition was replaced by modern, foreign superstition.</P>
      <P>It is also ironic that despite its emphasis on morality, the official 
      Buddhism has failed to strengthen the actual morality of Thai society. 
      While morality has been propagated continuously in the schools and media 
      for many decades, and while large numbers of people go to make merit in 
      the temples, moral degradation is still a grave problem for Thailand 
      today. One explanation is that this kind of Buddhism lacks &quot;the sacred.&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;The sacred&quot; (saksit) here refers to that which is beyond the five 
      physical senses, and is inaccessible and unexplainable by mere 
      rationality, but which, nonetheless, can be attained or realized by the 
      mind. It has a quality or power that those who access it can receive and 
      benefit from. It is a refuge or security for those who believe. Its 
      dynamism is beyond social codes and is incomprehensible to the untrained 
      mind. The ways to realize it are diverse, just as there are many ways of 
      conceiving of it. [12]</P>
      <P>There were many forms of the sacred in traditional Buddhism, for 
      example, deities, miracles, revered objects, and natural sites. Belief in 
      heaven and hell played an important role in strengthening people's sense 
      of morality. Some of the ancient laws, for example, the opium prohibition 
      law of King Rama the Second, evoked the fear of hell to dissuade people 
      from opium consumption. Once Buddhism was reformed to be more scientific, 
      there were no tangible sacred things to take the place of deities, heaven, 
      spirits, and the like. Even the Buddha was demystified to be made more 
      human.</P>
      <P>Nibbana or the ultimate is, in fact, another form of the sacred, the 
      unconditioned aspect (sankhata). Yet it, too, was removed from official 
      Buddhism. The moral code of official Buddhism has been rationalized as 
      well. People are expected to practice morality through the sheer force of 
      intellect and rationalization, but intellect alone is not effective enough 
      to develop a moral life. Morality has to be deepened to the spiritual 
      level. Faith or fear of the sacred's power, experience of inner peace, and 
      connection with the ultimate through meditation, are all necessary 
      spiritual conditions for maintaining one's morality. With the absence of 
      the sacred, the moral code of official Buddhism no longer had any 
      spiritual support or meaning.</P>
      <P>Another consequence of the removal of the sacred is the spread of 
      &quot;malign&quot; superstition. For their own security, ordinary people need the 
      sacred. Once the sacred cannot be found in official Buddhism, they are 
      tempted to look for it outside Buddhism, that is, in superstition. 
      Usually, these superstitions were once a part of traditional Buddhism. 
      Buddhist reform, rather than get rid of superstition, merely expelled them 
      from the wats. Once outside the wat, there were beyond the control of 
      Buddhism and thus became amoral. This degraded form of superstition, 
      aiming to gratify any desire, does not require any morality on the part of 
      the client. This lack of moral obligation is the main factor that 
      differentiates malign superstition from the superstition that was part of 
      traditional Buddhism.</P>
      <P>Despite its anti-superstition inclination, official Buddhism has 
      contributed to the wide dissemination of the very superstition it sought 
      to suppress. The more it tries to expel superstition from the wats, the 
      more superstition spreads to them. This is another irony of official 
      Buddhism. Moreover, the superstition that is now spreading to the wats is 
      simultaneously gaining control over Buddhism, and not vice versa as 
      before.</P>
      <P>This kind of superstition fits well with the new influence - 
      consumerism. On one hand, consumerism stimulates sensual and material 
      desire, motivating people to seek superstition as a quick and easy way to 
      get what they want. On the other hand, consumerism has commodified 
      superstition, making it easily accessible and diversified, as well as 
      marketing it with modern methods and technology. In short, consumerism 
      increases both the demand for and the supply of superstition.</P>
      <P>With this kind of superstition, people just wait for worldly 
      achievement to arrive. Success is expected to come easily, through 
      purchased amulets, without making any effort or practicing Dhamma, such 
      as, diligence, honesty, and self-contentment. Morality is therefore 
      regarded as unnecessary for daily life.</P>
      <P>The wide spread of superstition throughout the country, even in the 
      wats, is the sign of official Buddhism's failure in its attempt to remove 
      superstition. It also indicates the influence of consumerism on current 
      Buddhism. Both phenomenon reveal the weakness of Buddhism that can be 
      traced to the reform of King Mongkut and Prince Wachirayan.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Structural Problems</P>
      </B>
      <P>The situation discussed above is the consequence of the new orthodoxy 
      that, however, is only one aspect of the reform. Equally important is the 
      structural aspect of Sangha reorganization begun in the time of Prince 
      Wachirayan and continuing until now. Under the new centralized structure, 
      monks of all localities in the country came under the power of the 
      hierarchy, thus making them less responsive to their own communities. 
      Moreover, allowing the state to exert influence in many important aspects 
      of the Sangha, this new structure virtually transformed the Sangha into an 
      extension of the state. Monks are therefore more inclined toward the state 
      than the people.</P>
      <P>The reason that the Sangha stays close to the state is mainly because 
      the Sangha's leadership believes that its unity, cohesion, and orderliness 
      depend upon the state's support. But the price of having state protection 
      is the loss of autonomy. Further, many religious affairs that were once in 
      the control of the local communities, for example, the bestowing of 
      ecclesiastical rank and the establishment of wats, have been monopolized 
      by the state almost completely.</P>
      <P>In fact, there are other factors that contribute to the widening gap 
      between the monks and the people. Some of them are the 
      institutionalization of such social services as education and medicine, 
      which were once provided by the monks, the decline of ecclesiastical 
      education, and the lack of motivation in providing education for monks. 
      Compounded by the centralized and bureaucratized structure, these factors 
      contribute to the reduction of the Sangha's role in promoting morality in 
      Thai society. It also obstructs any attempt to reform the Sangha or 
      improve its social role in response to the changing world. With this 
      structure, merely maintaining the moral standards of the monks is almost 
      impossible as shown by the Sangha's failure to cope with all the recent 
      scandals.</P>
      <B>
      <P>New Reform Movements</P>
      </B>
      <P>Throughout the past hundred years, Thai Buddhism has never lacked 
      attempts to reform itself. After Prince Wachirayan's reform, the attempt 
      by Buddhadasa Bhikkhu is the most prominent. In fact, the former had a lot 
      of influence on the latter, especially in terms of the scientific and 
      rational approach to Buddhism, and the anti-superstition inclination. 
      However, Buddhadasa Bhikkhu was able to go beyond Prince Wachirayan; he 
      recognized the supreme value of the ultimate. He did more than anyone else 
      in the recent history of Buddhism in bringing the ultimate goal back to 
      its central place in Buddhism. Moreover, he tried to make it more 
      accessible to ordinary people. His teaching aimed to integrate the 
      ultimate into ordinary life, making transcendence and worldly life 
      inseparable. In other word, nibbana has been reintroduced as the sacred 
      for the committed Buddhist, in place of superstition or miracles. 
      Furthermore, his idea of &quot;nibbana here and now&quot; brings the sacred closer 
      to us in every moment of daily life, without needing to retreat to the 
      forest as monks.</P>
      <P>Though he also regarded Buddhism and science as identical, his 
      understanding was different from Prince Wachirayan, was more profound and 
      less imitative. Instead of defining Buddhism to fit with western science, 
      Buddhadasa defined science to conform with Buddhism, that is, as involving 
      not only physical aspects that can be experienced through the five senses, 
      but also including mental processes that can be experienced with the mind, 
      the sixth sense. Buddhadasa Bhikkhu's &quot;Scientific Buddhism&quot; is therefore 
      the science of timeless ultimate truth with meditation is an integral 
      &quot;technology.&quot;</P>
      <P>Buddhadasa Bhikkhu's ideas find an echo in Phra Dhammapitaka's (P. A. 
      Payuttho) teachings which present Buddhism in its totality with its 
      highest goal found in spiritual liberation through the realization of 
      ultimate truth. The ultimate is not some remote ideal for the unworldly 
      life; instead, it is relevant and necessary for people of this world, both 
      monks and laity. While Buddhadasa Bhikkhu encouraged his followers to live 
      with &quot;void-free mind,&quot; Phra Dhammapitaka stressed that noble ones who 
      attain at least the first level of enlightenment are needed by the present 
      world. His Constitution for Living, however comparable to Prince 
      Wachirayan 's Nawagowat in popularity and content, concludes with the 
      chapter entitled &quot;Attainer of Dhamma: A Liberated One,&quot; making it 
      strikingly different from Prince Wachirayan's orthodoxy.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that science has a significant influence for both 
      Buddhadasa Bhikkhu and Phra Dhammapitaka. (Both enjoyed studying and 
      experimenting with machines and new technologies when they were young.) 
      Like Buddhadasa, Phra Dhammapitaka elevates Thai Buddhism beyond the 
      worldly realm of western science. He recognizes the limits of science. 
      Thus, it should be complemented by Buddhism in order to have a better and 
      deeper understanding of the truth, and to use it in a constructive way. 
      However, one cannot help being impressed how the scientific approach 
      contributes a great deal to his thought and writings. Like Buddhadasa 
      Bhikkhu, his emphasis on the human being's potential to realize the 
      ultimate truth through his own wisdom and effort is likely to be 
      influenced by the humanism on which western science is based. This does 
      not mean that humanism is alien to Buddhism or that it belongs only to 
      western science. Rather, it is highly probable that the humanist influence 
      of science contributed a lot to their perception and recognition of 
      humanism in the Buddha's teaching, leading to their emphasis on and 
      explanation of the supreme potential of the human being. Without humanist 
      ideas, it is difficult to notice and present the humanist approach to 
      Buddhism as they did. This is the reason why traditional Buddhism seldom 
      explained human potential in such a way. Nibbana was understood 
      traditionally as a remote idea that could be attained only through merit 
      accumulation over countless lives. Hence, no serious effort is made to 
      realize nibbana in this life.</P>
      <P>Despite their popularity among the middle class, and especially the 
      well educated, the teaching of both monks has not been well received among 
      the Sangha leadership. Their thought and writings have influenced only low 
      ranking monks or those on the periphery, for example, &quot;the Suan Mokkh 
      movement.&quot; Until now, Sangha education institutions, including the Sangha 
      universities, still adhere to Prince Wachirayan's orthodoxy. Curriculum 
      and texts developed and written by Prince Wachirayan eighty years ago 
      remain in use in both the Pali and Nak Tham systems, whereas none of the 
      books by Buddhadasa Bhikkhu and Phra Dhammapitaka are studied as texts in 
      the Sangha's ecclesiastical education system.</P>
      <P>No contemporary monk in Thailand has put forth greater effort to reform 
      the Sangha education system than Phra Dhammapitaka. He was the first monk 
      to warn the Sangha and government about the value of higher education for 
      monks. Despite some success after thirty years of effort, only secular 
      education for monks receives support and improvement, while monastic and 
      Dhamma education is still quite stuck in the past, both in terms of 
      curriculum and administration. The failure of &quot;reform from within&quot; 
      initiated by him reflects the strong resistance so deeply rooted in the 
      Sangha structure. This has resulted in the sharp decline of the 
      ecclesiastical education system. Inevitably, monks increasingly have lost 
      their position of leadership in Thai society. Instead of leading the laity 
      to live with wisdom and higher morality, they follow the laity along the 
      fashionable trends. Nowadays, is there any trend more powerful than 
      consumerism?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Under the Dominion of Consumerism</P>
      </B>
      <P>Consumerism is the latest ideology having a strong influence on 
      Buddhism, after western science and nationalism had already shaped it for 
      almost a century. While science and nationalism had their impact on 
      Buddhism systemically through its redefinition by the elite, consumerism 
      has shaped Thai Buddhism not through the conscious effort of any 
      individual but because of its own internal weakness.</P>
      <P>With the influence of consumerism, the Buddhist community is converted 
      into a marketplace where not only amulets but also merit and ceremonies 
      are sold as commodities. During the past few decades, Thai Buddhist 
      teachings, beliefs, and practices have been transformed dramatically, 
      taking on many of the characteristics of consumerism, as follows:</P>
      <P>* materialism: wealth, not happiness, is preached and expected as the 
      goal of religious practice. </P>
      <P>* stimulation of desire: consumption of all sorts are encouraged, 
      including consumption of religious experience, for example, visiting 
      heaven and catching &quot;a glimpse of nibbana.&quot; </P>
      <P>* money-orientation: money, not effort, is the most important factor 
      for religious achievement. Once merit is commodified, it can be 
      accumulated with the aid of money. Even religious experience and 
      tranquillity are expected from offering money as merit making. </P>
      <P>* instant results: religious services and practices are expected to 
      give instant results. Superstition becomes attractive since it promises to 
      give quick and easy results. </P>
      <P>* individualism: religious practice aims to satisfy individual desires, 
      without any concern for the consequences that befall others. </P>
      <P>The proliferation of consumerism has contributed a great deal to the 
      rise of superstition since both complement each other in many aspects. 
      Consumerism stimulates desire and the maximization of profit while 
      superstition offers a &quot;short cut&quot; to worldly achievement. Consumerism 
      commodifies as many things as it can, while superstition sells many 
      commodities such as amulets, talismans, rituals, and &quot;nibbana 
      certificates.&quot;</P>
      <P>Once consumerism spread into the wats, superstition followed it. Wats, 
      however, not only consume superstition, they also reproduce it. As 
      previously mentioned, wats, once propagators of official Buddhism which is 
      anti-superstition, are now increasingly dominated by superstition. This 
      failure in getting rid of superstition is partly because it lacks the 
      sacred in which people can confide. It leaves no room for a mystical 
      Buddha, deities, heaven, miracles, and so on. Even the ultimate nibbana is 
      pretty much ignored, if not perverted. Despite efforts by Buddhadasa 
      Bhikkhu and Phra Dhammapitaka to revive the significance of nibbana, they 
      have not been accepted much by the Sangha hierarchy and education 
      institutions. Not surprisingly, official Buddhism's influence increasingly 
      declines even among the monks.</P>
      <P>Those who turn their backs on official Buddhism, however, do not 
      necessarily turn their ears to Buddhadasa Bhikkhu and Phra Dhammapitaka. 
      Despite the sacredness of the ultimate which both teachers try to bring 
      closer to the life of ordinary people, only the few can connect with it, 
      since such connection is possible only through meditation. For most 
      people, who are not much interested in meditation, the sacred that they 
      can connect with is not the one that is experienced directly with their 
      own minds but the one that is based in faith and is embodied in physical 
      objects that can be perceived with the five senses, for example, Mother 
      Guan Yin (Kannon), Luang Por Toe appearing through a medium, or the 
      Buddha's mystical power embedded in an amulet. </P>
      <P>Wats that offer access to this materialist aspect of the sacred can 
      attract large numbers of people. The more they can adapt to consumerism, 
      the more successful they are likely to be. No example is more prominent 
      than Wat Phra Dhammakaya. A clean and orderly atmosphere is the first 
      impression most visitors have about Wat Phra Dhammakaya, but it is the 
      sacred that binds the large number of followers to this wat with tenacious 
      faith. Besides its reputedly powerful miracles, its sacred is immanent and 
      touchable. Its sacred is characterized by the Buddha's Dhammakaya and 
      nibbana. Its nibbana and the Buddha's Dhammakaya are not only a permanent 
      self (atta) but also perceivable like matter (having physical qualities 
      like cold and soft). Moreover, ordinary people (that have not advanced in 
      meditation) can have contact with the Buddha's Dhammakaya, through their 
      &quot;rice offering to Dhammakaya in Nibbana&quot; ceremony.</P>
      <P>The sacred alone is not the only reason for Dhammakaya's rapid 
      expansion. Its success in drawing people (arguably almost a million 
      followers) is also due to its adaptation to consumerism. Dhammakaya not 
      only promises worldly achievement to its followers, but also uses 
      marketing techniques to create a demand for merit through &quot;direct sale.&quot; 
      Merit is commodified and diversified in different forms for followers to 
      have more choice. Competition is encouraged between volunteers who solicit 
      donations and rewards are given to those who can achieve the highest 
      amount of donations. These techniques are derived from the idea of its 
      leader that &quot;Buddhism is an excellent commodity that gets bad sales 
      because of the lack of good marketing strategies.&quot;</P>
      <P>A &quot;Mega-Church&quot; like Wat Dhammakaya is only one aspect of consumerized 
      Buddhism. Another aspect is the many small wats with widely diverse 
      practices and beliefs. There are many wats that mix up various symbols, 
      ceremonies, and deities, for example, mixing the Buddha, Kannon, and Shiva 
      together in the same wat. This can be explained by the increasing social 
      differentiation in Thai society, creating diverse beliefs and demands for 
      different religious experiences. Such religious behavior is better 
      characterized by religious &quot;consumption&quot; than religious &quot;practice,&quot; since 
      it is driven not by strong faith in a particular practice but by desire 
      for self-gratification, or even desire for a &quot;taste&quot; of religious 
      experience for a while.</P>
      <P>What lessons can we learn from the cases of Wat Dhammakaya, the 
      religious cocktail, and the rise of superstition? They are telling us 
      that:</P>
      <P>1. Uniform or standardized Buddhism is a thing of the past. Thai 
      Buddhism is returning to diversity again, perhaps to a greater degree than 
      before the Prince Wachirayan reform.</P>
      <P>2. In the past, uniform Buddhism was possible because of state and 
      central Sangha control. The trend in the above is a sign that Buddhism is 
      becoming independent of the state and the Sangha hierarchy, returning 
      again to the hands of the people.</P>
      <P>3. Consumerism is gaining influence in shaping Thai Buddhism, partly 
      through the &quot;consumption&quot; and selection by ordinary people.</P>
      <P>4. The beliefs and behavior of Thai people are deviating increasingly 
      from Buddhist teaching and is rather more about self-gratification than 
      reducing selfishness.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Toward the Reform Needed Today</P>
      </B>
      <P>A Buddhism that is under the dominion of consumerism is not conducive 
      to the good life and a peaceful society. Instead, it chains our lives to 
      suffering and enslaves us to material things, not to mention increasing 
      social conflicts. Even the worldly achievements that it promises are 
      hardly realized since it does not encourage effort, self-reliance, or 
      cooperation. The current economic crisis in Thailand is the most recent 
      example of how its promise has failed.</P>
      <P>The consumerist domination is only one aspect of the problems that face 
      Thai Buddhism today. Liberation from consumerism is therefore only part of 
      the solution, although a vital and necessary one. The revival of Buddhism 
      needs a comprehensive reform that copes with other factors as well. In 
      short, there are three main factors on the part of Buddhism that have had 
      a great impact on the beliefs and practices of Thai Buddhists, and on the 
      quality and role of the monks during the past century, resulting in the 
      decline of morality in Thai society. These factors are:</P>
      <P>1. Teachings that became official orthodoxy;<BR>
      2. Sangha structure and its relationship to state and society;<BR>
      3. Buddhist education.</P>
      <P>Real reform of Thai Buddhism is possible only when these factors are 
      addressed effectively.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Beyond Science</P>
      </B>
      <P>As earlier mentioned, rationalized and scientific Buddhism, though 
      welcomed by the educated and middle classes, has reduced Buddhism to 
      superficial teachings, void of spiritual depth. The situation was worsened 
      by a nationalism that became religion in its own right. Such secularized 
      Buddhism lacks the vitality needed to resist materialism, and thus is 
      easily corrupted by the consumer capitalism that goes hand in hand with 
      demoralized superstition.</P>
      <P>Science and rationalism are not the aspects that should be rejected. 
      They become problematic, however, when they are allowed to define 
      Buddhism, resulting inthe rejection of teachings that do not fit with 
      materialist science or that transcend rationality. It should be noted that 
      science and rationalism can lead us to some levels of truth, but not all. 
      The ultimate is a level of truth inaccessible to them and thus becomes one 
      of their casualties.</P>
      <P>No matter what attitude science has toward the ultimate, the key point 
      for Thai Buddhists is to bring the ultimate back into Buddhism. Nibbana, 
      or liberation of mind, should be integrated into daily life through the 
      effort of ordinary people. This is the true sacred that should not be 
      absent from Buddhism, wherever it is taught, even in schools for children.</P>
      <P>At the same time, other forms of the sacred should be allowed a role in 
      Buddhism. Deities, miracles, amulets, and others from the realm of 
      superstition, if used skillfully, can be instrumental in leading people to 
      higher levels of Dhamma. The point is that they should be guided by 
      Buddhism, and not the other way around.</P>
      <P>Nothing can provide a more solid basis for one's morality than the 
      ultimate truth. Once the mind is liberated from defilement and delusion, 
      real happiness and peace is realized, with no ill-will or desire to harm 
      anyone remaining. Though ordinary people may not attain the ultimate 
      fully, a momentary experience of it is possible and will have a tremendous 
      impact on their lives and their relationships.</P>
      <P>For those that cannot experience the ultimate, lower levels of the 
      sacred, when approached with a proper attitude, can restrain one from 
      doing evil or harming others. Ordinary people that lack sufficient 
      training always need such sacred beliefs to a certain extent. According to 
      Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, unless one is Arahat, the Buddhism that one practices 
      is never a pure one. A certain degree of superstition will continue to 
      creep into one's practice. Hence, he concluded &quot;Buddhism still needs 
      superstition.&quot; [13]</P>
      <B>
      <P>Restoring the Social Dimension of Buddhism</P>
      </B>
      <P>Thai Buddhism is increasingly individualized; everyone practices and 
      adapts it arbitrarily for her or his own benefit with less and less 
      intervention from the state, Sangha hierarchy, or even one's own family 
      and community, as was previously the norm. With such an attitude, Buddhism 
      is easily used to gratify oneself or to meet one's personal desire, 
      without concern for others, not to mention nature and the spiritual 
      dimension.</P>
      <P>It is highly likely that Buddhism will continue to be reduced to a 
      personal level of teaching. In fact, this is no new trend. In the past, 
      the benefits of the five precepts, for example, were always explained only 
      on the personal level, that is, contributing to a peaceful, happy 
      individual life, while the benefits to society were rarely mentioned. 
      Though there are many teachings on one's obligation to society (such as 
      the aparihaniyadhamma, dhammas never leading to deterioration only to 
      progress), they were less emphasized than teachings on person-to-person 
      practice (like the teaching of the six directions). [14] Even teachings 
      about the four sublime states of mind - the interpersonal attitudes of 
      loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity - received 
      more attention than the principles or Dhamma on which equanimity is based.</P>
      <P>According to Buddhism, since one has obligations to oneself, others, 
      society, and Dhamma, there are teachings for all four categories. However, 
      only the first two categories are stressed. Nowadays, we do not live in 
      villages anymore, but in a broader more complex society. In such a 
      society, there are not only personal and interpersonal relationships. 
      There are also social relationships, relationship with society as a whole, 
      which is increasingly global. Peace and harmony in society and personal 
      happiness do not depend only on proper behavior among individuals, but 
      equally depend on how we relate to our own society, for example, how we 
      abide by the law, take care of public properties, and respect the social 
      heritage and traditions. Buddhist teaching on our duty to the public world 
      or society, therefore, should be emphasized (and applied appropriately to 
      the modern world) in no less degree than teachings on personal 
      relationship. (More on this point will be discussed later.)</P>
      <B>
      <P>Restructuring the Sangha</P>
      </B>
      <P>The Thai Sangha is now facing three main organizational problems, as 
      follows:</P>
      <P>1. The centralized and inefficient structure;<BR>
      2. The close relationship with the state;<BR>
      3. Distance from society.</P>
      <P>The complexity and diversity of the present society demands a dynamic 
      Sangha if Buddhism is to play a significant role in contributing to the 
      good life. To be more dynamic, the Sangha has to be decentralized and more 
      open for initiatives from monks on every level.</P>
      <P>Instead of its current top-down orientation, the administration by the 
      Council of Elders should be more responsive and accountable to monks 
      throughout the country. Their participation should be encouraged in the 
      process of developing important plans or schemes, Sangha education policy, 
      for instance. Nowadays, most of such plans are developed by bureaucrats in 
      the Ministry of Education with only token participation allowed from 
      ordinary monks.</P>
      <P>Apart from more participation in shaping various plans and schemes, 
      administrative responsibility should be decentralized to all levels. This 
      will enable local monks to be more responsive to their particular 
      situations and develop closer relationships with the people.</P>
      <P>Administration on the regional and lower levels can be improved if an 
      administrative body is created to assist the head monk (chao khana) on 
      each of these levels. Members of such administrative bodies, of course, 
      should not be appointed (the current practice) but come from direct 
      election by all monks in the respective constituencies.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Relationship with the State</P>
      </B>
      <P>A balanced relationship between the Sangha, rulers, and the people has 
      always been essential for Theravada Buddhism's health. Nowadays, the 
      Sangha, however, leans closer to the state, so much so that the former 
      became an extension, or even a tool, of the latter. Such a relationship 
      contributes to the rigidity of the Sangha, since it is in effect a 
      powerless bureaucracy under the control of a corrupt one, and creates 
      nothing but inertia towards constructive change.</P>
      <P>The Sangha consistently loses more than it gains from this 
      relationship. Unlike individual rulers in the past, modern states have no 
      heart to care for enlightenment or the Dhamma. The State's domination of 
      the Sangha (or Church) is never for the sake of Sangha or religion, but 
      only for the state itself. Obviously, the Sangha should keep its proper 
      distance from the state and decrease dependence on it.</P>
      <P>For that to be possible, the Sangha should not depend on the state for 
      its budget. It should seek more financial support from civil society for 
      its activities. Besides donations from individuals, financial support from 
      civic bodies is a necessary alternative to state support.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Sangha should have more autonomy in its own 
      administration, without relying upon the Department of Religious Affairs 
      (Ministry of Education), which acts as the secretariat for the Council of 
      Elders. Monks now have sufficient potential for the self-government which 
      is enshrined in the new constitution. Sangha self-determination should be 
      supported by decentralization of responsibilities to lower levels, as 
      mentioned earlier.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the Sangha should depend less on state sanction and approval 
      of its religious affairs. State involvement in the establishment of wats 
      or the appointment of high ranking monks, for example, should be 
      minimized. Title promotions, if worth preserving, should involve 
      representatives of people from all walks of life rather than give a 
      dominant role to the state.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Sangha Relationship to Society</P>
      </B>
      <P>In the past, wats were both supported and checked by their surrounding 
      communities. The widening gap between the wats and their communities 
      contributed to misbehavior of monks on one hand, and to the 
      unresponsiveness of monks to the plight of surrounding communities on the 
      other hand.</P>
      <P>A closer relationship between the Sangha and society can be developed 
      by more involvement of civil society in religious and Sangha affairs. A 
      lot of support that the Sangha now receives from the state can be offered 
      by civil society instead. In the foreseeable future, the budget for Sangha 
      education and administration, for example, can be provided by &quot;provincial 
      councils,&quot; the civil bodies being nurtured on the provincial level 
      throughout Thailand, to represent all groups in each province, as part of 
      the Eighth National Economic and Social Development Plan. Such bodies 
      should reclaim the responsibilities that are now monopolized by the state, 
      and return them to civil society, that is, the people. These 
      responsibilities, of course, should include promotion of religious 
      affairs, which so far has been in the hands of the Department of Religious 
      Affairs.</P>
      <P>Besides the provincial level, civic bodies should be created on more 
      local levels in order to work with and give support to the Sangha on 
      corresponding levels. Such coordination will forge closer relationship 
      between the Sangha and civil society on all levels. More support and 
      checks from society is essential for the improvement of the quality of the 
      monkhood.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Sangha Education and Role of Women</P>
      </B>
      <P>Restoration of the complete Buddhist teachings and the reorganization 
      of the Sangha must be supported by reform of Sangha education, as it is 
      now in serious decline. Ecclesiastical education is outdated, that is, 
      unable to provide an appropriate understanding of the Dhamma, while 
      secular education for monks is either insufficient, of poor quality, or 
      too &quot;worldly&quot; (offering no basis for understanding the world from Buddhist 
      or spiritual perspectives). The current Sangha education system needs 
      reform in a comprehensive way, including curriculum, learning methods, 
      texts, facilities, teacher training, and management. Under the existing 
      Sangha structure, true Sangha education reform is almost impossible 
      because it requires a great deal of energy and initiative, which can 
      hardly be expected from the twenty septuagenarians in the Council of 
      Elders in whom all Sangha power is centralized.</P>
      <P>As a part of Sangha reform, the role of other Buddhists outside the 
      Sangha should be a matter of serious concern, especially the role of 
      women. So far, less opportunity is given to women than men as far as 
      Dhamma training and dissemination is concerned. The stark difference 
      between monks and nuns is one clear example. The potential of women to 
      study, practice, realize, and teach Dhamma, clearly, is not inferior to 
      that of men. If the former receive energetic support from society, they 
      will make an invaluable contribution to the Buddhist community and society 
      as a whole, much greater than before. Bhikkhuni ordination is one option 
      for women that should be taken into consideration by Thai society. 
      However, other options should be developed, too. Creation of new forms for 
      female monks and the promotion of the status of nuns (maechi) in order to 
      win the respect they deserve from society, no less than monks receive, 
      should be developed concurrently, regardless of the outcome of the long 
      drawn out bhikkhuni controversy.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Time for New Social Role</P>
      </B>
      <P>All the reforms mentioned above can be called internal reform or 
      &quot;reform for one's own welfare.&quot; According to the Buddha, there are three 
      kinds of welfare or benefit: one's own welfare (attattha), the welfare of 
      others (parattha), and the benefit of both (ubhayattha). The third shows 
      that the preceding two go hand in hand and cannot be separated 
      Consequently, reform for one's own benefit is just half of the reform that 
      is needed, and on its own will not get us very far. The other half is 
      reform for the welfare of others, that is, of society as a whole.</P>
      <P>The predominant social function of Buddhism nowadays is in ritual 
      services, while its moral and spiritual influence has been drastically 
      reduced. The only sign that Thai society still adheres to Buddhism is the 
      Thai peoples' relationships to wats and monk, as expressed through giving 
      alms food, merit making, and, recently, attending retreats. However, if we 
      consider the relationships among people throughout society itself, we see 
      that the influence of Buddhism is actually much weaker than in the past. 
      Selfishness, lack of generosity, and worse, exploitation, crime, 
      corruption, and misuse of public properties are increasingly prominent in 
      Thai society today.</P>
      <P>There are two kinds of social relationships: vertical and horizontal. A 
      Buddhist influence is more prominent in the former, as reflected in the 
      relationship between laity and monks, children and parents, and even 
      people's relationship to the sacred like the Buddha, Buddha relics, and 
      merit. But horizontal relationships, beyond the narrow circles of 
      relatives and friends, is more influenced by consumerism and materialism, 
      than by Buddhism.</P>
      <P>Buddhism's influence on vertical relationships, however beneficial it 
      may be to individuals and society, is not enough. Buddhism must expand its 
      role and influence to horizontal relationships, in order to increase 
      generosity among people, to overcome violence and crime, and to work for 
      more peace in society. Such a role cannot be achieved merely through 
      preaching, as before, but needs to be radically rethought and dramatically 
      adapted.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Outline for Strengthening Morality in Thai Society</P>
      </B>
      <P>Thai society badly needs binding moral forces that encourage and help 
      people to live together with goodwill, harmony, generosity, and 
      cooperation, and which will make society more desirable and livable. It is 
      important to note that such forces, while weak in Thai society as a whole, 
      actually still exist in small, intimate circles of family, kinship, and 
      friends. In these circles, everybody treats each other with honesty, 
      sincerity, and love. Impolite or selfish behavior, however obvious they 
      are in the streets, cinemas, public places, and even the wats, are rarely 
      found in these small circles. In other words, Thai people do not lack 
      morality; it's just that they apply it only to their immediate 
      acquaintances. The question is how morality can be expanded to other 
      people and to the rest of society.</P>
      <P>For Thai society to have a stronger moral basis, Buddhism can play the 
      following roles:</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>1. Extending the context of morality</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>Why do Thais act morally only with their acquaintances? Mainly because 
      the morality taught in the wats and schools, not only stresses the 
      interpersonal level as earlier mentioned, but is likely to be confined to 
      one's immediate acquaintances. For example, there are the &quot;six 
      directions,&quot; a frequently heard teaching in Thailand, which stipulate 
      mutual responsibility in six kinds of relationship: the relationship 
      between children and parents, wife and husband, student and teacher, 
      worker and boss, lay people and monks, and friend and friend. (Note that 
      five of these six pairs or relationships are, traditionally, vertical 
      ones.)</P>
      <P>Such a teaching is well suited to the village community where everybody 
      knows each other. Modern society, however, is more complicated. In daily 
      life, one does not relate with only one's acquaintances, but also with 
      people outside one's small circles. Until now, traditional Buddhist 
      teaching has given less importance to this latter kind of relationship. 
      Buddhist moral teaching should therefore be redefined to include broader 
      relationships. If the six directions teaching is to be improved, for 
      example, at least one pair of relationships essential to the modern world, 
      should be added: seller and buyer.</P>
      <P>Modern people relate to each other not just through interpersonal 
      relationships, but also through institutions, organizations, and systems 
      that are impersonal in nature. Thai society requires moral guidelines for 
      these impersonal relationships as well. Buddhism should develop this kind 
      of morality; otherwise its influence in Thai society will be limited.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>2. Developing social consciousness</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>Social consciousness here means concern for society and commitment to 
      its welfare. There are many Buddhist teachings supporting this attitude, 
      that is, teachings on the welfare of both oneself and all others. However, 
      &quot;others&quot; has traditionally been defined as persons and not as society as a 
      whole. Though there are many teachings on obligations to the community, 
      community is usually understood as small units like intimate familiars and 
      villages, and seldom as the broader unit of society. Partly because Thais 
      are most familiar with relationships on only the personal level, 
      community, to them, is always confined to that which is personalized or 
      consists of persons with whom they have direct relationships. Such 
      familiar, tangible community is different from society, which is more 
      abstract, consists of unknown people, and involves impersonal 
      relationships, those that result from organizations or systems.</P>
      <P>Teachings on responsibility to community, not only need more emphasis, 
      but also need to be defined in broader terms so as to include all of 
      society. Suitable teachings for this purpose include the seven conditions 
      of welfare (aparihaniyadhamma), meritorious action through rendering 
      services (veyyavaccamaya), and willingness to give a helping hand to the 
      community (kinkaraniyesu dakkhata). Here, Buddhadasa Bhikkhu's idea of 
      Dhammic Socialism is most relevant: its ethical system emphasizes 
      obligation to the society and the good of the whole, not just personal 
      benefit or that of other individuals.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>3. Expanding social relationships</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>A moral attitude or moral understanding is but one factor in moral 
      behavior. Another equally important factor is social relationship. Thai 
      people apply morality in a narrow way because their social circles are 
      small; their social interaction is usually limited the people with whom 
      they already have personal relationships. It's rare that people of 
      different backgrounds, professions, and localities, and who have no 
      previous personal relationship, will come together or work together. 
      Social interactions based on common objectives or ideas is much less 
      frequent than those based on existing personal bonds. Unsurprisingly, 
      cooperation on a wider scale, either for mutual benefit or public good, is 
      rare.</P>
      <P>Relationships confined to one's own small circles are conducive to a 
      narrow mind, whereas expansive (horizontal) relationships contribute to a 
      &quot;civic mind.&quot; Expansive engagement helps broaden one's realm of concern: 
      from self concern to concern for others; from concern for family to 
      concern for community and society (and the world); from concern for people 
      to concern for all of nature. With this attitude, one's own welfare and 
      the public welfare are considered identical since one has developed a 
      strong sense that one is part of society and society is part of oneself.</P>
      <P>It's essential that Buddhist monks and laity support self-help groups 
      of various kinds, from Dhamma study groups, to co-operatives, to 
      organizations for environmental conservation and community development. 
      Monks can play an important role in enlarging horizontal relationships 
      among people, through creating and nurturing networks among these groups. 
      In addition to helping broaden their attitudes and concerns, expansive 
      social relationships will develop people's confidence to carry out public 
      activities on a wider scale. As mentioned, there are many Buddhist 
      teachings that can be applied to this work.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>4. Building trust</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>Trust building is one significant benefit of collective action and 
      enlarging horizontal relationships. Making acquaintances and working 
      together are direct sources of trust. Trust is also strengthened by the 
      norm of reciprocity developed through regular cooperation and networks of 
      relationships. Once a norm of reciprocity is established, defectors and 
      &quot;free riders&quot; are easily sanctioned by the public. Social sanction of 
      defectors develops trust and confidence among people to cooperate with 
      each other. Not just the result of cooperation, trust also encourages 
      cooperation, either for mutual benefit or public good. Cooperation is 
      impossible if people do not trust each other or suspect that opportunists 
      will exploit their efforts. Trust is, therefore, an important form of 
      social capital.</P>
      <P>The presence or absence of trust is not purely a matter of attitude. It 
      also depends on social conditions. In a society where a norm of 
      reciprocity is established and social sanctions are effective against the 
      defectors and opportunists, the level of trust is high. Hence, it is not 
      enough to preach to people to trust each other. Appropriate social 
      conditions have to be developed as well. Expanding horizontal 
      relationships, through developing networks of civic engagement, is a vital 
      condition for trust. This can best be done from practical grassroots 
      activities in which people work together for mutual benefits agreed upon 
      by all. The tight and wide network contributes not only to active and 
      intensive engagement among people but is also essential for effective 
      sanctions toward the cheater. In a society where horizontal relationships 
      among people are narrow, and civic engagement is low, trust is weak and so 
      is cooperation for society's welfare. [15]</P>
      <P>The above helps explain why the attitude of &quot;everyone for oneself&quot; is 
      so prevalent in Thailand today. Trust is low. So is society's capacity to 
      impose a high cost on the defectors and cheaters since they have weak ties 
      and low engagement with society. Corrupt politicians, bureaucrats, 
      businessmen, other elites, including some monks, increase the problem by 
      capitalizing on this weakness. Thus, a network of engagement and expansive 
      horizontal relationships is needed for Thai society. It will increase the 
      capacity of society to punish the defectors and thus foster trust among 
      its members. With a high level of trust, people have more incentive to 
      cooperate with others, beyond their small circles of personal 
      acquaintances.</P>
      <P>Again, for Buddhism to be an effective moral force in Thai society, it 
      needs to do more than just preach about morality. It also needs to help 
      create the social conditions required to sustain and support the morality 
      it preaches. This can be achieved through broadening horizontal 
      relationships, that is, supporting self-help groups, community 
      cooperation, and creating networks among diverse communities. For a start, 
      the monks must learn to develop such networks among themselves on local 
      and more distant levels, and then expand the networks to include 
      villagers, NGOs, progressive business people, and others.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Free Society from Consumerism</P>
      </B>
      <P>The promotion of morality as mentioned above emphasizes cooperation and 
      concern for the welfare of others. In Buddhist teachings, this is mainly 
      categorized under sila. To be firm, sila. must be based on samadhi (a 
      strong, well-trained, integrated mind) and panna (wisdom). Morality 
      promotion has to give importance to the world view and mental qualities of 
      people to be successful.</P>
      <P>Buddhism can play a significant role in both areas. Thai society also 
      needs this contribution from Buddhism, since Thais are now overwhelmed by 
      consumerism, which is becoming a kind of religion, one devoid of wisdom 
      and peace of mind. Suffering and conflict in relationships are 
      increasingly intensified on every level because of the selfish consumerist 
      world view and values.</P>
      <P>Thai society needs a Buddhist perspective to replace consumerism. For 
      decades, the former has been subjugated by the latter. It now should be 
      revived and presented in a way relevant to the modern world. There is now 
      increasing interest in dynamism, for example, the dynamic and holistic 
      nature of Buddhist perspectives. Its spiritual perspectives are also 
      needed to balance the extreme materialism prevailing today.</P>
      <P>Buddhist values such as nonviolence, self-contentment, and freedom of 
      mind are no less important. These perspectives and their value system 
      should be developed as a world view for society. They should be integrated 
      as a goal for life and direction for society, constituting a basis for 
      collective vision and strategy. Concretely speaking, instead of aiming for 
      the unlimited growth of wealth and consumption, society should take 
      meaningful happiness and a higher quality of life as its goal.</P>
      <P>For this to be possible, a body of knowledge based on Buddhist 
      perspectives and the corresponding value system has to be developed to 
      offer an alternative explanation of reality and to provide practical 
      solutions to existing problems. Fortunately, due to its emphasis on 
      natural law and experience, Buddhism can draw on the more useful 
      contributions of science in this endeavor. Yet, without creating its own 
      body of knowledge, an idea cannot develop into an effective societal world 
      view. Buddhism must be true to itself.</P>
      <P>Replacing consumerist ideology with a Buddhist world view is essential 
      for freeing society from consumerism and its source - capitalism. It would 
      simultaneously strengthen Buddhism. Buddhist weaknesses, either on the 
      level of orthodoxy or institutions, are, to a large degree, the result of 
      the consumerist invasion. If Buddhism cannot liberate itself from 
      consumerism, it has no future. The best way to do this is to help Thai 
      society be free from consumerism, too.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Dual Mission</P>
      </B>
      <P>An individual's welfare and the welfare of others are intimately 
      related. Helping Thai society to be free from the grip of consumerism is 
      the best way to help Buddhism itself. Similarly, strengthening Thai 
      society will strengthen Buddhism too. This means that reforming Buddhism, 
      as already mentioned, must go hand in hand with reforming society. The 
      latter is vital for the welfare of Buddhism because the reorganization of 
      the Sangha is almost impossible without support and pressure from society 
      at large. If Thai society remains weak, lacks proper understanding of 
      Buddhism, and has no concern for public affairs, we cannot expect 
      society's support in the reform of Buddhism.</P>
      <P>Buddhist reform cannot be separated from social reform; they are &quot;dual 
      missions&quot; that concerned people must carry out together. The civil society 
      movement, a recent attempt to create a stronger society, must give 
      priority to the reform of Buddhism since Buddhism has such great potential 
      to help liberate civil society from the domination of state and capital. 
      Reforming Buddhism is the only way to liberate its potential to support 
      civil society.</P>
      <P>This article began with the question of how Buddhism can be a strong 
      moral force for Thai society. Buddhism, in decline for decades, has lost 
      that status. Restoring the wholeness of the teaching and reorganizing the 
      Sangha is the first stage in reviving Buddhism. It needs to reform its 
      role in society, too. In the end, its new role in helping to elevate 
      society will in turn help elevate itself out of its decline and thus 
      become more viable.</P>
      <P>This double mission challenging Thai Buddhism will be a decisive factor 
      in determining the status and fate of Thai Buddhism in the next century.</P>
      <P>I would like to offer my sincerest thanks to Sucitto Bhikkhu and others 
      at Dawn Kiam for their help in editing this article.</P>

      role in promoting this orthodoxy throughout the country. Though Phra Ajarn 
      Man Phurithatto and his disciples belong to this sect, their meditative 
      style of practice and emphasis on the realization of nibbana, had no 
      influence on the official orthodoxy propagated from Bangkok. They were 
      mainly on the periphery of the Sangha and, oftentimes, were criticized and 
      threatened by the hierarchy of their own sect. Despite being respected by 
      the hierarchy later, their popularity among people was used, both by the 
      monastic and state hierarchies, to promote Sangha consolidation and 
      national integration in remote areas, especially in the northeast where 
      they were based. See J.L.Taylor, Forest Monks and the Nation-State
