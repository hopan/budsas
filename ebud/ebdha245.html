      sticks on the skin and goes into the flesh; from the flesh, it gets into 
      the bones. It's like an insect on a tree that eats through the bark, into 
      the wood, and then into the core, until finally the tree dies.</FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We've grown up like that. It gets buried 
      deep inside. Our parents taught us grasping and attachment, giving meaning 
      to things, believing firmly that we exist as a self-entity and that things 
      belong to us. From our birth that's what we are taught. We hear this over 
      and over again, and it penetrates our hearts and stays there as our 
      habitual feeling. We're taught to get things, to accumulate and hold on to 
      them, to see them as important and as ours. This is what our parents know, 
      and this is what they teach us. So it gets into our minds, into our bones.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When we take an interest in meditation and 
      hear the teaching of a spiritual guide, it's not easy to understand. It 
      doesn't really grab us. We're taught not to see and do things the old way, 
      but when we hear it, it doesn't penetrate the mind; we only hear it with 
      our ears. People just don't know themselves.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So we sit and listen to teachings, but 
      it's just sound entering the ears. It doesn't get inside and affect us. 
      It's like we're boxing, and we keep hitting the other guy but he doesn't 
      go down. We remain stuck in our self-conceit. The wise have said that 
      moving a mountain from one place to another is easier than moving the 
      self-conceit of people.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We can use explosives to level a mountain 
      and then move the earth. But the tight grasping of our self-conceit--oh 
      man! The wise can teach us to our dying day, but they can't get rid of it. 
      It remains hard and fast. Our wrong ideas and bad tendencies remain so 
      solid and unbudging, and we're not aware of it. So the wise have said that 
      removing this self-conceit and turning wrong understanding into right 
      understanding is about the hardest thing to do.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For us who are worldly beings (putthujana) 
      to progress on to being virtuous beings (kalyanajana) is so hard. 
      Putthujana means people who are thickly obscured, who are dark, who are 
      stuck deep in this darkness and obscuration. The kalyanajana has made 
      things lighter. We teach people to lighten, but they don't want to do 
      that, because they don't understand their situation, their condition of 
      obscuration. So they keep on wandering in their confused state.&nbsp;</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If we come across a pile of buffalo dung, 
      we won't think it's ours and we won't want to pick it up. We will just 
      leave it where it is, because we know what it is.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It's like that. That's what's good in the 
      way of the impure. That which is evil is the food of bad people. If you 
      teach them about doing good, they're not interested, but prefer to stay as 
      they are, because they don't see the harm in it. Without seeing the harm, 
      there's no way things can be rectified. If you recognize it, then you 
      think, &quot;Oh! My whole pile of shit doesn't have the value of a small piece 
      of gold!&quot; and then you will want gold instead; you won't want the dung 
      anymore. If you don't recognize this, you remain the owner of a pile of 
      dung. If you are offered a diamond or a ruby, you won't be interested.&nbsp;</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">That's the &quot;good&quot; of the impure. Gold, 
      jewels, and diamonds are considered something good in the realm of humans. 
      The foul and rotten is good for flies and other insects. If you put 
      perfume on it, they would all flee. What those with wrong view consider 
      good is like that. That's the &quot;good&quot; for those with wrong view, for the 
      defiled. It doesn't smell good, but if we tell them it stinks, they'll say 
      it's fragrant. They can't reverse this view very easily. So it's not easy 
      to teach them.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you gather fresh flowers, the flies 
      won't be interested in them. Even if you tried to pay them, they wouldn't 
      come. But wherever there's a dead animal, wherever there's something 
      rotten, that's where they'll go. You don't need to call them-- they just 
      go. Wrong view is like that. It delights in that kind of thing. The 
      stinking and rotten is what smells good to it. It's bogged down and 
      immersed in that.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What's sweet-smelling to a bee is not 
      sweet to a fly. The fly doesn't see anything good or valuable in it and 
      has no craving for it. There is difficulty in practice, but in anything we 
      undertake, we have to pass through difficulty to reach ease. In Dharma 
      practice, we begin with the truth of dukkha, the pervasive 
      unsatisfactoriness of existence. But as soon as we experience this, we 
      lose heart. We don't want to look at it. Dukkha is really the truth, but 
      we want to get around it somehow. It's similar to the way we don't like to 
      look at old people, but prefer to look at those who are young.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If we don't want to look at dukkha, we 
      will never understand dukkha, no matter how many births we go through. 
      Dukkha is noble truth. If we allow ourselves to face it, then we will 
      start to seek a way out of it. If we are trying to go somewhere and the 
      road is blocked, we will think about how to make a pathway. Working at it 
      day after day, we can get through. When we encounter problems, we develop 
      wisdom like this. Without seeing dukkha, we don't really look into and 
      resolve our problems; we just pass them by indifferently.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">My way of training people involves some 
      suffering, because suffering is the Buddha's path to enlightenment. He 
      wanted us to see suffering, and to see origination, cessation, and the 
      path. This is the way out for all the aryas, the awakened ones. If you 
      don't go this way, there is no way out. The only way is knowing suffering, 
      knowing the cause of suffering, knowing the cessation of suffering, and 
      knowing the path of practice leading to the cessation of suffering. This 
      is the way that the aryas, beginning with stream entry, were able to 
      escape. It's necessary to know suffering.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If we know, we will see it in everything 
      we experience. Some people feel that they don't really suffer much. But 
      practice in Buddhism is for the purpose of freeing ourselves from 
      suffering. What should we do not to suffer anymore? When dukkha arises, we 
      should investigate to see the causes of its arising. Then once we know 
      that, we can practice to remove those causes. Suffering, origination, 
      cessation--in order to bring it to cessation, we have to understand the 
      path of practice. Then once we travel the path to fulfillment, dukkha will 
      no longer arise. In Buddhism, this is the way out.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Opposing our habits creates some 
      suffering. But generally we are afraid of suffering, and if something will 
      make us suffer, we don't want to do it. We are interested in what appears 
      to be good and beautiful, but we feel that anything involving suffering is 
      bad. It's not like that. Suffering is saccadhamma, truth. If there is 
      suffering in the heart, it becomes the cause that makes you think about 
      escaping. It leads you to contemplate. You won't sleep so soundly, because 
      you will be intent on investigating to find out what is really going on, 
      trying to see causes and their results.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Happy people don't develop wisdom. They 
      are asleep. It's like a dog that eats its fill. After that it doesn't want 
      to do anything. It can sleep all day. It won't bark if a burglar comes-- 
      it's too full, too tired. But if you only give it a little food, it will 
      be alert and awake. If someone tries to come sneaking around, it will jump 
      up and start barking. Have you seen that?</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We humans are trapped and imprisoned in 
      this world and have troubles in such abundance, and we are always full of 
      doubts, confusion, and worry. This is no game. It's really something 
      difficult and troublesome. So there's something we need to get rid of. 
      According to the way of spiritual cultivation, we should give up our 
      bodies, give up ourselves. We have to resolve to give our lives. We can 
      see the example of great renunciants, such as the Buddha. He was a noble 
      of the warrior caste, but he was able to leave it all behind and not turn 
      back. He was the heir to riches and power, but he could renounce them.&nbsp;</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If we speak the subtle Dharma, most people 
      will be frightened by it. They won't dare to enter it. Even saying, &quot;Don't 
      do evil,&quot; most people can't follow this. That's how it is. So I've sought 
      all kinds of means to get this across, and one thing I often say is, no 
      matter we are delighted or upset, happy or suffering, shedding tears or 
      singing songs, never mind--living in this world, we are living in a cage. 
      We don't get beyond this condition of being in a cage. Even if you are 
      rich, you are living in a cage. If you are poor, you are living in a cage. 
      If you sing and dance, you're singing and dancing in a cage. If you watch 
      a movie, you're watching it in a cage.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What is this cage? It is the cage of 
      birth, the cage of aging, the cage of illness, the cage of death. In this 
      way, we are imprisoned in the world. &quot;This is mine.&quot; &quot;That belongs to me.&quot; 
      We don't know what we really are or what we're doing. Actually all we are 
      doing is accumulating suffering for ourselves. It's not something far away 
      that causes our suffering, but we don't look at ourselves. However much 
      happiness and comfort we may have, having been born we cannot avoid aging, 
      we must fall ill, and we must die. This is dukkha itself, here and now.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The time we can be afflicted with pain or 
      illness is always. It can happen at any time. It's like we've stolen 
      something. They could come to arrest us at any time because we've done 
      that. That's our situation. There is danger and trouble. We exist among 
      harmful things; birth, aging, and illness reign over our lives. We can't 
      go elsewhere and escape them. They can come catch us at any time--it's 
      always a good opportunity for them. So we have to cede this to them and 
      accept the situation. We have to plead guilty. If we do, the sentence 
      won't be so heavy. If we don't, we suffer enormously. If we plead guilty, 
      they'll go easy on us--we won't be incarcerated too long.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When the body is born, it doesn't belong 
      to anyone. It's like our meditation hall. After it's built, spiders come 
      to stay in it. Lizards come to stay in it. All sorts of insects and 
      crawling things come to stay in it. Snakes may come to live in it. 
      Anything may come to live in it. It's not only our hall; it's everything's 
      hall.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These bodies are the same. They aren't 
      ours. People come to stay in and depend on them. Illness, pain, and aging 
      come to reside in them, and we are merely residing along with them. When 
      these bodies reach the end of pain and illness and finally break up and 
      die, that is not us dying. So don't hold on to any of this. Instead you 
      have to contemplate the matter, and your grasping will gradually be 
      exhausted. When you see correctly, wrong understanding will stop.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is birth that has created this burden 
      for us. But generally, we people can't accept this. We think that not 
      being born would be the greatest evil. Dying and not being born would be 
      the worst thing of all. That's how we view things. We usually only think 
      about how much we want in the future. And then we desire further, &quot;In the 
      next life, may I be born among the gods, or may I be born as a wealthy 
      person.&quot;&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We're asking for an even heavier burden! 
      But we think that will bring happiness.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To really penetrate the Dharma purely is 
      thus very difficult. We need to rely on serious investigation.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Such thinking is an entirely different way 
      from what the Buddha teaches. That way is heavy. The Buddha said to let go 
      of it and cast it away. But we think, I can't let go. So we keep carrying 
      it, and it keeps getting heavier. This is birth creating the cause for 
      heaviness</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Going a little further, do you know if 
      craving has its limits? At what point will it be satisfied? Is there such 
      a thing? If you consider it, you will see that tanha, blind craving, can't 
      be satisfied. It keeps on desiring more and more; even if this brings such 
      suffering that we are nearly dead, tanha will keep on wanting things, 
      because satisfaction is not possible for it.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is something important. If we people 
      could think in a balanced and moderate way--well, let's talk about 
      clothes. How many sets do we need? And food--how much do we eat? At the 
      most, for one meal we might eat two plates, and that's enough for us. If 
      we know moderation, then we will be happy and comfortable, but this is not 
      very common.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught the Santitigatha, the 
      Instructions for the Rich. It means being content with what we have. That 
      is a rich person. This is the instruction for the rich.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I think this kind of knowledge is really 
      worth studying. The knowledge taught in the Buddha's way is something 
      worth learning, worth reflecting on. First, it teaches the way of ethical 
      living. If we have enough material sustenance to support our lives, then 
      we can use this to block the way to the lower realms.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then, the pure Dharma of practice goes 
      beyond that. It's a lot deeper. Some of you may not be able to understand 
      it. Just take the Buddha's words that there is no more birth for him, that 
      birth and becoming are finished. Hearing this makes you uncomfortable. To 
      state it directly, the Buddha said that we should not be born, because 
      that is suffering. Just this one thing, birth, the Buddha focused on, 
      contemplating it and realizing its gravity. Being born, all dukkha comes 
      along with that. It happens simultaneously with birth. When we come into 
      this world, we get eyes, a mouth, a nose--it all comes along, only because 
      of birth. But if we hear about dying and not being born again, we feel it 
      would be utter ruination. We don't want to go there. But the deepest 
      teaching of the Buddha is like this.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Why are we suffering now? Because we were 
      born. So we are taught to put an end to birth. This is not just talking 
      about the body being born and the body dying. That much is easy to see--a 
      child can understand it. The breath comes to an end, the body dies, and 
      then it just lies there. This is what we usually mean when we talk about 
      death. But a breathing dead person--that's something we don't know about. 
      A dead person who can walk and talk and smile is something we haven't 
      thought about. We only know about the corpse that's no longer breathing. 
      That's what we call death.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It's the same with birth. When we say 
      someone has been born, we mean that a woman went to the hospital and gave 
      birth. But the moment of the mind taking birth--have you noticed that, 
      such as when you get upset over something at home? Sometimes love is born. 
      Sometimes aversion is born. Being pleased, being displeased--all sorts of 
      states. This is all nothing but birth.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We suffer just because of this. When the 
      eyes see something displeasing, dukkha is born. The ears hear something 
      that you really like, and dukkha is also born. There is only suffering.&nbsp;</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha summed it up by saying that 
      there is only a mass of suffering. Suffering is born and suffering ceases. 
      That's all there is. We pounce on and grab at it again and again, pouncing 
      on arising, pouncing on cessation, never really understanding it.&nbsp;</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When dukkha arises, we call that 
      suffering. When it ceases, we call that happiness. It's all old stuff, 
      arising and ceasing. We are taught to watch body and mind arising and 
      ceasing. There's nothing else outside of this. To sum it up, there is no 
      happiness-- there's only dukkha. We recognize suffering as suffering when 
      it arises. Then when it ceases, we consider that to be happiness. We see 
      it and designate it as such, but it isn't. It's just dukkha ceasing. 
      Dukkha arises and ceases, arises and ceases, and we pounce on it and catch 
      hold of it. Happiness appears and we are pleased. Unhappiness appears and 
      we are distraught. It's really all the same, mere arising and ceasing. 
      When there is arising, there's something, and when there is ceasing, it's 
      gone. This is where we doubt. Thus it's taught that dukkha arises and 
      ceases, and outside of that, there is nothing. When you come down to it, 
      there is only suffering. But we don't see clearly.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We don't recognize clearly that there is 
      only suffering because when it stops, we see happiness there. We seize on 
      it and get stuck there. We don't really know what's going on, which is 
      just arising and ceasing.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha summed things up by saying that 
      there are only arising and ceasing, and there's nothing outside of that. 
      This is difficult to listen to. But one who truly has a feel for the 
      Dharma doesn't need to take hold of anything and dwells in ease. That's 
      the truth.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The truth is that in this world of ours, 
      there is nothing that does anything to anybody. There is nothing to be 
      anxious about. There's nothing worth crying over, nothing to laugh at. 
      Nothing is inherently tragic or delightful. But such is what's ordinary 
      for people.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Our speech can be ordinary, relating to 
      others according to the ordinary way of seeing things. That's OK. But if 
      we are thinking in the ordinary way, that leads to tears.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In truth, if we really know the Dharma and 
      see it continuously, nothing is anything at all; there are only arising 
      and passing away. There's no real happiness or suffering. The heart is at 
      peace then, when there is no happiness or suffering. When there is 
      happiness and suffering, there is becoming and birth.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We usually create one kind of karma, which 
      is trying to stop suffering to give rise to happiness. That's what we 
      want. But what we want is not real peace; it's happiness and suffering. 
      The aim of the Buddha's teaching is to practice to create a type of karma 
      that is beyond happiness and suffering and that will bring peace. But we 
      aren't able to think like that. We can only think that having happiness 
      will bring us peace. If we have happiness, we think that's good enough.&nbsp;</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus we humans wish for things in 
      abundance. If we get a lot, that's good. Generally that's how we think. 
      Doing good is supposed to bring good results, and if we get that, we're 
      happy. We think that's all we need to do, and we stop there. But where 
      does good come to conclusion? It doesn't remain. We keep going back and 
      forth, experiencing good and bad, trying day and night to seize on what we 
      feel is good.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha's teaching is that first we 
      should give up evil, and then we practice what is good. Second, he said 
      that we should give up evil and give up the good as well, not having 
      attachment to it, because that is also one kind of fuel. When there is 
      something that is fuel, it will eventually burst into flame. Good is fuel. 
      Bad is fuel.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Speaking on this level kills people. 
      People aren't able to follow it. So we have to turn back to the beginning 
      and teach morality. Don't harm each other. Be responsible in your work, 
      and don't harm or exploit others. The Buddha taught this, but just this 
      much isn't enough to stop.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Why do we find ourselves here, in this 
      condition? It's because of birth. As the Buddha said in his first 
      teaching, the Discourse on Turning the Wheel of Dharma, &quot;Birth is ended. 
      This is my final existence. There is no further birth for the Tathagata.&quot; 
      So what does it mean to be really practicing Dharma? We should practice 
      correctly. There are so many methods of meditation you can practice, but 
      the point is that it should be leading you to letting go, to cessation, to 
      making an end of grasping attachment. It's just like people in the world 
      earning their livelihoods in various ways. There are farmers, 
      businesspeople, civil servants, engineers, factory workers producing all 
      sorts of goods; and it is all summarized as earning a living. Here it's 
      the same for us; we call it practicing Dharma.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So, where is the Dharma? The entire Dharma 
      is sitting here with us. When you've gotten old, don't think that's 
      something wrong. When your back is aching, don't think that's some kind of 
      mistake. If your stomach hurts, don't think that's something wrong. If you 
      are suffering, don't think that's wrong. If you're happy, don't think 
      that's wrong. All of this is Dharma. Suffering is merely suffering. 
      Happiness is merely happiness. Hot is merely hot. Cold is merely cold. 
      It's not that &quot;I am happy, I am suffering, I am good, I am bad, I gained 
      something, I lost something.&quot; What is there that can be lost by a person? 
      There's nothing at all. Gaining something is Dharma. Losing it is Dharma. 
      Being happy and comfortable is Dharma. Being ill at ease is Dharma. It 
      means not grasping onto all these conditions, but recognizing what they 
      are. If you have happiness, you realize, &quot;Oh! Happiness is not permanent.&quot; 
      If you are suffering, you realize, &quot;Oh! Suffering is not permanent.&quot; &quot;Oh, 
      this is really good!&quot;--that's not permanent. &quot;That is bad, really 
      bad!&quot;--not permanent. They are all just that much. So don't hold so firmly 
      onto them.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught about impermanence. What 
      is permanent? Only that this is the way things are; they don't follow 
      anyone's wishes. That is noble truth. Impermanence rules the world, and 
      that is something permanent. This is the point we are deluded at, so this 
      is where you should be looking. Whatever occurs, recognize it as right. 
      Everything is right in its own nature, which is ceaseless motion and 
      change. Our bodies exist thus. All sankhara, conditioned phenomena, exist 
      thus. We can't stop them; they can't be stilled. Not being stilled means 
      their nature of impermanence. If we don't struggle with this reality, then 
      wherever we are, we will be happy. Wherever we sit, we are happy. Wherever 
      we sleep, we are happy. Even when we get old, we won't make a big deal out 
      of it. You stand up and your back hurts, and you think, &quot;Yeah, that's 
      about right.&quot; It's right, so don't fight it. When the pain stops, you 
      might think, &quot;Ah, that's better.&quot; But it's not better. You're not yet 
      dead, so it will hurt again. This is the way it is, so you have to keep 
      turning your mind to this contemplation and not let it back away from the 
      practice. Keep steadily at it, and don't trust in things too much; trust 
      the Dhamma instead, that life is like this. Don't believe in happiness. 
      Don't believe in suffering. Don't get stuck in following after anything.&nbsp;</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With this kind of foundation, then 
      whatever occurs, never mind-- it is not anything permanent, it is not 
      anything certain. The world is like this. Then there is a path for us, a 
      path to manage our lives and protect ourselves. With mindfulness and clear 
      comprehension, with all-encompassing wisdom, that is the path in harmony. 
      Nobody can deceive us, because we have entered the path. Constantly 
      looking here, we are meeting the Dharma at all times.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The heart of the Buddha's way teaches not 
      to do evil, to make the mind wholesome and skillful, and to develop 
      wisdom. These days we are all searching for merit, but there aren't many 
      of us thinking about and understanding giving up evil. On the correct 
      path, one should give up evil first and then develop merit. If we don't 
      give up evil, what kind of mind will we be using to get merit? Merit won't 
      be able to stay; there will be no place for it. First we should be 
      sweeping the dirt out. Then we can put in something clean.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If we don't understand this clearly, we 
      won't be able to resolve our problems. But there aren't many who really 
      come back to this point and contemplate to understand according to the 
      principles of the Buddha's way. But if we have faith in the Buddha's way, 
      it will repay us. If people genuinely rely on the Three Jewels, then 
      practice is easy.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
