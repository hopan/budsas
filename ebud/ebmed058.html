  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">A</font><font face="Times New Roman">s the title
  suggests, there is a significant puzzle to be solved by any meditator or scholar who tries
  to clearly understand the qualities of experience, which accompany the transition from
  mere attention to respiration to full immersion in jhanic consciousness. I will attempt to
  show that there are good grounds for confusion on this matter as one traces the historical
  progression of the commentarial accounts from the Patisambhidamagga through the
  Vimuttimagga to the (later) Visuddhimagga.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the Visuddhimagga is so influential and so widely
  quoted by modern teachers, it would seem critical that it is reliable and, if in certain
  aspects it is not, then, with supporting evidence, to show clearly why it is not.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The body of this essay will show that a description of the
  mind of the jhanic meditator found in the Canon itself and quoted in the Patisambhidamagga
  as a simile involving a comparison of mind with a full clear moon, degenerates to a
  mistaken literalization of these images as internally produced visual data. Since the
  contents of mind are not easy to point to, the Buddha frequently used similes comparing
  visual and other sense objects with mental contents in order for meditators to clearly
  understand what they should be seeking and experiencing. In religious traditions of all
  kinds we often find a naive tendency to take literally what is meant as a simile. It seems
  this process has occurred somewhere along the line and has become enshrined in the
  Visuddhimagga's description of the <em>patibhaganimitta</em> or &quot;counter-part
  sign.&quot; It is important that new generations of western meditators not be misled by
  this probable historical error.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The terms &quot;nimitta&quot; or &quot;sign&quot; and <em>patibhaganimitta
  </em>or &quot;counter-part sign&quot; are frequently referred to in this essay, and it is
  best to clarify their meaning at the outset. The &quot;sign&quot; means a characteristic
  mark or phenomenon, which accompanies and helps identify an experience. For example, the
  flu is often accompanied by weakness and nausea; here nausea would be a sign of the flu.
  Extreme joy may be accompanied by a feeling of lightness of body and tears; these would be
  signs of joy. A doctor looks for certain signs which characteristically accompany certain
  illnesses. In the same way, certain signs are characteristic of entering deep states of
  right concentration and are intrinsic to the jhanic state. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the definitions (taken from Commentarial
  sources) found in Nyanatiloka's Buddhist Dictionary, there are three types of <em>nimitta.</em>
  The first type is the <em>parikamma-nimitta,</em>which refers to the perception of the
  object at the very beginning of concentration -it is also known as the &quot;preparatory
  image or sign.&quot; When the mind reaches a weak degree of concentration, a still
  unsteady and unclear image or sign called the &quot;acquired sign&quot; (<em>uggaha-nimitta</em>)
  arises. This percept precedes the appearance of an entirely clear and static image called
  the &quot;counter-image&quot; or &quot;counter-sign&quot; (the <em>patibhaga-nimitta</em>).
  The appearance of this third type of nimitta signals the appearance of neighbourhood (or
  access) concentration, the state that precedes full jhanic absorption. Both of these
  states share the same sign but differ only in the intensity of the component (state)
  factors. As mentioned in this definition, the counter-part sign is understood as a more
  refined and clarified version of the sign and is the natural result of heightened
  awareness and concentration. By knowing these signs, both the student and teacher are
  helped to assess the success or failure of the corresponding concentration attainments.</font></p>

  <h3><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#000080"><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">M</font><font face="Times New Roman">indfulness
  of in-and-out breathing (<em>anapanasati</em>) is one of the most important among the
  subjects or working grounds for meditation recommended by the Buddha. It is also one of
  the most popular meditation methods used by past and present generations of Theravada
  Buddhist practitioners seeking to complete the noble path of deliverance. The method is
  described in a number of suttas belonging to the Pali Canon (e.g., M 118, M 10, D 22).
  However, the suttas are quite concise, and at times sparse, in their treatment of
  meditation methods. Hence, one finds post-canonical exegetical works having as their main
  purpose the comment, explanation, complement, or clarification of texts that may be deemed
  abstruse or lacking information within the Canon.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Concerning the subject of breathing meditation, three such
  commentarial works, the Visuddhimagga (Vis., 500 AC, 1<sup>st</sup> Engl. ed. 1956), the
  Vimuttimagga (Vim., 100 AC ?, 1<sup>st</sup>.Engl.ed. 1961) and the Patisambhidamagga
  (Pat., 300 BC ?, 1<sup>st</sup>.Engl.ed. 1982) are at present available in English
  translation. Both teachers and students use them widely as valuable references for
  clarifying key aspects of the practice. Traditionally, the Visuddhimagga, the latest work
  of the three, has been used and considered perhaps the most authoritative standard to be
  followed as a manual of meditation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the subject of the sign (<em>nimitta</em>) and
  counter-part sign (<em>patibhaganimitta</em>), which arise during breath meditation, there
  are significant discrepancies between the descriptions found in the Visuddhimagga and
  Vimuttimagga. Diverse written works by modern teachers mention the characteristics of sign
  and counter-part sign appearing during breath meditation. Often these descriptions take
  the classic simile description found in the Visuddhimagga, perhaps as a cautious attempt
  at not straying from orthodoxy. However, as we show below, this description of the sign
  (learning or counter-part) may turn out to be quite misleading and, as often expressed by
  frustrated meditators, unclear.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Visuddhimagga description of mindfulness of
  breathing (Vis.213-215, p.277), para.213 one reads:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">...So too, the bhikkhu should not look for the in-breaths
    and out-breaths the rope of mindfulness and the goad of understanding, and fixing his mind
    on the place normally touched by them, he should go on giving his attention to that. For
    as he gives his attention in this way they reappear after no long time, as the oxen did at
    the drinking place where they met. So he can secure them with the rope of mindfulness, and
    yoking them in that same place and prodding them with the goad of understanding, he can
    keep on applying himself to the meditation subject.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">214. When he does so in this way, the sign [see
    corresponding note, next paragraph] soon appears to him. But it is not the same for all;
    on the contrary, some say that when it appears it does so to certain people producing a
    light touch like cotton or silk cotton or a draught.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">215. But this is the exposition given in the commentaries:
    It appears to some like a star or a cluster of gems or a cluster of pearls, to others with
    a rough touch like that of silk-cotton seeds or a peg made of heartwood, to others like a
    long braid string or a wreath of flowers or a <u>puff of smoke,</u> to others like a
    stretched-out <u>cobweb</u> or a <u>film of cloud </u>or a lotus flower or a chariot wheel
    or the <u>moon's disk</u> or the <u>sun's disk.</u> [Underlining mine].</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A note taken from a commentary to the Visuddhimagga reads:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The sign&quot; is the learning sign and the
    counterpart sign, for both are stated here together. Herein, the three similes beginning
    with cotton are properly the learning sign, the rest are both. &quot;Some&quot; are
    certain teachers. The similes beginning with the &quot;cluster of gems&quot; are properly
    the counterpart sign. (<em>Paramattha-manjusa, Visuddhimagga Atthakatha;</em> Vism. p.786,
    n.58).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The similes in the preceding sections (Vis.214-215)
  represent both tactile and visual sense perceptions. The following extracts are presented
  for the reader to assess whether a mix-up came about as a result of an error in the
  transmission (perhaps an error in written transcription) based on data obtained from
  earlier commentarial material such as the Vimuttimagga and the canonical
  Patisambhidamagga, or of having taken literally what originally was meant as a simile.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Vimuttimagga (p.68), in referring to the
  &quot;discerning of qualities&quot; for the diverse meditation subjects, states that
  &quot;...one subject of meditation seizes the sign through contact. Namely, mindfulness of
  respiration. And again, one subject of meditation seizes the sign through sight or
  contact. Namely, air <em>kasina.</em>&quot; This distinction is critical. It shows that
  breath meditation is different from other concentration objects in that it is exclusively
  tactile.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visual objects may be perceived during breathing
  meditation as a side effect for some meditators, however, the meditator should remain
  focused exclusively on the tactile sensation of breath. Thus, as mentioned in the
  Patisambhidamagga (170., p.172):</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">...the bhikkhu sits, having established mindfulness at the
    nose tip or on the upper lip, without giving attention to the in-breaths and out-breaths
    as they approach and recede,...the body and cognizance in one who is energetic [in this
    endeavour] becomes wieldy,...his applied thoughts are stilled...[and] his underlying
    tendencies come to be done away with...</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Going back to the Visuddhimagga similes given above
  (Vis.214-215), and comparing them with what one finds in the corresponding description in
  the Vimuttimagga (Mindfulness of Respiration. Procedure, pp.158-159; see paragraph below),
  one finds that they are diametrically opposed in apparent intended meaning. Whereas the
  Visuddhimagga similes are given in terms of what one may find as the sign to be dwelled
  upon, in the Vimuttimagga one finds words of caution so as to abstain from attending to
  such perceptions (instead of attending to the tactile respiration sign). The pertinent
  fragment from the Vimuttimagga is transcribed in full:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To the yogin who attends to the incoming breath with mind
    that is cleansed of the nine lesser defilements the image arises with a pleasant feeling
    similar to that which is produced in the action of spinning cotton or silk cotton. Also,
    it is likened to the pleasant feeling produced by a breeze. Thus in breathing in and out,
    air touches the nose or the lip and causes the setting-up of air perception mindfulness.
    This does not depend on colour or form. This is called the image. If the yogin develops
    the image [sign] and increases it at the nose-tip, between the eyebrows, on the forehead
    or establishes it in several places, he feels as if his head were filled with air. Through
    increasing in this way his whole body is charged with bliss. This is called perfection.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And again, there is a yogin: he sees several images from
    the beginning. He sees various forms such as <u>smoke,</u> <u>mist,</u> <u>dust,</u> <u>sand
    of gold,</u> or he experiences something similar to the pricking of a needle or to an
    ant's bite. If his mind does not become clear regarding these different images, he will be
    confused [!]. Thus he fulfils overturning and does not gain the perception of respiration.
    If his mind becomes clear, the yogin does not experience confusion. He attends to
    respiration and <u>he does not cause the arising of other perceptions </u>[underlining
    mine]. Meditating thus he is able to end confusion and acquire the subtle image [sign].
    And he attends to respiration with mind that is free. That image [sign] is free. Because
    that image [sign] is free, desire arises. Desire being free, that yogin attends
    respiration with equipoise. Equipoise, desire and joy being free, he attends to
    respiration, and his mind is not disturbed. If his mind is not disturbed, he will destroy
    the hindrances, and arouse the meditation (jhana) factors. Thus this yogin will reach the
    calm and sublime fourth meditation, jhana. This is as was fully taught above.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These warnings not to be distracted may be directly
  derived from the Mindfulness of Breathing discourse (M 118.26): &quot;I do not say there
  is development of breathing for one who is forgetful, who is not fully aware.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The phrase &quot;pleasant feeling similar to that which is
  produced in the action of spinning cotton or silk cotton&quot; should be understood as the
  pleasant tactile sensation experienced at a certain point on the hand of the weaver who
  supports or guides, while at the same time spinning, a line of cotton. The simile
  interpreted in this way is appropriate in the sense that the initial contact with the line
  is felt in a coarse way and eventually changes in quality (numbness, pressure, heat, etc.)
  to a different quality of perception by effect of the sustained friction. This is a more
  refined simile than found in the Vissudhimagga, which settles for the static image of
  &quot;the touch of cotton.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sentence &quot;this does not depend on colour or
  form&quot; makes it quite clear that the meditator should not expect the sign of
  respiration mindfulness as a visual image, since it is not possible to conceive of a
  visual perception lacking both colour and form. What may be inferred from the sentence is
  that the sign is a tactile percept. Incidentally, in the Patisambhidamagga, the earliest
  and most extensive source treatise on breathing, there is no mention in the whole section
  on breathing meditation of a visual or &quot;light&quot; nimitta.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A great mystery is solved when one realizes that most of
  the images ascribed to the counter-sign in the Visuddhimagga and to the
  &quot;distractions&quot; in the Vimuttimagga are found in the earlier Patisambhidamagga as
  part of a metaphorical description of the bhikkhu liberated from the defilements on
  account of his distinction in the practice of mindfulness of breathing. The descriptions
  follow:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whose mindfulness of breathing in and out is perfect, well
    developed, and gradually brought to growth according as the Buddha taught, It is he
    illuminates the world just like the full moon free from cloud (Pat.III, 171, p.172). And,</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just like the <u>full moon</u> free from <u>cloud:</u>
    Defilements are like clouds, the noble ones' knowledge is like the moon, the bhikkhu is
    like the deity's son who possesses the full moon. As the moon when freed from <u>cloud,</u>
    <u>freed from mist,</u> freed from <u>smoke</u> and <u>dust,</u> delivered from the
    clutches of the Eclipse-Demon Rahu, <u>gleams</u> and <u>glows</u> and <u>shines,</u> so
    too the bhikkhu who is delivered from all defilements gleams and glows and shines. Hence
    &quot;just like the full moon free from cloud&quot; was said (Pat.III, 182, p.175).
    [Underline mine]</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, what is given canonically as a simile for the mind,
  in the Vimuttimagga is taken literally as visual percepts, although appropriately, given
  as images to which one should not pay attention. The Visuddhimagga, however, both
  mistakenly takes the similes &quot;smoke&quot;, &quot;mist&quot;, &quot;dust&quot;,
  &quot;gleam&quot;, &quot;glows&quot;, &quot;shines&quot;, and &quot;moon&quot;, as literal
  visual images, and also misapprehends them as the counter-sign, the mark of success!, in
  direct opposition to the Vimuttimagga.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One can only wonder how these metaphorical images, found
  at the end of the section describing breathing meditation in the Patisambhidamagga,
  eventually became literal visual events related to meditation practice in later
  commentarial works. From the evidence presented in this note, it may seem advisable to
  consider both the Vimuttimagga and the Patisambhidamagga as more reliable texts as far as
  breathing meditation is concerned.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Only in the Patisambhidamagga is the material handled
  appropriately. Similes for the quality of mind such as &quot;clear&quot;,
  &quot;illumined&quot;, or &quot;free from clouds&quot;, are treated as similes, and
  furthermore the simile images of &quot;clouds&quot;, &quot;mist&quot;, etc., are properly
  understood as impediments to that clarity. The editors (traditionally Acariya Buddhaghosa)
  of the Visuddhimagga seem rather uncomfortable with the &quot;diversity of
  perception&quot; of the various nimittas for breath meditation and demonstrate their
  uneasiness by explaining that such diversity originates in the mere uniqueness of
  meditators' perceptions (see quote, next paragraph). Neither this explanation nor the need
  for it appears in the earlier commentaries.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">216. In fact this resembles an occasion when a number of
    bhikkhus are sitting together reciting a suttanta. When a bhikkhu asks, &quot; What does
    this sutta appear like to you?&quot; , one says, &quot;It appears to me like a great
    mountain torrent,&quot; another &quot;To me it is like a line of forest trees,&quot;
    another &quot;To me it is like spreading fruit tree giving cool shade.&quot; For the one
    sutta appears to them differently because of the difference in their perception. Similarly
    this single meditation subject appears differently because of difference in perception. It
    is born of perception, its source is perception, it is produced by perception. Therefore
    it should be understood that when it appears differently it is because of difference in
    perception (Vis. VIII, 216, p.278).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I am sure many a meditator has wondered why the Buddha had
  failed to mention the critical information of the &quot;sign&quot; and
  &quot;counter-sign&quot; in breath meditation, which the Visuddhimagga has deemed so
  critical to success in jhanic practice. I hope this essay has shown that the Buddha's
  description of the practise of breath meditation contains all necessary and sufficient
  information for success.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I would add that the only sign of jhana which is reliable,
  and which applies in all cases, is the description of the jhana factors given by the
  Buddha Himself, whether the meditation object is visual or tactile. I would further hope
  that the meditator realizes that the progressive clarity and refinements of his or her
  perception of the object of meditation are simply the &quot;side-effects&quot; of clarity
  and illumination of the still and focused mind.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lastly, I would emphasize that the object in respiration
  is contact with air. The quality of the air element is critically important to this
  meditation. If the Buddha were interested in mere sensation of contact then it would be
  simpler to touch one's nose with the fingers. The taking on of the lightness of air as an
  experience of the body is critical. As the Vimuttimagga says:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He feels as if his head were filled with air. Through
    increasing in this way his whole body is charged with bliss. This is called perfection.

  LOCATION: A SMALL RELATED MATTER</strong></font></h2>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">A</font><font face="Times New Roman"> related
  secondary matter regarding the breath nimitta is, once again, a traceable
  misunderstanding, which has evolved to its final form in the Visuddhimagga. A critical
  phrase is used in the suttas Four Foundations of Mindfulness and Anapanasati, that is:
  &quot;<em>parimukham satim upatthapetva,</em>&quot; which is often translated as
  &quot;setting mindfulness before him.&quot; One is then left to wonder why the
  Patisambhidamagga, the Vimuttimagga, and the Vissudhimagga all confidently give the
  location of breath contact as the nostrils. Furthermore, we find in the three works:
  &quot;either at the nose or lip.&quot; And here Buddhaghosa, the editor, gives as
  explanation that a &quot;long-nosed man can feel the breath at his nostril as it passes
  through his nose.&quot; A short-nosed man however, feels it on his upper lip. This is a
  strange bit of business if one thinks about it, because even if one is a &quot;short-nosed
  man&quot; one can only feel the exhalation of warm air out the nostrils onto the upper
  lip. We are now missing the entire in-breath. So it seems we have another puzzle.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we look back to the original sutta at the word
  &quot;mukha&quot;, it literally and sensibly means &quot;entrance&quot; or
  &quot;mouth.&quot; If we give it this obvious meaning we have: &quot;He fixes his
  attention at the Îentrance'&quot;, the entrance being either the nose or the mouth. The
  early commentators are assuming the reader realizes that the meditator may be breathing
  either through his mouth or his nose. If he is breathing through his mouth he should
  direct his attention to air contact at the lip. It is very sensible advice really, for it
  would be a shame to have to give up breath meditation just because one has a cold or a
  plugged nose! So we see what began as a straightforward location of breath contact at the
  nose or mouth, i.e. &quot;the entrance&quot;, slowly take on the perplexing addition of a
  &quot;long-nosed and a short-nosed man.&quot; The debate over the meaning of this phrase
  came about at a very early time (see quote from the original note in the
  Patisambhidamagga, below), and in fact all three commentaries have opted for <em>mukha</em>
  as nose or mouth.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<em>Has the sense of embracing</em>&quot; is in the
    sense of being embraced. What is embraced? The outlet. What outlet? Concentration based on
    mindfulness of breathing is itself the outlet, right up to the arahant path. Hence
    &quot;has the sense of outlet&quot; is said. The meaning of &quot;outlet from the round of
    rebirths&quot; is expressed by the meaning of the word <em>mukha</em> (mouth) as foremost
    (front). &quot;Has the sense of establishing&quot; is in the sense of individual essence.
    The meaning expressed by all these words is: Having made mindfulness an embraced outlet.
    But some say that &quot;has the sense of embracing'&quot; stands for &quot;embracing as
    the meaning of mindfulness,&quot; and that &quot;has the sense of outlet&quot; stands for
    &quot;door of entry and exit as the meaning of in-breaths and out-breaths.&quot; Then what
    is meant is: Having established mindfulness as the embraced outlet of the in-breaths and
    out-breaths.(Note 14, Engl. Ed.; PsA 350-1) </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some modern teachers have suggested that it doesn't matter
  where the breath contact is located, probably in response to the phrase which occurs later
  on in the sutta: &quot;Experiencing the whole body, he breathes in...&quot;, etc. And
  since the whole body of the breath is not explicitly stated, they feel there is room for
  interpretation. But the breath as a &quot;whole body&quot; is explicitly mentioned in the <em>Anapanasati
  Sutta,</em> though not in the <em>Satipatthana Sutta</em> the phrase means the same:
  &quot;I say, monks, that of bodies this is one, that is to say breathing-in and
  breathing-out&quot; (<em>Majjhima Nikaya,</em> PTS edition, III.83, p.125; the footnote
  states that &quot;...breathing is a body because it is included in the field of
  touch&quot;). As well there is an explicit location of &quot;the entrance&quot; in the
  sutta, which the three commentaries agree on, whatever the later confusion may have been.
  It also overlooks the simile which immediately follows the explicit location, i.e.,
  &quot;As a turner or his apprentice, while making a long turn, knows that he is making a
  long turn, or in making a short turn, knows that he is making a short turn, so too a monk,
  in breathing in a long breath, knows that he breathes in a long breath, in breathing a
  short breath, knows that he breathes in a short breath...and so trains himself, thinking:
  'I will breathe out, calming the whole body formation.' &quot;(<em>Digha Nikaya.</em> 22)
  The Buddha includes this apparently redundant simile for one reason. Similes, like
  pictures, are worth a thousand words and usually survive the butcheries of translation.
  This is the Buddha's failsafe mechanism to show that as a lathe worker fixes his attention
  one-pointedly with his chisel on a single spot while the wooden spindle is in ceaseless
  motion, the meditator does likewise at the &quot;entrance spot&quot; while the breath
  continuously flows past. Basically all the commentaries have managed to preserve this
  notion in the &quot;simile of the saw&quot;, but unfortunately the mouth as location is
  overlooked by the time of the Visuddhimagga.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">All of this does not mean that there is only one way to
  attain serenity using the breath. If someone has developed a technique that issues in
  jhana and which does not follow the explicit instructions that is fine too. Whatever

  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font face="Times New Roman">he following
  is a brief summary of instructions for meditators practicing breath meditation:</font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Attend to the sensation of breath/air wherever it enters
      and exits the body. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">If visual perceptions arise, ignore them. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">If the mind wanders do not allow it. Return to only the
      point of contact of breath. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Hold attention on the spot throughout the entire duration
      of in-breath and out-breaths. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The sensation or perception of sensation of moving air will
      change to a static feeling, this is the sign of the mind stilling. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Dwell on this airy, buoyant quality, which should pervade
      the head. One should experience a cool and airy emptiness of the head. This may extend
      throughout the body. This is a further &quot;sign&quot; of increasing stillness. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Remain with this airy lightness as an experience to focus
      upon. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">All hindrances should have fallen away and the five <em>jhana</em>
      factors will be present to a degree that may be weak, medium or strong. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Refer to the <em>Anapanasati Sutta</em> for further
      instructions.</font></li>
  </ul>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I hope the above points will help clarify any confusion
  that meditators have come up against and that they may breathe a sigh of relief as they
  move along the path.</font></p>
