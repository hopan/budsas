        Center, Castle Rock, Washington, USA.</P>

      <P>O</FONT>ne way to bring the mind into the present - to ground ourselves 
      in basic meditation - is to meditate on the body and the breath. We can do 
      this whenever we get lost or carried away by thoughts or feelings: just 
      remember, I&#39;m still breathing, the body is still here. That will ground 
      you. It will establish mindfulness in the present.</P>
      <P>Emotionally we can resist this simple practice. Maybe we&#39;re looking for 
      something else. It doesn&#39;t seem important enough just to reflect on the 
      breath, on our posture, or on the feeling of the body as it is; we tend to 
      dismiss them. But I encourage you to have complete faith in this practice 
      of &quot;just the present moment,&quot; just what&#39;s happening with the breath and 
      with the body.</P>
      <P>Contemplate the body. Such consciousness allows an intuitive awareness 
      that the body is in the mind. The conventional way of thinking about the 
      mind is that it&#39;s in the body. The average American would say, &quot;My mind is 
      up here; it&#39;s my brain.&quot; In the West we&#39;re so obsessed with thinking, with 
      ideas, with intellectual accomplishments - it&#39;s all up in the head. In 
      Thailand, they usually point to the heart when locating the mind. Either 
      way, we think it&#39;s inside us.</P>
      <P>But there is another way: contemplating the body as being in the mind. 
      You can be mindful of the body just by listening or watching or opening to 
      the feelings of the body. When you think about your right little finger, 
      that finger becomes a conscious experience. It&#39;s very good for the body to 
      be allowed, to be accepted in consciousness rather than to be dismissed, 
      misunderstood, or exploited. We usually either ignore our body or exploit 
      it for pleasure.</P>
      <P>Instead, we can listen to its rhythms, contemplate its feeling, its 
      sensitivity - through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body. This sensual 
      realm that we&#39;re born into is something we can contemplate. The mind can 
      observe sensitivity: heat and cold, pleasure and pain, beauty and 
      ugliness, harmonious sounds or jarring noises, fragrant smells or horrible 
      odors. Salty, sweet, bland, astringent, bitter - it&#39;s all sensitivity. We 
      feel good or bad, depressed or elated.</P>
      <P>With the body as a focus, I have found it very helpful to get in touch 
      with neutral sensations as well. Contemplate one hand touching the other, 
      or the pressure of the clothes on your skin. Human beings usually notice 
      only the extremities of sensory experience-when the body is feeling really 
      healthy or in great pain. We don&#39;t notice neutral sensations unless we 
      really pay attention. We also have a way of ignoring the mildly unpleasant 
      sensations. When we feel slightly uncomfortable, we just ignore that 
      feeling, at least until it becomes too irritating.</P>
      <P>So this realm and this form-this whole cosmos we are now experiencing - 
      is a sense realm, a sensitive realm. We can contemplate the body as in the 
      mind. This means that you can bring it into consciousness - your feet, 
      hands, head, face, shoulders, chest, back, waist, hips, the whole lot. 
      This reflection on the body is one of the Foundations of Mindfulness. 
      Foundation means that it&#39;s something you have all the time. The body is 
      with you until it dies. It&#39;s something here and now.</P>
      <P>Mindfulness of the body is a way to see the body in terms of Dhamma 
      rather than in terms of personal attachments. We tend to take sensitivity 
      as some kind of personal thing when it&#39;s just a natural thing; it&#39;s 
      nature. Noticing sensitivity means reflecting, otherwise we&#39;re just caught 
      up reacting to pleasure and pain, praise and blame, liking and disliking, 
      heat and cold. Reflecting means noticing: this is the way it is. Having a 
      human body is like this. It&#39;s going to be a source of continuous 
      irritation no matter how much we try to make it comfortable. Americans 
      have done marvelous things for the past 100 years to make life 
      increasingly more comfortable, but we are still constantly irritated even 
      in the midst of such comfort.</P>
      <P>What I mean is that because this realm is a sensitive realm, it&#39;s also 
      an &quot;irritating&quot; realm. Something is always coming at us, always impinging 
      on us in some way. Even when we close our eyes, we hear noises or feel 
      bodily pains. There&#39;s always something impinging on our consciousness, 
      some irritation. Even pleasant conditions are irritating when we 
      contemplate them. Any sensual experience is basically irritating to the 
      mind. This is the experience of sensitivity. The conditioned realm we live 
      in during the lifespan of the body is a state of sensitivity and 
      irritation, and this implies that we&#39;re going to be irritated until the 
      body dies.</P>
      <P>But we can endure this. It is bearable. There&#39;s nothing wrong with 
      irritation; it&#39;s not bad. It is simply something to contemplate and to 
      accept for what it is. When you don&#39;t accept your experience and look for 
      something else - a way of life where you won&#39;t ever be irritated again - 
      you are wasting your life, looking for paradise in a realm that&#39;s not 
      paradisiacal.</P>
      <P>The world we live in is like this; we&#39;re going to experience pleasure 
      and pain. Society is going to praise and blame us. How many people have 
      only been praised for their entire life? Never blamed or criticized? We 
      all want to be respected, to have good fortune and success. We all dread 
      being a failure, despised, looked down on, rejected. We tell ourselves, &quot;I 
      want to be successful and happy. I want to have good health. I want to be 
      attractive, acceptable, respected, loved, praised, wealthy, secure.&quot; We 
      don&#39;t want to get sick, look ugly, lose our hair or all our money.</P>
      <P>These are worldly values: always trying to get the best and avoid the 
      worst. When we reflect on this, we realize that good or bad, success or 
      failure, praise or blame are of equal value in terms of meditation. 
      Spiritual development is not dependent on being successful, happy, 
      healthy, wealthy, or being liked. In fact, sometimes we learn the most 
      from the other side: from sickness, disappointment, disillusionment, a 
      broken heart, unrequited love, and all the rest. We can gain a lot of 
      strength if we are willing to contemplate these experiences.</P>
      <P>When I look back over my own life, I&#39;m grateful for all the experiences 
      I used to resent when I was younger. Even for much of my monastic life I 
      carried around the thought that certain things had been unfair and should 
      never have happened. Whenever I remembered those events, I still felt the 
      resentment inside me. But through contemplation, I now feel grateful for 
      the misfortunes of my life. When life gets tough and things aren&#39;t going 
      right, something has to rise up, you have to kind of &quot;take it,&quot; to endure, 
      to survive what you most despise or believe is unfair or unjust. Those 
      times-the ups and downs of human experience-have given me a lot of 
      strength.</P>
      <P>Life is not just easy and pleasant, one party after another. This realm 
      is irritating. It is a realm of dukkha, of experiences that irritate us, 
      and cause us to create suffering if we&#39;re not mindful. So this mindfulness 
      is what the Buddha expounded as a way to realize nonsuffering. He didn&#39;t 
      say nonirritation; he was still irritated by life after his enlightenment, 
      but he didn&#39;t create suffering.</P>
      <P>The way of realizing this nonsuffering is through mindfulness, through 
      watching and listening, through bringing attention to the body and the 
      breath. Train yourself to do this-both when you&#39;re meditating and when 
      you&#39;re washing the dishes, working in the kitchen, or walking from one 
      place to another. Everywhere. Just keep remembering: &quot;Where am I? What am 
      I doing?&quot; More and more, integrate the sense of bringing your attention to 
      what&#39;s going on right now rather than rushing from here to there. We 
      usually want to hurry to get the dishes done so we can go and do something 
      more important, like meditate. But doing the dishes is part of conscious 
      experience. When you&#39;re doing the dishes, that&#39;s meditation too. Don&#39;t see 
      things as obstructions to practice but as opportunities for integrating 
      mindfulness into a flow of life.</P>
      <P>Formal meditation - sitting still for 45 minutes - helps us develop 
      this ability to be mindful. We learn to deal with pain in our legs or 
      back, with unpleasant thoughts or a wandering mind. None of us wants pain 
      or restlessness or any unpleasant experience, but our practice is not a 
      matter of trying to get rid of them. Instead, we learn to accept them for 
      what they are. By contemplating the sensations in the body, we see how 
      they change by themselves. They&#39;re not permanent. They are not the 
      ultimate reality. We learn how to be patient and endure emotionally what 
      we thought we couldn&#39;t take. We can bear with physical pain, with hunger, 
      with heat and cold, with praise and blame, with any irritation.</P>
      <P>What I&#39;m recommending is not a willful practice - &quot;I&#39;m going to break 
      through the pain barrier&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not going to give in to weakness&quot; - but 
      more of a faith-oriented practice. Just observe and witness. Contemplate 
      the various sensations and reactions, physical and emotional, that you&#39;re 
      having in the present. This helps us to bear with it, to endure when mind 
      is saying, &quot;I can&#39;t stand this any longer.&quot; We can take it. We can endure 
      everything and anything.</P>
