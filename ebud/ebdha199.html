    face="Times New Roman">he history of Buddhism in the Western world goes back to a period
    before the Christian era. First there were those contacts and inter-cultural influences
    which gave Buddhism a hearing in the world into which Christianity was born and developed.
    Secondly, there were outstanding scholars in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries who
    presented Buddhism to the Western world through editions and translations of Buddhist
    scriptures and their research. Finally, certain misrepresentations of Buddhism which
    persist in the minds of Westerners need to be removed and a brief positive account of what
    Buddhism has to offer to our modern world presented. </font><p><font
    face="Times New Roman">The Buddha lived in India in the sixth century B.C. The first
    historical and important confrontation between the classical East and the classical West
    took place in the fourth century B.C. when Alexander the Great invaded India. He was no
    ordinary soldier. As a pupil of Aristotle, he deeply appreciated cultural values, and in
    his expedition was a large number of scholars and artists for cultural exchanges. It is
    reasonable to suppose that the knowledge of Indian culture these Greek intellectuals and
    artists took back to their country included some acquaintance with Buddhism. As a result
    of this meeting of East and West, diplomatic relations were established and maintained
    between several Greek rulers and India's Court of Pataliputra (modern Patna), the capital
    of the Maurya Empire. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the third century B.C., the great Buddhist Emperor
    Asoka of India, sometimes described as the Buddhist Constantine, in three of his Edicts
    (Rock Edicts II, V and XIII), engraved on rocks and still extant, declared that he had
    established a ministry of religious affairs (called <i>Dharma-mahamatra</i>) to spread the
    <i>Dharma</i> and to promote moral and religious life among the people, and that he had
    sent successful 'Missions of Piety' to some Greek territories in addition to various parts
    of his own empire. He mentions by name five Greek kings to whom these missions were sent.
    They have been identified as Antiochus II of Syria (261-246 B.C.), Ptolemy II of Egypt
    (285-247 B.C.), Antigonas Gonatas of Macedonia (276-246 B.C.), Magas of Cyrene (300-258
    B.C.) and Alexander of Epirus (272-258 B.C.). There can be no reasonable doubt that
    Asoka's envoys' or 'missionaries' (<i>Duta</i>) spread a knowledge of Buddhism in these
    Greek territories, where Judaism was already known. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A few years ago an Edict of Asoka in both Greek and
    Aramaic languages was discovered in Afghanistan. (It is interesting to note that Aramaic
    was the language of Christ.) Very recently another Edict in Greek only, not as yet
    published, was discovered in the same country. The contents of these Edicts are more or
    less the same as those of Asoka's 'Edicts of Dharma' (<i>Dharmalipi</i>) discovered in
    India. It is now believed that almost all Asoka's Indian Edicts were published
    simultaneously in Greek too for the benefit of Greek speaking peoples. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The Questions of Milinda' (<i>The Milinda-panha</i>), the
    well-known Buddhist text in Pali language written about the first century after Christ
    (A.C.), reports a discussion on some important Buddhist doctrinal problems between a king
    named Milinda and the Buddhist scholar-saint Nagasena. This king has been identified as
    the Greek king Menandros, who ruled over the north?western part of India in the first
    century B.C. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">' The Great Chronicle of Sri Lanka' (<i>The Mahavamsa</i>),
    written in the fifth century A.C., but based on earlier material, says that in the first
    century B.C. a delegation of Buddhist monks from the Greek city of Alexandria (<i>Yona-nagara-Alasanda</i>),
    led by the Greek Elder Dhammarakkhita the Great, attended the inauguration ceremony of the
    Great Stupa (now called Ruvanvali-saya), at Anurdhapura in Sri Lanka. Whether this refers
    to Alexandria in Egypt or some other Alexandria, it was a Greek city where an important
    Buddhist community existed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Clement of Alexandria, one of the 'early Church fathers',
    in the closing decade of the second century A.C., says that among the 'barbarians' whose
    philosophy came to Greece were 'those who obey the precepts of Buddha'. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Numerous scattered references like these indicate the
    existence of Buddhism in the West in those early days. There should be no doubt as to the
    Buddhist influence on the Greek world and on early Christianity. The Christian monastery
    itself seems to have been influenced by the Buddhist monachism. It is well-known that
    Buddhists were the first in history to establish and organize cenobitic monasteries. Yet,
    curiously, no documents pertaining to Buddhism in the West in those early days are to be
    found today. One wonders whether they were destroyed by nature or perished at the hand of
    narrow?minded fanaticism. The influence of Buddhism and Indian thought on Western culture
    especially during those formative Christian centuries would provide serious students with
    numerous subjects of research. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After a silence of many centuries, the West began to hear
    of Buddhism again about the beginning of the sixteenth century. Christian missionaries who
    went from Europe to the East sent back reports which understandably were biased and
    misleading, full of prejudgements and misunderstandings. But the valuable contributions
    made by some Christian missionaries in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries ought
    not to be forgotten. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The serious study of Buddhism began in the West in the
    early nineteenth century. If what follows should seem to be no more than a bead?roll of
    the names of those to whom the Western world today owes its knowledge of the Buddha and
    his teaching, attention has to be drawn to those who founded the study of Buddhism in
    faculties and universities all over the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A summary of the nineteenth century advance in Western
    studies of Buddhism must begin with the German philosopher Schopenhauer (1788-1860), who
    awakened an interest among Western philosophers and intellectuals through his references
    to Buddhism which he greatly admired. But the credit for initiating the systematic and
    scientific study of Buddhism goes to the French Orientalist Eugene Burnouf (1801-1852)
    with the publication in 1826 of his pioneer work Essai sur le Pali, in collaboration with
    the German scholar Lassen. (Among his other works should be mentioned <i>L'Introduction d
    I'Histoire du Bouddhisme indien</i> (1844) and his translation of the well-known Mahayana
    Buddhist Sanskrit sutra called <i>Saddharma-pundarika</i> (1852).) Among Burnouf's eminent
    pupils was the German Indologist Max Miiller. One may consider Burnouf as the father of
    Buddhist studies in the West.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The work initiated by Burnouf was continued in Paris by
    researches and publications of original texts and translations. The greatest worker in
    this field was Sylvain Levi (1863-1935), who discovered and published rare Mahayana
    Buddhist Sanskrit texts with his translations. His work opened up new fields of research
    in Buddhist philosophy and history. The great French tradition established by Burnouf and
    Levi is being most successfully continued today by a brilliant pupilary succession: Paul
    Demieville, Louis Renou, Jean Filliozat, Olivier Lacombe, Armand Minard, Andre Bareau
    among others, though some of them are not exclusively Buddhologists. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Among Sylvain Levi's pupils was a Belgian, the famous
    Louis de La Vallee Poussin. Of his numerous works, his epoch-making translation
    (1923-1931) of Vasubandhu's <i>Abhidharma-kosa</i> should be singled out as it is almost
    an encyclopaedia, not only of Sarvastivada, but of Buddhist philosophy in general. La
    Vallee Poussin's tradition in Belgium, generally considered as a part of the French
    School, is excellently continued today by his worthy pupil and successor Etienne Lamotte,
    whose voluminous contributions are universally esteemed and appreciated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This interest in Buddhist studies, begun in Paris,
    gradually spread all over Europe. In Denmark, Victor Fausboll brought out in 1855 an
    edition of the <i>Dhammapada</i>, the best known Buddhist text, accompanied by a
    translation and notes in Latin. This was the first Pali text to be published in full in
    Europe in Roman characters. Another remarkable Danish Pali scholar was V. Trenckner, who
    started work on <i>The Critical Pali Dictionary</i> , a tremendous undertaking, still in
    the course of production. Its headquarters are in Copenhagen. Helmer Smith, the renowned
    Swedish Pali scholar, was also connected with this dictionary. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Holland, H. Kern edited and translated several Buddhist
    Sanskrit texts, and his Manual of Indian Buddhism, published in 1896, is still profitably
    consulted by students of Buddhism. The Dutch tradition is continued today by J. W. de Jong
    and others. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Germany, apart from Max Miffler's great contributions,
    Hermann Oldenberg, working both in Germany and England, edited the whole <i>Vinaya-pitaka</i>
    in five volumes (1879-1883) in addition to the edition and translation of the <i>Dipavamsa</i>
    (1879). Neumann translated several Pali Canonical works into German. Geiger's edition and
    translation of the <i>Mahavamsa</i> is well-known. So is the work of H. von Glasenapp. The
    German tradition is continued today by Waldschmidt, Bechert and several others. Nor should
    Paul Dahlke who did much to spread Buddhism in Germany be forgotten. His house is today
    the Buddhist Temple in Berlin. Winternitz's work in Czechoslovakia may be included in the
    German School. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Italy, G. Tucci, for several decades, has been making a
    considerable contribution by publishing Sanskrit and Tibetan texts and their translations,
    besides his own researches. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Russia, Vasilieff, Minayeff, Oldenburg and Stcherbatsky
    did a great deal to promote the scientific study of Buddhism. The Bibliotheca Buddhica
    Series, founded by Oldenburg in 1897, has published more than thirty volumes up to now.
    Stcherbatsky's invaluable <i>Buddhist Logic</i> was published in the same series. In 1960
    a Russian translation of the <i>Dhammapada</i> was published. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the United States, the Harvard Oriental Series,
    designed to bring about 'mutual understanding and good-will between East and West', has
    been publishing a large number of volumes since the late nineteenth century. In this
    series, Warren's <i>Buddhism in Translation </i>(1896), Burlingame's <i>Buddhist Legends</i>
    (1921) and Chalmers' <i>Buddha's Teachings</i> should be mentioned as works which have
    commendably contributed towards popularising Buddhism in the West. An edition of the
    Visuddhi-magga, the well?known Pali Commentary of Buddhaghosa, was published in this
    series in 1950. Apart from this, a valuable contribution to Sanskrit Buddhist studies was
    made by the late Prof. Edgerton of Yale University through his <i>Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit
    Dictionary, Reader and Grammar, </i>published in 1953. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But it is England that has rendered the greatest service
    to Buddhism in the West. In 1864, two events took place that were to have a far-reaching
    and a lasting influence on Pali Buddhist studies in the West. In that year, Robert
    Childers left Sri Lanka and his friend, T. W. Rhys Davids (1843-1922), went there; both
    were civil servants in Sri Lanka; both studied Pali there; both were impressed by the
    beauty and sublimity of the Buddha's teachings enshrined in the Pali Canon. On his return
    to England, Childers edited and published his famous <i>Dictionary of the Pali Language</i>
    (1872-1875), which is still well worth consulting. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After eight years in Sri Lanka, Rhys Davids returned to
    England in 1872, and began to work with other Orientalists in Europe. The greatest of his
    many and varied contributions to Pali Buddhist studies was the foundation of the Pali Text
    Society in 1881. The purpose of this Society is 'to render accessible to students the rich
    stores of the earliest Buddhist literature'. With the assistance and collaboration of his
    wife, a woman of remarkable intelligence and of unbounded energy, whose contribution was
    second only to that of her husband, Rhys Davids directed the activities of this Society,
    harnessing and co-ordinating talents scattered in many countries both in the East and the
    West. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is not possible in a few words to do justice to the
    enormous work done by the Pali Text Society during close upon a hundred years. This great
    work is most successfully continued today by its energetic and devoted present President,
    Miss I. B. Horner. Thanks to the Society, we have now in Roman characters all the Pali
    texts of the Buddhist Scripture, the <i>Tipitaka</i>, though some of the Abhidhamma texts
    need editing more fully. In addition, it has also edited, in some sixty volumes, the Pali
    Commentaries of the <i>Tipitaka</i>, besides a number of other post-canonical works. There
    are the English translations, in some fifty-eight volumes, of practically the whole
    Tipitaka. To these should be added the <i>Pali-English Dictionary</i>, <i>English-Pali
    Dictionary</i>, <i>The Dictionary of Pali Proper Names</i> and the <i>Pali Tipitaka
    Concordance</i>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is interesting to observe here that while countries on
    the European continent like France and Belgium specialized in Mahayana, England
    specialized in Theravada. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One has only to look into the <i>Bibliographie Bouddhique</i>
    in thirty-one volumes, published in Paris under the able editorship of Mademoiselle
    Marcelle Lalou, to realize the tremendous amount of work produced in the field of Buddhist
    studies in the West during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The interest of most of these scholars in Buddhism was
    academic. To them it was a new field of research like ancient history or archaeology, and
    not a living religion or a way of life. To Rhys Davids, however, it was not simply
    academic, it was a living force as well. He said: 'Buddhist or not Buddhist, I have
    examined every one of the great religious systems of the world, and in none of them have I
    found anything to surpass, in beauty and comprehensiveness, the Noble Eightfold Path of
    the Buddha. I am content to shape my life according to that Path.' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And this Path could scarcely be so widely known in the
    West as it is today but for the selfless labours of the scholars of whom only a very few I
    have had time to mention here. Today, Buddhism is taking a new turn, and there are
    thousands in the West who try to follow the teaching of the Buddha as a way of life. Some
    discover that Buddhist philosophy combines with Christian faith better than the classical
    philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, and certainly better than the pessimistic existential
    nihilism. Popular interest in Buddhism is growing more and more. Hundreds of books on
    Buddhism for the general reader, written by both the competent and the incompetent, have
    appeared; Buddhist societies, centres and groups, even Buddhist Viharas or Temples, have
    been founded in several countries in Europe and in the United States. These popular
    Buddhist activities in the West have considerably increased since 1956, when the <i>Buddha-jayanti</i>,
    the two thousand five hundredth anniversary of Buddhism, was celebrated on an
    international scale. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This period beginning from the early nineteenth century
    may be regarded as one of the most important eras, if not the most important, in Buddhist
    history since Asoka's time. Never before in the history of Buddhism has Buddhist
    literature been so widely disseminated throughout the world. This may be considered as a
    new <i>Dharma-cakra-pravartana</i> (Setting in motion the Wheel of Truth), in two
    continents: old Europe and the new world of America. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But even after nearly one-and-a-half century's study of
    Buddhism, there still prevail in the West some fundamental misconceptions introduced by
    certain early writers either through lack of understanding or prejudice. For instance,
    there is the misconception that Buddhism is a pessimistic religion. Buddhism is neither
    pessimistic nor optimistic. If anything, it is realistic, for it takes a realistic view of
    life and of the world. It does not falsely lull us into living in a fool's paradise, nor
    does it frighten and agonize us with all kinds of imaginary fears and guilt-feelings. It
    tells us exactly and objectively what we are and what the world around us is, and shows us
    the way to perfect freedom, peace, tranquility and happiness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught four fundamental truths pertaining to
    our life, our existence, which are known as Four Noble Truths. The First is that our life
    is impermanent and is attended with conflicts, sufferings, dissatisfactions both physical
    and psychological. The Second Noble Truth teaches that the cause of all these sufferings,
    conflicts and dissatisfactions, is our own selfish desire due to our false idea of self.
    The Third declares that by getting rid of selfish desire, of the idea of self, one can get
    rid of these conflicts and sufferings, can attain perfect freedom, harmony and peace, and
    realize the Absolute Truth (<i>Nirvana</i>) here and now, in this very life. Lastly, the
    Fourth Noble Truth teaches the Way, the Path, to attain the state of peace through our own
    efforts, through our moral, spiritual and intellectual discipline and perfection. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is no pessimism. People in Buddhist countries are not
    pessimistic; they are spontaneously cheerful. Buddhist art and architecture, Buddhist
    temples, never give the impression of gloom or sorrow, but produce an atmosphere of calm
    and serene joy. In fact, according to Buddhism, joy (<i>piti</i>) is one of the seven
    qualities necessary for Enlightenment. In Buddhist painting and sculpture the Buddha is
    always represented as serene, peaceful, calm and compassionate. Never a trace of
    suffering, agony or pain is to be seen in his countenance. The German philosopher Hermann
    Keyserling says: 'The East has succeeded in what has never yet been reached in the West:
    the visible representation of the divine as such. I know nothing more grand in this world
    than the figure of Buddha.' This grandest creation of art, the figure of the Buddha,
    surely could not have been produced by a pessimistic religion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then there is another misconception, equally grave, that
    Buddhism is a monastic religion, a religion for monks living in secluded monasteries, and
    not one for laymen leading a family life. The Buddha's teaching is not intended for monks
    alone, indeed it is for laymen as well. Vacchagotta once asked the Buddha
    straightforwardly whether there were laymen and women leading the family life who followed
    his teaching successfully and attained to high spiritual states. The Buddha categorically
    stated that there were not one or two, not a hundred or two hundred or five hundred, but
    many more. Surely it is the same today. It is only a question of sincere effort. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It might then be asked: If a layman can follow Buddhism
    while leading the life of an ordinary man, why was the <i>Sangha</i> (the Order of Monks)
    established by the Buddha. The Order provides opportunity for those who are willing to
    devote their lives not only for their own spiritual and intellectual development, but also
    for the service of others. An ordinary layman with a family cannot devote his whole life
    to the service of others as a monk can. It should be emphasized that true Buddhist
    renunciation is not a cowardly escape from life, but the giving up of all selfish desires
    and interests to face life boldly in a higher and nobler way in order to be able to serve
    humankind. A Bodhisattva who renounces everything, even his own Nirvana, in order to save
    all living beings, does not escape from life; he takes all life on himself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Others say that Buddhism is interested only in lofty
    ideas, high moral and philosophical thought, and that it ignores and is oblivious of the
    social and economic well-being of people. This, again, is a grievous misconception. The
    Buddha was concerned with the happiness of men. According to him, true happiness was not
    possible without leading a pure life based on moral and spiritual principles. But he knew
    the difficulties of leading such a life in unfavourable material and social conditions.
    Certainly Buddhism does not consider material welfare as an end in itself: it is only a
    means to an end, a higher and nobler end. But it is a means which is indispensable. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha did not take life out of the context of its
    social and economic setting. He looked at it steadily and as a whole, in all its social,
    economic and political aspects. His ethical, spiritual, and philosophical teaching is
    fairly well known. But little is known, particularly in the West, about his teaching on
    social, economic and political matters. Yet there are numerous discourses dealing with
    these questions. For instance, in one of the discourses he said that a layman who leads an
    ordinary family life has four kinds of happiness: one, a sufficient income, i.e. economic
    security (<i>atthi-sukha</i>); two, the enjoyment of his wealth (<i>bhoga-sukha</i>),
    three, freedom from debts (<i>anana-sukha</i>) and four, the leading of a blameless, pure,
    moral and spiritual life (<i>anavajja-sukha</i>). It should be noticed that the first
    three of these four are economic and material. Elsewhere the Buddha said that one of the
    causes of immorality and crimes is poverty (<i>daliddiya</i>), and that instead of trying
    to suppress them by punishments, which is a futile and unsuccessful method, rulers should
    find ways to raise the economic standard of the people. This sounds very modern. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In fact, Buddhism, though it is twenty-five centuries old,
    is most modern. It appeals to modern rational, scientific minds. Buddhism arose in India
    as a spiritual force against social injustices, against degrading superstitious rites,
    ceremonies and sacrifices; it denounced the tyranny of the caste-system and advocated the
    equality of all men; it emancipated woman and gave her complete spiritual freedom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhism there are no dogmas or beliefs that one has to
    accept on blind faith without question. It gives full responsibility and dignity to man.
    It makes man his own master. According to Buddhism, no higher being sits in judgment over
    his affairs and destiny. That is to say, our life, our society, our world, is what you and
    I want to make out of it, and not what some other unknown being wants. The Buddha said:
    'One is one's own refuge, who else could be the refuge?' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Based on this principle of individual responsibility, the
    freedom of thought allowed by the Buddha is unheard of elsewhere in the history of
    religions. He advised us (in the <i>Kalama-sutta</i>) not to accept anything just because
    it was handed down by tradition, or because it was ordained in religious texts, or because
    it is taught by our teacher or by some other authority. Only when we know for ourselves
    that certain things are good and wholesome, then we should accept them; when we know for
    ourselves that certain things are bad and unwholesome, we should give them up. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not merely the freedom of thought, but also the tolerance
    taught by the Buddha is astonishing to the student of history of religions. Once when
    Upali, an important follower of Jainism, begged the Buddha to accept him as one of his lay
    disciples, the Buddha advised him to respect and support his old religious teachers as he
    used to before. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the third century B.C., the Buddhist Emperor Asoka (to
    whose Edicts reference was made earlier), following this noble example of tolerance and
    understanding, honoured and supported all other religions in his vast empire. In one of
    his rock Edicts the Emperor declared that: 'one should not honour only one's own religion
    and condemn the religions of others, but one should honour others' religions for this or
    that reason. So doing one helps one's own religion to grow and renders service to the
    religions of others too ... Let all listen, and be willing to listen to the doctrines
    professed by others.' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This spirit of freedom of thought, tolerance and
    sympathetic understanding has been from the beginning one of the most cherished ideals of
    Buddhist culture and civilization, and may be considered as the most important lesson that
    the world today can learn from Buddhism. Though Buddhist countries might have gone to war
    for political or other reasons, there is not a single example of persecution or the
    shedding of blood in order to convert people to Buddhism, or to propagate it, during its
    long history of two thousand five hundred years. It spread peacefully all over the
    continent of Asia, having six hundred million adherents today. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a complaint prevalent everywhere that modern man
    is secular minded and is uninterested in religion. This is an incorrect appraisal. Man
    today is no more secular minded or less interested in religion than at any other time.
    There is a universal tendency for people to believe that the past was the best, that the
    present is bad and the future will be worse. But humanity as a whole has gradually
    progressed, not only materially and technically, but also morally and spiritually. Some
    ideas preached by religions have been absorbed into our social system. For instance both
    Buddhism and Christianity were against slavery, though it could not be abolished during
    the time of the Buddha or of the Christ. But today, by and large, it no longer exists,
    although there may still be some vestiges of it which, too, will surely disappear in time
    to come. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If modern man does not believe in a personal god, if he
    does not accept some dogmas of the established religions which are incompatible with
    modern scientific liberal spirit, it does not follow necessarily that the respect for, or
    belief in, moral and spiritual values, which constitute the essence of religion, has
    waned. In fact, modern man yearns for the living spirit of religion divested of its
    out-worn dogmas, beliefs and mythologies. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a common belief that material and technical
    progress is unfavourable to religious and spiritual life. It is hard to understand how an
    oil-lamp is more conducive to religious life than electric light, or that an ox?cart
    should produce more spirituality than an automobile. If religion cannot live in a society
    of material and scientific progress, in a society of prosperity, if it can thrive only in
    a society of poverty, misery and ignorance, then the sooner such a religion disappears
    from the face of the earth the better for humanity. Anachronistic and out-dated external
    forms and expressions of religion must change with the change of the times, but the
    spiritual essence of religion, vital piety and true knowledge, will survive and will
    continue to renew humanity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is neither a faith nor a belief; it is a way of
    life. Very briefly, this Way - which is called the Noble Eightfold Path because it is
    composed of eight categories or divisions: namely, Right Understanding, Right Thought,
    Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right
    Concentration - aims at developing three essential qualities necessary for man's true
    happiness, his peace and harmony, and for the realization of the Ultimate Truth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first of these is pure moral and ethical conduct,
    without which no spiritual progress is possible. The second is mental purification and
    development through meditation, which is indispensable for insight, inner peace, harmony
    and equilibrium. The third is the development of Wisdom, which is not only the ability to
    see things objectively as they are, not only perceiving the Truth, but also attaining
    complete freedom from selfish desire, hatred and violence, and the unlimited capacity to
    love all living beings without discrimination. The attainment of this perfect Wisdom-Love
    is the aim of the Buddhist way of life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It might be asked: What is Buddhism's answer to social
    unrest, social conflicts? Its answer is very clear. As the first verse of the <i>Dhammapada</i>
    teaches, all unrest, all conflicts, all disturbances are first born in the mind. Conflict
    or war is nothing but an external manifestation of greed, hatred, ill-will, violence,
    ignorance born in the minds of men. Social conflict is nothing but an individual conflict
    on an enormous scale. There is no society apart from individuals, and there is no social
    conflict apart from individual conflict. If there is peace within individuals, then
    society is peaceful. So, in order to have a peaceful world, we have to produce peace
    within individuals, providing them with social, economic, moral and spiritual security.
    This is Buddhism's answer. It is clear, but enormously difficult to achieve. Yet unless it
    is achieved, no amount of treaties and pacts on paper can produce real peace in the
    world./.</font></p>
