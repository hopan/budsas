  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">One quarter of the Buddha's teaching is based
  on feeling, which is the first truth that he taught for forty-five years. It is in not
  understanding this truth that we are leashed to repetition of birth and death in one form
  or another. To a lesser degree it also is one of the four foundations of mindfulness as
  outlined by the Buddha in several Suttas. An ordinary person and a more enlightened one
  differ from each other in their response to feelings. While an ordinary person, for
  instance, would cling to the pleasant feeling and reject the unpleasant, the more
  enlightened one neither clings to the pleasant nor rejects the unpleasant. Rather he pays
  total mindful attention to both and always maintains a balanced mind with regard to both. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">All living beings, without any exception,
  feel. Not very many of them, however, use feeling as a means of gaining deeper insight
  into the reality of their experience, while avoiding emotional reaction. Human beings who
  use their mind to think and create are in a very advantageous position. Unfortunately,
  however, not many human beings use their feelings as a way to develop their humanness or
  humane qualities. There are many human beings who have not learned to use their unlimited
  mental capacity and feelings for further development of their mind. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When somebody asks you, &quot;How are
  you?&quot; You would say &quot;I am fine.&quot; or &quot;I have never felt better.&quot;
  or &quot;I am O.K. and how about yourself?&quot; or &quot;I don't feel well today.&quot;
  or &quot;I have a bit of an upset stomach. &quot; or &quot;I feel miserable today.&quot;
  Here you express your feelings but not any particular reason for how you feel. If you were
  to perform a psychological analysis you would make a distinction between feelings and
  sensations. In your daily expression, however, you use these two terms indiscriminately.
  In order to maintain consistency in this article, I, too, therefore, will use the term
  &quot;feelings&quot; indiscriminately to mean both &quot;feelings&quot; and
  &quot;sensations&quot;. It may be better to put the difference between these two terms on
  the back burner until you have completely read this article. I am not trying to make any
  neurological analysis here of how feeling occurs. My attempt is to point out how feelings
  should be used as an object of mindfulness training so that you would be able to live with
  all kinds of feelings without having a nervous breakdown. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Feeling should be used as a mechanism for
  gaining deeper insight into the reality of feelings. We know from the moment we were born
  until we breathe our last breath we operate on feelings. Feeling arises from the periphery
  due to designation contact or from the deep down our own state of mind due to impingement
  contact. As soon as our senses come in contact with their objects we become conscious of
  our feelings caused by peripheral contact. Initiated simultaneously with the development
  of our nervous system, feeling was present even as we were in our mother's womb. When our
  mother ate hot food we felt the heat. When she ate cold food we felt the cold. When she
  was angry we felt her agitation and tension. When she moved we felt her movements. When
  she sang we heard her singing. When she cried we heard her cry. When she laughed we heard
  that too. While we may not be able to recall this, nevertheless, we felt all of them. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">As soon as we were born we cried not only
  because we felt sad that we had to leave our mother's womb, or not only because we thought
  that if we did not cry that people wouldn't pay attention to us, but because we felt the
  change of atmosphere. From the warm, dark and comfortable environment in the mother's womb
  we were thrust into the cool, blinding bright light and uncomfortable surroundings with
  several people around us. We had never experienced this before. From the moment we started
  our struggle of life as a unicellular being, we have been experiencing feelings. From the
  moment our nerve cells or neurons began to develop we have been experiencing our feelings.
  When the feeling pleases us we wish to have more of it and when feeling does not please us
  we wish to reject it. This is our natural reaction. Our entire search--struggle,
  achievements, improvement, development, inventions, working hard or not, desire to live or
  not to live-- depends on how we feel. Our search for food, clothing, medicine, shelter,
  sex, heat, cold, and much more, depends on our feelings. When we feel cold we look for
  heat. When we feel hungry we look for food. When we want to evacuate we go to a suitable
  place to fulfill that feeling. We have discovered, manufactured, developed or improved
  many things because of what we feel. We create and procreate according to our feelings.
  Even our reasoning began from our feelings. All that we do depends on our feelings. Our
  reaction to any situation depends on how we feel. After reacting to the situation we may
  rationalize our reaction. All our emotional reactions depend on how we feel about a
  situation. Repeated emotional reactions to feelings gradually nourish our ego. When
  emotional reaction becomes a habit we rationalize our emotional reaction and defend
  ourselves saying, &quot;I have every right to defend my feelings when somebody hurts my
  feelings.&quot; </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When we begin to learn the universal nature
  of feelings we begin to train our minds to use it for the benefit of all living beings,
  rather than becoming selfish. When we learn to train our minds to use feelings as objects
  of our mental development, we learn more about it and make the full use of it with deeper
  understanding. When you universalize your feelings you become more mindful about not
  saying anything to hurt anybody. Nor can you do anything to destroy any living being. All
  living beings feel the fear of death. Of course, if you ignore others' feelings, you may
  justify doing anything. Most of the time your justification does not come with feeling.
  You rationalize anything if you can ignore others' feelings. Religious fanatics are well
  known for this. Some people, while putting their own religions on high pedestals, use
  abusive or disparaging language to attack people belonging to other religions, because
  they ignore their feelings. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">All these are but a few examples of how much
  you suffer from your own feelings. If you look at your feelings with understanding, you
  would not be very upset to see somebody different from you. You won't get annoyed if
  someone speaks a language you don't understand. If you understand the nature of feelings
  you can listen to somebody's complaints of pain without yourself complaining. If you don't
  understand feelings you may be very obnoxious, arrogant and insulting, and later suffer
  for this behavior. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When you train yourself to have mindfulness
  of feelings your whole attitude will change and you will feel more comfortable in noticing
  differences in the world. Notice your feeling--pleasant, unpleasant or neutral--focus your
  total attention on it without thinking or saying, &quot;Ah! My head aches,&quot; or
  &quot;My leg aches,&quot; etc. Unless you pay total attention to your feeling, you won't
  know what is behind it. Pay total attention to your own feeling and begin to notice the
  pleasant feeling behind your unpleasant feeling. Only by giving total attention to
  something can you notice what is behind that thing. If you have enough patience to observe
  your feeling, you will also notice that it is changing. You would not notice this change
  in feeling if you did not pay attention to it. It is your attention, not the word, that
  brings things to the surface of your mind. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose you feel depressed. If you pay total
  attention to this feeling without adding any other emotion to it, you will notice your
  depression gradually diminishing. Of course, you may make your depression more miserable
  and even may have manic depression lasting for several days if you become attached to it.
  Or you can get rid of it very quickly if you learn to accept the reality of change that
  takes place during every moment of your feeling. Fortunately for you even unpleasant
  feelings are impermanent. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose you wake up one morning with a
  terrible headache. Immediately find a reasonably quiet place in your house or apartment
  and spend some time quietly sitting down, closing your eyes and watching your headache
  without any presumption or worry, but paying total attention to it. Soon will you notice
  your headache diminishing slowly. But if you worry about it, you may make your headache
  worse by adding more tension or pressure to it, because you add another
  feeling--worry--rather than dealing with just one feeling--headache. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose one night or for several nights in a
  row you cannot sleep. Following morning you wake up and you feel a little uncomfortable.
  If you begin to worry about not sleeping you may have more uncomfortable feelings. Now it
  is this worry, not the sleeplessness that makes you feel greater discomfort. If, on the
  other hand, you take it easy and don't worry about not having a good night's sleep, you
  feel better. This means that you can use your feelings to make you feel either comfortable
  or uncomfortable, depending on how you deal with your feelings. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose one day you feel very peaceful,
  joyful and happy. Look at that feeling as it is and try to pay total attention to it. As
  long as you feel peaceful, joyful and happy, try to pay total attention to it and let it
  fade away when it fades away. Don't try to make it permanent. If that feeling disappears,
  don't get upset; simply accept the disappearance. Welcome it as it is. By accepting it you
  allow yourself to recreate it in your mind at another time. If you worry about its
  disappearance you won't permit it to come back. What you are really doing by accepting the
  disappearance of your pleasant feeling is learning to relax and be comfortable with the
  change in your own feelings. You cannot force any feeling to stay with you as you wish. It
  slips away from your grip. The harder you try to keep it with you the quicker it
  disappears. If you simply accept it as it comes and let it go as it goes away, you
  maintain your equilibrium and this permits you to relax. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">By the same token, if an unpleasant feeling
  arises in you, don't try to reject it or push it away prematurely. It takes time for any
  feeling to go away. You have to cultivate patience with unpleasant feelings as well. If
  you lose your patience with it, you lose the pleasantness that can follow the
  unpleasantness, and even magnify it. When you &quot;take it easy&quot;, you make things
  simple and more comfortable for yourself. Simply pay total attention to your unpleasant
  feeling. You may have certain unpleasant feelings due to a chemical imbalance in your
  brain. You must admit that whether you like it or not, things in your body and mind change
  all the time. If you experience certain unpleasant sensations due to a change in hormone
  balance, you may prolong the imbalance by worrying or by being impatient. If you relax and
  pay total attention to the hormone imbalance your mind generates better and more positive
  hormones to transcend the imbalanced state. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Inadvertently, you cultivate a certain mental
  attitude towards numerous things and persons. This attitude can cause you pleasant or
  unpleasant feelings. When you mindfully look at your own state of mind, you will see that
  it is your own attitude that has created that state of mind which results in one feeling
  or another. Feeling does not come from the object that you perceive but from your own
  state or mental attitude. This is why when several people look at the same object they can
  have several different feelings, several different opinions about the object. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">If you mindfully watch your own mind and
  feelings, you can see very clearly and unequivocally that what you feel is your own
  creation and that you are totally responsible for it. Mindfully watching the continuous
  change of your own feelings can make you abstain from emotional reactions and make you see
  the truth of your own feelings. Mindfulness of feelings will not cause you to think
  obsessive thoughts or abusive thoughts or harmful thoughts. By unmindful thinking you
  abuse your mind. The abused mind always generates abusive feelings, which always is
  painful. </font></p>
