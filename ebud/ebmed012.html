<P>
The aim of this booklet is to serve as an introduction to the
practice of Insight Meditation as taught within the tradition
of  Theravada Buddhism.  You need not be familiar with the teachings
of the Buddha to make use of it, although such knowledge can help
to clarify any personal understanding you may develop through
meditation.
<P>
The purpose of Insight Meditation is not to create a system of
beliefs, but rather to give guidance on how to see clearly into
the nature of the mind.  In this way one gains first-hand understanding
of the way things are, without reliance on opinions or theories
-- a direct experience, which has its own vitality.  It also gives
rise to the sense of deep calm that comes from knowing something
for oneself, beyond any doubt.
<P>
Insight Meditation is a key factor in the path that the Buddha
offered for the welfare of human beings; the only criterion is
that one has to put it into practice!  These pages, therefore,
describe a series of meditation exercises, and practical advice
on how to use them.  It works best if the reader follows the guide
progressively, giving each sequence of instructions a good work-out
before proceeding further.
<P>
The term &quot;Insight Meditation&quot; (<B>samatha-vipassana</B>)
refers to practices for the mind that develop calm (<B>samatha</B>)
through sustained attention, and insight (<B>vipassana</B>) through
reflection.  A fundamental technique for sustaining attention
is focusing awareness on the body; traditionally, this is practised
while sitting or walking.  The guide begins with some advice on
this.
<P>
Reflection occurs quite naturally afterwards, when one is &quot;comfortable&quot;
within the context of the meditation exercise.  There will be
a sense of ease and interest, and one begins to look around and
become acquainted with the mind that is meditating.  This &quot;looking
around&quot; is called contemplation, a personal and direct seeing
that can only be suggested by any technique.  A few ideas and
guidance on this come in a later section.
<P>
<I>(It should be noted that knowledge of terms in Pali -- the
canonical language of Theravada Buddhism -- is not necessary to
begin the practice of meditation.  It can be useful, however,
to provide reference points to the large source of guidance in
the Theravada Canon, as well as to the teaching of many contemporary
masters who still find such words more precise than their English
equivalents.)<BR>
</I>
<H1 align=right>1.  Sustaining Attention</H1>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#800080>SITTING</FONT></H2>
<H3>Time and Place</H3>

<P>
Focusing the mind on the body can be readily accomplished while
sitting.  You need to find a time and a place which affords you
calm and freedom from disturbance.
<P>
A quiet room with not much in it to distract the mind is ideal;
a setting with light and space has a brightening and clearing
effect, while a cluttered and gloomy room has just the opposite.
 Timing is also important, particularly as most people's days
are quite structured with routines.  It is not especially productive
to meditate when you have something else to do, or when you're
pressed for time.  It's better to set aside a period -- say, in
the early morning or in the evening after work -- when you can
really give your full attention to the practice.  Begin with fifteen
minutes or so.  Practise sincerely with the limitations of time
and available energy, and avoid becoming mechanical about the
routine.  Meditation practice, supported by genuine willingness
to investigate and make peace with oneself, will develop naturally
in terms of duration and skill.
<H3>Awareness of the body</H3>

<P>
The development of calm is aided by stability, and by a steady
but peaceful effort.  If you can't feel settled, there's no peacefulness;
if there's no sense of application, you tend to day-dream.  One
of the most effective postures for the cultivation of the proper
combination of stillness and energy is sitting.
<P>
Use a posture that will keep your back straight without strain.
 A simple upright chair may be helpful, or you may be able to
use one of the lotus postures (See the &quot; <a href="#posture">Notes on Posture</a>&quot;).
These look awkward at first, but in time they can provide a unique
balance of gentle firmness that gladdens the mind without tiring
the body.
<P>
If the chin is tilted very slightly down this will help, but do
not allow the head to loll forward as this encourages drowsiness.
 Place the hands on your lap, palms upwards, one gently resting
on the other with the thumb-tips touching.  Take your time, and
get the right balance.
<P>
Now, collect your attention, and begin to move it slowly down
your body.  Notice the sensations.  Relax any tensions, particularly
in the face, neck and hands.  Allow the eyelids to close or half
close.
<P>
Investigate how you are feeling.  Expectant or tense?  Then relax
your attention a little.  With this, the mind will probably calm
down, and you may find some thoughts drifting in -- reflections,
daydreams, memories, or doubts about whether you are doing it
right!  Instead of following or contending with these thought
patterns, bring more attention to the body, which is a useful
anchor for a wandering mind.
<P>
Cultivate a spirit of inquiry in your meditation attitude.  Take
your time.  Move your attention, for example, systematically from
the crown of the head down over the whole body.  Notice the different
sensations -- such as warmth, pulsing, numbness, and sensitivity
-- in the joints of each finger, the moisture of the palms, and
the pulse in the wrist.  Even areas that may have no particular
sensation, such as the forearms or the earlobes, can be &quot;swept
over&quot; in an attentive way.  Notice how even the lack of sensation
is something the mind can be aware of.  This constant and sustained
investigation is called mindfulness (<B>sati</B>) and is one of
the primary tools of Insight Meditation.
<H3>Mindfulness of breathing (anapanasati)</H3>

<P>
Instead of &quot;body sweeping&quot;, or after a preliminary period
of this practice, mindfulness can be developed through attention
on the breath.
<P>
First, follow the sensation of your ordinary breath as it flows
in through the nostrils and fills the chest and abdomen.  Then
try maintaining your attention at one point, either at the diaphragm
or -- a more refined location -- at the nostrils.  Breath has
a tranquillising quality, steady and relaxing if you don't force
it; this is helped by an upright posture.  Your mind may wander,
but keep patiently returning to the breath.
<P>
It is not necessary to develop concentration to the point of excluding
everything else except the breath.  Rather than to create a trance,
the purpose here is to allow you to notice the workings of the
mind, and to bring a measure of peaceful clarity into it.  The
entire process -- gathering your attention, noticing the breath,
noticing that the mind has wandered, and re-establishing your
attention -- develops mindfulness, patience and insightful understanding.
 So don't be put off by apparent &quot;failure&quot; -- simply
begin again.  Continuing in this way allows the mind eventually
to calm down.
<P>
If you get very restless or agitated, just relax.  Practise being
at peace with yourself, listening to -- without necessarily believing
in -- the voices of the mind.
<P>
If you feet drowsy, then put more care and attention into your
body and posture.  Refining your attention or pursuing tranquillity
at such times will only make matters worse!
<H2><FONT COLOR=#800080>WALKING AND STANDING</FONT></H2>

<P>
Many meditation exercises, such as the above &quot;mindfulness
of breathing&quot;, are practised while sitting.  However, walking
is commonly alternated with sitting as a form for meditation.
 Apart from giving you different things to notice, it's a skilful
way to energise the practice if the calming effect of sitting
is making you dull.
<P>
If you have access to some open land, measure off about 25-30
paces' length of level ground (or a clearly defined pathway between
two trees), as your meditation path.  Stand at one end of the
path, and compose your mind on the sensations of the body.  First,
let the attention rest on the feeling of the body standing upright,
with the arms hanging naturally and the hands lightly clasped
in front or behind.  Allow the eyes to gaze at a point about three
metres in front of you at ground level, thus avoiding visual distraction.
 Now, walk gently, at a deliberate but &quot;normal&quot; pace,
to the end of the path.  Stop.  Focus on the body standing for
the period of a couple of breaths.  Turn, and walk back again.
 While walking, be aware of the general flow of physical sensations,
or more closely direct your attention to the feet.  The exercise
for the mind is to keep bringing its attention back to the sensation
of the feet touching the ground, the spaces between each step,
and the feelings of stopping and starting.
<P>
Of course, the mind will wander.  So it is important to cultivate
patience, and the resolve to begin again.  Adjust the pace to
suit your state of mind -- vigorous when drowsy or trapped in
obsessive thought, firm but gentle when restless and impatient.
 At the end of the path, stop; breathe in and out; &quot;let go&quot;
of any restlessness, worry, calm, bliss, memories or opinions
about yourself.  The &quot;inner chatter&quot; may stop momentarily,
or fade out.  Begin again.  In this way you continually refresh
the mind, and allow it to settle at its own rate.
<P>
In more confined spaces, alter the length of the path to suit
what is available.  Alternatively, you can circumambulate a room,
pausing after each circumambulation for a few moments of standing.
 This period of standing can be extended to several minutes, using
&quot;body sweeping&quot;.
<P>
Walking brings energy and fluidity into the practice, so keep
your pace steady and just let changing conditions pass through
the mind.  Rather than expecting the mind to be as still as it
might be while sitting, contemplate the flow of phenomena.  It
is remarkable how many times we can become engrossed in a train
of thought -- arriving at the end of the path and &quot;coming
to&quot; with a start! -- but it is natural for our untrained
minds to become absorbed in thoughts and moods.  So instead of
giving in to impatience, learn how to let go, and begin again.
 A sense of ease and calm may then arise, allowing the mind to
become open and clear in a natural, unforced way.
<H2><FONT COLOR=#800080>LYING DOWN</FONT></H2>

<P>
Reclining at the end of a day, spend a few minutes meditating
while lying on one side.  Keep the body quite straight and bend
one arm up so that the hand acts as a support for the head.  Sweep
through the body, resting its stresses; or collect your attention
on the breath, consciously putting aside memories of the day just
past and expectations of tomorrow.  In a few minutes, with your
mind clear, you'll be able to rest well.

<a name="heart"><H2><FONT COLOR=#800080>CULTIVATING THE HEART</FONT></H2></a>
<P>
Cultivating good-will (metta) gives another dimension to the practice
of Insight.  Meditation naturally teaches patience and tolerance,
or at least it shows the importance of these qualities.  So you
may well wish to develop a more friendly and caring attitude towards
yourself and other people.  In meditation, you can cultivate good-will
very realistically.
<P>
Focus attention on the breath, which you will now be using as
the means of spreading kindness and good-will.  Begin with yourself,
with your body.  Visualise the breath as a light, or see your
awareness as being a warm ray, and gradually sweep it over your
body.  Lightly focus your attention on the centre of the chest,
around the heart region.  As you breathe in, direct patient kindness
towards yourself, perhaps with the thought, &quot;May I be well&quot;,
or &quot;Peace&quot;.  As you breathe out, let the mood of that
thought, or the awareness of light, spread outwards from the heart,
through the body, through the mind, and beyond yourself.  &quot;May
others be well.&quot;
<P>
If you are experiencing negative states of mind, breathe in the
qualities of tolerance and forgiveness.  Visualising the breath
as having a healing colour may be helpful.  On the out-breath,
let go -- of any stress, worry or negativity -- and extend the
sense of release through the body, the mind, and beyond, as before.
<P>
This practice can form all or part of a period of meditation --
you have to judge for yourself what is appropriate.  The calming
effect of meditating with a kindly attitude is good for beginning
a sitting, but there will no doubt be times to use this approach
for long periods, to go deeply into the heart.
<P>
Always begin with what you are aware of, even if it seems trivial
or confused.  Let your mind rest calmly on that -- whether it's
boredom, an aching knee, or the frustration of not feeling particularly
kindly.  Allow these to be; practise being at peace with them.
 Recognise and gently put aside any tendencies towards laziness,
doubt or guilt.
<P>
Peacefulness can develop into a very nourishing kindness towards
yourself, if you first of all fully accept the presence of what
you dislike.  Keep the attention steady, and open the heart to
whatever you experience.  This does not imply approval of negative
states, but allows them a space wherein they can come and go.
<P>
Generating good-will toward the world beyond yourself follows
much the same pattern.  A simple way to spread kindness is to
work in stages.  Start with yourself, joining the sense of loving
acceptance to the movement of the breath.  &quot;May I be well.&quot;
Then, reflect on people you love and respect, and wish them well,
one by one.  Move on to friendly acquaintances, then to those
towards whom you feel indifferent.  &quot;May they be well.&quot;
Finally, bring to mind those people you fear or dislike, and continue
to send out wishes of good-will.
<P>
This meditation can expand, in a movement of compassion, to include
all people in the world, in their many circumstances.  And remember,
you don't have to feel that you love everyone in order to wish
them well!
<P>
Kindness and compassion originate from the same source of good
will, and they broaden the mind beyond the purely personal perspective.
 If you're not always trying to make things go the way you want
them to; if you're more accepting and receptive to yourself and
others as they are, compassion arises by itself.  Compassion is
the natural sensitivity of the heart.

<H1 align=right>2.  Reflection</H1>

<H2><FONT COLOR=#800080>CHOICELESS AWARENESS</FONT></H2>

<P>
Meditation can also proceed without a meditation object, in a
state of pure contemplation, or &quot;choiceless awareness&quot;.
<P>
After calming the mind by one of the methods described above,
consciously put aside the meditation object.  Observe the flow
of mental images and sensations just as they arise, without engaging
in criticism or praise.  Notice any aversion and fascination;
contemplate any uncertainty, happiness, restlessness or tranquillity
as it arises.  You can return to a meditation object (such as
the breath). whenever the sense of clarity diminishes, or if you
begin to feel overwhelmed by impressions.  When a sense of steadiness
returns, you can relinquish the object again.
<P>
This practice of &quot;bare attention&quot; is well-suited for
contemplating the mental process.  Along with observing the mind's
particular &quot;ingredients&quot;, we can turn our attention
to the nature of the container.  As for the contents of the mind,
Buddhist teaching points especially to three simple, fundamental
characteristics.
<P>
First, there is changeability (<B>anicca</B>) - the ceaseless
beginning and ending all things go through, the constant movement
of the content of the mind.  This mind-stuff may be pleasant or
unpleasant, but it is never at rest.
<P>
There is also a persistent, often subtle, sense of dissatisfaction
(<B>dukkha</B>).  Unpleasant sensations easily evoke that sense,
but even a lovely experience creates a tug in the heart when it
ends.  So at the best of moments there is still an inconclusive
quality in what the mind experiences, a somewhat unsatisfied feeling.
<P>
As the constant arising and passing of experiences and moods become
familiar, it also becomes clear that -- since there is no permanence
in them -- none of them really belong to you.  And, when this
mind-stuff is silent -- revealing a bright spaciousness of mind
-- there are no purely personal characteristics to be found! 
This can be difficult to comprehend, but in reality there is no
&quot;me&quot; and no &quot;mine&quot;-- the characteristic of
&quot;no-self&quot;, or impersonality (<B>anatta</B>).
<P>
Investigate fully and notice how these qualities pertain to all
things, physical and mental.  No matter if your experiences are
joyful or barely endurable, this contemplation will lead to a
calm and balanced perspective on your life.
<H2><FONT COLOR=#800080>CONTEMPLATING YOUR PRACTICE</FONT></H2>

<P>
These meditation exercises all serve to establish awareness of
things as they are.  By bringing your mind fully onto experiences,
you will notice more clearly the state of the mind itself -- for
example, whether you are being lazy or over-eager in your practice.
 With a little honest appraisal, it becomes evident that the quality
of the meditation practice depends, not on the exercise being
used, but on what you are putting into it.  Reflecting in this
way, you will gain deeper insight into your personality and habits.
<P>
There are some useful points to bear in mind whenever you meditate.
 Consider whether you are beginning afresh each time -- or even
better, with each breath or footstep.  If you don't practise with
an open mind, you may find yourself trying to recreate a past
insight, or unwilling to learn from your mistakes.  Is there the
right balance of energy whereby you are doing all that you can
without being over-forceful?  Are you keeping in touch with what
is actually happening in your mind, or using a technique in a
dull, mechanical way?  As for concentration, it's good to check
whether you are putting aside concerns that are not immediate,
or letting yourself meander in thoughts and moods. Or, are you
trying to repress feelings without acknowledging them and responding
wisely?
<P>
Proper concentration is that which unifies the heart and mind.
 Reflecting in this way encourages you to develop a skilful approach.
 And of course, reflection will show you more than how to meditate:
it will give you the clarity to understand yourself.
<P>
Remember, until you've developed some skill and case with meditation,
it's best to use a meditation object, such as the breath, as a
focus for awareness and as an antidote for the overwhelming nature
of the mind's distractions.  Even so, whatever your length of
experience with the practice, it is always helpful to return to
awareness of the breath or body.  Developing this ability to begin
again leads to stability and case.  With a balanced practice,
you realise more and more the way the body and mind are, and see
how to live with greater freedom and harmony.  This is the purpose
and the fruit of Insight Meditation.
<H2><FONT COLOR=#800080>LIVING INSIGHTFULLY</FONT></H2>

<P>
With the practice of Insight Meditation you will see your attitudes
more clearly, and come to know which are helpful and which create
difficulties.  An open attitude can make even unpleasant experiences
insightful -- for instance, understanding the way that the mind
reacts against pain or sickness.  When you approach such experiences
in this way, you can often unwind the stress and resistance to
pain, and alleviate it to a great degree.  On the other hand,
an impatient streak will have different results: becoming annoyed
with others if they disturb your meditation; being disappointed
if your practice doesn't seem to be progressing fast enough; falling
into unpleasant moods over insignificant matters.  Meditation
teaches us that peace of mind -- or its absence -- essentially
depends on whether or not we contemplate the events of life in
a spirit of reflection and open-mindedness.
<P>
By looking into your intentions and attitudes in the quiet of
meditation, you can investigate the relationship between desire
and dissatisfaction.  See the causes of discontent: wanting what
you don't have; rejecting what you dislike; being unable to keep
what you want.  This is especially oppressive when the subject
of the discontent and desire is yourself.  No-one finds it easy
to be at peace with personal weakness, especially when so much
social emphasis is placed on feeling good, getting ahead and having
the best.  Such expectations indeed make it difficult to accept
oneself as one is.
<P>
However, with the practice of insight meditation, you discover
a space in which to stand back a little from what you think you
are, from what you think you have.  Contemplating these perceptions,
it becomes clearer that you don't have any thing as &quot;me&quot;
or &quot;mine&quot;; there are simply experiences, which come
and go through the mind.  So if, for example, you're looking into
an irritating habit, rather than becoming depressed by it, you
don't reinforce it and the habit passes away.  It may come back
again, but this time it's weaker, and you know what to do.  Through
cultivating peaceful attention, mental content calms down and
may even fade out, leaving the mind clear and refreshed.  Such
is the ongoing path of insight.
<P>
To be able to go to a still centre of awareness within the changing
flow of daily life is the sign of a mature practice, for insight
deepens immeasurably when it is able to spread to all experience.
 Try to use the perspective of insight no matter what you are
doing -- routine housework, driving the car, having a cup of tea.
 Collect the awareness, rest it steadily on what you are doing,
and rouse a sense of inquiry into the nature of the mind in the
mist of activity.  Using the practice to centre on physical sensations,
mental states, or eye-, ear- or nose-consciousness can develop
an ongoing contemplation that turns mundane tasks into foundations
for insight.
<P>
Centred more and more in awareness, the mind becomes free to respond
skilfully to the moment, and there is greater harmony in life.
 This is the way that meditation does &quot;social work&quot;--
by bringing awareness into your life, it brings peace into the
world.  When you can abide peacefully with the great variety of
feelings that arise in consciousness, you are able to live more
open[y with the world, and with yourself as you are.

<H1 align=right>3.  Further Suggestions</H1>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#800080>PERSONAL CONDUCT</FONT></H2>
<P>
As our insight deepens, we see more clearly the results of our
actions -- the peace that good intention, sincerity and clear-mindedness
promote, and the trouble that confusion and carelessness create.
It is this greater sensitivity, observing in particular the distress
we cause ourselves and others, that often inspires us to want
to live more wisely.  For true peace of mind, it is indispensable
that formal meditation be combined with a commitment to responsibility,
and with care for oneself and others.
<P>
There is really nothing mysterious about the path of  Insight.
 In the words of the Buddha, the way is simple: &quot;<B>Do good,
refrain from doing evil, and purify the mind</B>&quot;. It is
a long-observed tradition, then, for people who engage in spiritual
practice to place great importance on proper conduct.  Many meditators
undertake realistic moral vows -- such as refraining from harming
living beings, from stealing, from careless use of sexuality,
from using intoxicants (alcohol and drugs), and from gossip and
other graceless speech habits -- to help their own inner clarity,
and perhaps gently encourage that of others.
<H2><FONT COLOR=#800080>COMPANY AND ROUTINE</FONT></H2>

<P>
Meditating with a few friends at regular times can be a great
support towards constancy of practice and development of wisdom.
 The solitary meditator eventually faces diminishing will-power,
as there's often something else to do that seems more important
(or more interesting) than watching the breath.  Regular group
meditation for an agreed-upon duration keeps the participants
going, regardless of their flux of moods. (The investigation of
these shifts of disposition often yields important insights, but
on our own we can find it difficult to persevere with them.) As
well as seeing the personal benefits, you can reflect that your
efforts are helping others to keep practising.

<a name="posture"><H2><FONT COLOR=#800080>NOTES ON POSTURE</FONT></H2></a>
<P>
The ideal is an upright, alert posture.  Slumping only increases
the pressure on the legs and discomfort in the back.  It is important
to attend to your posture with wisdom, not insensitive will-power!
 Posture will improve in time, but you need to work with the body,
not use force against it.<BR>

<P>
Check your posture:
<UL>
<LI>Are the hips leaning back?  This will cause a slump.
<LI>The small of the back should have its natural, unforced curve
so that the abdomen is forward and &quot;open&quot;.
<LI>Imagine that someone is gently pushing between the shoulder
blades, while keeping the muscles relaxed.  This will give you
an idea of whether you unconsciously &quot;hunch&quot; your shoulders
(and hence close your chest).
<LI>Note, and gently release, any tension in the neck/shoulder
region.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
If your posture feels tense or stack: 
<UL>
<LI>Allow the spine to straighten by imagining the crown of the
head as suspended from above.  This also lets the chin tuck in
slightly. 
<LI>Keep the arms light and held back against the abdomen.  If
they are forward, they pull you out of balance.
<LI>Use a small firm cushion underneath and toward the back of
the buttocks to support the angle of the hips.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
For the legs:
<UL>
<LI>Practise some stretching exercises (like touching the toes
with both legs stretched out, while sitting).
<LI>If you have a lot of pain during a period of sitting, change
posture, sit on a small stool or chair, or stand up for a while.
<LI>If you usually (or wish to) sit on or near the floor, experiment
with cushions of different size and firmness, or try out one of
the special meditation stools that are available.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
For drowsiness:
<UL>
<LI>Try meditating with your eyes open.
<LI>&quot;Sweep&quot; your attention systematically around your
body.
<LI>Focus on the whole body and on physical sensations, rather
than on a subtle object like the breath.
<LI>Stand up and walk mindfully for a while in the open air.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
For tension or headaches:
<UL>
<LI>You may be trying too hard -- this is not unusual! -- so lighten
your concentration.  For instance, you might move your attention
to the sensation of the breath at the abdomen.
<LI>Generate the energy of good-will (see the section on &quot;<a href="#heart">Cultivating
the Heart</a>&quot;), and direct it towards the area of tension.
<LI>Visualising and spreading light through the body can be helpful
in alleviating its aches and pains.  Try actually focusing a benevolent
light on an area of difficulty!
