<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I think something that interests us all is ourselves -
    because we are the subject of our lives. No matter what you
    think of yourself, there is a natural interest there because
    you have to live with yourself for a lifetime. The self view
    is therefore something that can give us a lot of misery, if
    we see ourselves in the wrong way. Even under the most
    fortunate circumstances, if we don't see ourselves in the
    right way we still end up creating suffering in our minds. So
    the Buddha was trying to point out that the way to solve the
    problem isn't through trying to make everything right and
    pleasant on the external dimension, but to develop the right
    understanding, the right attitude towards ourselves. This is
    the whole thrust of his teaching. </p>
    <p>Living in Britain at this time, we expect comfort and all
    kinds of privileges, rights and material comforts. This makes
    life more pleasant in many ways, but also when our every need
    is provided for and life is too comfortable, something in us
    doesn't develop. Sometimes it is the struggle through
    hardship that develops and matures us as human beings. I
    remember when we lived in London, we used to take walks up on
    Hampstead Heath in the morning and watch these well-off
    people taking their pet poodles for walks on the Heath. We'd
    start thinking that it wouldn't be so bad to be born as a lap
    dog here in England: have some nice lady constantly pampering
    you, making you little jumpers for the winter, and finding
    tasty little dog biscuits to feed you. It looked like a life
    of affection and comfort could be rather pleasing! But the
    truth is that most of us would find that suffocating: we need
    to measure ourselves against something, we need to struggle
    and to learn how to get beyond the limitations that we think
    we have at this time. Where we get defeated is where we give
    up to the limitations that we have through resignation and
    apathy. Then of course we just get depressed and miserable. </p>
    <p>But when we give up or surrender to restriction and to
    restraint through wisdom, then we find liberation! Life is
    the experience of restriction and restraint, being born in
    the human body and having to live under the laws of nature on
    planet earth. Mentally we can soar up into the sky, we can go
    up into the heavens, but physically we are bound to
    limitations that get increasingly restrictive as we grow
    older. This need not be seen as suffering because that is the
    way things are. </p>
    <p>You can develop a different attitude and learn to accept
    the limitations - not out of a negative resignation but just
    because you realise that what you really are looking for is
    within you. You need not seek for it outside, you need not
    think that it is something far away or inaccessible to you.
    It comes through the willingness to calm down and stop
    resisting and to listen and awaken to your own conscious
    experience. But of course the big obstruction to that is that
    we have the sense of ourselves as being this or that or the
    other. </p>
    <p>The sense of oneself is something that we become conscious
    of when we are children; when we are born there is no sense
    of a self as being anything. As we grow up then we learn what
    we are supposed to be, if we are good or bad, if we are
    loveable or not, if we are approved of or disapproved of. So
    we develop a sense of ourselves. We also often compare
    ourselves to others and have role models of what we should be
    when we grow up. I noticed from my own experience that the
    ego really started consolidating when I was sent off to
    school: I was thrown into those classrooms with all those
    strange children and then I started noticing who was the
    strongest, who was the toughest, who was the one the teacher
    liked the best. We saw ourselves in terms of our
    relationships to others. This develops through a lifetime
    unless we deliberately choose to change and start looking
    more deeply than just living our lives through the
    conditioning of the mind that we acquired when we were very
    young. Even when we get older, sometimes we still have very
    adolescent attitudes or childish emotional reactions to life
    that we have been unable to resolve except by suppressing or
    ignoring them. And these can be very embarrassing or shocking
    to us. </p>
    <p>There is one way of talking about the self that makes it
    sound very doctrinal. Buddhists can sometimes say that there
    is no self, as if it was a proclamation that you have to
    believe in; as if there were some God on high saying
    &quot;THERE'S NO SELF!&quot;; and in that presentation
    something in us resists. It doesn't seem true to just go
    announcing that there isn't any self- because what is this
    experience that we are feeling right now? Here there seems to
    be very much a sense of oneself! You're feeling, you're
    breathing, you see and hear; you react to things - people can
    praise you or criticise you and you feel happy or depressed
    accordingly. So if this isn't me then what is it? And am I
    supposed to go round as a Buddhist believing that I don't
    have a self? Or if I am going to believe in something, maybe
    it is better to believe that I do have a self, because then
    you can say things like: &quot;my true self is perfect and
    pure.&quot; That at least gives you some kind of
    inspirational encouragement to try to live your life, rather
    than saying that there is no self, no soul, leaving a total
    annihilation of any possibilities. These are just examples of
    the use of language; we can say 'there is no self' as a
    proclamation, or &quot;there is no self&quot; as a
    reflection. The reflective mode is to encourage us to
    contemplate the self. The Buddha was pointing to the fact
    that when we really look at these changing conditions that we
    tend to identify with, we can begin to see that these are not
    self. What we believe in, what we hold to and cling to and
    assume, is not what we really are: it's a position, it is a
    condition, it is something that changes according to time and
    place. Each one of us is experiencing consciousness through
    the human body that we have, and it is like this. </p>
    <p>Consciousness is a natural function, there is no sense of
    self in regards to consciousness. The only reason that we
    might assume a self is because consciousness operates in
    terms of subject and object; to be conscious we have to be a
    separate entity, so therefore we are operating from this
    position of being this subjective being here. Then we can get
    obsessed with a very personal interpretation of everything:
    every reaction or experience, whether it is instinctive or
    whatever, can be interpreted in the sense of it being me and
    mine. We can interpret the natural energies of the body in a
    very personal way as if this is me, my problem, rather than
    seeing them as part of the package that we get from being
    born as a human being. Even a baby when it is first born has
    instinctive drives to survive, so when it is hungry it cries.
    Babies are usually born beautiful creatures so that we
    naturally want to love and take care of them. Do you think
    that the baby is doing this deliberately - &quot;I'm trying
    to be cute so that Ajahn Sumedho will hold me, my mother will
    love me - or ts this just the way it is, just nature in
    operation? These are just natural things, but we tend to see
    them in very personal ways. </p>
    <p>We hold views about each other that we carry with us for a
    lifetime: she is like this, he is like that; and these
    influence how we react and we respond to each other - just in
    the way someone looks: pleasing, happy, welcoming; mean and
    unpleasant; or somebody praises us or insults us. We can
    carry resentment about being insulted for a lifetime and
    never forgive that person. Maybe they did it when they were
    just having a bad time, even after thirty years, we can still
    make a problem about it if we want. So this self needs to be
    examined and looked at and contemplated, in religious terms.
    Every religion has its self-naughting teachings: in some ways
    religion is about relinquishing the selfish tendencies of the
    mind, so before we can, say, realise the Kingdom of God we
    have to let go of our selfish fascinations and obsessions.
    Or, if we are going to realise the true Dhamma, we need to
    let go of the self view. So this can be another command from
    above, like &quot;You shouldn't be selfish! Get rid of any
    selfishness and try to become somebody who is pure!&quot; We
    would all agree with that, nobody here would relish the idea
    of becoming more and more selfish, but sometimes we don't
    know how not to be selfish. We may have grand ideas that we
    should give up all our wealth, not hold on to anything; then
    we're getting closer to not being selfish - but the strange
    thing is that when you become a monk or a nun, sometimes,
    although you are thinking you are getting rid of selfishness,
    you find yourself getting more and more selfish. Your
    selfishness becomes very concentrated, because you can't
    spread yourself over such a wide area as in lay life. So you
    become much more aware of it. And if you condemn it, then it
    seems to be a hopeless situation, because you begin to
    interpret life from that sense of &quot;I'm selfish and I've
    got to get rid of this selfishness.&quot; And one of the
    biggest problems in our way of thinking is to relinquish that
    basic premise that &quot;I am this person and I have got to
    do something, in order to become an unselfish, enlightened
    person in the future.&quot; </p>
    <p>We are conditioned to think this way in our culture: be a
    good boy and therefore you do this and you do that and in the
    future you will become somebody who will be worthy and
    acceptable in society. This makes sense on the worldly side
    of life, because we start out illiterate, so we have to
    learn, and from then on we have to study all the different
    subjects in a school in order to become someone who can get
    through the system. If we fail then we become someone who
    fails. And failure is despised. It is interesting in teaching
    meditation to people who have this fear of failure, they fear
    that they are going to fail in meditation. But there is no
    way you could fail in meditation. It is not about failure,
    otherwise even meditation becomes just another way for us to
    prove ourselves. &quot;I can't do it now. If I practise hard,
    I will become a good meditator and I will become enlightened,
    hopefully...&quot; And then the doubt comes: &quot;But I
    don't think I could ever get enlightened. Who is
    enlightened?&quot; </p>
    <p>People like to check us all out to see if Ajahn Sumedho is
    enlightened or whether Ajahn Viradhammo is, or whether we
    have reached some kind of advanced level. Or are we just
    blokes who haven't quite made it? But there is a different
    way of looking and thinking which is the opposite of seeing
    ourselves in terms of being somebody who has to do something
    to become somebody who is better than he or she is right now.
    That is the worldly way of thinking. That's what people like
    to hear isn't it: &quot;I had all kinds of problems and was a
    very miserable, unhappy man and then practising meditation I
    saw the light and now I'm happy and fulfilled.&quot; From the
    worldly conditioned attitude, &quot;I am this person, I am
    this personality, I am Ajahn Sumedho... I am all kinds of
    things... I should be and I shouldn't be.&quot; But the aim
    of Buddhist meditation is about changing one's attitude by
    using the reflective or intuitive function of the mind. </p>
    <p>When we go into the stillness of meditation, often times
    the sense of oneself will take us over, we'll be filled with
    all kinds of memories and ideas about ourselves. We sometimes
    wish that... &quot;if I go and meditate then I'll go into
    stillness and I'll get out of this ugly scenario of
    myself.&quot; Sometimes the mind will suddenly just stop and
    we'll experience a kind of bliss, or a peace that we have
    either forgotten or never really noticed before. But the
    sense of oneself will still operate because of the force of
    habit. So we develop an attitude of listening to this self,
    not in terms of believing or disbelieving but in noticing
    what it really is that arises and ceases. Whether we think of
    ourselves as the greatest or the worst doesn't matter, the
    condition itself comes and goes. Through letting go or
    'self-naughting', not trying to get rid of it but allowing it
    to go, then we begin to experience the true nature of mind
    which is bliss, silence. </p>
    <p>So there are moments in our lives when the self does stop
    functioning and we get in touch with the pure state of
    conscious experience. That is what we call bliss. But when we
    have those blissful experiences, immediately the desire to
    have them again takes over, and no matter how hard we try to
    have it again, as long as we're attached to the view of
    wanting bliss again, we will never get it. It doesn't work
    that way. Wanting it means that we have already made it
    impossible, so the attitude then is one of letting go of
    desire. Not trying to suppress desire, because that is
    another kind of desire: the desire to get rid of desire is
    still the same problem. So if we're trying to suppress or
    annihilate desire, it doesn't work. Nor does just following
    desire. But in this state of attentive awareness, we begin to
    see what is actually taking place, then we can let go of the
    causes of our suffering. We see how it actually is, and we
    have that intuitive wisdom to let go. So in this life as a
    human being from birth to death every moment is an
    opportunity for understanding in the right way. Success or
    failure suddenly doesn't mean anything because even if we
    fail, we learn from that. This doesn't mean that we don't try
    or put ourselves forth but that our aim is no longer to
    succeed but to understand things. </p>
    <p align="left">It takes a long time to get underneath this
    self view because it is an all pervasive influence on our
    conscious experience. With meditation also, we bring
    attention to very ordinary things like the breath and the
    body, and so we learn how to bring our attention into the
    present moment, to sustain our attention . </p>
