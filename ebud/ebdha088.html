<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This practice of ours is not easy.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may know
    some things but there is still much that we don't
    know.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, when we hear teachings such as
    &quot;know the body, then know the mind within the
    body&quot;; or &quot;know the mind, then know the mind within
    the mind&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we haven't yet practiced these
    things, then we hear them we may feel baffled.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong> [<a href="#n1">1</a>] <a
    name="r1"></a> is like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past I used
    to be a teacher, [<a href="#n2">2</a>]<a name="r2"></a> but I
    was only a &quot;small teacher&quot;, not a big
    one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do I say a &quot;small
    teacher&quot;?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I didn't practice.&nbsp;
    &nbsp; I taught the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong> but I
    didn't practice it.&nbsp; &nbsp; This I call a small teacher,
    an inferior teacher.&nbsp;&nbsp; I say an &quot;inferior
    teacher&quot; because when it came to the practice I was
    deficient.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the most part my practice was a
    long way off the theory, just as if I hadn't learnt the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong>
    at all.</p>
    <p>However, I would like to state that in practical terms
    it's impossible to know the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong>
    completely, because some things, whether we know them or not,
    are still offenses.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is tricky.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    And yet it is stressed that if we do not yet understand any
    particular training rule or teaching, we must study that rule
    with enthusiasm and respect.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we don't know,
    then we should make an effort to learn.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we
    don't make an effort, that is in itself an offense.</p>
    <p>For example, if you doubt...&nbsp; suppose there is a
    woman and, not knowing whether she is a woman or a man, you
    touch her.&nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="#n3">3</a>] <a name="r3"></a>You're
    not sure, but still go ahead and touch...&nbsp; that's still
    wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to wonder why that should be wrong,
    but when I considered the practice, I realized that a
    meditator must have <strong><i>sati</i></strong>, he must be
    circumspect.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether talking, touching or holding
    things, he must first thoroughly consider.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    error in this case is that there is no <strong><i>sati</i></strong>,
    or insufficient <strong><i>sati</i></strong>, or a lack of
    concern at that time.</p>
    <p>Take another example:&nbsp;&nbsp; it's only eleven o'clock
    in the morning but at the time the sky is cloudy, we can't
    see the sun, and we have no clock.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now suppose we
    estimate that it's probably afternoon...&nbsp; we really feel
    that it's afternoon...&nbsp; and yet we proceed to eat
    something.&nbsp;&nbsp; We start eating and then the clouds
    part and we see from the position of the sun that it's only
    just past eleven.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is still an offense [<a
    href="#n4">4</a>].<a name="r4"></a> I used to wonder,
    &quot;Eh?&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not yet past mid-day, why is this
    an offense?&quot;</p>
    <p>An offense is incurred here because of negligence,
    carelessness, we don't thoroughly consider.&nbsp;&nbsp; There
    is a lack of restraint.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is doubt and we
    act on the doubt, there is a <strong><i>dukkata</i></strong>
    [<a href="#n5">5</a>] <a name="r5"></a>offense just for
    acting in the face of the doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp; We think that it
    is afternoon when in fact it isn't.&nbsp;&nbsp; The act of
    eating is not wrong in itself, but there is an offense here
    because we are careless and negligent.&nbsp; &nbsp; If it
    really is afternoon but we think it isn't, then it's the
    heavier <strong><i>pacittiya</i></strong>
    offense.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we act with doubt, whether the action
    is wrong or not, we still incur an offense.&nbsp; &nbsp; If
    the action is not wrong in itself it is the lesser offense;
    if it is wrong then the heavier offense is
    incurred.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong>
    can get quite bewildering.</p>
    <p>At one time I went to see Venerable Ajahn Mun.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="#n6">6</a>]<a name="r6"></a> At that time I had
    just begun to practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had read the <strong><i>Pubbasikkha</i></strong>
    [<a href="#n7">7</a>] <a name="r7"></a>and could understand
    that fairly well.&nbsp; &nbsp; Then I went on to read the <strong><i>Visuddhimagga</i></strong>,
    where the author writes of the <strong><i>Silanidesa</i></strong>
    (Book of Precepts), <strong><i>Samadhinidesa</i></strong>
    (Book of Mind-Training) and <strong><i>Pannanidesa</i></strong>
    (Book of Understanding)...&nbsp; I felt my head was going to
    burst!&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading that, I felt that it was
    beyond the ability of a human being to practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But then I reflected that the Buddha would not teach
    something that is impossible to practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; He
    wouldn't teach it and he wouldn't declare it, because those
    things would be useful neither to himself nor to
    others.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong><i>Silanidesa</i></strong> is
    extremely meticulous, the <strong><i>Samadhinidesa</i></strong>
    more so, and the <strong><i>Pannanidesa</i></strong> even
    more so!&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat and thought, &quot;Well, I can't
    go any further.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's no way
    ahead.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was as if I'd reached a dead-end.</p>
    <p>At this stage I was struggling with my practice...&nbsp; I
    was stuck.&nbsp;&nbsp; It so happened that I had a chance to
    go and see Venerable Ajahn Mun, so I asked him:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;Venerable Ajahn, what am I to do?&nbsp;&nbsp; I've just
    begun to practice but I still don't know the right way.&nbsp;
    &nbsp; I have so many doubts I can't find any foundation at
    all in the practice.&quot;</p>
    <p>He asked, &quot;What's the problem?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;In the course of my practice I picked up the <strong><i>Visuddhimagga</i></strong>
    and read it, but it seems impossible to put into
    practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; The contents of the <strong><i>Silanidesa</i></strong>,
    <strong><i>Samadhinidesa</i></strong> and <strong><i>Pannanidesa</i></strong>
    seem to be completely impractical.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think
    there is anybody in the world who could do it, it's so
    detailed and meticulous.&nbsp;&nbsp; To memorize every single
    rule would be impossible, it's beyond me.&quot;</p>
    <p>He said to me:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Venerable...&nbsp;
    there's a lot, it's true, but it's really only a
    little.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we were to take account of every
    training rule in the <strong><i>Silanidesa</i></strong> that
    would be difficult...&nbsp; true...&nbsp; But actually, what
    we call the <strong><i>Silanidesa</i></strong> has evolved
    from the human mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we train this mind to
    have a sense of shame and a fear of wrong-doing, we will then
    be restrained, we will be cautious...&nbsp; .</p>
    <p>&quot;This will condition us to be content with little,
    with few wishes, because we can't possibly look after a
    lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; When this happens our <strong><i>sati</i></strong>
    becomes stronger.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be able to maintain <strong><i>sati</i></strong>
    at all times.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever we are we will make the
    effort to maintain thorough <strong><i>sati</i></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Caution will be developed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever you doubt
    don't say it, don't act on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there's
    anything you don't understand, ask the teacher.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Trying to practice every single training rule would indeed be
    burdensome, but we should examine whether we are prepared to
    admit our faults or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we accept them?&quot;</p>
    <p>This teaching is very important.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not so
    much that we must know every single training rule, if we know
    how to train our own minds.</p>
    <p>&quot;All that stuff that you've been reading arises from
    the mind.&nbsp; &nbsp; If you still haven't trained your mind
    to have sensitivity and clarity you will be doubting all the
    time.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should try to bring the teachings of
    the Buddha into your mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be composed in
    mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever arises that you doubt, just give
    it up.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't really know for sure then
    don't say it or do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, if you
    wonder, &quot;Is this wrong or not?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- that
    is, you're not really sure -- then don't say it, don't act on
    it, don't discard your restraint.&quot;</p>
    <p>As I sat and listened, I reflected that this teaching
    conformed with the eight ways for measuring the true teaching
    of the Buddha:&nbsp; &nbsp; Any teaching that speaks of the
    diminishing of defilements; which leads out of suffering;
    which speaks of renunciation (of sensual pleasures); of
    contentment with little; of humility and disinterest in rank
    and status; of aloofness and seclusion; of diligent effort;
    of being easy to maintain...&nbsp; these eight qualities are
    characteristics of the true <strong><i>Dhamma-vinaya</i></strong>,
    the teaching of the Buddha.&nbsp;&nbsp; anything in
    contradiction to these is not.</p>
    <p>&quot;If we are genuinely sincere we will have a sense of
    shame and a fear of wrongdoing.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will know that
    if there is doubt in our mind we will not act on it nor speak
    on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong><i>Silanidesa</i></strong> is
    only words.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, <strong><i>hiri-ottappa</i></strong>
    [<a href="#n8">8</a>] <a name="r8"></a>in the books is one
    thing, but in our minds it is another.&quot;</p>
    <p>Studying the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong> with Venerable
    Ajahn Mun I learnt many things.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I sat and
    listened, understanding arose.</p>
    <p>So, when it comes to the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong>
    I've studied considerably.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some days during the
    Rains Retreat I would study from six o'clock in the evening
    through till dawn.&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand it
    sufficiently.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the factors of <strong><i>apatti</i></strong>
    [<a href="#n9">9</a>] <a name="r9"></a>which are covered in
    the <strong><i>Pubbasikkha</i></strong> I wrote down in a
    notebook and kept in my bag.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really put effort
    into it, but in later times I gradually let go.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It was too much.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't know which was the
    essence and which was the trimming, I had just taken all of
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I understood more fully I let it drop
    off because it was too heavy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just put my
    attention into my own mind and gradually did away with the
    texts.</p>
    <p>However, when I teach the monks here I still take the <strong><i>Pubbasikkha</i></strong>
    as my standard.&nbsp;&nbsp; For many years here at Wat Ba
    Pong it was I myself who read it to the assembly.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In those days I would ascend the Dhamma-seat and go on until
    at least eleven o'clock or midnight, some days even one or
    two o'clock in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were
    interested.&nbsp;&nbsp; And we trained.&nbsp;&nbsp; After
    listening to the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong> reading we
    would go and consider what we'd heard.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't
    really understand the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong> just by
    listening to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having listened to it you must
    examine it and delve into it further.</p>
    <p>Even though I studied these things for many years my
    knowledge was still not complete, because there were so many
    ambiguities in the texts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that it's been such
    a long time since I looked at the books, my memory of the
    various training rules has faded somewhat, but within my mind
    there is no deficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a standard
    there.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt, there is
    understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp; I put away the books and
    concentrated on developing my own mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't
    have doubts about any of the training rules.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    mind has an appreciation of virtue, it won't dare do anything
    wrong, whether in public or in private.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not
    kill animals, even small ones.&nbsp; &nbsp; If someone were
    to ask me to intentionally kill an ant or a termite, to
    squash one with my hand, for instance, I couldn't do it, even
    if they were to offer me thousands of <strong><i>baht</i></strong>
    (Thai currency) to do so.&nbsp; &nbsp; Even one ant or
    termite!&nbsp;&nbsp; The ant's life would have greater value
    to me.</p>
    <p>However, it may be that I may cause one to die, such as
    when something crawls up my leg and I brush it
    off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it dies, but when I look into my mind
    there is no feeling of guilt.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no
    wavering or doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because there
    was no intention.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><i>Silam vadami
    bhikkhave cetanaham</i></strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Intention
    is the essence of moral training.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking
    at it in this way I see that there was no intentional
    killing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes while walking I may step on an
    insect and kill it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, before I really
    understood, I would really suffer over things like
    that.&nbsp; &nbsp; I would think I had committed an offense.</p>
    <p>&quot;What?&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no
    intention.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There was no intention,
    but I wasn't being careful enough!&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would
    go on like this, fretting and worrying.</p>
    <p>So this <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong> is something which
    can be disturb practicers of Dhamma, but it also has its
    value, in keeping with what the teachers say --
    &quot;Whatever training rules you don't yet know you should
    learn.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't know you should question
    those who do.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; They really stress this.</p>
    <p>Now if we don't know the training rules, we won't be aware
    of our transgressions against them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take, for
    example, a Venerable Thera of the past, Ajahn Pow of Wat Kow
    Wong Got in Lopburi Province.&nbsp;&nbsp; One day a certain <strong><i>Maha</i></strong>,
    [<a href="#n10">10</a>] <a name="r10"></a>a disciple of his,
    was sitting with him, when some women came up and asked,</p>
    <p>&quot;Luang Por!&nbsp;&nbsp; We want to invite you to go
    with us on an excursion, will you go?&quot;</p>
    <p>Luang Por Pow didn't answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong><i>Maha</i></strong>
    sitting near him thought that Venerable Ajahn Pow hadn't
    heard, so he said,</p>
    <p>&quot;Luang Por, Luang Por!&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you
    hear?&nbsp;&nbsp; These women invited you to go for a
    trip.&quot;</p>
    <p>He said, &quot;I heard.&quot;</p>
    <p>The women asked again, &quot;Luang Por, are you going or
    not?&quot;</p>
    <p>He just sat there without answering, and so nothing came
    of the invitation.&nbsp;&nbsp; When they had gone, the <strong><i>Maha</i></strong>
    said,</p>
    <p>&quot;Luang Por, why didn't you answer those women?&quot;</p>
    <p>He said, &quot;Oh, <strong><i>Maha</i></strong>, don't you
    know this rule?&nbsp;&nbsp; Those people who were here just
    now were all women.&nbsp;&nbsp; If women invite you to travel
    with them you should not consent.&nbsp; &nbsp; If they make
    the arrangements themselves that's fine.&nbsp; &nbsp; If I
    want to go I can, because I didn't take part in making the
    arrangements.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;The <strong><i>Maha</i></strong> sat and thought,
    &quot;Oh, I've really made a fool of myself.&quot;</p>
    <p>The <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong> states that to make an
    arrangement, and then travel together with, women, even
    though it isn't as a couple, is a <strong><i>pacittiya</i></strong>
    offense.</p>
    <p>Take another case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lay people would bring
    money to offer Venerable Ajahn Pow on a tray.&nbsp;&nbsp; He
    would extend his receiving cloth, [<a href="#n11">11</a>] <a
    name="r11"></a>holding it at one end.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when
    they brought the tray forward to lay it on the cloth he would
    retract his hand from the cloth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he would
    simply abandon the money where it lay.&nbsp;&nbsp; He knew it
    was there, but he would take no interest in it, just get up
    and walk away, because in the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong>
    it is said that if one doesn't consent to the money it isn't
    necessary to forbid laypeople from offering it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If he had desire for it, he would have to say,
    &quot;Householder, this is not allowable for a
    monk&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; He would have to tell them.&nbsp;
    &nbsp; If you have desire for it, you must forbid them from
    offering that which is unallowable.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if
    you really have no desire for it, it isn't
    necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; You just leave it there and go.</p>
    <p>Although the Ajahn and his disciples lived together for
    many years, still some of his disciples didn't understand
    Ajahn Pow's practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a poor state of
    affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; As for myself, I looked into and
    contemplated many of Venerable Ajahn Pow's subtler points of
    practice.</p>
    <p>The <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong> can even cause some
    people to disrobe.&nbsp;&nbsp; When they study it all the
    doubts come up.&nbsp;&nbsp; It goes right back into the
    past...&nbsp; &quot;my ordination, was it proper?&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="#n12">12</a>] <a name="r12"></a>Was my preceptor
    pure?&nbsp;&nbsp; None of the monks who sat in on my
    ordination knew anything about the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong>,
    were they sitting at the proper distance?&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the
    chanting correct?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doubts come rolling
    on...&nbsp; &quot;The hall I ordained in, was it
    proper?&nbsp;&nbsp; It was so small...&nbsp;
    &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; They doubt everything and fall into hell.</p>
    <p>So until you know how to ground your mind it's really
    difficult.&nbsp; &nbsp; You have to be very cool, you can't
    just jump into things.&nbsp;&nbsp; But to be so cool that you
    don't bother to look into things is wrong also.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
    was so confused I almost disrobed because I saw so many
    faults within my own practice and that of some of my
    teachers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was on fire and couldn't sleep
    because of those doubts.</p>
    <p>The more I doubted, the more I meditated, the more I
    practiced.&nbsp; &nbsp; Wherever doubt arose I practiced
    right at that point.&nbsp; &nbsp; Wisdom arose.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Things began to change.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's hard to describe the
    change that took place.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind changed until
    there was no more doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know how it
    changed, if I were to tell someone they probably wouldn't
    understand.</p>
    <p>So I reflected on the teaching <strong><i>Paccattam
    veditabbo vinnuhi</i></strong> -- the wise must know for
    themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be a knowing that arises
    through direct experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Studying the <strong><i>Dhamma-vinaya</i></strong>
    is certainly correct but if it's just the study it's still
    lacking.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you really get down to the practice
    you begin to doubt everything.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I started
    to practice I wasn't interested in the minor offenses, but
    when I started practicing, even the <strong><i>dukkata</i></strong>
    offenses became as important as the <strong><i>parajika</i></strong>
    offenses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before, the <strong><i>dukkata</i></strong>
    offenses seemed like nothing, just a trifle.&nbsp; &nbsp;
    That's how I saw them.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening you could
    confess them and they would be done with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
    you could transgress them again.&nbsp;&nbsp; This sort of
    confession is impure, because you don't stop, you don't
    decide to change.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no restraint, you
    simply do it again and again.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no
    perception of the truth, no letting go.</p>
    <p>Actually, in terms of ultimate truth, it's not necessary
    to go through the routine of confessing offenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If we see that our mind is pure and there is no trace of
    doubt, then those offenses drop off right there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That we are not yet pure is because we still doubt, we still
    waver.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not really pure so we can't let
    go.&nbsp;&nbsp; We don't see ourselves, this is the
    point.&nbsp;&nbsp; This <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong> of
    ours is like a fence to guard us from making mistakes, so
    it's something we need to be scrupulous with.</p>
    <p>If you don't see the true value of the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong>
    for yourself it's difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many years before I
    came to Wat Ba Pong I decided I would give up
    money.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the greater part of a Rains Retreat I
    had thought about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end I grabbed my
    wallet and walked over to a certain <strong><i>Maha</i></strong>
    who was living with me at the time, setting the wallet down
    in front of him.</p>
    <p>&quot;Here, <strong><i>Maha</i></strong>, take this
    money.&nbsp;&nbsp; From today onwards, as long as I'm a monk,
    I will not receive or hold money.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can be my
    witness.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;You keep it, Venerable, you may need it for your
    studies&quot;...&nbsp; The Venerable <strong><i>Maha</i></strong>
    wasn't keen to take the money, he was embarrassed
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
    <p>&quot;Why do you want to throw away all this money?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;You don't have to worry about me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've
    made my decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided last night.&quot;</p>
    <p>From the day he took that money it was as if a gap had
    opened between us.&nbsp;&nbsp; We could no longer understand
    each other.&nbsp; &nbsp; He's still my witness to this very
    day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since that day I haven't used money or
    engaged in any buying or selling.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been
    restrained in every way with money.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was
    constantly wary of wrongdoing, even though I hadn't done
    anything wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inwardly I maintained the
    meditation practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; I no longer needed wealth, I
    saw it as a poison.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether you give poison to a
    human being, a dog or anything else, it invariably causes
    death or suffering.&nbsp; &nbsp; If we see clearly like this
    we will be constantly on our guard not to take that
    &quot;poison.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we clearly see the harm
    in it, it's not difficult to give up.</p>
    <p>Regarding food and meals brought as offerings, if I
    doubted them I wouldn't accept them.&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter
    how delicious or refined the food might be, I wouldn't eat
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a simple example, like raw pickled
    fish.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose you are living in a forest and you
    go on almsround and receive only rice and some pickled fish
    wrapped in leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you return to your
    dwelling and open the packet you find that it's raw pickled
    fish...&nbsp; just throw it away!&nbsp;&nbsp;[<a href="#n13">13</a>]
    <a name="r13"></a>Eating plain rice is better than
    transgressing the precepts.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has to be like
    this before you can say you really understand, then the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong>
    becomes simpler.</p>
    <p>If other monks wanted to give me requisites, such as bowl,
    razor or whatever, I wouldn't accept, unless I knew them as
    fellow practicers with a similar standard of <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Why not?&nbsp; &nbsp; How can you trust someone who is
    unrestrained?&nbsp;&nbsp; They can do all sorts of
    things.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unrestrained monks don't see the value of
    the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong>, so it's possible that
    they could have obtained those things in improper
    ways.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was as scrupulous as this.</p>
    <p>As a result, some of my fellow monks would look askance at
    me...&nbsp; &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; He doesn't socialize, he won't
    mix...&nbsp; &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was unmoved:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;Sure, we can mix when we die.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes
    to death we are all in the same boat&quot;, I thought.&nbsp;
    &nbsp; I lived with endurance.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was one who
    spoke little.&nbsp;&nbsp; If others criticized my practice I
    was unmoved.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because even if I
    explained to them they wouldn't understand.&nbsp;&nbsp; They
    knew nothing about practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like those times
    when I would be invited to a funeral ceremony and somebody
    would say, &quot;...&nbsp; Don't listen to him!&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Just put the money in his bag and don't say anything about
    it...&nbsp; don't let him know.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<a
    href="#n14">14</a>] <a name="r14"></a>I would say, &quot;Hey,
    do you think I'm dead or something?&nbsp;&nbsp; Just because
    one calls alcohol perfume doesn't make it become perfume, you
    know.&nbsp;&nbsp; But you people, when you want to drink
    alcohol you call it perfume, then go ahead and
    drink.&nbsp;&nbsp; You must be crazy!&quot;</p>
    <p>The <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong>, then, can be
    difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to be content with little,
    aloof.&nbsp;&nbsp; You must see, and see right.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Once, when I was traveling through Saraburi, my group went to
    stay in a village temple for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Abbot
    there had about the same seniority as myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; In
    the morning, we would all go on almsround together, then come
    back to the monastery and put down our bowls.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Presently the laypeople would bring dishes of food into the
    hall and set them down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the monks would go
    and pick them up, open them and lay them in a line to be
    formally offered.&nbsp;&nbsp; One monk would put his hand on
    the dish at the other end.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that was
    it!&nbsp;&nbsp; With that the monks would bring them over and
    distribute them to be eaten.</p>
    <p>About five monks were traveling with me at the time, but
    not one of us would touch that food.&nbsp;&nbsp; On almsround
    all we received was plain rice, so we sat with them and ate
    plain rice, none of us would dare eat the food from those
    dishes.</p>
    <p>This went on for quite a few days, until I began to sense
    that the Abbot was disturbed by our behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp; One
    of his monks had probably gone to him and said, &quot;Those
    visiting monks won't eat any of the food.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't
    know what they're up to.&quot;</p>
    <p>I had to stay there for a few days more, so I went to the
    Abbot to explain.</p>
    <p>I said, &quot;Venerable Sir, may I have a moment
    please?&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time I have some business which
    means I must call on your hospitality for some days, but in
    doing so I'm afraid there may be one or two things which you
    and your fellow monks find puzzling:&nbsp; &nbsp; namely,
    concerning our not eating the food which has been offered by
    the laypeople.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like to clarify this with you,
    sir.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's really nothing, it's just that I've
    learned to practice like this...&nbsp; that is, the receiving
    of the offerings, sir.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the lay people lay
    the food down and then the monks go and open the dishes, sort
    them out and then have them formally offered...&nbsp; this is
    wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a <strong><i>dukkata</i></strong>
    offense.&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, to handle or touch food
    which hasn't yet been formally offered into a monk's hands,
    &quot;ruins&quot; that food.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong>,
    any monk who eats that food incurs an offense.</p>
    <p>&quot;It's simply this one point, sir.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's
    not that I'm criticizing anybody, or that I'm trying to force
    you or your monks to stop practicing like this...&nbsp; not
    at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wanted to let you know of my good
    intentions, because it will be necessary for me to stay here
    for a few more days.</p>
    <p>He lifted his hands in <strong><i>anjali</i></strong>, [<a
    href="#n15">15</a>]<a name="r15"></a> &quot;<strong><i>Sadhu</i></strong><i>!</i>
    Excellent!&nbsp;&nbsp; I've never yet seen a monk who keeps
    the minor rules in Saraburi.&nbsp;&nbsp; there aren't any to
    be found these days.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there still are such
    monks they must live outside of Saraburi.&nbsp;&nbsp; May I
    commend you.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no objections at all, that's
    very good.&quot;</p>
    <p>The next morning when we came back from almsround not one
    of the monks would go near those dishes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    laypeople themselves sorted them out and offered them,
    because they were afraid the monks wouldn't eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    From that day onwards the monks and novices there seemed
    really on edge, so I tried to explain things to them, to put
    their minds at rest.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think they were afraid of
    us, they just went into their rooms and closed themselves in
    in silence.</p>
    <p>For two or three days I tried to make them feel at ease
    because they were so ashamed, I really had nothing against
    them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't say things like &quot;There's not
    enough food,&quot; or &quot;bring 'this' or 'that'
    food.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I had
    fasted before, sometimes for seven or eight days.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Here I had plain rice, I knew I wouldn't die.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Where I got my strength from was the practice, from having
    studied and practiced accordingly.</p>
    <p>I took the Buddha as my example.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever I
    went, whatever others did, I wouldn't involve
    myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; I devoted myself solely to the practice,
    because I cared for myself, I cared for the practice.</p>
    <p>Those who don't keep the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong> or
    practice meditation and those who do practice can't live
    together, they must go separate ways.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't
    understand this myself in the past.&nbsp; &nbsp; As a teacher
    I taught others but I didn't practice.&nbsp; &nbsp; This is
    really bad.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I looked deeply into it, my
    practice and my knowledge were as far apart as earth and sky.</p>
    <p>Therefore, those who want to go and set up meditation
    centers in the forest...&nbsp; don't do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
    you don't yet really know, don't bother trying, you'll only
    make a mess of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some monks think that going to
    live in the forest they will find peace, but they still don't
    understand the essentials of practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; They cut
    grass for themselves, [<a href="#n16">16</a>] <a name="r16"></a>do
    everything themselves...&nbsp; Those who really know the
    practice aren't interested in places like this, they won't
    prosper.&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing it like that won't lead to
    progress.&nbsp; &nbsp; No matter how peaceful the forest may
    be you can't progress if you do it wrong.</p>
    <p>They see the forest monks living in the forest and go to
    live in the forest like them, but it's not the
    same.&nbsp;&nbsp; The robes are not the same, eating habits
    are not the same, everything is different.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Namely, they don't train themselves, they don't
    practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; The place is wasted, it doesn't really
    work.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it does work, it does so only as a venue
    for showing off or publicizing, just like a medicine
    show.&nbsp;&nbsp; It goes no further than that.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Those who have only practiced a little and then go to teach
    others are not yet ripe, they don't really
    understand.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a short time they give up and it
    falls apart.&nbsp;&nbsp; It just brings trouble.</p>
    <p>So we must study somewhat, look at the <strong><i>Navakovada</i></strong>,
    [<a href="#n17">17</a>] <a name="r17"></a>what does it
    say?&nbsp;&nbsp; Study it, memorize it, until you
    understand.&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time ask your teacher
    concerning the finer points, he will explain
    them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Study like this until you really understand
    the <strong><i>Vinaya</i></strong>.</p>

        &quot;Vinaya&quot; literally means &quot;leading
        out,&quot; because maintenance of these rules &quot;leads
        out&quot; of unskillful actions, and, by extension,
        unskillful states of mind; in addition it can be said to
        &quot;lead out&quot; of the household life, and, by
        extension, attachment to the world. [<a href="#r1">^</a>]
