    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;This is a designation for this noble eightfold
        path: 'the divine vehicle' and 'the vehicle of Dhamma'
        and 'the unsurpassed victory in battle'. </p>
        <p>&quot;Right view, Ananda, when developed and
        cultivated, has as its final goal the removal of lust,
        the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion. </p>
        <p>&quot;Right intention, when developed and cultivated,
        has as its final goal the removal of lust, the removal of
        hatred, the removal of delusion. </p>
        <p>&quot;Right speech, when developed and cultivated, has
        as its final goal the removal of lust, the removal of
        hatred, the removal of delusion. </p>
        <p>&quot;Right action, when developed and cultivated, has
        as its final goal the removal of lust, the removal of
        hatred, the removal of delusion. </p>
        <p>&quot;Right livelihood, when developed and cultivated,
        has as its final goal the removal of lust, the removal of
        hatred, the removal of delusion. </p>
        <p>&quot;Right effort, when developed and cultivated, has
        as its final goal the removal of lust, the removal of
        hatred, the removal of delusion. </p>
        <p>&quot;Right mindfulness, when developed and
        cultivated, has as its final goal the removal of lust,
        the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion. </p>
        <p>&quot;Right concentration, when developed and
        cultivated, has as its final goal the removal of lust,
        the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion.&quot; </p>
        <p>&quot;In this way, Ananda, it may be understood how
        this is a designation for this noble eightfold path: 'the
        divine vehicle' and 'the vehicle of Dhamma' and 'the
        unsurpassed victory in battle.'&quot; </p>

    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>An ancient path
    re-discovered: </strong></font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;It is just as if a man, traveling along a
        wilderness track, were to see an ancient path, an ancient
        road, traveled by people of former times. He would follow
        it. Following it, he would see an ancient city, an
        ancient capital inhabited by people of former times,
        complete with parks, groves, and ponds, walled,
        delightful. He would go to address the king or the king's
        minister, saying, 'Sire, you should know that while
        traveling along a wilderness track I saw an ancient
        path...I followed it...I saw an ancient city, an ancient
        capital...complete with parks, groves, and ponds, walled,
        delightful. Sire, rebuild that city!' Then the king or
        king's minister would rebuild the city, so that at a
        later date the city would become powerful, rich, and
        well-populated, fully grown and prosperous. </p>
        <p>&quot;In the same way I saw an ancient path, an
        ancient road, traveled by the Rightly Self-awakened Ones
        of former times. And what is that ancient path...? Just
        this noble eightfold path: right view, right resolve,
        right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
        effort, right mindfulness, right concentration...I
        followed that path. Following it, I came to direct
        knowledge of aging and death, direct knowledge of the
        origination of aging and death, direct knowledge of the
        cessation of aging and death, direct knowledge of the
        path leading to the cessation of aging and death. I
        followed that path. Following it, I came to direct
        knowledge of birth... becoming... clinging... craving...
        feeling... contact... the six sense spheres... name and
        form... consciousness, direct knowledge of the
        origination of consciousness, direct knowledge of the
        cessation of consciousness, direct knowledge of the path
        leading to the cessation of consciousness. I followed
        that path. </p>
        <p>&quot;Following it, I came to direct knowledge of
        processes, direct knowledge of the origination of
        processes, direct knowledge of the cessation of
        processes, direct knowledge of the path leading to the
        cessation of processes. Knowing that directly, I have
        revealed it to monks, nuns, male lay adherents, and
        female lay adherents, so that this holy life has become
        powerful, rich, detailed, well-populated, wide-spread,
        proclaimed among celestial and human beings.&quot; </p>

    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>Enlightenment is accessible
    only to those who follow this path: </strong></font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;In any doctrine and discipline where the noble
        eightfold path is not found, no contemplative of the
        first... second... third... fourth order [stream-winner,
        once-returner, non-returner, or Arahant] is found. </p>
        <p>&quot;But in any doctrine and discipline where the
        noble eightfold path is found, contemplatives of the
        first... second... third... fourth order are found. </p>
        <p>&quot;The noble eightfold path is found in this
        doctrine and discipline, and right here there are
        contemplatives of the first... second... third... fourth
        order. Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable
        contemplatives. And if the monks dwell rightly, this
        world will not be empty of Arahants.&quot; </p>
        <p align="right"><em><strong>-- DN 16 </strong></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>The Path: </strong></font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Of paths, the eightfold is best. Of truths, the four
        sayings. Of qualities, dispassion. Of two-footed beings,
        the one with the eyes to see. </p>
        <p>Just this is the path - there is no other - to purify
        vision. Follow it, and that will be Mara's bewilderment. </p>
        <p>Following it, you put an end to suffering and stress.
        I have taught you this path for knowing the extraction of
        arrows. </p>
        <p>It's for you to strive ardently. Tathagatas simply
        point out the way. Those who practice, absorbed in jhana:
        from Mara's bonds they'll be freed. </p>
