The offering of lights, flowers, food, fruit juice, incense, etc.
in the name of the Buddha is yet another practice, the meaning
of which some people fail to understand. Offering of such things
to holy persons is in fact an oriental custom. Even during the
Buddha's time, it was customary among Indian people to carry some
flowers whenever they visited a holy person. This is only done
as a mark of respect. Devout Buddhists likewise always offer something
in the name of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. This symbolic act
gives them a sense of happiness, peace, and relief. 
<P>
At the same time, understanding Buddhists often use the same offerings
as objects of their meditation. They are fully aware that these
physical objects are simple representations of things spiritual.
The flame of the candle or oil lamp and the flowers could each
be compared to the physical body of life. The offering of light
symbolises the dispelling of darkness or ignorance through light.
The existence of the flame and its brightness, the beauty of the
flowers, the aroma of incense and the final fading away of such
brightness and beauty only to manifest their impermanence; hence
all these natural phenomena could be taken up as suitable objects
for meditation. The flowers on the altar represent one of the
most beautiful and yet one of the most transient forms of nature.
<P>
These offerings symbolises meritorious deeds because of the wholesome
and devout mental states they induce. Therefore time spent in
a shrine room in offering some of these articles and reciting
some verses is not at all wasted. The devotees' pious acts have
the effect of pleasing themselves and calming the mind. It is
good to start out daily work after offering some of these objects
to the Buddha as a mark of respect to the holy religious teacher
who has shown us the correct path for our peace, happiness, and
salvation.
<P>
However, Buddhists should not be satisfied by simply offering
something in the name of the Buddha, reciting in a parrot-fashion
some verses or Suttas thinking that their duty has been done.
To become good Buddhists, they have to do something more; they
have to correct themselves by following the Buddha's advice. Try
to gain more knowledge and understanding through His Teaching.
One should not think that by just offering something to the Buddha,
one's wrong doings can be eradicated.
