    <p>Wat Wana Potiyahn [<a href="#1">1</a>]<a name="r1"></a>
    here is certainly very peaceful, but this is meaningless if
    our minds are not calm.&nbsp;&nbsp; All places are
    peaceful.&nbsp;&nbsp; That some may seem distracting is
    because of our minds.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, a quiet place can
    help to become calm, by giving one the opportunity to train
    and thus harmonize with its calm.</p>
    <p>You should all bear in mind that this practice is
    difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp; To train other things is not so
    difficult, it's easy, but the human mind is hard to
    train.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord Buddha trained his
    mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind is the important
    thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything within this body-mind system
    comes together at the mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; The eyes, ears, nose,
    tongue and body all receive sensations and send them into the
    mind, which is the supervisor of all the other sense
    organs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore it is important to train the
    mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the mind is well trained all problems
    come to an end.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are still problems it's
    because the mind still doubts, it doesn't know in accordance
    with the truth.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why there are problems.</p>
    <p>So recognize that all of you have come fully prepared for
    practicing Dhamma.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether standing, walking,
    sitting or reclining, the tools you need with which to
    practice are well-provided, wherever you are.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    They are there, just like the Dhamma.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dhamma
    is something which abounds everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right
    here, on land or in water &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
    wherever &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; the Dhamma is always
    there.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dhamma is perfect and complete, but
    it's our practice that's not yet complete.</p>
    <p>The Lord, Fully Enlightened Buddha taught a means by which
    all of us may practice and come to know this
    Dhamma.&nbsp;&nbsp; It isn't a big thing, only a small thing,
    but it's right.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, look at
    hair.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we know even one strand of hair, then we
    know every strand, both our own and also that of
    others.&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that they are all simply
    &quot;hair.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; By knowing one strand of hair
    we know it all.</p>
    <p>Or consider people.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we see the true nature
    of conditions within ourselves then we know all the other
    people in the world also, because all people are the
    same.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dhamma is like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a
    small thing and yet it's big.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, to see the
    truth of one condition is to see the truth of them
    all.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we know the truth as it is all problems
    come to an end.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, the training is difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why
    is it difficult?&nbsp;&nbsp; It's difficult because of
    wanting, <strong><i>tanha</i></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you
    don't &quot;want&quot; then you don't practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But if you practice out of desire you won't see the
    Dhamma.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about it, all of you.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If you don't want to practice you can't practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You must first want to practice in order to actually do the
    practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether stepping forward or stepping
    back you meet desire.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why the cultivators
    of the past have said that this practice is something that's
    extremely difficult to do.</p>
    <p>You don't see Dhamma because of desire.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sometimes desire is very strong, you want to see the Dhamma
    immediately, but the Dhamma is not your mind -- your mind is
    not yet Dhamma.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dhamma is one thing and the
    mind is another.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not that whatever you like
    is Dhamma and whatever you don't like isn't.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That's not the way it goes.</p>
    <p>Actually this mind of ours is simply a condition of
    Nature, like a tree in the forest.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want a
    plank or a beam it must come from the tree, but the tree is
    still only a tree.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not yet a beam or a
    plank.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before it can really be of use to us we
    must take that tree and saw it into beams or
    planks.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the same tree but it becomes
    transformed into something else.&nbsp;&nbsp; Intrinsically
    it's just a tree, a condition of Nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in
    its raw state it isn't yet of much use to those who need
    timber.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our mind is like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
    a condition of Nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; As such it perceives
    thoughts, it discriminates into beautiful and ugly and so on.</p>
    <p>This mind of ours must be further trained.&nbsp;&nbsp; We
    can't just let it be.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a condition of Nature
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; train it to realize that it's a
    condition of Nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; Improve on Nature so that
    it's appropriate to our needs, which is Dhamma.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Dhamma is something which must be practiced and brought
    within.</p>
    <p>If you don't practice you won't know.&nbsp;&nbsp; Frankly
    speaking, you won't know the Dhamma by just reading it or
    studying it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or if you do know it your knowledge
    is still defective.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, this spittoon
    here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everybody knows it's a spittoon but they
    don't fully know the spittoon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why don't they
    fully know it?&nbsp;&nbsp; If I called this spittoon a
    saucepan, what would you say?&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose that every
    time I asked for it I said, &quot;Please bring that saucepan
    over here&quot;, that would confuse you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why
    so?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because you don't fully know the
    spittoon.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you did there would be no
    problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; You would simply pick up that object and
    hand it to me, because actually there isn't any
    spittoon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you understand?&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a
    spittoon due to convention.&nbsp;&nbsp; This convention is
    accepted all over the country, so it's spittoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But there isn't any real &quot;spittoon.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; If
    somebody wants to call it a saucepan it can be a
    saucepan.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be whatever you call
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is called
    &quot;concept.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we fully know the
    spittoon, even if somebody calls it a saucepan there's no
    problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever others may call it we are
    unperturbed because we are not blind to its true
    nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one who knows Dhamma.</p>
    <p>Now let's come back to ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose
    somebody said, &quot;You're crazy!&quot;, or, &quot;You're
    stupid&quot;, for example.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though it may not
    be true, you wouldn't feel so good.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything
    becomes difficult because of our ambitions to have and to
    achieve.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of these desires to get and to
    be, because we don't know according to the truth, we have no
    contentment.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we know the Dhamma, are
    enlightened to the Dhamma, greed, aversion and delusion will
    disappear.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we understand the way things are
    there is nothing for them to rest on.</p>
    <p>Why is the practice so difficult and arduous?&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Because of desires.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as we sit down to
    meditate we want to become peaceful.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we didn't
    want to find peace we wouldn't sit, we wouldn't
    practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as we sit down we want peace to
    be right there, but wanting the mind to be calm makes for
    confusion, and we feel restless.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how it
    goes.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Buddha says, &quot;Don't speak out
    of desire, don't sit out of desire, don't walk out of desire,
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; Whatever you do, don't do it with
    desire.&quot; Desire means wanting.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't
    want to do something you won't do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; If our
    practice reaches this point we can get quite
    discouraged.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can we practice?&nbsp;&nbsp; As
    soon as we sit down there is desire in the mind.</p>
    <p>It's because of this that the body and mind are difficult
    to observe.&nbsp;&nbsp; If they are not the self nor
    belonging to self then who do they belong to?&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's difficult to resolve these things, we must rely on
    wisdom.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha says we must practice with
    &quot;letting go,&quot; isn't it?&nbsp;&nbsp; If we let go
    then we just don't practice,
    right?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; Because we've
    let go.</p>
    <p>Suppose we went to buy some coconuts in the market, and
    while we were carrying them back someone asked:</p>
    <p>&quot;What did you buy those coconuts for?&quot;<br>
    &quot;I bought them to eat.&quot;<br>
    &quot;Are you going to eat the shells as well?&quot;<br>
    &quot;No.&quot;<br>
    &quot;I don't believe you.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're not going to
    eat the shells then why did you buy them also?&quot;</p>
    <p>Well what do you say?&nbsp;&nbsp; How are you going to
    answer their question?&nbsp;&nbsp; We practice with
    desire.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we didn't have desire we wouldn't
    practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Practicing with desire is <strong><i>tanha</i></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Contemplating in this way can give rise to wisdom, you
    know.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, those coconuts: Are you going
    to eat the shells as well?&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course
    not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then why do you take them?&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Because the time hasn't yet come for you to throw them
    away.&nbsp;&nbsp; They're useful for wrapping up the coconut
    in.&nbsp;&nbsp; If, after eating the coconut, you throw the
    shells away, there is no problem.</p>
    <p>Our practice is like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha said,
    &quot;Don't act on desire, don't speak from desire, don't eat
    with desire.&quot; Standing, walking, sitting or reclining
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; whatever
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; don't do it with
    desire.&nbsp;&nbsp; This means to do it with
    detachment.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just like buying the coconuts
    from the market.&nbsp;&nbsp; We're not going to eat the
    shells but it's not yet time to throw them away.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We keep them first.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how the practice
    is.&nbsp;&nbsp; Concept and Transcendence [<a href="#2">2</a>]
    <a name="r2"></a>are co-existent, just like a
    coconut.&nbsp;&nbsp; The flesh, the husk and the shell are
    all together.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we buy it we buy the whole
    lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; If somebody wants to accuse us of eating
    coconut shells that's their business, we know what we're
    doing.</p>
    <p>Wisdom is something each of us find for
    oneself.&nbsp;&nbsp; To see it we must go neither fast nor
    slow.&nbsp;&nbsp; What should we do?&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to where
    there is neither fast nor slow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Going fast or
    going slow are not the way.</p>
    <p>But we're all impatient, we're in a hurry.&nbsp;&nbsp; As
    soon as we begin we want to rush to the end, we don't want to
    be left behind.&nbsp;&nbsp; We want to succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When it comes to fixing their minds for meditation some
    people go too far &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; They light the
    incense, prostrate and make a vow, &quot;As long as this
    incense is not yet completely burnt I will not rise from my
    sitting, even if I collapse or die, no matter what
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; I'll die
    sitting.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having made their vow they start
    their sitting.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as they start to sit
    Mara's [<a href="#3">3</a>]<a name="r3"></a> hordes come
    rushing at them from all sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; They've only sat
    for an instant and already they think the incense must be
    finished.&nbsp;&nbsp; They open their eyes for a peek
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; &quot;Oh, There's still ages
    left!&quot;</p>
    <p>They grit their teeth and sit some more, feeling hot,
    flustered, agitated and confused &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
    Reaching the breaking point they think, &quot;it must be
    finished by now.&quot; &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; Have
    another peek &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; &quot;Oh,
    no!&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not even <i>half-way</i> yet!&quot;</p>
    <p>Two or three times and it's still not finished, so they
    just give up, pack it in and sit there hating
    themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm so stupid, I'm so
    hopeless!&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; They sit and hate themselves,
    feeling like a hopeless case.&nbsp;&nbsp; This just gives
    rise to frustration and hindrances.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is
    called the hindrance of ill-will.&nbsp;&nbsp; They can't
    blame others so they blame themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; And why is
    this?&nbsp;&nbsp; It's all because of wanting.</p>
    <p>Actually it isn't necessary to go through all
    that.&nbsp;&nbsp; To concentrate means to concentrate with
    detachment, not to concentrate yourself into knots.</p>
    <p>But maybe we read the scriptures, about the life of the
    Buddha, how he sat under the Bodhi tree and determined to
    himself, &quot;As long as I have still not attained Supreme
    Enlightenment I will not rise from this place, even if my
    blood dries up&quot;.</p>
    <p>Reading this in the books you may think of trying it
    yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll do it like the
    Buddha.&nbsp;&nbsp; But you haven't considered that your car
    is only a small one.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha's car was a
    really big one, he could take it all in one go.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    With only your tiny, little car, how can you possibly take it
    all at once?&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a different story altogether.</p>
    <p>Why do we think like that?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we're too
    extreme.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes we go too low, sometimes we go
    too high.&nbsp;&nbsp; The point of balance is so hard to
    find.</p>
    <p>Now I'm only speaking from experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
    past my practice was like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Practicing in
    order to get beyond wanting &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; if we
    don't want, can we practice? I was stuck here.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But to practice with wanting is suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
    didn't know what to do, I was baffled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I
    realized that the practice which is steady is the important
    thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; One must practice
    consistently.&nbsp;&nbsp; They call this the practice that is
    &quot;consistent in all postures.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep
    refining the practice, don't let it become a
    disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice is one thing, disaster is
    another [<a href="#4">4</a>].<a name="r4"></a> Most people
    usually create disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp; When they feel lazy they
    don't bother to practice, they only practice when they feel
    energetic.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how I tended to be.</p>
    <p>All of you ask yourselves now, is this right?&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To practice when you feel like it, not when you don't: is
    that in accordance with the Dhamma?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it
    straight?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it in line with the
    Teaching?&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what makes practice
    inconsistent.</p>
    <p>Whether you feel like it or not you should practice just
    the same: this is how the Buddha taught.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most
    people wait till they're in the mood before practicing, when
    they don't feel like it they don't bother.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
    is as far as they go.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is called
    &quot;disaster,&quot; it's not practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
    true practice, whether you are happy or depressed you
    practice; whether it's easy or difficult you practice;
    whether it's hot or cold you practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's
    straight like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the real practice, whether
    standing, walking, sitting or reclining you must have the
    intention to continue the practice steadily, making your <i>sati</i>
    consistent in all postures.</p>
    <p>At first thought it seems as if you should stand for as
    long as you walk, walk for as long as you sit, sit for as
    long as you lie down &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; I've tried
    it but I couldn't do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a meditator were to
    make his standing, walking, sitting and lying down all equal,
    how many days could he keep it up for?&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand for
    five minutes, sit for five minutes, lie down for five minutes
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; I couldn't do it for very
    long.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I sat down and thought about it some
    more.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What does it all mean?&nbsp;&nbsp;
    People in this world can't practice like this!&quot;</p>
    <p>Then I realized &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; &quot;Oh,
    that's not right, it can't be right because it's impossible
    to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing, walking, sitting, reclining
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; make them all
    consistent.&nbsp;&nbsp; To make the postures consistent the
    way they explain it in the books is impossible.&quot;</p>
    <p>But it is possible to do this: The mind
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; just consider the
    mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; To have <strong><i>sati</i></strong>,
    recollection, <strong><i>sampajanna</i></strong>, self
    awareness and <strong><i>panna</i></strong>, all-round wisdom
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; this you can do.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
    is something that's really worth practicing.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
    means that while standing we have <strong><i>sati</i></strong>,
    while walking we have <strong><i>sati</i></strong>, while
    sitting we have <strong><i>sati</i></strong>, and while
    reclining we have <strong><i>sati</i></strong>, --
    consistently. This is possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; We put awareness
    into our standing, walking, sitting, lying down -- into all
    postures.</p>
    <p>When the mind has been trained like this it will
    constantly recollect Buddho, Buddho, Buddho
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; which is knowing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Knowing what?&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing what is right and what is
    wrong at all times.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, this is
    possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is getting down to the real
    practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, whether standing, walking,
    sitting or lying down there is continuous <strong><i>sati</i></strong>.</p>
    <p>Then you should understand those conditions which should
    be given up and those which should be cultivated.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You know happiness, you know unhappiness.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
    you know happiness and unhappiness your mind will settle at
    the point which is free of happiness and
    unhappiness.&nbsp;&nbsp; Happiness is the loose path, <strong><i>kamasukhallikanuyogo</i></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Unhappiness is the tight path, <strong><i>attakilamathanuyogo</i></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="#5">5</a>] <a name="r5"></a>If we know these two
    extremes, we pull it back.&nbsp;&nbsp; We know when the mind
    is inclining towards happiness or unhappiness and we pull it
    back, we don't allow it to lean over.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have
    this sort of awareness, we adhere to the One Path, the single
    Dhamma.&nbsp;&nbsp; We adhere to the awareness, not allowing
    the mind to follow its inclinations.</p>
    <p>But in your practice it doesn't tend to be like that, does
    it?&nbsp;&nbsp; You follow your inclinations.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
    you follow your inclinations it's easy, isn't it?&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But this is the ease which causes suffering, like someone who
    can't be bothered working.&nbsp;&nbsp; He takes it easy, but
    when the time comes to eat he hasn't got
    anything.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how it goes.</p>
    <p>So I've contended with many aspects of the Buddha's
    teaching in the past, but I couldn't really beat
    him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays I accept it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I accept
    that the many teachings of the Buddha are straight down the
    line, so I've taken those teachings and used them to train
    both myself and others.</p>
    <p>The practice which is important is<strong> </strong><strong><i>patipada</i></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What is <strong><i>patipada</i></strong>?&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
    simply all our various activities, standing, walking,
    sitting, reclining and everything else.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is
    the <strong><i>patipada</i></strong> of the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now the <strong><i>patipada</i></strong> of the mind: how
    many times in the course of today have you felt
    low?&nbsp;&nbsp; How many times have you felt
    high?&nbsp;&nbsp; Have there been any noticeable
    feelings?&nbsp;&nbsp; We must know ourselves like
    this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having seen those feelings can we let
    go?&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever we can't yet let go of we must work
    with.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we see that we can't yet let go of
    some particular feeling we must take it and examine it with
    wisdom.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reason it out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Work with
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example
    when you are feeling zealous, practice, and then when you
    feel lazy, try to continue the practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you
    can't continue at &quot;full speed&quot; then at least do
    half as much.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't just waste the day away by
    being lazy and not practicing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing that will
    lead to disaster, it's not the way of a cultivator.</p>
    <p>Now I've heard some people say, &quot;Oh, this year I was
    really in a bad way.&quot;<br>
    &quot;How come?&quot;<br>
    &quot;I was sick all year.&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't practice at
    all.&quot;</p>
    <p>Oh!&nbsp;&nbsp; If they don't practice when death is near
    when will they ever practice?&nbsp;&nbsp; If they're feeling
    well do you think they'll practice?&nbsp;&nbsp; No, they only
    get lost in happiness.&nbsp;&nbsp; If they're suffering they
    still don't practice, they get lost in that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
    don't know when people think they're going to
    practice!&nbsp;&nbsp; They can only see that they're sick, in
    pain, almost dead from fever &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
    that's right, bring it on heavy, that's where the practice
    is.&nbsp;&nbsp; When people are feeling happy it just goes to
    their heads and they get vain and conceited.</p>
    <p>We must cultivate our practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; What this
    means is that whether you are happy or unhappy you must
    practice just the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are feeling well
    you should practice, and if you are feeling sick you should
    also practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who think, &quot;This year I
    couldn't practice at all, I was sick the whole time&quot;
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; if these people are feeling well,
    they just walk around singing songs.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is
    wrong thinking, not right thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why
    the cultivators of the past have all maintained the steady
    training of the heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; If things are to go wrong,
    just let them be with the body, not in mind.</p>
    <p>There was a time in my practice, after I had been
    practicing about five years, when I felt that living with
    others was a hindrance.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would sit in my <strong><i>kuti</i></strong>
    (hut) and try to meditate and people would keep coming by for
    a chat and disturbing me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran off to live by
    myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I couldn't practice with those
    people bothering me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was fed up, so I went to
    live in a small, deserted monastery in the forest, near a
    small village.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stayed there alone, speaking to
    no-one -- because there was nobody else to speak to.</p>
    <p>After I'd been there about fifteen days the thought arose,
    &quot;Hmm.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be good to have a novice or <strong>pa-kow</strong>
    [<a href="#6">6</a>]<a name="r6"></a> here with
    me.&nbsp;&nbsp; He could help me out with some small
    jobs.&quot; I knew it would come up, and sure enough, there
    it was!</p>
    <p>&quot;Hey!&nbsp;&nbsp; You're a real
    character!&nbsp;&nbsp; You say you're fed up with your
    friends, fed up with your fellow monks and novices, and now
    you want a novice.&nbsp;&nbsp; What's this?&quot;<br>
    &quot;No&quot;, it says, &quot;I want a good novice.&quot;<br>
    &quot;There!&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are all the good people, can
    you find any?&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are you going to find a good
    person?&nbsp;&nbsp; In the whole monastery there were only
    no-good people.&nbsp;&nbsp; You must have been the only good
    person, to have run away like this!&quot;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; You have to follow it up like
    this, follow up the tracks of your thoughts until you see
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; &quot;Hmm.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is
    the important one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is there a good person
    to be found?&nbsp;&nbsp; There aren't any good people, you
    must find goodness anywhere else, you must look within
    yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are good in yourself then
    wherever you go will be good.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether others
    criticize or praise you, you are still good.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
    you aren't good, then when others criticize you, you get
    angry, and when they praise you, you get pleased.</p>
    <p>At that time I reflected on this and have found it to be
    true from that day up until the present.&nbsp;&nbsp; Goodness
    must be found within.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as I saw this, that
    feeling of wanting to run away disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp; In
    later times, whenever I had that desire arise I let it
    go.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever it arose I was aware of it and kept
    my awareness on that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus I had a solid
    foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever I lived, whether people
    condemned me or whatever they would say, I would reflect that
    the point is not whether they were good or bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Good or evil must be seen within ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    However other people are, that's their concern.</p>
    <p>Don't go thinking, &quot;Oh, today is too hot&quot;, or,
    &quot;Today is too cold,&quot; or, &quot;Today is
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever the
    day is like that's just the way it is.&nbsp;&nbsp; Really you
    are simply blaming the weather for your own
    laziness.&nbsp;&nbsp; We must see the Dhamma within
    ourselves, then there is a surer kind of peace.</p>
    <p>So for all of you who have come to practice here, even
    though it's only for a few days, still many things will
    arise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many things may be arising which you're
    not even aware of.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is some right thinking,
    some wrong thinking &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; many, many
    things.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I say this practice is difficult.</p>
    <p>Even though some of you may experience some peace when you
    sit in meditation, don't be in a hurry to congratulate
    yourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, if there is some confusion,
    don't blame yourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; If things seem to be
    good, don't delight in them, and if they're not good don't be
    averse to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just look at it all, look at what
    you have.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just look, don't bother
    judging.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it's good don't hold fast to it; if
    it's bad, don't cling to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good and bad can
    both bite, so don't hold fast to them.</p>
    <p>The practice is simply to sit, sit and watch it
    all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good moods and bad moods come and go as is
    their nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't only praise your mind or only
    condemn it, know the right time for these things.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When it's time for congratulations then congratulate it, but
    just a little, don't overdo it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like
    teaching a child, sometimes you may have to spank it a
    little.&nbsp;&nbsp; In our practice sometimes we may have to
    punish ourselves, but don't punish yourself all the
    time.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you punish yourself all the time in a
    while you'll just give yourself a good time and take it easy
    either.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's not the way to
    practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; We practice according to the Middle
    Way.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the Middle Way?&nbsp;&nbsp; This
    Middle Way is difficult to follow, you can't rely on your
    moods and desires.</p>
    <p>Don't think that only sitting with the eyes closed is
    practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do think this way then quickly
    change your thinking!&nbsp;&nbsp; Steady practice is having
    the attitude of practice while standing, walking, sitting and
    lying down.&nbsp;&nbsp; When coming out of sitting
    meditation, reflect that you're simply changing
    postures.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you reflect in this way you will
    have peace.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever you are you will have this
    attitude of practice with you constantly, you will have a
    steady awareness within yourself.</p>
    <p>Those of you who, having finished their evening sitting,
    simply indulge in their moods, spending the whole day letting
    the mind wander where it wants, will find that the next
    evening when sitting meditation all they get is the
    &quot;backwash&quot; from the day's aimless
    thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no foundation of calm because
    they have let it go cold all day.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you practice
    like this your mind gets gradually further and further from
    the practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I ask some of my disciples,
    &quot;How is your meditation going?&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; They
    say, &quot;Oh, it's all gone now&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; You
    see?&nbsp;&nbsp; They can keep it up for a month or two but
    in a year or two it's all finished.</p>
    <p>Why is this?&nbsp;&nbsp; It's because they don't take this
    essential point into their practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; When they've
    finished sitting they let go of their <strong><i>samadhi</i></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    They start to sit for shorter and shorter periods, till they
    reach the point where as soon as they start to sit they want
    to finish.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually they don't even
    sit.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the same with bowing to the
    Buddha-image.&nbsp;&nbsp; At first they make the effort to
    prostrate every night before going to sleep, but after a
    while their minds begin to stray.&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon they don't
    bother to prostrate at all, they just nod, till eventually
    it's all gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; They throw out the practice
    completely.</p>
    <p>Therefore, understand the importance of <strong><i>sati</i></strong>,
    practice constantly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right practice is steady
    practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether standing, walking, sitting or
    reclining the practice must continue.&nbsp;&nbsp; This means
    that practice, meditation, is done in the mind, not in the
    body.&nbsp;&nbsp; If our mind has zeal, is conscientious and
    ardent, then there will be awareness.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind is
    the important thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind is that which
    supervises everything we do.</p>
    <p>When we understand properly then we practice
    properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we practice properly we don't go
    astray.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if we only do a little that is still
    all right.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, when you finish sitting
    in meditation, remind yourselves that you are not actually
    finishing meditation, you are simply changing
    postures.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your mind is still
    composed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether standing, walking, sitting or
    reclining you have <strong><i>sati</i></strong> with
    you.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have this kind of awareness you can
    maintain your internal practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening
    when you sit again the practice continues
    uninterrupted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your effort is unbroken, allowing
    the mind to attain calm.</p>
    <p>This is called steady practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether we are
    talking or doing other things we should try to make the
    practice continuous.&nbsp;&nbsp; If our mind has recollection
    and self-awareness continuously, our practice will naturally
    develop, it will gradually come together.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    mind will find peace, because it will know what is right and
    what is wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will see what is happening
    within us and realize peace.</p>
    <p>If we are to develop <strong><i>sila</i></strong> (moral
    restraint), or <strong><i>samadhi</i></strong> (firmness of
    mind) we must first have <strong><i>panna</i></strong>
    (wisdom).&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people think that they'll develop
    moral restraint one year, <i>samadhi</i> the next year and
    the year after that they'll develop wisdom.&nbsp;&nbsp; They
    think these three things are separate.&nbsp;&nbsp; They think
    that this year they will develop, but if the mind is not firm
    (<strong><i>samadhi</i></strong>), how can they do
    it?&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is no understanding, (<strong><i>panna</i></strong>)
    how can they do it?&nbsp;&nbsp; Without <strong><i>samadhi</i></strong>
    or <strong><i>panna</i></strong>, <strong><i>sila</i></strong>
    will be sloppy.</p>
    <p>In fact these three come together at the same
    point.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we have <strong><i>sila</i></strong>
    we have <strong><i>samadhi</i></strong>, when we have <strong><i>samadhi</i></strong>
    we have <strong><i>panna</i></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are
    all one, like a mango.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it's small or
    fully grown, it's still a mango.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it's ripe
    it's still the same mango.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we think in simple
    terms like this we can see it more easily.&nbsp;&nbsp; We
    don't have to learn a lot of things, just to know these
    things, to know our practice.</p>
    <p>When it comes to meditation some people don't get what
    they want, so they just give up, saying they don't yet have
    the merit to practice meditation.&nbsp;&nbsp; They can do bad
    things, they have that sort of talent, but they don't have
    the talent to do good.&nbsp;&nbsp; They throw it in, saying
    they don't have a good enough foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is
    the way people are, they side with their defilements.</p>
    <p>Now that you have this chance to practice, please
    understand that whether you find it difficult or easy to
    develop <strong><i>samadhi</i></strong> is entirely up to
    you, not the <strong><i>samadhi</i></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
    it is difficult, it is because you are practicing
    wrongly.&nbsp;&nbsp; In our practice we must have &quot;Right
    View&quot; (<strong><i>sammaditthi</i></strong>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If our view is right then everything else is right: Right
    View, Right Intention, Right Speech, Right Action, Right
    Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Recollection, Right
    Concentration -- the Eightfold Path.&nbsp;&nbsp; When there
    is Right View all the other factors will follow on.</p>
    <p>Whatever happens, don't let your mind stray off the
    track.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look within yourself and you will see
    clearly.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the best practice, as I see it, it
    isn't necessary to read many books.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take all the
    books and lock them away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just read your own
    mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have all been burying yourselves in
    books from the time you entered school.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think
    that now you have this opportunity and have the time, take
    the books, put them in a cupboard and lock the
    door.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just read your mind.</p>
    <p>Whenever something arises within the mind, whether you
    like it or not, whether it seems right or wrong, just cut it
    off with, &quot;this is not a sure thing.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Whatever arises just cut it down, &quot;not sure, not
    sure.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; With just this single ax you can cut
    it all down.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's all &quot;not sure.&quot;</p>
    <p>For the duration of this next month that you will be
    staying in this forest monastery, you should make a lot of
    headway.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will see the truth.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
    &quot;not sure&quot; is really an important one.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This one develops wisdom.&nbsp;&nbsp; The more you look the
    more you will see &quot;not sure'-ness.&nbsp;&nbsp; After
    you've cut something off with &quot;not sure&quot; it may
    come circling round and pop up again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, it's
    truly &quot;not sure.&quot; Whatever pops up just stick this
    one label on it all &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; &quot;not
    sure.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; You stick the sign on ..&quot;not
    sure' &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; and in a while, when its
    turn comes, it crops up again &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
    &quot;Ah, not sure.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dig here!&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Not sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will see this same old one who's
    been fooling you month in, month out, year in, year out, from
    the day you were born.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's only this one
    who's been fooling you all along.&nbsp;&nbsp; See this and
    realize the way things are.</p>
    <p>When your practice reaches this point you won't cling to
    sensations, because they are all uncertain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have
    you ever noticed?&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you see a clock and
    think, &quot;Oh, this is nice.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buy it and
    see &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; in not many days you're bored
    with it already.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This pen is really
    beautiful,&quot; so you take the trouble to buy
    one.&nbsp;&nbsp; In not many months you tire of it
    again.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how it is.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is
    there any certainty?</p>
    <p>If we see all these things as uncertain then their value
    fades away.&nbsp;&nbsp; All things become
    insignificant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why should we hold on to things
    that have no value?&nbsp;&nbsp; We keep them only as we might
    keep an old rag to wipe our feet with.&nbsp;&nbsp; We see all
    sensations as equal in value because they all have the same
    nature.</p>
    <p>When we understand sensations we understand the
    world.&nbsp;&nbsp; The world is sensations and sensations are
    the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we aren't fooled by sensations we
    aren't fooled by the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we aren't fooled
    by the world we aren't fooled by sensations.</p>
    <p>The mind which sees this will have a firm foundation of
    wisdom.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a mind will not have many
    problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any problems it does have it can
    solve.&nbsp;&nbsp; When there are no more problems there are
    no more doubts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Peace arises in their
    stead.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is called
    &quot;Practice.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we really practice it
    must be like this.</p>
