        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Vicinity of Nibbàna</font></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right now, those of us who are Buddhist
        monks and nuns, and those who are serious lay practitioners, are in the
        vicinity of <i>Nibbàna</i>. Being in this situation, we should recall
        that we are practising in precisely the same way that men and women,
        young and old, have been practising for the last twenty-five centuries,
        and eventually we too will achieve the same results. We are in the
        presence of <i>Nibbàna</i> in the sense that we have taken up the
        practice that is conducive to <i>Nibbàna</i>. Sometimes it's hard to
        realize how close it can be. One doesn't realize that all we have to do
        is turn our head, to make just a slight change in our way of looking at
        things, to open ourselves up to the same truth that the Buddha saw --
        the same truth that Venerables <i>Sàriputta, Mahàmoggallàna,
        Mahàkassapa, Ànanda, Anuruddha</i>, and all the other great Arahants
        of the last twenty-five centuries have seen. It was there then, it is
        here now. We should recall this frequently. Recall that there have been
        thousands, even tens of thousands of Arahants in the past, and that
        there will be many hundreds, thousands, even tens of thousands of
        Arahants in the future. This path is still available, and when the path
        is available, so are the fruits.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a book called <i>A Manual of a
        Mysti</i>c, an old treatise on meditation found in an obscure monastery
        in Sri Lanka many decades ago [1]. Part of the meditation practice
        described in it is just the above recollection, the recollection of all
        the Arahants who achieved the sublime bliss of <i>Nibbàna</i> in the
        past. And now, here you are, embarking on the same journey, doing the
        same things, which <i>must </i>give rise to the same fruits. This was
        the promise of the Buddha. He said that this Dhamma leads one way and
        one way only: it leads to <i>Nibbàna</i>. If you can get into the
        stream, it will sweep you all the way down to the sea.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such recollections, done frequently,
        give rise to great joy, happiness, and confidence; they give rise to
        faith in this practice which we call Buddhism, the Dhamma. This faith in
        turn gives rise to energy, so that we can have the will -- the sustained
        will -- to do what is necessary to transform our initial glimmer of
        faith into sustained realization.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You are in the presence of <i>Nibbàna</i>
        every time you open up one of the books of the Tipitaka and reads the
        teachings of the Buddha. You are in the presence of <i>Nibbàna</i>
        because there is just a thin veil between you and the Dhamma. When the
        Buddha taught these teachings to monks like Venerable <i>Bàhiya</i> (<i>Udàna</i>
        1:10), just the teachings alone were enough to give people of that
        calibre great Insight, Insight which closed the gap between them and <i>Nibbàna</i>.
        They were not just in the presence of <i>Nibbàna</i>; they had made
        that one step further into <i>Nibbàna</i>, into the full realization of
        <i>Nibbàna</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Venerable Bahiya and others like him
        probably never imagined that they were so close to such a marvellous and
        sublime event, yet they became great disciples of the Buddha. Indeed,
        when people look through the glasses of delusion, they often think:
        &quot;How could someone like me ever gain this sublime bliss of <i>Nibbàna</i>?
        How could I ever attain a <i>Jhàna</i>? How could one like me ever
        penetrate such a deep and profound Dhamma?&quot; <i>But the Buddha said
        that you can! </i>You can because you already have the confidence and
        faith to take up the brown robe of the Lord Buddha or to practise his
        teachings earnestly as a lay person.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lending an Ear</font></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">An important aspect of the path, in
        addition to virtue and good conduct, is the study of the Buddha's
        teachings. The Buddha put it very beautifully in his discourses: one
        lends an ear, bends the ear, listens with interest, and applies the
        mind, so that what one hears can enter deep within the mind and settle
        there. As it settles, over the weeks, months, and years, it will grow
        and bear fruit. One day this fruit will be so sweet, the fruit of
        Enlightenment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As one lends an ear to the Dhamma,
        contemplating it, and allowing it to sweep over the mind like a
        beautiful breeze on a warm day, allowing it to soak in and to penetrate
        deep into the mind, it penetrates deeper than thought, deeper than the
        intellect, far deeper than the faultfinding mind, and far far deeper
        than the familiar mind. The Dhamma penetrates into that part of the mind
        that one has yet to know -- waiting there, waiting until, through the
        practice of meditation, one enters those very refined, beautiful, and
        subtle states of mind where these seeds of the Dhamma are resting,
        waiting to bear fruit, waiting to give the bliss of Enlightenment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One has faith and confidence because one
        knows that others have realized this in the past. Sometimes people think
        that the great masters, the great monks and nuns of old, were somehow
        supermen and superwomen. But many of them started off as no different
        from most practitioners today. Sometimes the most unlikely candidates
        became the greatest saints. They took up the training to the best of
        their abilities; they persevered in their attempts to get hold of the
        mind and to calm it, to lead it to one-pointedness, to stillness. Then
        one day, through the accumulation of all their effort, the accumulation
        of all their practice of virtue, the accumulation of meditations --
        sometimes nodding meditation and sometimes scattered meditation --
        through the accumulation of their learning, and of their reflections,
        and of their small insights, they eventually succeeded in breaking
        through the barriers that separated them from their goal.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One Drop at a Time</font></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha compares the practice of the
        Dhamma to a pot filling up one drop at a time. There comes the moment
        when just one more drop falls into the pot, and then the pot overflows:
        the Dhamma is seen. One never knows when the time for that last drop to
        fall has arrived. The ordinary, unenlightened individual can never see
        this pot getting filled because it's in a part of the mind to which he
        or she as yet has no access -- but little by little it's getting filled.
        One day it will become completely full, and it will spill over into the
        mind as you know it now and lead one into the source, into this
        innermost mind, which is usually hidden by the defilements and the
        hindrances. This is when one starts to see the source which the Buddha
        called &quot;the housebuilder,&quot; the creator of birth and suffering.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, whether one is a monastic or one
        with lay precepts, one should never give up the effort, never give up
        the training. This is a theme that runs throughout the Buddha's
        teachings. If one gives up the training in virtue, meditation, and
        wisdom, one has no chance of success. But if one continues with the
        training, if one continues following the Buddha's instructions, one will
        find that this training leads in only one way. It leads to <i>Nibbàna</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This message is beautifully encapsulated
        in some of the best advice I ever got from a highly respected monk in
        Sri Lanka. It's a piece of advice I always value and keep in mind. He
        told me that at the end of each day, it doesn't matter so much what
        stage one has attained, or what one has achieved. What really matters is
        whether one has really practised to the limit of one's ability that day
        -- whether one has really tried one's best -- or instead has been slack
        and heedless, forgetting the Buddha's teachings, and forgetting one's
        faith that these teachings actually lead to <i>Nibbàna</i>. If at the
        end of the day you look back and know that you have tried your best,
        then you are accumulating spiritual qualities, you are getting inwardly
        filled with these precious drops of water, and drawing closer to the
        goal. By continuing in this way, it will happen and must happen, that
        Enlightenment will come as well. This reflection is a means of
        developing faith in the Buddha's teachings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha not only encouraged faith
        using the metaphoric &quot;carrot&quot; -- the encouragement,
        incitement, and reassurance that this path produces fruit; he also used
        the metaphoric &quot;stick.&quot; The stick is just reflecting and
        wisely seeing the consequences of going the wrong way -- into the realm
        of craving and desire, of disappointment and frustration; into the realm
        of suffering; into the realm of more births -- and uncertain births at
        that. Uncertain births produce uncertain results, sometimes with great
        suffering and torment. That is enough of a stick because it gives a
        sense of wholesome fear <i>(ottappa),</i> the fear of the consequences
        of not continuing to make an effort, of not continuing to walk this
        path, of not continuing to progress as far as your ability allows. It
        doesn't matter where you are on the path as long as you are stepping
        forward, as long as every day another drop falls, filling up that great
        jar inside yourself. If you are doing that, then you are in the presence
        of <i>Nibbàna</i>, in the sense that you are walking the path that
        gives rise to <i>Nibbàna</i>.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Virtue</font></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha and the Noble Ones always say
        that that path is the Noble Eightfold Path - the path of virtue <i>(sìla)</i>,
        concentration <i>(samàdhi)</i>, and wisdom<i> (paññà)</i>. To walk
        the path of virtue means that you will not harm any living being. One
        dwells with a mind intent on the happiness of all beings -- that
        softness of mind concerned with the welfare of all beings wherever they
        may be, including oneself. That virtue has to be perfected. It's not
        enough to have 90% virtue, or 95% virtue, or even 99% virtue. One's
        virtue must be fully purified, purified, first of all, by faith.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said that virtue is the
        foundation of the path. Virtue is the ground on which rest the higher
        aspects and factors of the Noble Eightfold Path. If this part of the
        path is weak, if one takes liberties with one's virtue and bends the
        rules, then it's going to weaken concentration and create impediments to
        the arising of wisdom. Thus out of faith and trust in the Buddha's
        teachings, and in the teachings of all the great monks and nuns one
        knows about, one resolves in a place which is deeper than the
        defilements, &quot;I shall uphold these precepts as if they were a
        golden casket full of jewels; I shall hold them up to my head; I shall
        value them and protect them. These are of the Buddha.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One famous meditation teacher used to
        tell his monk disciples that they should look after their alms bowls as
        if the bowls were the Buddha's head. One should regard virtue as what's <i>on
        top of </i>the Buddha's head, or even higher. One should hold it in such
        reverence and value it so much that one would not dare to deliberately
        go against any advice or pronouncement coming from Lord Buddha.
        Eventually, as one develops greater concentration and wisdom, one's
        faith and confidence in the Buddha's teaching grow to the extent that
        one would not transgress these precepts even for the sake of life. It
        becomes almost impossible to do so. The mind values them so highly
        because they come from the <i>Tathàgata</i>, because they lead to <i>Nibbàna</i>,
        and because, by empowering the mind to achieve concentration, they open
        up the door for wisdom to enter.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">At first one just has ordinary
        confidence and faith. But with each realization and with each deep
        insight, one's confidence and faith are transformed -- not into love or
        worship but into something higher and deeper than that. They are
        transformed into an enormous respect for that which is the highest of
        all. As it is said in the Ratana-sutta: <i>&quot;Na tena dhammena
        samatthi kiñci </i>-- There is nothing equal to this Dhamma&quot; (<i>Sutta-nipàta</i>,
        v.225). Once one realizes that the Dhamma is more valuable than anything
        else in the whole world, one would never transgress, damage, devalue, or
        demean virtue.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As virtue becomes strong in the
        practitioner, concentration happens by itself. It happens simply because
        the mind becomes pure. To become pure means to become free from
        defilements. It is actions that defile the mind, actions of body and
        speech, and also the thoughts which precede visible actions. The
        practice of virtue means getting hold of the mind which is being defiled
        by habitual patterns of unskillful reactions, the reactions of a crazy
        person, the reactions of a person who just cannot see. The mind is
        covered up with &quot;grease&quot; and &quot;dust&quot; so it cannot
        really see its own welfare. The practice of virtue is the first shining
        and cleaning up of the mind, wiping away the accumulated dust and grime
        of many lifetimes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those beings who walk in virtue, who
        speak and act kindly and wisely, seem to have nothing threatening or
        harmful about them. They radiate a beauty, magnetic attraction, which
        comes from the inner happiness they experience through their unblemished
        virtue. Each practitioner of this path should know that happiness, but
        it will only be known if it is pointed out. If a virtuous person takes
        the time to look.into his or her mind, to turn the apparatus of
        perception inward, he or she will see that their virtue is very pure,
        the virtue of the Buddha, and thus will gain more faith and confidence
        in the Buddha's teachings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">On this path towards Enlightenment one
        passes through different stages, and each of those stages brings its own
        happiness. These happy feelings are little confirmations that this path
        is leading in the right direction. They give encouragement, and one can
        ask, &quot;If this is the happiness I have achieved so far, what is the
        happiness that awaiting me at the next stage?&quot; Be warned, however,
        that the defilements make one turn away what is pure towards what is
        impure. One should make a deliberate effort to notice that pure, subtle,
        and refined happiness born of an unblemished lifestyle, a life of
        harmlessness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Maybe you consider your virtue to be as
        yet imperfect. But enough perfection is there; enough days and hours are
        spent in such a pure livelihood, pure speech, and pure action, that you
        should notice the result is an unblemished inward happiness. Turn to
        that; recognize it, and you will affirm it. This will give you extra
        confidence in the Buddha's teachings about the mind and about right
        practice of body and speech.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sense Restraint</font></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As one develops virtue and the restraint
        born of virtuous conduct, one realizes that the way to achieve
        perfection in virtue is by restraining the senses. One has to restrain
        oneself in speaking, looking, and listening. Why listen to every
        conversation around you ? &quot;What did they say? What are they
        doing?&quot; It doesn't concern you. It's much more beneficial to turn
        away from the conversations of the world, to turn away from the
        activities of people. One doesn't even look at what is happening
        outside; instead, one looks and listens to the activities inside
        oneself. This is what is called restraint. Instead of the senses turning
        outside, they start to turn inside and &quot;look&quot; at their own
        activity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the senses become more restrained,
        one starts to experience one of the first stages of the happiness born
        of peace, the happiness born of restraint, the happiness born when the
        mind is starting to experience calm. The senses are being quietened
        down; for one is guarding them. What are they being guarded from? They
        are being guarded from involvement in the world, which tends to excite
        and disturb our minds.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said that if one practises
        sense restraint one will experience a very pleasurable, pure, and
        beautiful result -- a quiet, peaceful, and settled happiness. Those who
        practise seriously, and particularly those who live and practise in
        quiet.places, should be able to realize this delightful state of peace.
        One should reflect and notice that happiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One is following the Buddha's teachings
        by delighting in wholesome states of mind. It is only unwise and
        unprofitable to delight in unwholesome states, in the satisfactions of
        the world of the five senses. That is where the Buddha said one will
        find danger. But as for the peace and happiness born of pure virtue and
        pure sense restraint, delight in it, enjoy it, indulge in it, and
        celebrate it. Do it out of faith in the Lord Buddha.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness and Clear Comprehension</font></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the gradual training sense restraint
        first gives rise to mindfulness and clear comprehension. Here the mind
        starts to feel its first experience of being in control, of being at the
        helm. Usually in our lives the senses are in control, and we have no
        freedom. As soon as there's a delightful object, straightaway the senses
        go to it. When an attractive person of the opposite sex passes by, the
        eyes go in that direction. As soon as a nice smell drifts up from the
        kitchen, the nose goes to it. As soon as there is an interesting
        conversation or pleasant music, the ears go straight to it. The senses
        are in control, not the mind, not wisdom.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, when one develops self-control
        by guarding the senses, mindfulness find room to grow. The mind acquires
        the power to know what is really going on, to direct attention to what
        is skillful and useful, and to resist getting lost in pointless
        entanglements and compulsive activities. When sense restraint gives rise
        to this mindfulness and clear comprehension, one starts to develop the
        foundation for the marvellous states of concentration where at last one
        sees the mind clearly for what it truly is.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Concentration and Insight: Whatever You
        Think It Is, It's Something Else</font></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the suttas, we sometimes come across
        little phrases of great significance. One such phrase is: &quot;Whatever
        you imagine it to be, it is always something else.&quot; [2] This is one
        of the most profound descriptions of the Dhamma we can find. Whatever
        one conceives it be, it is going to be something else. It is as true for
        <i>Jhàna</i> and Insight as it is for <i>Nibbàna</i> itself. After
        having experienced one of these states, one realizes how completely
        different the experience actually is from what you thought, read, and
        expected it to be. The conceptual mind cannot reach these refined
        aspects of mind. All the concepts in the world are just built up from
        the bricks of one's worldly experience. How could such a crude and
        coarse apparatus as the conceptual mind reach these states? This is good
        to remember; because it takes away one's trust and confidence in the
        conceptual mind. We tend to put far too much trust in our ability.to
        conceive; so much so, that we waste our time arguing about concepts,
        about who is right and who is wrong, instead of actually embarking upon
        the practice that will enable us to see and know the truth beyond
        concepts.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Out of faith in the Lord Buddha, one's
        job and duty is to use that conceptual mind where it is appropriate, and
        drop it where it has no place, where it does not reach, where it does
        not belong. Where it does not belong is in the realm of those states of
        mind that are beyond ordinary human experience <i>(uttarimanussadhamma)</i>:
        the <i>Jhàna</i>s, the states of Insight, and <i>Nibbàna</i>. Here the
        conceptual mind has to be dropped. But first of all, this has to be
        taken on faith -- faith in the teachings of the Buddha and the Noble
        Disciples. What I mean by faith is that one values the teachings of the
        Buddha so much that one allows them to go inside the mind. One day when
        one is close to concentration or Insight, those teachings will bear
        fruit, and one will give up the conceptual mind. That which creates
        conceptual entanglement is called diversification <i>(papañca)</i>, a
        coarser form of craving . Having given up <i>papañca</i>, the mind
        becomes still and peaceful; one gets beyond the veil, behind the cause
        of the problem. One could say that the language of the self, the ego, <i>is
        </i>these thoughts and concepts, and the only way one can see this ego
        is to first make it shut up.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So one doubts this conceptual mind and
        instead one develops the mind of faith in the Buddha's teaching, which
        says that this path can lead in one way only. The conceptual mind might
        say, &quot;I can't do it, it's too hard for me.&quot; But that is just
        the talk of the ego getting scared, the talk of Màra, [3] who is on the
        defensive, rattled by our progress on the path to <i>Nibbàna</i>.
        Instead of believing in the conceptual mind, the mind of Màra, one
        trusts the word of the Buddha and the advice of the Noble Disciples. One
        puts aside those conceptual doubts, lets them go, and pushes them away.
        One goes beyond them, and finds that the Buddha was wise and
        enlightened: he did teach the Dhamma, and that Dhamma works. This is
        especially clear when the mind becomes peaceful.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Push out the conceptual mind and arouse
        the mind of faith. Let go. Let go of the ordering, the assessing of the
        situation, and the thinking of what to do next. Let the Dhamma take
        over; let the natural course of the practice take over. If you have been
        practising virtue, sense restraint, and mindfulness, you have the basis
        for concentration; so let go and let concentration happen. Allow the
        mind just to concentrate, to revert to what we might call its natural
        state -- the seeking of satisfaction and comfort within itself rather
        than outside.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mind then becomes self-sufficient,
        self-comforting, and self-sustaining, so that the door from the mind to
        the five external senses is cut off, and the mind does not go out to the
        five senses. Instead it remains immersed in itself, in radiant joy. One
        experiences this, delights in it, and it is wise and good to delight in
        it. One has faith in the Buddha, who said that this delight has no
        underlying tendencies to craving and lust.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Beginnings of Craving</font></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as one leaves these states of
        concentration, one can experience the beginnings of craving, the
        beginnings of the mind going out to seek satisfaction. As an arm reaches
        out for a cup of tea (or whatever it thinks to be joy), one sees how
        stupid that craving is. Craving has its measure of delight: the
        anticipation, the joy of activity, the doing, making, becoming, and
        controlling. But this is delusive joy. One sees craving going out and
        also sees its results.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When one is developing Insight based on
        these powerful states of concentration, something like craving, instead
        of appearing as an idea or concept, appears like an animal or a being
        emerging from the mind and going out. One sees this very clearly; also
        one can very clearly understand the dangers. The coarse mind can see
        only what is coarse and superficial. The subtle mind, however, can see
        the subtle. One understands the very source and essence of craving: why
        it works, why the mind delights in it, and the consequences of that
        delighting. Then the mind can develop repulsion towards craving itself,
        repulsion to these &quot;animals&quot; who emerge from the mind and go
        out promising happiness and joy, but afterwards come back to bite and
        torment the mind. Craving is unfaithful to its promise; it promises
        delight, happiness, satisfaction, and contentment, but in the end brings
        only torment and disappointment. The refined mind can see this.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The refined mind can see where this
        craving first originates. It first originates in the delusion of
        &quot;I&quot; and in the delusion of &quot;mine.&quot; It is the
        delusion of a &quot;self&quot; <i>(attà)</i> which needs joy and
        satisfaction in the first place. This sense of self, this sense of
        &quot;I,&quot; is the source of craving, and it's not going to be
        uncovered easily as it lies very deep within. One needs the powerful,
        refined, and subtle mind even to be able to come close to the source and
        meaning of self, or rather <i>that which we take to be sel</i>f. This is
        a very hard thing to see, but with faith and confidence in the Buddha's
        teachings, and by following them, one comes closer and closer.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once one sees the self, or rather what
        we take to be the self, then one can truly say that one is in the
        presence of <i>Nibbàna</i>. One sees the self as just a mirage,
        something that has deceived the mind for so many lifetimes. One
        &quot;sees&quot; this not as a concept, but as a very refined state that
        is very hard to describe to others. Language doesn't reach to these
        places. Once that self is seen, the delusion is destroyed and the very
        ground from which craving originates is pulled away. Craving is then
        like a bird with no place to rest anymore. It can still go on flying in
        the sky, but it can't.come back to rest on any branch or ground.
        Eventually it will get tired, and then it will die. Once the mind sees
        these things -- the Dhamma, the origination of all things, where they
        lead to, the nature of the mind and the nature of delusion -- faith is
        transformed into wisdom. It is transformed into <i>the experience </i>of
        the Dhamma, into <i>Enlightening </i>and powerful wisdom.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many may wonder how anyone can gain such
        refined wisdom. But those who have faith in the Buddha know that there
        is a path, there is a way, by which human beings can gain this wisdom.
        That way is the Noble Eightfold Path. From the very beginning to the end
        it's not that long; it doesn't take that much time. One just needs the
        patience and the energy born of confidence. If that energy comes from a
        sense of &quot;self,&quot; it's not going to be very productive. If the
        energy one arouses for one's practice comes from a sense of
        &quot;me&quot; and &quot;mine,&quot; for instance, because we're ashamed
        of what we have done so far and want to do better, it won't be anywhere
        near as effective as it would be if it comes from faith in the Buddha's
        teachings. If it's energy born of faith, it is not energy coming from
        the &quot;self,&quot; it is energy coming from the Buddha. If it's faith
        in the Dhamma, or if it's faith in the Noble (Ariya) Sangha, it is
        energy born of the Dhamma, energy born of the Sangha -- the <i>Ariya
        Sangha</i>. If one hears a great discourse from one of the Noble Ones,
        it gives rise to faith, and that faith gives rise to energy. It is born
        from the Ariyas, from the Noble Ones. It is that energy, powerful and
        penetrative, which can arouse one to make one's virtue spotless, which
        can perfect one's sense restraint, sharpen one's mindfulness, and bring
        the mind to concentration.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whether you like it or not, it
        happens&quot;: Whether you think that <i>Jhàna</i> is the path to <i>Nibbàna</i>
        or not, you get into <i>Jhàna</i>. It's a natural part of the Noble
        Eightfold Path, and it happens by itself. Planning it or not planning it
        is just getting in the way and putting off its happening. The experience
        of <i>Jhàna</i> comes naturally to a mind in which the hindrances have
        been suppressed; in which faith has been developed; in which purity of
        virtue has been developed; in which sense restraint has been developed;
        in which mindfulness has been developed. Whether one likes it or not,
        whether one decides for it or not, the happiness ushered in by all these
        preparatory practices will naturally give rise to the beautiful <i>Jhàna</i>s.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Bliss of Enlightenment</font></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha called the <i>Jhàna</i>s
        &quot;the bliss of Enlightenment.&quot; [4] They are not the true
        release of Enlightenment, but close enough in their affective qualities
        to give one a taste of freedom. These are also called freedoms of the
        mind <i>(cetovimutti)</i>. They are the first real experiences of
        freedom for the meditator. One is getting a taste of what <i>Nibbàna</i>
        truly is. The mind has calmed down, the defilements are gone.-- though
        only temporarily -- and one experiences a mind without defilements,
        which is just &quot;inside of itself.&quot; One experiences contentment,
        a place where craving doesn't reach, a place where Màra is blindfolded.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The experience of these beautiful states
        that the Buddha described gives an indication of what <i>Nibbàna</i> is
        like. Then one doesn't need to worry about faith anymore. The experience
        is there and, once there, the faith in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha
        are &quot;gone to greatness&quot; <i>(mahaggata)</i>. If the meditator
        has that last bit of confidence to turn the attention where the Buddha
        said to turn it at such a time, he or she starts to uncover the mirage
        of self, that which one has always taken to be &quot;me&quot; or
        &quot;mine.&quot; If one looks behind the screen at the source of the
        film, the light and the projector itself, then one begins to see the
        Dhamma. As said earlier, one then starts to notice where the defilements
        originate from. The source of the hindrances, the mirage of self, is
        uncovered. It is this delusion <i>(avijjà)</i> that is the root cause
        of suffering.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Entering the Stream</font></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one uproots the mirage of self, and
        sees clearly with a mind beyond concepts, with a mind freed through the
        practice of the Eightfold Path, then there will come with certainty the
        knowledge that one has entered the stream and is a Stream-winner, bound
        for Enlightenment. There is no way that this can be turned back, and
        that's why they say that at this stage faith in the Buddha, Dhamma, and
        Sangha becomes unshakable. It becomes so powerful, tall, and great that
        there is no way in the world one might ever turn back.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having realized the Dhamma, one can
        delight in it, delight in the achievement and in the uniqueness of the
        Buddha. With this realization, one really knows what the Buddha is. As
        the Buddha said, &quot;One who sees the Dhamma, sees me. One who sees
        me, sees the Dhamma&quot; [5]. That is a profound saying, and one needs
        to have actually seen the Dhamma to understand its meaning. In other
        words, if one has truly seen the Dhamma, then one will value the Buddha,
        Dhamma, and Noble Sangha above all else. Confidence and faith in the
        Buddha reaches its peak and becomes an enormous source of joy and
        happiness -- the bliss of pure confidence. Faith <i>(saddhà)</i> is the
        source not only of energy but of happiness and delight <i>(sukha)</i>
        too. And again, it's a delight and happiness from which there is nothing
        to be blamed or feared. It's a pool from which one can drink, where
        there is no pollution and nothing to cause injury or illness. <i>Thus
        faith is a powerful tool. </i>It will take one from the beginning to the
        end of this realm of samsàra and eventually set one free.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Exhortation.</font></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As mentioned before, right in the
        beginning your faith may be weak and challenged by the defilements, but
        just notice, as you follow the Eightfold Path, how each stage gives rise
        to greater degrees of happiness. These experiences of happiness are real
        and are there to be turned to at any time if you will only notice them.
        They are like invisible companions that one takes for granted and often
        just doesn't notice. They will give increased faith that this practice
        works, and as that faith builds up, it will propel you along the path.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You are in the presence of <i>Nibbàna</i>
        because you are practising the Noble Eightfold Path. Confidence in this
        truth might just enable the mind to accept that <i>Nibbàna</i> is only
        hidden behind the thinnest of veils. You might just get the incentive to
        go beyond and achieve <i>Jhàna</i>, achieve Insight, and become one of
        the Noble Ones. Then you will realize that it wasn't all that much, not
        all that difficult. Just go one step further into the mind and one step
        further behind the defenses of the delusion of self.</font></p>
