  <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman">-oOo-</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font face="Times New Roman">oday I will
  explain the passage that we read every morning. This is from the Discourse called The Four
  Foundations of Mindfulness. This passage is just a summary of the Four Foundations of
  Mindfulness. But it is important that those who practice Foundations of Mindfulness or
  Vipassanaa Meditation understand this passage correctly and clearly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;As I have said, the method of the practice of
  Mindfulness or the Four Foundations of Mindfulness was discovered by the Buddha. He
  practiced it himself and got the best results from this practice and then for forty-five
  years he taught the Four Foundations of Mindfulness many times. After his death these
  methods were collected and recorded in what is known as the Paa.li Canon. The instructions
  given at Vipassanaa retreats are all based on the Mahaasatipa.t.thaana Sutta which
  contains this passage.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;The first sentence is, &quot;<b>This is the only
  way, monks, for the purification of beings ... namely, the Four Foundations of
  Mindfulness.</b>&quot; So, at the very beginning the Buddha said, &quot;This is the only
  way&quot;. The Four Foundations of Mindfulness or the Practice of Mindfulness, is the only
  way for the purification of beings ... Here the Buddha said, &quot;<b>This is the only way</b>&quot;.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Now, the Paa.li word for this translation is
  &quot;Ekaayano&quot;. &quot;Ekaayano&quot; is composed of two parts, &quot;eka&quot; and
  &quot;ayana&quot;. Ayana means way, path or road, and eka means one. So, ekaayano
  literally means one way. This one way is interpreted to mean one way which has no forks,
  no branches. There is just one way and if you tread this way you will surely reach your
  destination. There are no misleading branches of this way. The other meaning is that this
  is the way to be taken by one, to be taken by the individual only. That means when you are
  treading on this path or on this way you are alone, you have no companion because you make
  progress or you do not make progress depending on your own capabilities.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Also, this word is interpreted to mean &quot;the Way
  of The One&quot;. &quot;The One&quot; here means the Buddha. The Buddha was the best of
  the beings and so he was called &quot;The One&quot; and this is the way discovered and
  taught by the Buddha, so this is called the Way of The One. Also, it is interpreted to
  mean the only way, this is the only way, there is no other way for the purification of
  beings and so on. Now, with regard to the translation &quot;the only way&quot; there are
  two questions. One is that here, Four Foundations of Mindfulness mean mindfulness only.
  But, there are other factors of the Noble Eightfold Path. So, are they also not the way to
  purification of beings ...? The answer is that they are also the way to purification of
  beings ..., but they do not exist without mindfulness. So when mindfulness is mentioned,
  they are virtually mentioned, i.e., although mindfulness alone is mentioned here, we
  should understand that all the other seven factors that are concomitant with the Noble
  Path are also implied. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;The other question raised by people, especially of
  the West, is &quot;Why did Buddha say, &quot;This is the only way&quot;? Aren't there
  other ways to the purification of beings? They argue that there are different roads to
  reach a city and just as there are different roads to a city there must be different ways
  to reach purification of beings or to reach Nibbaana. Some people do not like this or they
  thought the Buddha would not have said this, &quot;The only way&quot;. Some times
  analogies are not really correct. It is true that there are different roads to reach this
  town. (I am not familiar with this country so I do not know which roads reach this town.)
  But they are roads, they are not marshes or forests. And so the road is the only way to
  reach this town. There may be different roads but they are roads. In the same way, there
  may be different ways of practicing mindfulness but they must be mindfulness. Only
  mindfulness can lead us to the attainment of Nibbaana. Also, if we say physical exercise
  is the only way to build big muscles, I think no one would object to that. If you want to
  build big muscles you have to do physical exercise. Without physical exercise, you cannot
  hope to build muscles. But, physical exercise can take different forms such as weight
  lifting or using machines and so on. In the same way, mindfulness is the only way to reach
  Nibbaana, but mindfulness may take different forms. Even in this discourse on the
  Foundations of Mindfulness, mindfulness practice is taught in twenty-one ways. There are
  twenty-one different kinds of mindfulness practice to choose from. Therefore, I think it
  is correct to say that this is the only way. So mindfulness is the only way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">People may argue here because the word used here is
  &quot;ekaayano&quot;, one way. But in another place -- in the Dhammapada -- Buddha said
  clearly, &quot;This alone is the way and there is no other way for the purity of
  wisdom.&quot; So we cannot argue that Buddha said there is any other way. He expressly
  said that this alone is the way and there is no other way. So I think we must accept that
  this is the only way for the purification of beings. If we consider it with reference to
  the practice it becomes clear.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have said that mindfulness is like a guard, and once the
  guard is removed anything can come in. So as long as mindfulness is at the sense doors,
  our minds are pure. No unwholesome mental states can come into our minds, because
  mindfulness is there guarding the sense doors. Once mindfulness is removed, or once we
  lose mindfulness, all these mental defilements come in. So mindfulness is the only way to
  keep the mind pure. Please note here also that mindfulness is one of the eight Factors of
  the Path described in the Dhammapada, and if the Eightfold Path is the &quot;only
  way&quot;, then mindfulness surely is the only way too.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again, mindfulness may take different forms, such as
  mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of feeling, mindfulness of consciousness, mindfulness
  of dhamma objects or mindfulness of parts of the body and so on. So, if it is mindfulness
  it is the only way for the purification of beings. For the purification of beings means
  for the purification of the minds of beings. Because Buddha is more concerned about the
  purification of mind than the purification of the physical body -- although it does not
  mean that we do not take care of the cleanliness of the physical body -- what is more
  important for us is the cleanliness of our minds. So, the purification of beings here
  means purification of minds of beings. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Commentaries, it is said that personal cleanliness
  or cleanliness of the body as well as the cleanliness of the place are conducive to
  concentration and wisdom. So we also need to keep our bodies clean and keep the place
  where we meditate clean. Although we are not to neglect the cleanliness of the body we
  should be more concerned about the cleanliness of our minds. So here the Buddha said that
  mindfulness is the only way for the purification of minds of beings.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With this passage Buddha mentioned the benefits we will
  get from the practice of mindfulness. The first benefit the Buddha mentiond is
  purification of mind. Then Buddha said, &quot;<b>for the overcoming of sorrow and
  lamentation</b>&quot;. If we want to overcome sorrow and lamentation or crying aloud we
  should practice mindfulness. Mindfulness is the only way to overcome sorrow and
  lamentation. Here sorrow is a mental state. Lamentation is crying aloud through sorrow and
  saying this thing or that. To overcome sorrow and lamentation also we should practice the
  Foundations of Mindfulness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<b>For the disappearance of pain and grief</b>&quot;:
  Pain here means physical pain, pain in the body, and grief means mental pain, depression,
  ill will, hatred; all these are included in the word &quot;grief&quot;. For the overcoming
  and disappearance of pain and grief we should practice the Foundations of Mindfulness. As
  I said you may not conquer pain, you may not overcome pain altogether, pain may not
  disappear altogether. But, if you practice mindfulness you will be able to live with pain
  and accept it. Like that of the Venerable Anuruddha, your mind will not be disturbed or
  perturbed by the physical pain. If your mind is not perturbed by physical pain, pain is
  virtually non-existent. So, for the disappearance of pain or the overcoming of pain, we
  should practice mindfulness meditation. For the overcoming of grief, overcoming of ill
  will, depression and so on we should practice mindfulness meditation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Grief is a mental state and sorrow is also a mental state.
  They are actually connected with each other. These are mental states and so these mental
  states can be overcome or made to disappear or can be avoided by the practice of
  mindfulness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mind cannot take two things or more than one thing at a
  time. Mind can only take one object at a time. I think we are lucky. If mind could take
  two or more things at a time our suffering would be much greater. Since mind can take only
  one thing at a time, we can overcome sorrow and grief by the practice of mindfulness.
  Let's take anger, for example. Suppose I am angry with Mr. A. So long as my mind is on Mr.
  A, my anger will increase and I will be getting more and more angry with him because I am
  taking him as the object of my consciousness or mind. But once I turn my mind from Mr. A,
  who is the source of my anger, to anger itself -- the moment I turn my mind to anger
  itself -- Mr. A does not exist for me at that time. He has already disappeared from my
  mind. When my mind is on the anger itself and when the source of anger has disappeared,
  anger has to disappear also.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That way, we treat such mental states with mindfulness,
  with just simple but strong or forceful mindfulness. This is how we deal with what are
  called emotions such as attachment, anger, hatred, depression, and sorrow. Whatever the
  mental state, we just treat it with mindfulness and try to be mindful of it. When our
  mindfulness is really strong, they will surely disappear. So Buddha said, &quot;This is
  the only way to overcome sorrow and lamentation and to overcome pain and grief.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<b>This is the only way for reaching the Noble Path.</b>&quot;
  When you read books on Buddhism, you will see this word &quot;Path&quot; many times.
  Sometimes it is spelt with a lower case &#145;p&#146;, but mostly with the upper case
  &#145;P&#146;. &quot;Path&quot; as a technical term is a name for the combination or group
  of the eight Factors of the Path -- Right Understanding, Right Thought and so on -- that
  arise at the moment of enlightenment. The type of consciousness that is accompanied by
  these factors is called &quot;Path Consciousness&quot;. The word &quot;enlightenment&quot;
  is another technical word whose meaning is not easy to understand. People use this word
  quite freely, but only a few might understand its meaning properly. Without definition it
  is vague. It may mean different things to different persons or different religions:
  enlightenment for a Buddhist may be quite different from enlightenment for a Christian.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we talk about enlightenment, we should first define
  it. According to Buddhism, enlightenment means the eradication of mental defilements and
  seeing Nibbaana directly, seeing Nibbaana face to face, at the same time. As a person
  practices Vipassanaa meditation and progresses from one stage to another, to higher and
  higher stages, as the result of this Vipassanaa practice, a time will come when in his
  mind a type of consciousness arises which he has not experienced before. That type of
  consciousness, along with its mental concomitants is so powerful that it can eradicate
  mental defilements altogether, not to come back again. At the same time it takes Nibbaana
  as object. So, what we mean by enlightenment is &quot; what happens at that moment&quot;
  -- a moment, when that consciousness arises, eradicates mental defilements and takes
  Nibbaana as object.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That consciousness is called &quot;Path
  Consciousness&quot;. Immediately following that Path Consciousness are two or three
  moments of Fruition Consciousness. You have to understand Abhidhamma to understand this
  fully. So for reaching the Noble Path simply means for gaining enlightenment. When you
  really reach the Noble Path, you become enlightened and you are able to eradicate mental
  defilements and take Nibbaana as object.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<b>This is the only way for the realization of
  Nibbaana</b>&quot;. This is the same thing as reaching the Noble Path. So, when a person
  reaches the Noble Path, when the Path Consciousness arises in him/her and that
  consciousness takes Nibbaana as object, that is when he/she is said to have realized
  Nibbaana. So, reaching the Noble Path and realization of Nibbaana mean the same thing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha said that the practice of mindfulness is the only
  way to purify our minds, the only way to overcome sorrow and lamentation, to overcome pain
  and grief, to reach the Noble Path and to realize Nibbaana, namely, the Four Foundations
  of Mindfulness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here also we have the words &quot;foundation&quot; and
  &quot;mindfulness&quot;. First, let us understand what mindfulness is. All of us have been
  practicing mindfulness for, may be, years but sometimes when we are asked, &quot;What is
  mindfulness?&quot; we may not be able to give a satisfactory answer.
  &quot;Mindfulness&quot; is the translation of the Paa.li word &quot;sati&quot;. This
  discourse is called, &quot;Satipa.t.thaana&quot; so you have the word &quot;sati&quot;
  there. This &quot;sati&quot; is translated as mindfulness. Maybe there is no better word
  for it. &quot;Sati&quot; literally means remembering, but it covers more than remembering
  actually. Etymologically, &quot;sati&quot; means remembering but in normal usage
  &quot;sati&quot; means more than that. Sati is defined in the Commentaries as remembering
  and its characteristic is said to be &quot;non-wobbling&quot;, that means &quot;not
  floating on the surface&quot;. If it is sati, it must not be superficial, it must go deep
  into the object. That is why I always say, &quot;full awareness of the object,&quot; or
  &quot;thorough awareness of the object.&quot; Sati is said to have the function of not
  losing the object. As long as there is sati, or mindfulness, we do not lose that object,
  we do not forget that object. Mindfulness has the function of not losing or forgetting the
  object. It is like a guard at the gate. So, that is what we call mindfulness. Mindfulness
  is not superficial awareness, it is a deep and thorough awareness of the object. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Foundations of Mindfulness&quot; means actually,
  &quot;setting up&quot; of mindfulness or &quot;firmly established mindfulness&quot; or
  &quot;mindfulness firmly established&quot;. The Paa.li word &quot;satipa.t.thaana&quot; is
  translated as foundations of mindfulness but we must understand that it means setting up
  of a firm mindfulness or establishing a firm mindfulness. So, the practice of establishing
  firm mindfulness is called the &quot;foundations of mindfulness.&quot; In this discourse,
  Buddha said that there were four foundations of mindfulness. When you practice Vipassanaa
  meditation at a retreat like this, you practice all these four foundations of mindfulness,
  but you practice them at random and not one after another in the order given in the
  Discourse. That is because when you practice Vipassanaa meditation you have to be mindful
  of the object at the present moment. You cannot afford not to be mindful of the object at
  the present moment. The object at the present moment can be any one of these four.
  Sometimes the body, sometimes feelings, sometimes consciousness, and sometimes dhamma
  objects. You have to take these objects as they come, you have no choice. That is why
  sometimes Vipassanaa meditation is called &quot;choiceless awareness&quot;. That means you
  have no choice, you just have to take what is presented to you. So you practice these four
  foundations of mindfulness at random when you practice Vipassanaa meditation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here in the summary the Buddha taught us how to practice
  the four foundations of mindfulness. So what are the four? &quot;Herein, a monk dwells
  contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful, overcoming
  or removing covetousness and grief in the world.&quot; It is a very short sentence but it
  has many meanings.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#800080">&quot;<b>Contemplating the body in
  the body</b>&quot;: </font>That means when a monk practices mindfulness of the body he is
  precise. He contemplates the body in the body and he does not contemplate the feeling in
  the body or he does not contemplate the person in the body and so on. He contemplates the
  body in the body. In order to have a precise object the Buddha repeated the words
  &quot;body, feeling, consciousness and dhamma&quot; in these sentences. So that means he
  is precise in his mindfulness of the body, feelings, consciousness and the dhammas. When
  he practices body contemplation he is ardent, he is clearly comprehending and he is
  mindful. With regard to the word &quot;ardent&quot; I do not know what other meaning it
  carries in English. This word is the translation of the Paa.li word &quot;aataapii&quot;. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes we lose something when we translate from one
  language to another. The word &quot;aataapii&quot; comes from the word
  &quot;aataapa&quot;. &quot;AAtaapa&quot; means &quot;heat of the sun.&quot; Heat of the
  sun can heat up things so that things become withered and even they may burn. So in the
  same way the effort heats up the mental defilements or burns them up. So it is called
  &quot;aataapa&quot; in Paa.li and one who has aataapa is called aataapii, the
  &quot;ii&quot; denoting possession. So one who possesses aataapa is called aataapii. When
  we read the Sutta in Paa.li and when we read the word aataapii we have that in our mind,
  we see the effort burning up the mental defilements. When you translate this word into
  English as &quot;ardent&quot; you lose that image. So aataapii means he/she makes real
  effort, not a slack effort, he makes a real effort to be mindful and to clearly
  comprehend. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Buddha, still a Bodhisatta, sat down under the Bodhi
  tree to practice to become the Buddha he made a very firm resolution in his mind.
  &quot;May my skin, sinews and bones remain, and may my flesh and blood dry up, but I will
  not desist from or give up this superhuman effort until I reach Buddhahood. I will not get
  up from this seat until I reach Buddhahood, I will make every effort to achieve my
  aim.&quot; Such an effort is called the &quot;right effort.&quot; So to make the right
  effort means you have to make a really good effort, not a slackening effort. This word
  &quot;aataapii&quot; implies all these meanings. To right effort to be understood here is
  the Right Effort that is one of the eight factors of the Path. You may have read about
  Right Effort in other books. Right Effort means to remove or avoid unwholesome mental
  states and to acquire and cultivate wholesome mental states. In order to resist
  unwholesome mental states, in order to resist evil, you need mental effort. If you do not
  make effort you cannot resist evil. Effort is very useful in resisting or removing
  unwholesome mental states and also to cultivate wholesome mental states. To develop
  wholesome mental states you need effort. If you do not make effort you do not come here,
  if you do not want to make effort you do not go to a retreat at all. So you need a real,
  strong effort to practice the Foundations of Mindfulness. Here also the Buddha described
  the monk as being ardent which means he has that kind of effort that burns up the mental
  defilements. That is indicated by the word aataapii in the Paa.li text.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next word is &quot;<b>clearly comprehending</b>&quot;.
  Clearly comprehending means clearly seeing. Whatever object he puts his mind on, he sees
  it clearly. What does &quot;clearly&quot; mean? He sees it thoroughly, he sees it with
  wisdom. When a yogi concentrates on breathing, for instance, he sees the breath clearly.
  He sees the in-breath distinctly from out-breath and out-breath distinctly from in-breath;
  and also he sees that the breath arises and disappears and that at the moment there are
  only the breaths and the awareness of the breaths and no other thing to be called a person
  or an individual. Such understanding is called &quot;clear comprehension.&quot; When you
  have clear comprehension about something, you know that thing and all its aspects. And
  also according to the teachings of the Buddha, you know that there are just the thing
  observed and the mind that observes and none other which you could call a person or an
  individual, a man or a woman. Seeing in this way is called clear comprehension. This clear
  comprehension will come only after some time, not right at the beginning. You practice
  mindfulness, but right at the beginning you may not even see the breaths clearly.
  Sometimes they are mixed together and very vague. Little by little with the growth of your
  concentration and practice, you'll see the objects more and more clearly and then also
  their arising and disappearing and so on. So this clear comprehension comes not right at
  the beginning but after one has gained some experience.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order for this clear comprehension to arise, we need
  one more thing. Although it is not mentioned in this Discourse we need one more thing and
  that is concentration. Without concentration clear comprehension cannot come. What is
  concentration? Concentration is a mental state or a mental factor, which keeps the
  components of mind squarely on the object, and does not let them go to other objects. That
  is what we call concentration. It is usually described as the mind being able to be on an
  object for a long period of time. For example, if you take the breath as an object your
  mind is always on the breath and the mind does not go anywhere else. That is what we call
  concentration. Actually, at every moment also the mental factor or state which is called
  concentration keeps the mind and its components unified on the object, it keeps them
  together and does not let them go to another object. This concentration is essential for
  clear comprehension to arise. Without this concentration we cannot hope to see things
  clearly, we cannot hope to get clear comprehension.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we get concentration, our mind calms down and becomes
  quiet and that is the time when we begin to see things. It is like, say, water. At first
  there is dirt or mud in the water and so we cannot see through the water. But when the
  dirt or mud settles down and the water becomes clear we can see through it. So, mind needs
  to be like the water, settled, because there are many dirt or many mental defilements in
  our mind. So long as our minds are contaminated by mental defilements we cannot see things
  clearly. We need to suppress or let these mental defilements which are called mental
  hindrances settle down so that we can see clearly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we get concentration we will be able to keep these
  mental hindrances settled. When the mental hindrances are subdued or settled, mind becomes
  clear and it is the time when clear comprehension or the true knowledge of things arises. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to get clear comprehension we need concentration
  and concentration is not mentioned here. But we must take that concentration is also
  included in this passage because without concentration we cannot get clear comprehension.
  Sometimes some words may be left out but we have to understand them as mentioned through
  inference. Let's say there is a flat rock and a hunter is following a deer and he sees
  foot prints on one side, but on the flat rock itself he does not see any footprints, and
  again he sees the footprints on the other side. So from this he infers that the deer must
  have run across the flat rock. He sees the beginning and he sees the end and so he infers
  the middle, that the deer must have run on the rock. In the same way here, to be mindful
  is the beginning and clear comprehension is something like the end. So, when these two are
  mentioned the middle is also virtually mentioned because without the middle --
  concentration -- there can be no clear comprehension.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the last word here is &quot;mindful&quot;:
  Mindfulness is put last here but actually, in practice it should come after
  &quot;ardent&quot;. We make effort, so we have mindfulness. We have mindfulness, so we
  have concentration and concentration leads to clear comprehension. We have
  &quot;mindfulness&quot; here, but I have already defined mindfulness so I do not need to
  define it again.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A monk dwells contemplating the body in the body. A monk
  practices the foundation of mindfulness on the body, being ardent, making true effort,
  being mindful and being thoroughly aware of the object and having concentration and clear
  comprehension.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">How many components do we now have? Ardent is one
  component, clearly comprehending is another component, concentration is yet another and
  mindfulness, another. So we have four mental states here. These four mental states are the
  components of the practice. When we practice there must be these four mental states
  working together harmoniously. But, there is one more mental state which is not mentioned
  here, and that is faith or confidence. Confidence or faith is also an important factor
  because if we do not have confidence in this practice we would not practice. We do not
  really have blind faith but we have faith or confidence in the Buddha and His teachings.
  We believe that just by paying attention to these objects we will be able to see the true
  nature of these things, the impermanent, suffering and non-soul nature. So we should have
  that much confidence because without confidence no work can be successful. Confidence,
  therefore, is also a part of the practice of meditation and although it is not actively
  operating at the moment of meditation or practice of mindfulness, it is still there
  working harmoniously with the other factors. So, altogether we get five factors and these
  are the five factors that are called five Mental Faculties. In Paa.li they are called
  Indriyas. Meditation teachers are fond of talking about these five factors. These five
  factors must be working simultaneously and harmoniously with each other if we are to have
  a good practice of meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As I said, in the beginning we may be lacking in clear
  comprehension but later when our concentration develops we will be able to see things
  clearly and so on and these five components will be working in harmony. What if they do
  not work in harmony? We are lost! When we are practicing, especially important is the
  balance of effort and concentration. If they are not balanced, if there is an excess of
  one or the other, we are lost, our meditation is nothing. The effort we make must be just
  enough, not too much, and not too little. Sometimes we tend to make too much effort
  because we want to achieve something; we become a little greedy and so we make more
  effort. When we make more effort, we become restless, agitated and then we lose
  concentration. So, too much effort will not work. What if there is too little effort? We
  become sleepy, lazy and we cannot concentrate and cannot practice either. So, the effort
  we make must be neither too much nor too little. When there is excess of effort there is
  not enough of concentration. Among effort and concentration, when one goes up the other
  goes down. Too much effort, and concentration will go down. When you make too little
  effort, again concentration goes down. Concentration also must not be too much. When we
  have too much concentration we tend to become lazy. We tend to take it easy or we tend to
  slacken our effort.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose we are practicing and we have good concentration.
  When we have good concentration we do not have to make much effort and so we tend to
  slacken the effort. When we slacken our effort the degree of effort goes down and we
  become lazy or sleepy. In that case we have to step up our effort, by making more effort
  and paying closer attention or sometimes by adding some things to note like three or more
  objects in succession at a time. So, the effort and concentration must be balanced so that
  we have good meditation and clear comprehension.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometime, say, we are practicing and we have good
  concentration and all of a sudden we lose concentration. Probably we have made more effort
  than is needed. We want to make it better and so we make more effort and the result is the
  opposite of what we want. Sometimes you are practicing meditation, your concentration is
  good and even though your concentration is good, you tend to go sleepy or nodding. That
  means you have too much concentration. If there is too much concentration you have to make
  the level of concentration go down by stepping up effort, by taking more objects at a time
  and so on.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, meditation is not easy. I do not want to discourage
  you but meditation is not easy. It is very delicate. Just a little bit of an unbalanced
  mental state can destroy the concentration you have built up with great effort. So, these
  five mental states should be working simultaneously and also they should be working in
  harmony. Meditation practice is like a machine. There are many parts in a machine and each
  part must work properly. If one part does not work properly, the whole machine goes out of
  control. In the same way, if any one of the factors does not work properly, the whole work
  of meditation is thrown out of balance. Therefore, each one of these five mental factors
  must be working properly and harmoniously with other factors.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here comes the value of mindfulness. Mindfulness is a
  regulating mental factor. So it helps to keep effort from becoming too much, it helps
  concentration from becoming too much and so on. So, the mindfulness factor is a regulating
  factor among these five components in the practice of meditation. That is why it is said
  that mindfulness is always needed, there can be no excess of mindfulness. Mindfulness is
  needed everywhere like the seasoning of salt in all dishes and like a Prime Minister who
  does all the work of a king. Mindfulness is a very important factor in these five factors
  but every factor is important and everyone must be working in harmony and in balance with
  the other factors.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the five mental factors are working in balance and a
  yogi is clearly comprehending, then what is the result? The result is overcoming
  covetousness and grief in the world. That is the result a yogi gets from clearly
  comprehending in the practice of mindfulness meditation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now here, most English translations missed the point. They
  translate it as &quot;having overcome&quot; or &quot;having abandoned&quot;, or
  &quot;having removed&quot; covetousness and grief in the world. What is the practice for?
  What is this mindfulness practice for? It is for overcoming covetousness and grief.
  Covetousness means attachment and grief means ill will or anger. So, Vipassanaa or
  Satipa.t.thaana meditation is &quot;for overcoming&quot; covetousness and grief.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If a person has already overcome covetousness and grief
  he/she does not need to practice. For this very purpose we are practicing mindfulness, but
  if we have already achieved this purpose we do not need to practice mindfulness. So, here
  we should translate it as &quot;overcoming (at the same time) covetousness and grief in
  the world,&quot; and not &quot;having overcome.&quot; That means the yogi overcomes
  covetousness and grief as he practices mindfulness. I want you to be aware of this. (Here
  an explanation with reference to Paa.li grammatical construction would be helpful; but
  since it would be too involved I have no choice but to ignore it.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Overcoming covetousness and grief in the world means
  avoiding craving or attachment or anger or ill will concerning the object the yogi is
  observing. &quot;In the world&quot; means in the world of body, feelings and so on,
  concerning that object. We see one object and we can be attached to that object. If we
  come to the conclusion that it is beautiful, or it is good, we will be attached to it; and
  we can have anger, or hatred, etc., towards that object if we decided it was ugly or
  disgusting. So, these mental defilements can come into our minds when we experience
  something.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to prevent them from arising, we need to make
  some protection and that protection is mindfulness. When we are mindful, they will not get
  a chance to get into our minds. When we are mindful, when we comprehend clearly, and when
  we see the objects clearly, we know that these objects come and go, these objects are
  impermanent and so not to be attached to them. So, we can avoid covetousness or attachment
  and grief or hatred regarding that object by the practice of mindfulness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whether we say &quot;overcoming&quot; or
  &quot;removing&quot; or whatever, actually we are avoiding or preventing them from
  arising. Not that they have come and then we overcome them, or we remove them after they
  have come. The meaning really is preventing covetousness and grief from arising in our
  minds. If we do not practice mindfulness on the object they will surely come, either
  covetousness or grief, or attachment or hatred. These mental states can come, but by the
  practice of mindfulness we can prevent them from coming. Preventing them from arising in
  our mind is what is meant by overcoming them. (But if they have arisen, of course, we
  should make them the object of our attention to eliminate them.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we talk about enlightenment we say, &quot;at the
  moment of enlightenment&quot; mental defilements are eradicated. What mental defilements
  are eradicated at that moment? The present ones, or past ones or the future ones ? The
  past is already past, we do not have to do anything to get rid of them, and the future
  defilements are not here yet, so you cannot do anything about them. What of the present
  defilements? If they are present there can be no enlightenment. Because enlightenment is a
  wholesome state and those mental defilements are unwholesome states. Wholesome states and
  unwholesome states cannot exist together. They do not coexist. So the defilements that are
  said to be eradicated at the moment of enlightenment are not of the past, not of the
  future and not of the present. Then what defilements are eradicated?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Actually, strictly speaking, those that are eradicated are
  not called defilements, or kilesas in Paa.li. They are called latencies or anusayas in
  Paa.li, which means the potential to arise. What the enlightenment consciousness
  eradicates is that potential. That means when something is always with us we say we have
  that thing. Take, for example, smoking. Suppose you smoke but right now you do not. If I
  ask you, &quot;Do you smoke? &quot; you would say, &quot;Yes, I do.&quot; Because you
  smoked in the past and you will smoke in the future and you have not given up smoking. So
  although you are not smoking at the very moment, you say, &quot;Yes, I smoke.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the same way, now right at this moment, I hope I have
  no mental defilements in my mind and you have no mental defilements in your mind. But
  after the talk you go out and you step on something sharp or someone pushes you and you
  get angry and thus the mental defilement comes when there are the conditions for them. So
  we say we have mental defilements. I have mental defilements, you have mental defilements,
  but not right at this moment. So, that &quot;liability to arise&quot; is what is
  eradicated by enlightenment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mental defilements that are said to be eradicated at
  the moment of enlightenment are actually nothing but that ability or liability to come up.
  When they come up they are already there. In the same way here, overcoming covetousness
  and grief means avoiding or preventing them from arising in our minds. How? By the
  practice of mindfulness. We make effort, we apply mindfulness and we have concentration
  and we see things clearly. When we see things clearly there is no chance for these mental
  defilements to come into the mind. In this way, Vipassanaa or mindfulness practice removes
  mental defilement.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This removal or overcoming is just momentary, just by
  substitution. Next moment they may come back. It is of a very short duration. It is called
  abandonment by substitution. That means you abandon the unwholesome mental states by
  substituting them with the wholesome mental states. When there is wholesome mental state
  there cannot be any unwholesome mental state. You put wholesome mental states in the place
  and so unwholesome mental states do not get a chance to arise. That is called abandonment
  by substitution. That will last for only a moment. The next moment they may come back.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the moment of Vipassanaa the covetousness and grief are
  removed in that way. You get out of Vipassanaa and you meet some conditions for them to
  arise, and they will arise.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is another kind of abandonment called
  &quot;temporary abandonment.&quot; Abandonment by pushing away. When you push something
  away it may stay there for sometime, it may not come back quickly, like plants in the
  water. If you push them away they may stay away for some time, but then very slowly they
  may come back. That kind of removing or abandonment is called &quot;temporary abandonment
  or removing&quot;, or removal by pushing away. That is achieved by jhaanas. When a person
  gets jhaanas, or experiences jhaanas, he/she is able to push these mental defilements away
  for some time. They may not come to his/her mind for the whole day or maybe a week or a
  month, but in this case too they can come back.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third removal is called total removal. The Paa.li word
  is &quot;samuccheda = cutting off&quot;, i.e., removal by cutting off. It is like you cut
  the root of a tree and it never grows back. So the total removal or removal once and for
  all is called removal by cutting off and that is achieved at the moment of enlightenment.
  The mental defilement eradicated at the moment of enlightenment never comes back to that
  person.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">An Arahant has eradicated all mental defilements. He has
  no attachment, no anger, no pride, no jealousy and other unwholesome mental states. Even
  though they are provoked Arahants will not get angry. Even though they may see a very,
  very attractive and beautiful object, they will not feel any attachment or desire for that
  object. Those are the persons who have eradicated mental defilements by totally cutting
  them off.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are the three kinds of removing, and here we can
  understand the two kinds of removing. I have already explained the first removing. There
  can also be the second kind of removing here. That is, if you have practiced meditation
  well and you are able to avoid covetousness and grief with regard to the objects you
  observe, you will find that you are able to avoid covetousness and grief even with regard
  to those objects that you do not observe. Here &quot;do not observe&quot; means do not
  treat with mindfulness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Naturally, the objects we come across can cause
  covetousness and grief in our minds. If we do not practice mindfulness on the object, then
  we will have attachment or ill will towards that object. That happens to most people. If
  you are good at Vipassanaa practice and you have this experience of avoiding covetousness
  and grief with regard to objects that are observed, you will find that you are able to
  prevent them from arising even with regard to those that are not observed. That is what is
  called temporary removal by Vipassanaa. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vipassanaa can achieve only these two kinds of removal --
  momentary removal and temporary removal. But Vipassanaa cannot achieve the third one, the
  total removal; that will be done by enlightenment or Path Consciousness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Buddha said &quot;overcoming covetousness and grief
  in the world&quot;, he meant that the monk was able to avoid covetousness and grief from
  arising with regard to that object which he is observing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here &quot;covetousness&quot; means all kinds of
  attachment, greed, lust, and other similar mental states and &quot;grief&quot; means not
  just grief but anger, hatred, depression, sorrow; all are included in grief. There are
  three roots of unwholesomeness and they are attachment, anger and ignorance. Among these
  three, two are mentioned here. Covetousness is actually the first one which is
  &quot;lobha&quot; or attachment and the second one is &quot;dosa&quot;. So, by
  covetousness we mean all shades of lobha and by grief we mean all shades of dosa. Moha
  (ignorance) is not included here because moha is very difficult to prevent and eradicate.
  So, in this sentence we must understand that a monk practices body contemplation making
  effort, applying mindfulness, getting concentration and clearly comprehending and at the
  same time he is able to avoid covetousness and grief from arising. It is the same with
  regard to feelings, to consciousness and to dhamma objects. (The Commentary says that the
  statement &#145;overcoming covetousness and grief&#146; refers to the overcoming of all
  the five mental hindrances, because when covetousness and grief that are the strongest of
  the five hindrances are mentioned, we must understand that the other hindrances are also
  mentioned.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You know the four foundations of mindfulness, four kinds
  of setting up of mindfulness. There are four because there are four kinds of objects. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>The first one is body</strong></em>. Sometimes
  body does not mean the whole physical body, but a group of some material properties.
  Breathing is also called the body. Different parts of the body are also called the body.
  By the word &quot;body&quot; we must understand anything that is associated with the body.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>The second is feelings</strong></em>. Feeling
  is a mental state. Now we have pain here, physical pain and we experience that physical
  pain with our mind. In our mind there is a mental state called feeling. Since it is pain,
  feeling is the painful feeling. When Buddha said a monk contemplates feeling in the
  feeling, He means the monk is contemplating on that mental state and not necessarily on
  the pain there. In practice, when we have pain we have to concentrate on the pain and be
  mindful of it because that is practical. But actually, when we are making notes as,
  &quot;pain, pain&quot;, we are really making notes of the mental state that feels the pain
  in the body. That feeling is of three kinds -- pleasant, unpleasant and neutral.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>The third is consciousness</strong></em>. It
  is usually translated as mind, but I think consciousness is a better translation. The
  Paa.li word is &quot;citta&quot;. This means consciousness. In Buddhist psychology, mind
  is composed of four things. So what we call &quot;mind&quot; is a group of or combination
  of four things. Sometimes there may be confusion regarding these terms: mind and
  consciousness. Let us say mind is composed of two things first, consciousness and mental
  factors. Consciousness is defined as the awareness of an object. Here awareness is not
  like awareness in the practice of meditation. It is just mere awareness. It is like I am
  aware of someone there although I am looking this way. That kind of awareness is called
  consciousness. At least, it is called consciousness in Abhidhamma. The English word may
  mean more or less than that, I am not sure.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Please note that although we use the word consciousness
  for the word &quot;citta&quot;, it is not an exact translation of the word. Consciousness
  is defined as a mental state which is the awareness of the object. Only when there is
  awareness of the object can there be contact with the object, feeling of the object,
  liking of the object, disliking of the object and so on. So, these mental states are
  subordinate to consciousness, but they are also components of the mind. So, mind is first
  divided into two -- consciousness and mental factors. Contact, feeling, perception,
  attention, like, dislike and so on are all called mental factors. According to Abhidhamma
  there are fifty-two of them, and these fifty-two are grouped into three -- feeling,
  perception and mental formations. So when we add consciousness to these three we get four
  kinds of mental states. It&#146;s amazing that the Buddha could define and differentiate
  each of these mental states that arise simultaneously taking the same object.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we practice meditation and say &quot;sorry,
  sorry&quot;, that means we have a consciousness accompanied by sorrow or something like
  that. It could be contemplation on consciousness. When I say, &quot;angry, angry&quot;, I
  am doing contemplation of consciousness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>The last one is the dhamma</strong></em>. This
  is one Paa.li word that is most difficult to translate or that cannot be translated
  adequately. This word means different things in different contexts. You cannot translate
  the word &quot;dhamma&quot; with just one English word. If you do, you will be wrong.
  Here, dhamma simply means the objects that are mental hindrances, the five aggregates, the
  twelve bases, the seven Factors of Enlightenment and Four Noble Truths. They are called
  dhamma in this discourse. So, we cannot translate this word. Mostly it is translated as
  &quot;mind object&quot; or &quot;mental object&quot;, but each of these translations is
  not satisfactory. Therefore it is better to keep the word &quot;dhamma&quot; untranslated
  to avoid confusion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#800080"><b>Dwelling on dhamma objects</b>:</font>
  if you concentrate on anger, then you are doing contemplation on the dhamma. Here dhamma
  does not mean the teachings or discourse or other things. If you see something and you are
  mindful of seeing, then you are doing dhamma object contemplation. So, the dhamma object
  contemplation is very wide and includes mental hindrances, aggregates, bases, Factors of
  Enlightenment and the Four Noble Truths.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we translate it as &quot;mind object&quot; and we take
  it to mean &quot;mind as object&quot;, then some objects are not mind. If we translate it
  as &quot;mental object&quot;, then everything is object of mind. Body is also object of
  mind. Since we cannot get a satisfactory and adequate translation, it is better to leave
  it untranslated.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have already told you that you practice these four at
  random and so when you are really practicing do not try to find out which one you are
  doing. This is a distraction. As a practitioner of Vipassanaa you have to take what is
  there at the present moment. Do not try to find out whether it is the body, or the
  feeling, or the consciousness or the dhamma. Whatever there is, your duty is to be mindful
  of that object so you do not have covetousness and grief regarding that object.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order not to have covetousness and grief you have to be
  mindful. You have no time to find out whether it is consciousness or dhamma or other
  things. When you practice Vipassanaa meditation you practice all these four foundations of
  mindfulness as they come along. So long as you are mindful of the object at the present
  moment you are doing fine, your meditation is good. What is not good is when you are
  carried away by your thoughts and forget about meditation for some seconds or maybe
  minutes. That is not good. But so long as you are mindful, you are doing the right thing,
  your meditation is going well.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes, yogis think that if they do not concentrate on
  the main object they are not doing meditation. Sometimes they say, &quot;Oh, we have to
  spend time or waste time noting the mind going here and there and we do not have much time
  to concentrate on the main object.&quot; Whether you are aware of the main object or the
  secondary object, so long as you are mindful at that moment you are doing fine. You are
  meditating and practicing Vipassanaa. What is important in Vipassanaa meditation is first
  to be mindful of the object at the present moment. Sometimes you may miss to be mindful
  and then that missing also becomes the object of meditation. You have to say to yourself,
  &quot;missing, missing&quot; or something like that before you go back to the home object.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There should be mindfulness always, mindfulness here,
  mindfulness there; and if you can keep mindfulness intense, then you will make rapid
  progress and you will begin to see the true nature of things. That is, you will begin to
  see the objects arising and disappearing. When you see the arising and disappearing you
  also see that they are impermanent. When you see they are impermanent you also see their
  suffering nature and also the non-soul nature or that you have no control over these, that
  they arise and disappear at their own free will. So, when you see them you are said to see
  the three general characteristics of all conditioned phenomena. Seeing of these three
  general characteristics of all conditioned phenomena is the essence of Vipassanaa. If you
  practice Vipassanaa you must see these three characteristics because the word
  &quot;Vipassanaa&quot; means &quot;seeing in different ways&quot; and seeing in different
  ways means seeing in the light of impermanence, in the light of suffering and in the light
  of non-soul. What is important in Vipassana is to see these three characteristics and in
  order to see these three characteristics we need to observe, we need to watch and pay
  attention to the objects at that present moment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to pay attention to the object at the present
  moment we need to make effort. Without effort nothing worthwhile can be achieved. This is
  why Buddha said, &quot;ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful.&quot; When we can
  fulfill these conditions -- being ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful -- and have
  concentration we will be able to overcome covetousness and grief regarding the object we
  observe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the summary of the discourse called the Mahaa
  Satipa.t.thaana Sutta, the Great Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness. If you
  understand the summary this much I think you have a firm understanding of what mindfulness
  practice is, and so you will understand how to practice mindfulness meditation. There are
  other detailed instructions for the practice of mindfulness and I hope you are familiar
  with all these instructions. Following these instructions, making effort, applying
  mindfulness and seeing things clearly, may all of us be able to overcome covetousness and
  grief in the world.</font></p>
