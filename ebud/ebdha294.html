      and purity (<B>visuddhi</B>) of the mind from mental defilements, and the

      cut off all impurities. But what we are talking here is knowledge (<B>ñāṇa</B>), 
      of course, knowledge and wisdom are not equivalent terms. For one can 
      collect knowledge by learning, but not wisdom. Wisdom is not something 
      that is accumulated, but it comes from a deep reflection. Therefore, of 
      the three roads, to wit: <B>Suta</B>- learning, <B>Cinta</B>- thinking, <B>
      Bhāvana</B>- meditation, only the third one gives rise to wisdom. But 
      Buddhism does not overlook the fist two steps. It always emphasizes on 
      learning and teaching as the way to dispel ignorance. And some times the 
      two terms knowledge and wisdom are interchangeable.</FONT></SPAN></P>

      In Sri Lanka, in ancient time there were Mahavihara, Abhayagiri 
      (Anuradhapura period); in modern time there were Vidyalankara pirivena, 
      Kaleniya Pirivena, Vajira Pirivena,… to name a few. In Myanmar in the past 
      Pyu, Thaton, Bagan, Amarapura were the great centre of Buddhism where 
      children were sent to monasteries to acquire knowledge. Before the 
      colonial period, Buddhist monasteries were the main schools for children 
      of countries of the Theravada Buddhist tradition (Sri Lanka, Thailand, 
      Myanmar, Lao, Cambodia and some southern provinces of Vietnam). </SPAN>

      <FONT FACE="VU Times"><FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT>n modern time, Buddhist monks 
      and nuns still actively give their services in educational field. Building 
      school, write and distributing books, giving lectures, supporting poor 
      students, and giving Dhamma talks are the most popular way to educate 
      people. Follow the Teacher&#39;s footsteps Buddhist monks and nuns wander 
      place to place to awaken people to the reality of life. A typical 
      progressive talk start from charity (dana), to morality (sila), to 
      heavenly states (sagga), to renunciation (nekkhamma), and finally to the 
      Four Noble Truths that embody the liberation from all form of suffering. 
      Thus Buddhist education is the way leading upward, though it does not 
      stress much on the skills and knowledge for material gains, but it always 
      encourages people &quot;to be able&quot; in supporting oneself and one family, to 
      benefit society, and above all, to be detached, liberated from greed, 
      hatred, and delusion.</FONT></SPAN></P>
