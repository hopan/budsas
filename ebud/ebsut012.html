Then the Lord addressed the monks thus: "Monks, it is through not
understanding, not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that I as well as you
have for a long time run on and gone round the cycle of birth-and-death. What are
they? 
<P>
By not understanding the <a href="#sacca1">Noble Truth of Dukkha</a> we
have fared on, by not understanding the <A HREF="#sacca2">Noble Truth of the Origin of Dukkha</A>,
by not understanding the <A HREF="#sacca3">Noble Truth of the Cessation of Dukkha</A>
by not understanding the <A HREF="#sacca4">Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of
Dukkha</A>, we have fared on round the cycle of birth-and-death.
And by the understanding, by the penetration of the same Noble Truth of
Dukkha, of the Origin of Dukkha, of the Cessation of Dukkha and of the
Path Leading to the Cessation of Dukkha, the craving for becoming has been
cut off, the support of becoming has been destroyed, there is no more
re-becoming."

<h3>One's duties with regard to each of the Four Noble Truths</h3>
[The Buddha speaks of his Awakening:]
<blockquote>
"Vision arose, insight arose, discernment arose, knowledge arose, illumination
arose within me with regard to things never heard before: 
<p>
'This is the absolute
truth of stress'... <b>'This absolute truth of stress is to be comprehended'</b>...
'This absolute truth of stress has been comprehended'... 
<p>'This is the absolute
truth of the origination of stress'... <B>'This absolute truth of the origination of
stress is to be abandoned'</B>... 'This absolute truth of the origination of stress
has been abandoned'... 
<p>
This is the absolute truth of the stopping of stress'...
<b>'This absolute truth of the stopping of stress is to be directly experienced'</b>...
'This absolute truth of the stopping of stress has been directly experienced'...
<p>
'This is the absolute truth of the way leading to the stopping of stress'...
<b>'This absolute truth of the way leading to the stopping of stress is to be
developed'</b>... 'This absolute truth of the way leading to the stopping of stress
has been developed.'
<p>
"And, monks, as long as this knowledge  and  vision of mine -- with its three rounds  and  twelve permutations
concerning these four absolute truths as they actually are -- was not pure, I did not claim to have directly
awakened to the right self-awakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its deities, Maras  and  Gods, with its
contemplatives  and  priests, its royalty  and  commonfolk. But as soon as this knowledge  and  vision of mine -- with
its three rounds  and  twelve permutations concerning these four absolute truths as they actually are -- was truly
pure, then I did claim to have directly awakened to the right self-awakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its
deities, Maras  and  Gods, with its contemplatives  and  priests, its royalty  and  commonfolk. The knowledge  and  
vision arose in me: 'Unprovoked is my release. This is the last birth. There is now no further becoming.'"

Now this, monks, is the Noble Truth of Dukkha:
Birth is dukkha, ageing is dukkha, death is dukkha;
sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief,  and  despair are dukkha;
association with things disliked is dukkha; separation from things liked is
dukkha; not getting what one wants is dukkha; in short, the five

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The All is aflame. Which All is aflame? The eye is aflame. Forms are aflame. Eye
consciousness is aflame. Eye contact is aflame. And whatever there is that arises
in dependence on eye contact, experienced as pleasure, pain or
neither-pleasure-nor-pain, that too is aflame. Aflame with what? Aflame with the
fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. Aflame, I tell you,
with birth, aging,  and  death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses,  and 
despairs.

The ear is aflame. Sounds are aflame....<br>
The nose is aflame. Smells are aflame....<br>
The tongue is aflame. Tastes are aflame....<br>
The body is aflame. Tactile sensations are aflame....<p>
The intellect is aflame. Ideas are aflame. Intellect consciousness is aflame.
Intellect contact is aflame. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on

<h3>Unraveling the causes of suffering</h3>
<blockquote>The ending of the effluents is for one who knows  and  sees, I tell you, not for one
who does not know  and  does not see. For one who knows what  and  sees what?...'Such is
form, such its origination, such its disappearance. Such is feeling.... Such is
perception....Such are fabrications....Such is consciousness, such its
origination, such its disappearance.' The ending of the effluents is for one who
knows in this way  and  sees in this way. 
<p>
The knowledge of ending in the presence of ending has its prerequisite, I tell
you. It is not without a prerequisite. And what is its prerequisite? Release...
Release has its prerequisite, I tell you. It is not without a prerequisite. And
what is its prerequisite? Dispassion....Disenchantment....Knowledge  and  vision of
things as they actually are present....Concentration....Pleasure....Serenity....
Rapture....Joy....Conviction....
Stress....Birth....Becoming....Clinging....Craving....Feeling....Contact....The
six sense media....Name- and -form....Consciousness....Fabrications....Fabrications
have their prerequisite, I tell you. They are not without a prerequisite. And
what is their prerequisite? Ignorance....
<p>
Just as when the gods pour rain in heavy drops  and  crash thunder on the upper
mountains: The water, flowing down along the slopes, fills the mountain clefts  and 
rifts  and  gullies. When the mountain clefts  and  rifts  and  gullies are full, they fill
the little ponds. When the little ponds are full, they fill the big lakes...the
little rivers...the big rivers. When the big rivers are full, they fill the great
ocean. In the same way:<P></blockquote>

<h3>This/That Conditionality</h3>
<blockquote>And what is the noble method that is rightly seen and rightly ferreted out by
discernment? There is the case where a noble disciple notices: <p>
<blockquote>
<i>When this is, that is. </i><br>
<i>From the arising of this comes the arising of that. </i><br>
<i>When this isn't, that isn't. </i><br>
<i>From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that. </i>
</blockquote>
In other words: <p>
From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications. <br>
From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness. <br>
From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form. <br>
From name-and-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media. <br>
From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact. <br>
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. <br>
From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. <br>
From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance. <br>
From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming. <br>
From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. <br>
From birth as a requisite condition, then old age and death, sorrow,
lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play. <br>
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress and suffering.
<p>
Now from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance comes
the cessation of fabrications. <br>
From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness. <br>
From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-and-form. <br>
From the cessation of name-and-form comes the cessation of the six sense media. <br>
From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact. <br>
From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling. <br>
From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving. <br>
From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance. <br>
From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming. <br>
From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth. <br>
From the cessation of birth, then old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain,
distress, and despair all cease. <br>
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of
stress and suffering.<p>
This is the noble method that is rightly seen and rightly ferreted out by
discernment.<p>

<h3>An ancient path rediscovered</h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is just as if a man, traveling along a wilderness track, were to see an ancient path, 
an ancient road, traveled by people of former times.  He would follow it.  Following it, 
he would see an ancient city, an ancient capital inhabited by people of former times, 
complete with parks, groves,  and  ponds, walled, delightful.  He would go to address 
the king or the king�s minister, saying, "Sire, you should know that while traveling 
along a wilderness track I saw an ancient path...I followed it...I saw an ancient city, 
an ancient capital...complete with parks, groves,  and  ponds, walled, delightful.  Sire, rebuild that city!"  
Then the king or king's minister would rebuild the city, so that at a later date the 
city would become powerful, rich,  and  well-populated, fully grown  and  prosperous.   
<p>
In the same way I saw an ancient path, an ancient road, traveled by the Rightly 
Self-awakened Ones of former times.  And what is that ancient path...?  
Just this <b>noble eightfold path</b>:  
right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration .... I followed that path.
<P>  
Following it, I came to direct knowledge of aging  and  death, 
direct knowledge of the origination of aging  and  death, 
direct knowledge of the cessation of aging  and  death, 
direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of aging  and  death.  
I followed that path.  
Following it, I came to direct knowledge of birth...becoming...clinging... 
craving...feeling... contact...the six sense spheres...name  and  form...consciousness, 
direct knowledge of the origination of consciousness, 
direct knowledge of the cessation of consciousness, direct knowledge of the path 
leading to the cessation of consciousness.  I followed that path.  
<p>
Following it, I came to direct knowledge of processes, 
direct knowledge of the origination of processes, 
direct knowledge of the cessation of processes, 
direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of processes.  
Knowing that directly, I have revealed it to monks, nuns, male lay adherents, 
 and  female lay adherents, so that this holy life has become powerful, 
rich, detailed, well-populated, wide-spread, proclaimed among celestial  and  human beings.

<h3>More on Right View</h3>
And how is right view the forerunner?  One discerns 'wrong view, wrong view.'  
One discerns 'right view, right view.'  This is one's right view.  

<p>
And what is wrong view?  
'There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed.  There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions.
  There is no this world, no next world, no mother, no father, no spontaneously reborn beings; 
  no priests or contemplatives who, faring rightly and practicing rightly, proclaim this world and 
  the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves.'  This is wrong view.
<p>
And what is right view?  Right view, I tell you, is of two sorts:  
There is right view with fermentations, siding with merit, resulting in the paraphernalia (of becoming); 
and there is noble right view, free from fermentations, transcendent, a factor of the path.
<p>
And what is the right view that has fermentations, sides with merit, and results in paraphernalia?
'There is what is given, what is offered, what is sacrificed.  There are fruits and results of good
 and bad actions.  There is this world and the next world.  There is mother and father.  
 There are spontaneously reborn beings; there are priests and contemplatives who, 
 faring rightly and practicing rightly, proclaim this world and the next after having 
 directly known and realized it for themselves.'  
 This is the right view that has fermentations, sides with merit, and results in paraphernalia.
<p>
And what is the right view that is free from fermentations, transcendent, a factor of the path?  
The discernment, the faculty of discernment, the strength of discernment, analysis of qualities 
as a factor of awakening, the path factor of right view in one developing the noble path whose 
mind is noble, whose mind is free from fermentations, who is fully possessed of the noble path.   
This is the right view that is free from fermentations, transcendent, a factor of the path.  
<p>
One tries to abandon wrong view and to enter into right view:  This is one's 
<A HREF="#samma-vayamo">right effort</A>.  
One is mindful to abandon wrong view and to enter and remain in right view:  
This is one's <A HREF="#samma-sati">right mindfulness</A>.  
Thus these three qualities -- right view, <A HREF="#samma-vayamo">right effort</A>, and <A HREF="#samma-sati">right mindfulness</A> -- run and
 circle around right view.

<h3>Sorting through the many kinds of wrong view</h3>
There is the case where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person... does not
discern what ideas are fit for attention, or what ideas are unfit for
attention. This being so, he does not attend to ideas fit for attention, and
attends instead to ideas unfit for attention....This is how he attends
inappropriately: 'Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the
past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past? Shall I
be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future?
How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?'
Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present: 'Am I? Am I not?
What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?'<p>
As this person attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds of view
arises in him: The view <i>I have a self</i> arises in him as true and
established, or the view<i> I have no self</i>...or the view<i> It is by means
of self that I perceive self</i>...or the view <i>It is by means of self that I
perceive not-self</i>...or the view <i>It is by means of not-self that I
perceive self</i> arises in him as true and established, or else he has a view
like this: <i>This very self of mine -- the knower that is sensitive here and
there to the ripening of good and bad actions -- is the self of mine that is
constant, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and will endure as long
as eternity. </i>This is called a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a
contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. Bound by a fetter
of views, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is not freed from birth,
aging, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. He is
not freed from stress, I say.<p>
The well-taught noble disciple...discerns what ideas are fit for attention, and
what ideas are unfit for attention. This being so, he does not attend to ideas
unfit for attention, and attends instead to ideas fit for attention....He
attends appropriately, <i>This is stress...This is the origin of stress...This
is the cessation of stress...This is the way leading to the cessation of
stress.</i> As he attends appropriately in this way, three fetters are
abandoned in him: identity-view, doubt, and grasping at precepts and
practices.<p>

<h3>When one's knowledge is independent of others</h3>
Kaccayana: 'Lord, "Right view, right view," it is said. To what extent is there
right view?'<p>
The Buddha: 'By and large, Kaccayana, this cosmos is supported by (takes as its
object) a polarity, that of existence and non-existence. But when one sees the
origination of the cosmos as it actually is with right discernment,
"non-existence" with reference to the cosmos does not occur to one. When one
sees the cessation of the cosmos as it actually is with right discernment,
"existence" with reference to the cosmos does not occur to one. <p>
'By and large, Kaccayana, this cosmos is in bondage to attachments, clingings
(sustenances), and biases. But one such as this does not get involved with or
cling to these attachments, clingings, fixations of awareness, biases, and
latent tendencies; nor is he resolved on "my self." He has no uncertainty or
doubt that, when there is arising, only stress is arising; and that when there
is passing away, stress is passing away. In this, one's knowledge is
independent of others. It is to this extent, Kaccayana, that there is right
view.'<p>

Abandoning false speech, [a monk] abstains from false speech.  
He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of the world.  
Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech.  
What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from the people here.  
What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from the people there.  
Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united, he loves concord, 
delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things that create concord.  
Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive speech.  
He speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that go to the heart, 
that are polite, appealing and pleasing to people at large.  
Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter.  
He speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with the goal, the Dhamma, and the discipline.  
He speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed, connected with the goal.

<h3>Reflect on your speech, before, during, and after speaking...</h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[The Buddha speaks to his son, Rahula:]
Whenever you want to perform a verbal act, you should reflect on it: 
'This verbal act I want to perform -- would it lead to self-affliction, 
to the affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful verbal act, 
with painful consequences, painful results?' 
If, on reflection, you know that it would lead to self-affliction, 
to the affliction of others, or to both; it would be an unskillful 
verbal act with painful consequences, painful results, 
then any verbal act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do. 
But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction... 
it would be a skillful verbal action with happy consequences, 
happy results, then any verbal act of that sort is fit for you to do.
<p>
While you are performing a verbal act, you should reflect on it: 
'This verbal act I am doing -- is it leading to self-affliction, 
to the affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful verbal act, 
with painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, 
you know that it is leading to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, 
or to both... you should give it up. 
But if on reflection you know that it is not... you may continue with it.
<p>
Having performed a verbal act, you should reflect on it.... If, on reflection, 
you know that it led to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; 
it was an unskillful verbal act with painful consequences, painful results, 
then you should confess it, reveal it, lay it open to the Teacher or to a 
knowledgeable companion in the holy life. Having confessed it... you should exercise restraint 
in the future. But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction... 
it was a skillful verbal action with happy consequences, happy results, 
then you should stay mentally refreshed and joyful, training day and night 
in skillful mental qualities.

<h3>How to admonish another</h3>
Although the Buddha offered this advice to the bhikkhus (monks), 
lay-followers will also find it to be worthy of deep reflection. 
If you have ever "blown up" at someone, only to regret it later, consider this...
<BLOCKQUOTE>
O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who desires to admonish another should do so after 
investigating five conditions in himself and after establishing  five other conditions in
himself. What are the five conditions which he should investigate in himself?
<p>
(1) Am I one who practises purity in bodily action, flawless and untainted...?
<p>
(2) Am I one who practises purity in speech, flawless and untainted...?
<p>
(3) Is the heart of goodwill, free from malice, established in me towards fellow-farers in the holy life...?
<p>
(4) Am I or am I not one who has heard much, who bears in mind what he has heard,
who stores up what he has heard? Those teachings which are good alike in their beginning, middle, and ending,
proclaiming perfectly the spirit and the letter of the utterly purified holy life -- have such teachings
been much heard by me, borne in mind, practised in speech, pondered in the heart and rightly penetrated by insight...?
<p>
(5) Are the Patimokkhas [rules of conduct for monks and nuns] in full thoroughly learnt by heart,
well-analyzed with thorough knowledge of their meanings, clearly divided sutta by sutta and known in minute detail
by me...?
<p>
These five conditions must be investigated in himself.
<p>
And what other five conditions must be etablished in himself?
<p>
(1) Do I speak at the right time, or not?<br>
(2) Do I speak of facts, or not?<br>
(3) Do I speak gently or harshly?<br>
(4) Do I speak profitable words or not?<br>
(5) Do I speak with a kindly heart, or inwardly malicious?
<p>
O bhikkhus, these five conditions are to be investigated in himself and the latter five established in himself
by a bhikkhu who desires to admonish another.

Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given. 
 He takes only what is given, accepts only what is given, 
 lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure.  
 Abandoning uncelibacy, he lives a celibate life, aloof, 
 refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way.

<h3>Right effort is like fine-tuning a musical instrument</h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As Ven. Sona was meditating in seclusion (after doing walking meditation until 
the skin of his soles was split and bleeding), this train of thought arose in his awareness:
"Of the Blessed One's disciples who have aroused their persistence, 
I am one, but my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clinging/sustenance.
Now, my family has enough wealth that it would be possible to enjoy wealth and make merit.
What if I were to disavow the training, return to the lower life, and to enjoy wealth and make merit?"
<p>
Then the Blessed One, as soon as he perceived with his awareness the train of thought in Ven. Sona's 
awareness -- as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or bend his outstretched arm -- disappeared 
from Mount Vulture Peak, appeared in the Cool Wood right in front of Ven. Sona, and sat down on a prepared 
seat.  Ven. Sona, after bowing down to the Blessed One, sat down to one side.  As he was sitting there, 
the Blessed One said to him, 
<p>
"Just now, as you were meditating in seclusion, didn't this train of thought 
appear to your awareness:  'Of the Blessed One's disciples who have aroused their persistence, 
I am one, but my mind is not released from the effluents....What if I were to disavow the training, 
return to the lower life, and to enjoy wealth and make merit?'"
<p>
"Yes, venerable sir."
<p>
"Now what do you think, Sona.  Before, when you were a house-dweller, were you skilled at playing the vina?"
<p>
"Yes, venerable sir."
<p>
"...And when the strings of your vina were too taut, was your vina in tune and playable?"
<p>
"No, venerable sir."
<p>
"...And when the strings of your vina were too loose, was your vina in tune and playable?"
<p>
"No, venerable sir."
<p>
"...And when the strings of your vina were neither too taut nor too loose, but tuned [lit: 'established'] 
to be right on pitch, was your vina in tune and playable?"
<p>
"Yes, venerable sir."
<p>
"In the same way, Sona, over-aroused persistence leads to restlessness, 
overly slack persistence leads to laziness.  
Thus you should determine the right pitch for your persistence, fine-tune ['penetrate', 'ferret out'] 
the pitch of the [five] faculties [to that], and there pick up your theme."
<p>
"Yes, venerable sir," Ven. Sona answered the Blessed One.  
Then, having given this exhortation to Ven. Sona, the Blessed One -- as a strong man might 
stretch out his bent arm or bend his outstretched arm -- disappeared 
from the Cool Wood and appeared on Mount Vulture Peak.
<p>  
So after that, Ven. Sona determined the right pitch for his persistence, 
fine-tuned the pitch of the [five] faculties [to that], and there picked up his theme.  
Dwelling alone, secluded, uncomplacent, ardent and resolute, he in no long 
time reached and remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which
clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing and
realizing it for himself in the here and now.  
He knew:  "Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.  
There is nothing further for the sake of this world."  
And thus Ven. Sona became another one of the Arahants.

<h3>Mindfulness is like balancing a pot of oil on one's head</h3>

"Suppose, monks, that a large crowd of people comes thronging together, saying, 
'The beauty queen!  The beauty queen!'  And suppose that the beauty queen is 
highly accomplished at singing and dancing, so that an even greater crowd
comes thronging, saying, 'The beauty queen is singing!  The beauty queen is dancing!'
Then a man comes along, desiring life and shrinking from death, desiring pleasure
and abhorring pain.  
They say to him, 'Now look here, mister.  You must take this bowl filled to the brim
with oil and carry it on your head in between the great crowd and the beauty queen.  
A man with a raised sword will follow right behind you, and wherever you spill even a drop of oil, 
right there will he cut off your head.'  
Now what do you think, monks:  Will that man, not paying attention to the bowl of oil, 
let himself get distracted outside?"
<p>
"No, venerable sir."
<p>
"I have given you this parable to convey a meaning.  The meaning is this:  
The bowl filled to the brim with oil stands for mindfulness immersed in the body.  
Thus you should train yourselves:  'We will develop mindfulness immersed in the body.
We will pursue it, make it our vehicle, make it our homesite.   
We will practice it, acquaint ourselves well with it, and set about it properly.'  
Thus you should train yourselves."

<h3>The four developments of concentration</h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These are the four developments of concentration.  What four?  
There is the development of concentration that, when developed and pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here and now.  
There is the development of concentration that...leads to the attainment of knowledge and vision.
There is the development of concentration that...leads to mindfulness and alertness.  
There is the development of concentration that, when developed and pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents.
<p>
(1) And what is the development of concentration that, when developed and pursued, 
leads to a pleasant abiding in the here and now?  There is the case where a monk -- 
quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful qualities -- enters and 
remains in the first jhana:  
rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.  
With the stilling of directed thought and evaluation, he enters and remains in the second jhana:  
rapture and pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation -- internal assurance.  
With the fading of rapture he remains in  equanimity, mindful and alert, and physically sensitive of pleasure.  
He enters and remains in the third jhana, and of him the Noble Ones declare, "Equanimous and mindful, 
he has a pleasurable abiding."  With the the abandoning of pleasure and pain -- as with the earlier 
disappearance of elation and distress -- he enters and remains in the fourth jhana:  
purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.  
This is the development of concentration that...leads to a pleasant abiding in the here and now.
<p>
(2) And what is the development of concentration that...leads to the attainment of knowledge and vision?  
There is the case where a monk has the perception of light, the perception of daytime (at any hour of the day) 
well-fixed and well in hand.  Day (for him) is the same as night, night is the same as day.  
By means of an awareness open and unhampered, he develops a brightened mind.  
This is the development of concentration that...leads to the attainment of knowledge and vision.
<p>
(3) And what is the development of concentration that...leads to mindfulness and alertness?  
There is the case where a monk is conscious of feelings as they arise, as they persist, as they go 
totally to their end.  He is conscious of perceptions as they arise, as they persist, as they go 
totally to their end.  He is conscious of thoughts as they arise, as they persist, as they go 
totally to their end.  This is the development of concentration that...leads to mindfulness and alertness.
<p>
(4) And what is the development of concentration that...leads to the ending of the effluents?  
There is the case where a monk remains focused on arising and falling away with reference 
to the five aggregates for sustenance/clinging:  "Such is form, such its origination, 
such its passing away.  Such is feeling... Such is perception...Such are processes...Such 
is consciousness, such its origination, such its passing away."  This is the development of concentration
