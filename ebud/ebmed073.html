        comfortably erect, without leaning forward or backward, left or right.
        Close your eyes and think thoughts of good will. Thoughts of good will
        go first to yourself, because if you can't think good will for yourself
        -- if you can't feel a sincere desire for your own happiness -- there's
        no way you can truly wish for the happiness of others. So just tell
        yourself, &quot;May I find true happiness.&quot; Remind yourself that
        true happiness is something that comes from within, so this is not a
        selfish desire. In fact, if you find and develop the resources for
        happiness within you, you're able to radiate it out to other people.
        It's a happiness that doesn't depend on taking away anything away from
        anyone else.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So now spread good will to other people.
        First, people who are close to your heart -- your family, your parents,
        your very close friends: May they find true happiness, as well. Then
        spread those thoughts out in ever widening circles: people you know
        well, people you don't know so well, people you like, people you know
        and are neutral about, and even people you don't like. Don't let there
        be any limitations on your good will, for if there are, there will be
        limitations on your mind. Now spread thoughts of good will to people you
        don't even know -- and not just people; all living beings of all kinds
        in all directions: east, west, north, south, above, and below, out to
        infinity. May they find true happiness, too.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then bring your thoughts back to the
        present. If you want true happiness, you have to find it in the present,
        for the past is gone and the future is an uncertainty. So you have to
        dig down into the present. What do you have right here? You've got the
        body, sitting here and breathing. And you've got the mind, thinking and
        aware. So bring all these things together. Think about the breath and
        then be aware of the breath as it comes in and goes out. Keeping your
        thoughts directed to the breath: that's mindfulness. Being aware of the
        breath as it comes in and out: that's alertness. Keep those two aspects
        of the mind together. If you want, you can use a meditation word to
        strengthen your mindfulness. Try &quot;<strong>Buddho</strong>,&quot;
        which means &quot;awake.&quot; Think &quot;<strong>bud-</strong>&quot;
        with the in-breath, &quot;<strong>dho</strong>&quot; with the out.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Try to breathe as comfortably as
        possible. A very concrete way of learning how to provide for your own
        happiness in the immediate present -- and at the same time,
        strengthening your alertness -- is to let yourself breathe in a way
        that's comfortable. Experiment to see what kind of breathing feels best
        for the body right now. It might be long breathing, short breathing; in
        long, out short; or in short, out long. Heavy or light, fast or slow,
        shallow or deep. Once you find a rhythm that feels comfortable, stay
        with it for a while. Learn to savor the sensation of the breathing.
        Generally speaking, the smoother the texture of the breath, the better.
        Think of the breath, not simply as the air coming in and out of the
        lungs, but as the entire energy flow that courses through the body with
        each in-and-out breath. Be sensitive to the texture of that energy flow.
        You may find that the body changes after a while. One rhythm or texture
        may feel right for a while, and then something else will feel more
        comfortable. Learn how to listen and respond to what the body is telling
        you right now. What kind of breath energy does it need? How can you best
        provide for that need? If you feel tired, try to breathe in a way that
        energizes the body. If you feel tense, try to breathe in a way that's
        relaxing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If your mind wanders off, gently bring
        it right back. If it wanders off ten times, a hundred times, bring it
        back ten times, a hundred times. Don't give in. This quality is called
        ardency. In other words, as soon as you realize that the mind has
        slipped away, you bring it right back. You don't spend time aimlessly
        sniffing at the flowers, looking at the sky, or listening to the birds.
        You've got work to do: work in learning how to breathe comfortably, how
        to let the mind settle down in a good space here in the present moment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the breath starts feeling
        comfortable, you can start exploring it in other areas of the body. If
        you simply stay with the comfortable breath in a narrow range, you'll
        tend to doze off. So consciously expand your awareness. A good place to
        focus first is right around the navel. Locate that part of the body in
        your awareness: where is it right now? Then notice: how does it feel
        there as you breathe in? How does it feel when you breathe out? Watch it
        for a couple of breaths, and notice if there's any sense of tension or
        tightness in that part of the body, either with the in-breath or with
        the out-breath. Is it tensing up as you breathe in? Are you holding onto
        the tension as you breathe out? Are you putting too much force on the
        out-breath? If you catch yourself doing any of these things, just relax.
        Think of that tension dissolving away in the sensation of the in-breath,
        the sensation of the out-breath. If you want, you can think of the
        breath energy coming into the body right there at the navel, working
        through any tension or tightness that you might feel there ...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then move your awareness to the right --
        to the lower right-hand corner of your abdomen -- and follow the same
        three steps there: 1) locate that general part of the body in your
        awareness; 2) notice how it feels as you breathe in, how it feels as you
        breathe out; and 3) if you sense any tension or tightness in the breath,
        just let it relax ... Now move your awareness to the left, to the lower
        left-hand corner of your abdomen, and follow the same three steps there.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now move your awareness up to the solar
        plexus ... and then to the right, to the right flank ... to the left
        flank ... to the middle of the chest ... After a while move up to the
        base of the throat ... and then to the middle of the head. Be very
        careful with the breath energy in the head. Think of it very gently
        coming in, not only through the nose but also through the eyes, the
        ears, down from the top of the head, in from the back of the neck, very
        gently working through and loosening up any tension you may feel, say,
        around your jaws, the back of your neck, around your eyes, or around
        your face ...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">From there you can move your attention
        gradually down the back, out the legs, to the tips of the toes, the
        spaces between the toes. As before, focus on a particular part of the
        body, notice how it feels with the in-breath and out-breath, relax any
        sensation of tension or tightness you might feel there, so that the
        breath energy can flow more freely, and then move on until you've
        reached the tips of the toes. Then repeat the process, beginning at the
        back of the neck and going down the shoulders, through the arms, past
        your wrists, and out through your fingers.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You can repeat this survey of the body
        as many times as you like until the mind feels ready to settle down.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then let your attention return to any
        spot in the body where it feels most naturally settled and centered.
        Simply let your attention rest there, at one with the breath. At the
        same time let the range of your awareness spread out so that it fills
        the entire body, like the light of a candle in the middle of a room: the
        candle flame is in one spot, but its light fills the entire room. Or
        like a spider on a web: the spider's in one spot, but it knows the whole
        web. Be keen on maintaining that broadened sense of awareness. You'll
        find that it tends to shrink, like a balloon with a small hole in it, so
        keep broadening its range, thinking &quot;whole body, whole body, breath
        in the whole body, from the top of the head down into the tips of the
        toes.&quot; Think of the breath energy coming in and out of the body
        through every pore. Make a point of staying with this centered,
        broadened awareness as long as you can. There's nothing else you have to
        think about right now, nowhere else to go, nothing else to do. Just stay
        with this centered, broadened awareness of the present ...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the time comes to leave meditation,
        remind yourself that there's a skill to leaving. In other words, you
        don't just jump right out. My teacher, Ajaan Fuang, once said that when
        most people meditate, it's as if they're climbing a ladder up to the
        second story of a building: step-by-step-by-step, rung-by-rung, slowly
        up the ladder. But as soon as they get to the second story, they jump
        out the window. Don't let yourself be that way. Think of how much effort
        went into getting yourself centered. Don't throw it away.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first step in leaving is to spread
        thoughts of good will once more to all the people around you. Then,
        before you open your eyes, remind yourself that even though you're going
        to have your eyes open, you want your attention to stay centered in the
        body, at the breath. Try to maintain that center as long as you can, as
        you get up, walk around, talk, listen, whatever. In other words, the
        skill of leaving meditation lies in learning how not to leave it,
        regardless of whatever else you may be doing. Act from that sense of
        being centered. If you can keep the mind centered in this way, you'll
        have a standard against which you can measure its movements, its
        reactions to the events around it and within it. Only when you have a
        solid center like this can you gain insight into the movements of the
        mind.</font></p>
