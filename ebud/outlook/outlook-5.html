        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he Buddha said
        that one should realize the impermanence of all things. Everybody is
        subject to old age, sickness and death. All thins are susceptible to
        change. What one is enjoying today may be changed tomorrow. Many people
        do not want to face this turth; they are too attached to the pleasant
        things which one can enjoy through eyes, ears, nose, tongue and
        body-sense. They do not realize that these things are not true
        happiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha cured people's ignorance by
        helping them to have right understanding about their life; the taught
        them Dhamma. The Buddha taught different ways of developing
        wholesomeness: <i>dana</i> or generosity, <i>sila</i> or morality, and <i>bhavana</i>
        or mental develpment. <i>Bhavana</i> is a way of<i> kusala</i> <i>kamma</i>
        which is on a higher level, because wisdom is developed through <i>bhavana</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One may wonder why wisdom (in Pali, <i>panna</i>)
        is necessary. The answer is that only rnderstanding things as they are
        can eleminate ignorance. Out of ignorance people take what is
        unwholesome for wholesome. ignorance causes sorrow. The Buddha always
        helped people to have right understanding about their different <i>cittas</i>.
        He explained what <i>akusala</i> <i>cittas</i> are in order that people
        could develop more wholesomeness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One can verfy in one's daily life that
        the Buddha taught the truth. His teachings are true not only for
        Buddhists, but for everybody, no matter what race or nationality he is
        or what religion he professes. Attachment or greed (in Pali, <i>lobha</i>),
        anger or aversion (in Pali, <i>dosa</i>), and ignorance (in Pali, <i>moha</i>)
        are common to everybody, not only to Buddhists. Should not everyone
        eradicate <i>lobha</i>, <i>dosa</i> and <i>moha</i>?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">People do not always realize that <i>lobha</i>,
        <i>dosa</i> and <i>moha</i> lead to sorrow. They may recognize
        unwholesomeness when it is coarse, but not when it is more subtle. For
        example, they may know that the <i>citta </i>is unwholesome when <i>lobha</i>
        is as coarse as greed or lust, but not when it is more subtle, such as
        when there is attachment to beautiful things or to dear people. Why is
        it unwholesome to have attachment to one's relatives and friends?&nbsp;
        It is true that we cannot help having <i>lobha</i>, but we should
        realize that attachment is not the same as pure loving-kindness, there
        can be moments of attachment too. Attachment is not wholesome; it will
        sooner or later bring unhappiness. Although people may not like to see
        this truth, they will one day experience that <i>lobha</i> brings
        unhappiness. Through death we are bound to lose people who are dear to
        us.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">And when sickness or old age affect our
        sense faculties we may no longer be able to enjoy beautiful things
        through eyes and ears.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we do not have the right
        understanding of the realities of life we will not know how to bear the
        loss of dear people. We read in the 'U<i>dana</i>' (Khuddaka Nikaya, U<i>dana</i>,
        Chapter VIII, Pataligama, par. 8) that Visakha lost her granddaughter.
        She came to see the Buddha with 'wet clothes and wet hair.'&nbsp; The
        Buddha said to her:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt;"><font face="Times New Roman">'Why,
          Visakha! How is it that you come here with clothes and hair still wet
          at an unseasonable hour?'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'O, sir, my dear and lovely
          granddaughter is dead!&nbsp; That is why I come here with hair anc
          clothes still wet at an unseasonable hour.'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'Visakha, would you like to
          have as many sons and grandsons as there are men in Savatthi?'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'Yes, sir, I would indeed!'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'But how many men do you
          suppose die daily in Savatthi?'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'Ten, sir, or maybe nine, or
          eight. Maybe seven, six, five or four, three, two; maybe one a day
          dies in Savatthi, sir. Savatthi is never free from men dying, sir.'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'What think you, Visakha?&nbsp;
          In such case would you ever be without wet hair and clothes?'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'Surely not, sir! Enough for
          me, sir, of so many sons and grandsons!'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'Visakha, whoso have a hundred
          things beloved, they have a hundred sorrows. Whoso have ninety,
          eighty...thirty, twenty things beloved ... whoso have ten ... whoso
          have but one thing beloved, have but one sorrow. Whoso have no one
          thing beloved, they have no sorrow. Sorrowless are they are
          passionless. Serene are they, I declare.'</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">People who see that it
        is unwholesome to be enslaved by attachment to people and to things
        around themselves, want to develop more understanding of realities
        through <i>bhavana</i> (mental development). Studying the Buddha's
        teachings and explaining them to others is<i> kusala</i> <i>kamma</i> of
        the kind of <i>bhavana</i>. In studying the teachings <i>panna</i> will
        be developed. If we want to understand what the Buddha taught it is
        essential to read the Buddha's teachings as they have come down to us at
        the present time in the 'Three Collections'; the '<i>Vinaya</i>', the '<i>Suttanta</i>'
        and the '<i>Abhidhamma</i>'. Study alone, however, is not enough. We
        should experience the truth of Dhamma in daily life. Only then will we
        know things as they really are. Teaching Dhamma to other people is<i>
        kusala</i> <i>kamma</i> of a high degree. In this way one not only helps
        other people to have more understanding about their life, one develops
        one's own understanding as well. Teaching Dhamma is the most effective
        way of helping other people to find true happiness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another way of<i> kusala</i> <i>kamma</i>
        included in <i>bhavana</i> is tranquil meditation or '<i>samatha</i> <i>bhavana</i>'.
        In <i>samatha</i> one concentrates on one object of meditation in order
        to purify oneself of <i>lobha</i>, <i>dosa</i> and <i>moha</i>. When one
        is more advanced in concentration one can attain different stages of
        jhana or absorption-concentration. The <i>jhanacittas</i> are<i> kusala</i>
        <i>cittas</i>; when the <i>citta </i>is jhana<i>citta </i>there is no <i>lobha</i>,
        <i>dosa</i> or <i>moha</i>. At the moment of <i>jhana</i> one develops<i>
        kusala</i> <i>kamma</i>. Jhana is not the same as the trance which might
        be experienced after taking certain drugs. Those who take drugs want to
        obtain the desired end in an easy way and their action is prompted by <i>lobha</i>.
        Those who apply themselves to <i>samatha</i> have the sincere wish to
        purify themselves of <i>lobha</i>, <i>dosa</i> and <i>moha</i>; they do
        not look for sensational or thrilling experiences.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Samatha</i> can purify the mind, but
        it cannot eradicate unwholesome latent tendencies. When the <i>citta </i>is
        not <i>jhanacitta</i>, <i>lobha</i>, <i>dosa</i> and <i>moha</i> can
        arise again. The person who applies himself to <i>samatha</i> cannot
        eradicate the belief in a self, and as long as there is the concept of
        self, defilements cannot be eradicated.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The concept of self can only be
        eradicated through <i>vipassana</i>. <i>Vipassana</i> or 'insight
        meditation' is another way of<i> kusala</i> <i>kamma</i> included in <i>bhavana</i>.
        In <i>vipassana</i>, ignorance about reality is eliminated. One learns
        to see things as they are in being aware, for example, when one sees,
        hears, smells, tastes, when one receives impressions through body-sense
        or when one thinks. When we experience that all things are only <i>nama</i>
        and <i>rupa</i> which arise and fall away, we will cling less to <i>nama</i>
        and <i>rupa</i>, and we will be less inclined to take them for self.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is the reason that we are all
        inclined to cling to a self? The reason is that because of our ignorance
        we do not know things as they really are. When one hears a sound, one is
        ignorant of the different phenomena which occur during the moment one is
        hearing that sound. One thinks that it is a self who is hearing.
        However, it is not a self who is hearing; it is a <i>citta </i>which
        hears the sound. <i>Citta </i>is a mental phenomena, it is <i>nama</i>,
        that is, the reality which experiences something. The <i>citta </i>which
        hears experiences the sound. Sound itself does not experience anything.
        Sound and ear-sense are conditios for hearing. Ear-sense is <i>rupa</i>
        as well. One may wonder whether it is true that ear-sense does not
        experience anything. Ear-sense is a kind of <i>rupa</i> in the ear which
        has the capacity to receive sound, but it does not experience the sound.
        It is only a condition for the <i>nama</i> which experience the sound.
        Each <i>citta </i>has its own conditions through which it arises. Seeing
        has eye-sense as the physical condition and color as the object. There
        is no self which performs different functions such as seeing, hearing,
        smelling, tasting, receiving impressions through body-sense and
        thinking. These are different <i>nama</i>s each of which arises because
        of its own conditions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Greater Discourse on the
        Destruction of Craving' (Mahatankhasankhaya-sutta, majjhima Nikaya I,
        Mahayamaka-vagga) that the monk Sati had a misconception about the
        Buddha's teaqchings. He understood from the Buddha's teachings that
        consciousness stays, and that it is one and the same consciousness which
        speaks, feels, and experiences the results of good and bad deeds.
        Several monks heard about Sati's wrong view. After they had tried in
        vain to dissuade him from his wrong view, they spoke to the Buddha about
        him. The Buddha summoned Sati and said to him:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt;"><font face="Times New Roman">'Is
          it true, as is said, that a pernicious view like this has accrued to
          you, Sati: &quot;In so far as I understand Dhamma taught by the Lord
          it is that this consciousness itself runs on, fares on, not
          another&quot;?'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'Even so do I, Lord, understand
          Dhamma taught by the Lord: it is this consciousness itself that runs
          on, fares on, not another.'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'What is this consciousness,
          Sati?'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'It is this, Lord, that speaks,
          that feels, that experiences now here, now there, the fruition of
          deeds that are lovely and that are depraved.'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'But to whom, foolish man, do
          you understand that Dhamma was taught by me thus?&nbsp; Foolish man,
          has not consciousness generated by conditions been spoken of in many a
          figure by me, saying: &quot;Apart from condition there is no
          origination of consciousness&quot;?&nbsp; But now you, foolish man,
          not only misrepresent me beacuse of your own grasp, but you also
          injure yourself and give rise to much demerit which, foolish man, will
          be for your woe and sorrow for a long time.'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; ... Then the Lord addressed the
          monks, saying:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'Do you, monks, understand that
          Dhamma was taught by me thus so that this monk Sati, a fisherman's
          son, because of his own wrong grasp not only misrepresents me but is
          also injuring himself and giving rise to much demerit?'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'No, Lord. For in many a figure
          has consciousness generated by conditions been spoken of to us by the
          Lord, saying: &quot;Apart from condition there is no origination of
          consciousness.&quot;'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'It is good, monks, it is good
          that you understand thus Dhamma taught by me to you, monks. For in
          many a figure has consciousness generated by conditions been spoken of
          by me to you, monks, saying: &quot;Apart from condition there is no
          origination of consciousness.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;... It is because, monks, an
          appropriate condition arises that consciousnes sis known by this or
          that name: if consciousness is know by this or that name: if
          consciousness arises because of eye and material shapes, it is known
          as seeing-consciousness; if consciousness arises because of ear and
          sounds it is known as hearing-consciousness; if consciousness arises
          because of nose and smells, it is known as smelling-consciousness; if
          consciousness arises because of tongue and tastes, it is known as
          tasting-consciousness; if consciousness arises because of body and
          touches, it is known as tactile-consciousness; if consciousness arises
          because of mind and mental objects, it is known as mental
          consciousness. Monks, as a fire burns because of this or that
          appropriate condition, by that it is known: if a fire burns because of
          sticks, it is known as a stick-fire; and if a fire burns because of
          chips, it is known as a chip-fire; and if a fire burns because of
          grass, it is known as a grass-fire; and if a fire burns because of
          cowdung, it is known as a cowdung-fire ... Even so, monks, when
          because of a condition appropriate to it consciousness arises, it is
          known by this or that name ...'</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Thinking about
        different kinds of <i>nama</i> and <i>rupa</i> and the conditions
        through which they arise will help us to have right understanding about
        them. However, it is not the same as the direct experience of the truth.
        We will know what <i>nama</i> and <i>rupa</i> really are when we can
        experience their different characteristics as they appear through eyes,
        ears, nose, tongue, body-sense and mind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Nama</i> and <i>rupa</i> succeed one
        another so rapidly that we do not realize that there are different <i>nama</i>-units
        and different <i>rupa</i> units. For example, only perceiving sound is a
        moment which is different from liking or disliking the sound. Knowing
        what the thing is that is heard, is again a different moment. We are
        often inclined to find the <i>citta </i>which likes or the <i>citta </i>which
        dislikes so important that we do not notice the characteristic of the <i>nama</i>
        or <i>rupa</i> which appears at that moment. Thus we cannot see things
        as they are; we think that there is a self which likes or dislikes. Like
        and dislike are only <i>nama</i>s arising because of conditions; like
        and dislike depend on one's accumulations. There are conditions for each
        citta; there is no self which can let any <i>citta </i>arise at this or
        at that moment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We take not only mental phenomena for
        self, we take tha body for self as well. However, the body consists of
        nothing but different <i>rupa</i>-elements which arise and fall away.
        There are many different kinds of <i>rupa</i>. The <i>rupa</i>s which
        can be directly experienced through body-sense are: hardness, softness,
        heat, cold, motion and pressure. These <i>rupa</i>s can be directly
        experienced through body-sense, there is no need to think about them or
        to name them. The direct experience of <i>rupa</i>s whenever they appear
        is the only way to know that they are different <i>rupa</i>s and that we
        cannot take them for self.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We should be aware of different
        characteristic of <i>nama</i> and <i>rupa</i> as they appear through the
        five sense-doors and through the mind-door. <i>Nama</i> and <i>rupa</i>
        which we do not know, we take for self. For example, we are not used to
        being aware of seeing. Seeing is the <i>nama</i> which just perceives
        colour through the eyes. This type of <i>nama</i> is real and thus it
        can be experienced. Before one knows what one sees there must be a
        moment of just perceiving colour through the eyes. One is used to paying
        attention only to the object one sees, and thus one cannot experience
        the <i>nama</i> which perceives colour and which arises before the other
        types of <i>nama</i> which like or dislike or which think about the
        object in different ways. If one is ignorant of seeing, one takes seeing
        for self. It is the same with hearing, which is just the perceiving of&nbsp;
        sound. If we realize that there should be awareness of the <i>nama</i>
        and <i>rupa</i> we have not yet been aware of, there will be awareness
        of these realities more often.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the beginning we will be inclined to
        remind ourselves of different <i>nama</i>s and <i>rupa</i>s until we are
        used to them. When hearing arises we may remind ourselves that this <i>nama</i>
        is a reality which just perceives sound through the ears. When we are
        used to the characteristic of hearing we will realize that it is
        different from thinking and from other types of <i>nama</i>. We will
        realize that it is different from <i>rupa</i>. Thus we will be less
        inclined to take hearing for self.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can be aware of only one
        characteristic of <i>nama</i> or <i>rupa</i> at a time. For example,
        when one hears, there are both hearing and sound, but one cannot be
        aware of hearing and sound at the same moment. There can be awareness of
        sound at one moment and of hearing at another moment, and thus one will
        gradually learn that their characteristics are different.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Only if we learn to be aware of the <i>nama</i>
        or <i>rupa</i> which appears at the present moment will we see things as
        they are. Thinking about <i>nama</i> and <i>rupa</i>, reminding
        ourselves of them or naming realities '<i>nama</i>' and '<i>rupa</i>',
        is still not the direct experience of reality. If we are thinking about <i>nama</i>
        and <i>rupa</i> in stead of directly experiencing their characteristics,
        we are clinging to them and we will not become detached from the idea of
        self. It is beyond control which characteristic presents itself at which
        moment. We cannot change the reality which has appeared already. We
        should not htink that there must be awareness of hearing first and after
        that of thinking about what we heard. Different realities will appear at
        different moments depending on conditions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the beginning we are not able to
        experience the arising and falling away of <i>nama</i> and <i>rupa</i>.
        We should just be aware of whatever characteristic of <i>nama</i> or <i>rupa</i>
        presents itself. When, for exampke. smelling appears, we cannot help
        smelling. At that moment we should just experience that characteristic,
        without making any special effort. There is no need to think about it or
        to remind ourselves that it is smelling, or that it is <i>nama</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is essential to realize that
        awareness is a type of <i>nama</i> as well, which can only arise when
        there are the right conditions. There is no self which is aware or which
        can have awareness arise at will. Right understanding of the practice of
        <i>vipassana</i> is a condition for the arising of awareness. When the
        right understanding has been developed awareness will arise more often.
        After a moment of awareness there will be a long time without awareness,
        or there will be moments when we are only thinking about <i>nama</i> and
        <i>rupa</i>. In the beginning there cannot be a great deal of awareness,
        but even a short moment of right awareness can help us very much in
        daily life.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>panna</i> developed in the direct
        experience of reality is of a higher degree than the <i>panna</i>
        developed through thinking about reality or the <i>panna</i> developed
        in <i>samatha</i>. <i>Vipassana</i> is<i> kusala</i> <i>kamma</i> of a
        very high degree, because <i>vipassana</i> leads to detachment from the
        concept of self and to the eradication of all defilements. If there is
        less <i>lobha</i>, <i>dosa</i> and <i>moha</i>, it is for the happiness
        of the whole world as well.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <i>'Anguttara Nikaya'</i> (Book
        of the Nine, Chapter II, par. x, Velama) we read that the Buddha spoke
        to Anathapindika about different degrees of wholesome deeds which bring
        their fruits accordingly. We read that the Buddha said:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt;"><font face="Times New Roman">...though
          with pious heart he took refue in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
          Sangha, greater would have been the fruit thereof, had he with pious
          heart undertaken to keep the precepts: abstention from taking life ...
          from intoxicating liquor, the cause of sloth.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; ... though with pious heart he
          undertook to keep these precepts, greater would have ben the fruit
          thereof, had he made become a mere passing fragrance of
          loving-kindness.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; ... though he made become just
          the fragrance of loving-kindness, greater would have been fruit
          thereof, had he made become, just for a finger-snap, the perception of
          impermanence.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The perception of
        impermanence is developed when there is a moment of right awareness of <i>nama</i>
        or <i>rupa</i>. One might be sureprised that the perception of
        impermanence is more fruitful than other kinds of wholesome deeds. In
        the practice of <i>vipassana</i> we will see how right awareness can
        change our life and our actions. In being aware we make the best of our
        life. The time will come when we have to leave this world because of old
        age, sickness or accident. Is it not better to take leave of the world
        with full understanding of what things are than to part from the world
        with aversion and fear?</font></p>
