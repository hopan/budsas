        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he
        Sangha is the third of the 'Three Gems'.&nbsp; When Buddhists take their
        refuge in the Sangha they say: <b><i>'Sangham saranam gacchami'</i></b>,
        which means, 'I go for refuge to the Sangha',&nbsp; The word <i>sangha</i>
        literally means 'congregation' or 'community'.&nbsp; It is the word
        generally used for the order of monks.&nbsp; When the word <i>sangha</i>
        denotes the third Gem it has a different meaning.&nbsp; The Sangha which
        is the third Gem are the ariyans.&nbsp; '<i>Ariyan</i>' is the name
        which denotes all those who have attained one of the four stages of
        enlightenment, no matter whether they are monks, nuns (<i>bhikkhuni</i>),
        unmarried layfollowers or married layfollowers.&nbsp; In the suttas we
        read that countless men and women layfollowers, single and married,
        became enlightened (<i>Maha-Vacchgotta-sutta, Majjhima Nikaya II</i>).</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In order to understand what
        enlightenment is, we should first know more about the accumulation of
        defilements.&nbsp; Defilements are all the imperfections we have
        accumulated in each <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta.</i>&nbsp;
        Our life is a continuous series of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i>
        succeeding one another, and thus the process of accumulation is
        continued from one <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>to
        the next citta, going on from birth to death, and from one life to the
        next life.&nbsp; One may wonder how a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta
        </i>can contain all the accumulations of the past.&nbsp; This is
        possible, because a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>is
        mentality.&nbsp; Matter which is limited, such as a room, can only
        contain as much as its space allows.&nbsp; A <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta
        </i>is different from matter, it is unlimited in what it can contain.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The defilements which have
        accumulated in our <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">citta </i>are very deeply rooted, and can only be eradicated in stages,
        which are the different stages of enlightenment.&nbsp; First the latent
        tendency of the concept of self has to be eradicated.&nbsp; We can
        eradicate the belief in a self in understanding what it is we take for
        self: in developing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vipassana</i>.&nbsp;
        What we call 'my body' are only physical phenomena which arise and fall
        away and which we cannot control.&nbsp; We read in the <i>'Samyutta
        Nikaya'</i> (<i>Khandha-vagga, </i>Middle Fifty, par. 59, The Five) that
        the Buddha said to his first five disciples in the Deerpark of Varanasi:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">'Body,
          monks, is not the self.&nbsp; If body, monks, were the self, then body
          would not be involved in sickness, and one could say of body:
          &quot;Thus let my body be.&nbsp; Thus let my body not be.&quot;'</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The same
        is said about mentality.&nbsp; The wrong view of self we have
        accumulated all through our many lives can be eliminated only very
        gradually.&nbsp; The wisdom will be keener at each stage of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vipassana</i>.
        When one has experienced nibbana for the first time the wrong view of
        self is eradicated completely and there is no more doubt about
        realities.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This first stage of
        enlightenment is the stage of the 'stream-winner', in Pali, '<i>sotapanna</i>'.
        We read in the 'Samyutta Nikaya' (Khanda-vagga, Chapter XXV, Kindred
        Sayings on Entering, par. 1) that the Buddha said to the monks:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">'The eye,
          monks is impermanent, changeable, becoming otherwise. The ear, monk,
          is impermanent, changeable. So is the nose, the tongue, the body, and
          the mind. It is impermanent, changeable, becoming otherwise....</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;He, monks, who thus
          knows, thus sees these doctrines, is called &quot;streamwinner, saved
          from destruction, assures, bound for enlightenment&quot;.'</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>sotapanna</i>
        is sure to attain the last stage of enlightenment, which is the stage of
        the arahat. The <i>sotapann</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">a</i>
        has not eradicated all defilements yet; there is still <i>lobha, dosa
        and moha</i>. He realizes that he still has <i>akusala</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i>;
        he knows that there are still conditions for them, but he does not take
        them for self. The <i>sotapanna</i> still has defilements, but he will
        never break the five precepts; it has become his nature to observe them.
        He cannot commit a deed which can cause rebirth in one of the woeful
        planes. Those who are not ariyans cannot be sure that they will not be
        reborn in a woeful plane of existence, even if they have done many good
        deeds in this life. One may have committed an ill deed in a past life
        which may cause rebirth in hell. Only ariyans can&nbsp;&nbsp; be sure
        that they will not reborn in a woeful plane.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>sotapanna</i> has an
        unshakable confidence in the 'Three Gems': in the Buddha, The Dhamma and
        the Sangha. He has no doubts about the Path the Buddha taught; he cannot
        delude himself about the&nbsp; right practice of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vipassana</i>.
        If we have not attained enlightenment we can be deluded about the right
        practice. Instead of developing wisdom we cling to a self, we want to
        induce awareness, and we cling to results we are hoping for. The <i>sotapanna</i>,
        however, is firmly established on the Path to the last stage of
        enlightenment.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The fact that the <i>sotapanna</i>
        has experienced nibbana does not mean that he cannot continue all his
        daily activities. The <i>sotapanna</i> can live with husband or wife and
        have a family life. So too until the third stage of enlightenment, the
        stage of the 'non-returner' or '<i>anagami</i>'. The <i>arahat,</i>
        however, no longer has any wish for the layman 's life.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>sotapanna</i> does
        not take any <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">nama</i> or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">rupa</i>
        for self, but there is still attachment, aversion and ignorance; he
        still has conceit. Therefore he has to continue the development of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vipassana</i>.
        We read in the 'Samyutta Nikaya' (Khandha-vagga, Last Fifty, par. 122,
        Virtue) that Maha-Kotthita asked Sariputta what would be the object of
        awareness for a virtuous monk (who has not realized any stage of
        enlightenment yet), or for a <i>sotapanna</i>, or for those who have
        realized the subsequent stages of enlightenment. Sariputta explained
        that the object is the five khandhas of grasping, which are all the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">nama</i>s
        and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">rupa</i>s in and around
        oneself. Sariputta said:</font></p>
        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The
        ariyan of the second stage, the <i>sakadagami (</i>once-returner), has
        not eradicated all attachment and aversion, but they have become
        attenuated.&nbsp; He still has ignorance, which is only completely
        eradicated by the arahat.&nbsp; The ariyan of the third stage, the <i>anagami</i>
        (non-returner), has eradicated aversion and he has eradicated attachment
        to the things experienced through the five senses, but he still clings
        to life and he still has conceit.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Ariyans who are not yet
        arahats can still have conceit, although they have no wrong view of

        When somebody thinks himself better than, equal to or less than someone
        else, it is conceit, even if it is true.&nbsp; Why should we compare
        ourselves with others?&nbsp; In the <i>'Khemaka-sutta'</i> (<i>Samyutta
        Nikaya, Khandha-vagga</i>, Middle Fifty, part 4, par. 89)&nbsp; we read
        that the monk Khemaka, who was staying in Jujube Tree Park, was
        afflicted by sickness.&nbsp; Some other monks who were staying near
        Kosambi in Ghosita Park, asked the monk Dasaka to inquire after his
        health.&nbsp; After he gave the message that his health was not
        improving, the other monks told Dasaka to ask Khemaka whether he still
        took anything for self.&nbsp; When Khemaka had told Dasaka that he did
        not take anything for self, the other monks concluded that Khemaka must
        be an arahat.&nbsp; Khemaka answered to Dasaka:</font></p>
        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Then the
        venerable Dasaka returned to the monks with that message and reported
        the words of the venerable Khemaka (and those monks sent this further
        message):</font></p>
        <blockquote>

          to think &quot;I am&quot;, which was still not removed from him- that
          is now removed.&nbsp; Suppose, friends, there is a dirty, soiled
          cloth, and the owners give it to a Washerman, and he rubs is smooth
          with salt-earth, or lye or cowdung, and rinses it in pure clean water.&nbsp;
          Now, though that cloth be clean, utterly cleansed, yet there hangs

          cowdung.&nbsp; The washerman returns it to the owners, and they lay it

        The ariyans prove that there is a way to the end of defilements.&nbsp;
        We should know what the condition is for the end of defilements: the
        cultivation of wisdom.&nbsp; The monks, nuns, men and women layfollowers
        who were ariyans in the Buddha's time proved that what the Buddha taught
        can be realize in daily life.&nbsp; The Buddha did not teach abstract
        ideas, he taught reality.&nbsp; Should those who want to realize the
        truth not walk the same Path they walked, even if they still have a long
        way to go?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The ariyans have understood
        very clearly that we cannot seek deliverance from our defilements
        outside ourselves.&nbsp; Defilements can only be eradicated where they
        arise: within ourselves.&nbsp; If we want to eradicate defilements we
        should follow the 'Middle Way'.&nbsp; In order to follow the 'Middle
        Way' we do not have to change our daily life.&nbsp; We can be aware of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">nama</i>
        and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">rupa</i> during our daily activities.&nbsp; We will experience that this
        may be more difficult than the practices of an ascetic.&nbsp; It is
        harder to overcome the clinging to a self when we are seeing, hearing or
        thinking, than to endure bodily hardship.&nbsp; The development of
        wisdom is a lifetask.&nbsp; We need much courage and perseverance in
        order to continue to be aware of the realities in daily life.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When we take our refuge in
        the <i>ariyan Sangha</i> we are expressing our confidence in the
        Buddha's Path, through which we may realize what the Sangha has
        realized.&nbsp; When we take our refuge in the Sangha are also paying
        respect to all monks, no matter whether they are ariyans or not, because
        monks try to realize in their own lives what the Buddha taught and they
        try to help other people as well to realize the truth.&nbsp; Thus the
        monks remind us of the 'Three Gems': <b><i>the Buddha, the Dhamma and
        the Sangha</i></b>.</font></p>
