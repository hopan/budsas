        <p align="center"><b><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080" size="4">The
        Dhamma</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he second of the
        Three Gems Buddhists take their refuge in is the Dhamma.&nbsp; When they
        take their refuge in the Dhamma they say: '<i><b>Dhammam saranam
        gacchami</b></i>', which means, 'I go for refuge to the Dhamma.'</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What does the word dhamma mean?&nbsp;
        Most people think that dhamma means doctrine, but the word dhamma has
        many more meanings.&nbsp; Dhamma means everything which is real, no
        matter whether it is good or bad.&nbsp; Dhamma comprises, for example,
        seeing, sound, greed and honesty.&nbsp; We cannot take our refuge in
        every dhamma; for instance, we cannot take our refuge in greed or hate.&nbsp;
        We cannot even take for refuge our parents, our husband or wife, because
        we are bound to be separated from them sooner or later.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Can we take our refuge in our good
        deeds?&nbsp; The effect of a good deed is never lost, since each good
        deed will bring its fruit accordingly.&nbsp; In the <i>'Samyutta Nikaya'</i>
        (<i>Sagatha-vagga</i>, Chapter I, part 8, par. 5) we read that a <i>deva</i>
        asks the Buddha how a man should live so that he does not have to fear
        life in another world.&nbsp; The Buddha answers:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let him but rightly set both speech
          and mind,<br>
          And by the body work no evil things.<br>
          If in a house well stored with goods he dwell,<br>
          Let him have faith, be gentle, share his goods<br>
          With the others, and be affable of speech.<br>
          In these four qualities if he persist,<br>
          He need not fear life in another world.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">A good deed can cause
        a happy rebirth such as birth the human plane of existence, or in a
        heavenly plane, and thus one need not fear life in another world.
        However, even a heavenly plane is not a permanent refuge. Life in a
        heavenly plane may last very long, but it is not permanent. There may be
        rebirth in 'woeful planes' after one's lifespan in a heavenly plane is
        terminated, depending on one's accumulated good and bad deeds. Each deed
        will bring its own result : a wholesome deed will bring a pleasant
        result and an unwholesome deed will bring an unpleasant result. Some
        deeds may produce a result in this life, other deeds may produce a
        result in a later life. The accumulated unwholesome and wholesome deeds
        may cause births in different planes of existence at different times. In
        the <i>'Samyutta Nikaya'</i> ( <i>Sagatha-vagga</i>, Chapter III, part
        2, Childless) we read about someone who gave alms to a Pacceka Buddha.&nbsp;
        Because of this good deed he was reborn in heaven seven times and after
        that in the human plane, which is also kusala vipaka.&nbsp; However, he
        killed his nephew because he wanted his brother's fortune.&nbsp; This
        ill deed caused him to be reborn in hell.&nbsp; Thus he received the
        results of wholesome deeds and of unwholesome deeds at different times.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As long as all defilements and latent
        tendencies have not been eradicated, there will be rebirth in different
        planes of existence.&nbsp; Even those who are reborn in heavenly planes
        still have defilement's and latent tendencies.&nbsp; Birth is sorrow, no
        matter on what plane; birth will be followed by death.&nbsp; We read in
        the <i>'Samyutta Nikaya'</i> (<i>Nidana-vagga</i>, Chapter XV, part 1,
        par. 3) that the Buddha said to the monks:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Incalculable is the beginning, monks, of
        this faring on.&nbsp; The earliest point is not revealed of the running
        on, faring on, of beings cloaked in ignorance, tied to craving.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; As to that, what do you think,
          monks? What is greater:- the flood of tears shed by you crying and
          weeping as you fare on, run on this long while, united as you have
          been with the undesirable, sundered as you have been from the
          desirable, or the waters in the four seas?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; ... For many a long day, monks,
          have you experienced the death of mother, of son, of daughter, have
          you experienced the ruin of kinfolk, of wealth, the calamity of
          disease.&nbsp; Greater is the flood of tears shed by you crying and
          weeping over one and all of these, as you fare on, run on this many a
          long day ... than are the waters in the four seas.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Only when all defilements are eradicated
        will there be no cause any more which can produce a next life, and thus
        there will be no more rebirth.&nbsp; That means the end of all sorrow.&nbsp;
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Nibbana</i> is the end of rebirth because <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">nibbana</i> is the end of defilements.&nbsp; Therefore one can truly
        take one's refuge in <i>nibbana</i>.&nbsp; In the suttas <i>nibbana</i>
        is called 'the deathless'.&nbsp; We read in the <i>'Samyutta Nikaya'</i>
        (<i>Maha-vagga</i>, Kindred Sayings on the Way, Ignorance, par. 7) that
        a monk said to the Buddha:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Times New Roman">'&quot;The deathless!
          The deathless!&quot; Lord, is the saying.&nbsp; Pray, Lord, what is
          the deathless, and what the way to the deathless?'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;'That which is the destruction
          of greed, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of ignorance,
          monk- that is called &quot;the deathless&quot;.&nbsp; This same ariyan
          eightfold way is the way to the deathless...'</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Nibbana</i> is the
        dhamma which is the second Gem.&nbsp; <i>Nibbana</i> is a Gem of the
        highest value, because there is nothing to be preferred to complete
        freedom from all sorrow.&nbsp; <i>Nibbana</i> is real: even if one
        cannot yet experience <i>nibbana</i>, it should be considered the goal
        of life.&nbsp; If one follows the right Path one might realize <i>nibbana</i>
        even during this life.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">People may think that it is not very
        desirable not to be born again.&nbsp; If we have not attained <i>nibbana</i>
        we cannot imagine what <i>nibbana</i> is like.&nbsp; It does not make
        much sense therefore to speculate about <i>nibbana</i>.&nbsp; At the
        present moment we can experience our defilements; we can experience the
        sorrow which is caused in the world by greed, hatred and ignorance.&nbsp;
        We read in the <i>'Samyutta Nikaya'</i> (<i>Sagatha-vagga</i>, Chapter
        III, part 3, par. 3, The World) that King Pasenadi asks the Buddha:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">'How many kinds of things, Lord, that
        happen in the world, make for trouble, for suffering, for distress?'&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha answered:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Three things, sire, happen of that
          nature.&nbsp; What are the three? Greed, hatred and ignorance:- these
          three make for trouble, for suffering, for distress.'&nbsp; Who does
          not want to be free from suffering caused by greed, hatred and
          ignorance?&nbsp; Those who want to become free from all defilements
          take their refuge in <i>nibbana</i>.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is the Path leading to <i>nibbana</i>?&nbsp;
        <i>Nibbana</i> cannot be attained merely by wishing to achieve it.&nbsp;
        Can people attain <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">nibbana</i> by doing good deeds?&nbsp; Even when one performs good deeds
        there can still be the idea of self.&nbsp; Good deeds without the right
        understanding of realities cannot eradicate the belief in a self and the
        other defilements.&nbsp; Thus they cannot lead to <i>nibbana</i>.&nbsp;
        Only <i>vipassana</i> leads to the eradication of all defilements.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One may wonder whether it is necessary,
        in addition to developing <i>vipassana</i>, to do other good deeds.&nbsp;
        The answer is that, the wisdom developed in <i>vipassana</i> helps us to
        be kind and considerate to other people in our deeds and speech.&nbsp;
        We learn to use every opportunity to eradicate unwholesomeness.&nbsp;
        Every time there is awareness of the nama or rupa while one is observing
        precepts or doing other kinds of good deeds, one is on the Path leading
        to <i>nibbana</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The development of <i>vipassana</i> is a
        lifetask for most of us, since we are not used to the direct experience
        of the nama or rupa which appears through one of the five senses or
        through the mind.&nbsp; We are used to thinking of realities from a past
        experience or those which might present themselves in the future.&nbsp;
        We should not expect to learn awareness in one day or even within one
        year.&nbsp; We cannot tell how much progress is made each day, because
        wisdom accumulates very gradually.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the <i>'Samyutta Nikaya'</i>
        (<i>Khandha-vagga</i>, Middle Fifty, part 5, par. 101, Adze-handle) that
        the Buddha said to the monks:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">By knowing, monks, by seeing is, I
          declare, the destruction of the asavas, not by not knowing, by not
          seeing ...</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose, monks, in a monk who lives
          neglectful of self-training there should arise this wish: 'O that my
          heart were freed without grasping from the asavas.'&nbsp; Yet for all
          that his heart is not freed from the asavas.&nbsp; What is the cause
          of that?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">It must be said that it is his neglect
          of self-training.&nbsp; Self-training in what?&nbsp; In the four
          applications of mindfulness ... in the ariyan Eightfold Path.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">... In the monk who dwells attentive
          to self-training there would not arise such a wish as this: 'O that my
          heart were freed from the asavas without grasping'; and yet his heart
          is freed from them.&nbsp; What is the cause of that?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">It must be said it is his attention to
          self-training ... Just as if, monks, when a carpenter or carpenter's
          apprentice looks upon his adze-handle and sees thereon his thumbmark
          and his finger-marks he does not thereby know: 'Thus and thus much of
          my adze-handle has been worn away today, thus much yesterday, thus
          much at other times.'&nbsp; But he knows the wearing away of it just
          by its wearing away.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style="margin-right:36.0pt;margin-left:36.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Even
        so monks, the monk who dwells attentive to self-training has not this
        knowledge: 'Thus and thus much of the asavas has been worn away today,
        thus much yesterday, thus much at other times': but he knows the wearing
        away of them just by their wearing away.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">When wisdom is highly
        developed <i>nibbana</i> can be realized.&nbsp; There are four stages of
        enlightenment or realization of <i>nibbana</i>.&nbsp; Defilements are so
        deeply rooted that they can only be eradicated stage by stage.&nbsp; In
        the first stage there is no more wrong view of 'self', but there is
        still attachment, aversion and ignorance.&nbsp; Only at the last stage
        of enlightenment, the stage of the arahat, are all defilements and
        latent tendencies eradicated completely.&nbsp; When one has attained the
        stage of the arahat there will be no more rebirth.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The citta which experiences <i>nibbana</i>
        is a <i>'lokuttara citta'</i>.&nbsp; There are two types of <i>citta</i>
        for each of the four stages of enlightenment, thus there are eight <i>lokuttara
        citta</i>.&nbsp; <i>Nibbana</i> and the eight <i>lokuttara cittas</i>
        are the <i>'nava lokuttara dhamma'</i>, or 'nine supramundane dhammas'.&nbsp;
        These <i>nava lokuttara dhammas</i> are the second Gem, the Dhamma to
        which one goes for refuge.&nbsp; When one takes one's refuge in the
        second Gem, one considers it the goal of one's life to develop the
        wisdom which can eventually eradicate all defilements.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a tenth dhamma included in the
        second Gem: the teachings of the Buddha.&nbsp; The teachings can lead
        people to the truth if they study them with right understanding and if
        they practise according to what is taught.&nbsp; One should study the
        whole of the Buddha's teachings.&nbsp; If one studies only a few suttas
        one will not clearly understand what the Buddha taught.&nbsp; Many times
        a sutta merely alludes to things which are explained in detail in other
        parts of the Tipitaka.&nbsp; It is useful to study the commentaries to
        the Tipitaka as well, because they explain the Buddha's teachings.&nbsp;
        The teachings are our guide since the Buddha passed away.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the <i>'Gopakamoggallan-sutta'</i>
        (<i>Majjhima Nikaya III, Devadaha-vagga</i>) that after the Buddha's
        death a brahman asked Ananda what the cause was of the unity of the
        monks.&nbsp; He said:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;

          even one monk who was designated by the Lord who knew and saw,
          perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, saying: &quot;After my passing
          this one will be your support,&quot; and to whom you might have
          recourse now?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'There is not even one monk,
          brahman, who was designated by the Lord who knew and saw, perfected
          one, fully Self-Awakened One, saying: &quot;After my passing this one
          will be your support,' and to whom we might have recourse now.'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'But is there even one monk,
          Ananda, who is agreed upon by the Order and designated by a number of
          monks who are elders, saying: &quot;After the Lord's passing this one
          will be our support,&quot; and to whom you might have recourse now?'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'There is not even one monk,
          brahman, who is agreed upon by the Order ... and to whom we might have
          recourse now.'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 'But as you are thus without a
          support, good Ananda, what is the cause of your unity?'</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; We brahman, are not without
          support; we have a support, brahman.&nbsp; Dhamma is the support.'</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">In the <i>'Anguttara
        Nikaya'</i> (Book of the Threes, Chapter VI, par. 60, Sangarava) we read
        that the Buddha speaks to the brahman Sangarava about three kinds of
        miracles: the miracle of 'superpower', such as diving into the earth or
        walking on water, the miracle of thought-reading and the miracle of
        teaching.&nbsp; The Buddha asked him which miracle appealed to him most.&nbsp;
        Sangarava answered:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Times New Roman">Of these miracles,
          master Gotama, the miracle of superpower ... seems to me to be of the
          nature of an illusion.&nbsp; Then again as to the miracle of
          thought-reading ... this also, master Gotama, seems to me to be of the
          nature of an illusion.&nbsp; But as to the miracle of teaching ... of
          these miracles this one appeals to me as the more wonderful and
          excellent.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The teachings are the
        greatest miracle because they can change a person's life.&nbsp; Dhamma
        brings right understanding, so that one is able to walk on the Path
        which leads to the end of the cycle of rebirth, to <i>nibbana</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's teachings do not appeal to
        everybody.&nbsp; Many people find it difficult to think in a way which
        is different from the way they used to think.&nbsp; They do not like the
        idea that there is no self.&nbsp; They want to control their mind even
        though they can find out that this is impossible.&nbsp; The Buddha knew
        how difficult it is for people to change their way of thinking.&nbsp; In
        the 'Discourse to Vacchagotta on Fire' (<i>Aggi-Vacchagotta-sutta,
        Majjhima Nikaya II, Paribbajaka-vagga</i>) we read that the Buddha said
        to Vacchagotta:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Times New Roman">You ought to be at a
          loss, Vaccha, you ought to be bewildered.&nbsp; For, Vaccha, this
          dhamma is deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful,
          excellent, beyond dialectic, subtle, intelligible to the wise; but it
          is hard for you who are of another view, another allegiance, another
          objective, of a different observance, and under a different teacher.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Dhamma is deep and
        difficult to understand.&nbsp; People cannot understand Dhamma if they
        still cling to their own views.&nbsp; If they would really study the
        teachings and persevere in the practice of what is taught, they would
        find out for themselves whether one can take one's refuge in the Dhamma.&nbsp;
        When we have experienced that what the Buddha taught is reality, even if
        we cannot yet experience everything he taught, we do not want to
        exchange our understanding for anything else in life.&nbsp; If we have
        the right understand of realities and if we develop wisdom, we will have
        Dhamma as a support.&nbsp; Thus we take refuge in the Dhamma.</font></p>
