        the Buddhist temples of Thailand we see people paying respect in front
        of the Buddha statue by kneeling and touching the floor three times with
        their hands and head. Those who have just arrived in Thailand may wonder
        whether this way of paying respect is a form of prayer or whether it has
        another meaning. Buddhists in Thailand express in this way their
        confidence in the 'Three Gems': the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.
        They take their refuge in the 'Three Gems'.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The first Gem is the Buddha<i>.
        </i>When people take their refuge in the Buddha, they say the following
        words in Pali: <b><i>'Buddham saranam gacchami'</i></b>, which means, 'I
        go for refuge to the Buddha. 'What is the meaning of the word 'Buddha'?
        The 'Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning' (the '<i>Paramatthajotika</i>', a
        commentary to the <i>Khuddaka Nikaya</i>) explains (in the commentary to
        the 'Three Refuges' of the 'Minor Readings') the meaning of the word
        'Buddha':</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">...
          and this is said, 'Buddha: in what sense buddha? He is the discoverer
          (<i>bujjhita</i>) of the Truths, thus he is enlightened (<i>buddha</i>).
          He is the enlightener <i>(bodheta</i>) of the generation, thus he is
          enlightened. He is enlightened by omniscience, enlightened by seeing
          all, enlightened without being led by others ... Buddha: this is not a
          name made by a mother, made by a father ...<i> </i>this (name)
          &quot;Buddha&quot;, which signifies final liberation, is a realistic
          description of Enlightened Ones. Blessed Ones, together with their
          obtainment of omniscient knowledge at the root of an enlightenment
          (tree). '</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The
        Buddha is the discoverer of the truth. What is the truth the Buddha
        discovered all by himself? 'He is enlightened by omniscience,
        enlightened by seeing all ' the Paramatthajotika commentary says. He had
        developed the wisdom to see and to experience the truth of all things.
        Everything in life is impermanent and thus it is unsatisfactory. People
        suffer from old age, sickness and death. In spite of this truth people
        still cling to the things in and around themselves. Thus they are not
        able to see reality. The Buddha experienced that all phenomena which
        arise fall away immediately<i>. </i>He would not cling to anything at
        all.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">For us it is difficult to
        experience the truth of impermanence. Nama and rupa arise and fall away
        all the time, but one cannot experience this if one's wisdom is not
        developed. It is difficult to be aware often of realities when they
        appear and to realize what they are: only nama and rupa, phenomena which
        are impermanent and not self. The more we realize how difficult it is to
        see things as they are, the more we understand that the Buddha's wisdom
        must have been of the highest degree.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught that
        everything in life is dukkha. Dukkha literally means misery of
        suffering. However, the experience of dukkha is much deeper than a
        feeling of sorrow or contemplation about suffering. The experience of
        dukkha is the experience of the impermanence of the nama and rupa in our
        life and the realization that none of these phenomena is true happiness.
        Some people may think that pondering over this truth is already the
        experience of dukkha. However, one does not know the truth if one merely
        thinks about it. When one directly experiences the arising and falling
        away of nama and rupa, one will come to know the truth of dukkha. Then
        one will learn to be less attached to nama and rupa.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the 'Greater Discourse
        of a Full Moon' (<i>Mahapunnama-sutta, Majjhima Nikaya III,
        Devadaha-vagga</i>) we read that the Buddha asked the monks:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">'What
          do you think about this, monks? Is material shape permanent or
          impermanent? '</font></p>
          <p style="margin-right:36.0pt" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&nbsp;</i>'Impermanent,
          revered sir. '</font></p>
          <p style="margin-right:36.0pt" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&nbsp;</i>'But
          is what is impermanent painful or is it pleasant? '</font></p>
          <p style="margin-right:36.0pt" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&nbsp;</i>'Painful,
          revered sir. '</font></p>
          <p style="margin-right:36.0pt" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&nbsp;</i>'And
          is it right to regard that which is impermanent, suffering, liable to
          change, as, &quot;This is mine, this am I, this is myself&quot;? '</font></p>
          <p style="margin-right:36.0pt" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&nbsp;</i>'No,
          revered sir. '</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The
        Buddha asked the same question about mental phenomena.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Everything in our life is
        impermanent. Even what we call happiness is impermanent- it is only a
        mental phenomenon which arises and falls away immediately. How can that
        which arises and falls away as soon as it has arisen be real happiness?
        Everything in life, even happiness, is therefore dukkha or
        unsatisfactory. What arises and falls away we cannot take for
        self;everything is anatta or 'not self'. Impermanence, dukkha and anatta
        are three aspects of the same truth, the truth about all things in and
        around ourselves. It may take us a long time before we can experience
        things as they really are. We should always be aware of the nama and
        rupa which appear, such as, for example, seeing, hearing or thinking at
        this moment.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was always
        mindful and clearly conscious. He did not have ignorance about any
        reality. When we realize how difficult mindfulness is, we deeply respect
        the great wisdom of the Buddha. The Buddha is called the 'Awakened One',
        because he is awakened to the truth. We read in the 'Sela-sutta' (<i>Majjhima
        Nikaya II, Brahmana-vagga</i>) that the Buddha said to Sela:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">'What is to be known is
          known by me, and what is to be developed is developed, what is to be
          got rid of has been got rid of- therefore, brahman, am I Awake. '</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha had, by his
        enlightenment, attained the greatest purity. He had completely
        eradicated all defilements. The Buddha became enlightened in this world.
        He taught that people in this world can develop such a high degree of
        wisdom that they can become completely free form defilements and latent
        tendencies. The more we know about our own subtle defilements and the
        more we see how deeply rooted the clinging to a self is, the more we
        realize the high degree of the Buddha's purity.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was full of
        compassion for everybody. The fact that the Buddha was free form
        defilements does not mean that he did not want to help the world or that
        he did not want to think of those who still had defilements. People are
        inclined to think that Buddhism makes people neglectful of their duties
        towards others and that it makes them self-centered. On the contrary,
        Buddhism enables one more fully to perform one's duties and to serve
        other people in a more unselfish way.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha attained
        enlightenment for the happiness of the world. In the <i>'Anguttara
        Nikaya'</i> (Book of the Ones, Chapter XIII) we read that the Buddha
        said to the monks:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:36.0pt;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Monks,
          there is one person whose birth into the world is for the welfare of
          many folk, for the happiness of many folk; who is born out of
          compassion for the world, for the profit, welfare and happiness of
          devas and mankind. Who is that one person? It is a Tathagata who is
          Arahant, a fully Enlightened One. This, monks, is that one person.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The more
        one understands the Buddha's teachings, the more one is impressed by his
        compassion for everybody. The Buddha knew what it meant to be free from
        all sorrow. Therefore he helped other people to attain this freedom as
        well. One can help other people by kindness, by generosity, and in many
        other ways. The most precious thing one can give others is to show them
        the way to true peace and happiness. The Buddha proved his great
        compassion to people in teaching them Dhamma.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When Buddhists pay respect
        to the Buddha statue they do not pray to a Buddha in heaven, since the
        Buddha passed away completely. Buddhists pay respect to the Buddha
        statue because they think with deep reverence and gratefulness of his
        virtues: of his wisdom, his purity and his compassion. When one speaks
        of virtues one usually thinks of good qualities in someone's character.
        There are many degrees of good qualities however. When the wisdom of him
        who follows the eightfold Path is developed to such an extent that he
        can attain enlightenment, then his way of life will have become purer
        and his compassion for others deeper. Wisdom is not only knowing the
        truth in theory, but realizing the truth in one's life as well. The
        virtues of the Buddha were developed to such a degree that he not only
        became enlightened without the help of a teacher, but was also able to
        teach the truth to others, so that by following the Path they could
        attain enlightenment.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">There were other Buddhas
        before Gotama the Buddha. All Buddhas find the truth by themselves,
        without being led by others. However, there are two different kinds of
        Buddha: the '<i>Sammasambuddha</i>' and the <i>'Pacceka Buddha'</i> or
        'Silent Buddha'. The Pacceka Buddha has not accumulated virtues to the
        same extent as the Sammasambuddha and thus he is not as qualified in
        teaching other people as the Sammasambuddha. Gotama the Buddha was a
        Sammasambuddha. There cannot be more than one Sammasambuddha in a
        'Buddha era'; neither can there be any Pacceka Buddhas. The Buddha era
        in which we are living will be terminated when the Buddha's teachings
        have disappeared completely. The Buddha foretold that the further one is
        away from the time he lived, the more his teachings will be
        misinterpreted anc corrupted. Some time after his teachings have
        disappeared completely there will be the next Buddha and so the next
        Buddha era. The next Buddha will discover the truth again and he will
        teach other people the way to enlightenment.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists take refuge in
        the Buddha. What does the word 'refuge' mean? The <i>Paramatthajotika</i>
        commentary speaks about the meaning of the word 'refuge':</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p style="margin-right:36.0pt" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">...
          When people have gone for refuge, then by that very going for refuge
          it combats, dispels, carries off, and stops, their fear, anguish,
          suffering, (risk of) unhappy destination (on rebirth), and defilement
          ... the going for refuge is the arising of knowledge, with confidence
          therein and giving preponderance thereto, from which defilement is
          eliminated and eradicated, and which occurs in the mode of taking that
          as the highest value...</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Going for
        refuge to the Buddha does not mean that the Buddha can eradicate
        people's defilements. We read in the <i>'Maha-Parinibbana-sutta</i>'
        (Digha Nikaya II, Chapter II) that, before his death, the Buddha said to
        Ananda:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p style="margin-right:36.0pt" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Now
          I am frail, Ananda, old, aged, far gone in years. This is my eightieth
          year, and my life is spent... Therefore, Ananda, be an island to
          yourself, a refuge to yourself, seeking no external refuge; with
          Dhamma as your island, Dhamma as your refuge, seeking no other refuge.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The
        Buddha then explained that taking one's refuge in the Dhamma means being
        mindful of <i>nama</i> and <i>rupa. </i>This is the eightfold Path which
        leads to <i>nibbana. </i>One can depend only on oneself in following
        this Path, not on any one else.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said that the
        Dhamma and the Vinaya would be his successor. Today the Buddha is no
        longer with us, but one takes refuge in the Buddha when one has
        confidence in his teachings and one considers it the most important
        thing in life to practise what he taught.</font></p>
