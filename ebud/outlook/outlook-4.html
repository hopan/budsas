        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he
        Buddha helped people to have right understanding about unwholesomeness
        and wholesomeness; he helped them in teaching them Dhamma.&nbsp; Dhamma
        excels all other gifts, because there is nothing more helpful than
        giving other people the right understanding so that they can cultivate
        wholesomeness.&nbsp; In this way they will find true happiness.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the <i>Anguttara Nikaya</i>
        (Book of the Twos, Chapter IV, par. 2)&nbsp; we read that it is not easy
        to repay one's parents for all they have done:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Monks, one can never
          repay two persons, I declare.&nbsp; What two?&nbsp; Mother and father.&nbsp;
          Even if one should carry about his mother on one shoulder and his
          father on the other, and so doing should live a hundred years, attain
          a hundred years; and if he should support them, anointing them with
          unguents... if he should establish his parents in supreme authority,
          in the absolute rule over this mighty earth abounding in the seven
          treasures- not even thus could he repay his parents.&nbsp; What is the
          cause of that?&nbsp; Monks, parents do much for their children: they
          bring them up, they nourish them, they introduce them to this world.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, monks, whose
          incites his unbelieving parents, settles and establishes them in the
          faith; whose incites his immoral parents, settles and establishes them
          in morality; whose incites his stingy parents, settles and establishes
          them in liberality; whose incites his foolish parents, settles and
          establishes them&nbsp; in wisdom, - such an one, just by so doing,
          does repay, does more than repay what is due to his parents.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In this sutta the Buddha
        points out how important it is to help other people to have right
        understanding about the development of wholesomeness; he explained that
        this is the way to repay one's parents.&nbsp; Establishing one's parents
        in faith is mentioned first.&nbsp; The word 'faith' however, is not used
        in the sense of 'faith in a person'.&nbsp; The Buddha did not want
        people to perform wholesome deeds in obedience to him or in obedience to
        certain rules.&nbsp; Faith means confidence in wholesomeness, confidence
        that the cultivation of wholesomeness leads to happiness.&nbsp;
        Therefore any time there is wholesomeness there must be faith.&nbsp;
        After faith the above-quoted sutta speaks about 'morality', and then
        generosity is mentioned.&nbsp; Wisdom or right understanding is
        mentioned last.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When the different ways of<i>
        kusala</i> <i>kamma</i> are explained in the sutta, '<i>dana</i>' or
        generosity is usually mentioned first, '<i>sila</i>' or morality is
        mentioned next, and after that '<i>bhavana</i>' or mental development.&nbsp;
        There are many ways to develop<i> kusala</i> or wholesomeness.&nbsp; It
        is very helpful to know about these different ways in order to make
        progress in wholesomeness.&nbsp; Therefore '<i>panna</i>', or 'Right
        Understanding', is the factor which conditions people to develop
        wholesomeness.&nbsp; There can be no '<i>bhavana</i>' or mental
        development without <i>panna</i>.&nbsp; <i>Panna</i> is an indispensable
        factor for '<i>bhavana</i>', and on the other hand <i>panna</i> is
        developed through '<i>bhavana</i>'.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Panna</i>, understanding
        things as they are, will help people to lead a more wholesome life.
        There are many levels of '<i>panna</i>'. To the extent that <i>panna</i>
        is developed defilements will be eliminated and thus people will find
        peace of mind. We should cultivate <i>panna</i> and help other people to
        cultivate <i>panna</i> as well. We should have right understanding about
        unwholesomeness and about wholesomeness.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">All <i>akusala</i> <i>cittas</i>
        are caused by ignorance or '<i>moha</i>'. There are different types of <i>akusala</i>
        <i>cittas</i>. Some <i>cittas</i> are rooted in '<i>moha</i>' alone'
        There are <i>akusala</i> <i>cittas</i> rooted in '<i>moha</i>' and '<i>lobha</i>'.
        ('<i>Lobha</i>' is attachment, selfishness, or greed.) Furthermore there
        are <i>akusala</i> <i>cittas</i> rooted in '<i>moha</i>' and '<i>dosa</i>'.
        ('<i>Dosa</i>' is ill-will or aversion.) Unwholesome deeds are motivated
        by <i>akusala</i> <i>cittas</i>.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When there is a<i> kusala</i>
        <i>citta </i>there is no '<i>lobha</i>', '<i>dosa</i>' or '<i>moha</i>'
        with that <i>citta. kusala</i> <i>cittas</i> motivate wholesome deeds or<i>
        kusala</i> <i>kamma</i>. When we perform '<i>dana</i>', '<i>sila</i>' or
        '<i>bhavana</i>', there is no '<i>lobha</i>', '<i>dosa</i>' or '<i>moha</i>'
        with the<i> kusala</i> <i>citta </i>which motivates the wholesome deeds.
        It is very helpful to know more about '<i>dana</i>', '<i>sila</i>' and '<i>bhavana</i>'
        in order to lead a more wholesome life.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The first way of cultivate
        wholesomeness is '<i>dana</i>'. '<i>Dana</i>' is giving useful things to
        other people, for example, giving away food, clothing or money to those
        who are in need. When we give something away we purify ourselves: we
        think of other people, we have no selfish thoughts. At these moments
        there is no <i>lobha</i>, <i>dosa</i> or <i>moha</i>.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Giving with the right
        understanding that giving is<i> kusala</i> is more wholesome than giving
        without this understanding. People who give with the understanding that
        they purify&nbsp; themselves by this wholesome act, are stimulated to do
        as many good deeds as possible. One may think it a selfish attitude to
        consider one's own accumulation of wholesomeness. However, it is not a
        selfish attitude. When one has the right understanding of the ways to
        develop wholesomeness, it is therefore not selfish to think of one's
        development of<i> kusala</i> <i>kamma</i>, but rather it is to the
        benefit of everyone. It is to one's fellow&nbsp; man's advantage too if
        one eliminates <i>lobha</i>, <i>dosa</i>, and <i>moha</i>. It is more
        agreeable to live with someone who is not selfish and who is not angry
        than with a selfish or an angry person.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">There are many degrees of <i>panna</i>.
        When <i>panna</i> is more highly developed, one understands that it is
        not 'self' who performs wholesome deeds, but <i>cittas</i> which are
        conditioned by accumulation of wholesomeness in the past. Thus there is
        no reason for conceit or pride. By the development of <i>panna</i>,
        which is a mental phenomenon and which is not 'self', one can accumulate
        more wholesomeness.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Young children in Thailand
        are trained to give food to the monks and thus they accumulate<i> kusala</i>
        <i>kamma</i>. The Thais call the performing of good deeds <i>'tham bunn'</i>.
        When children learn to do good at an early age it is a condition for
        them to continue to be generous when they are grown-up.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When someone gives food to
        the monks, it is the giver in the first place who will benefit from this
        wholesome act; the monks give him the opportunity to develop
        wholesomeness. The monks do not thank people for their gifts; they say
        words of blessing which show that they rejoice in the good deeds of the
        giver. One might find it strange at first that the monks do not thank
        people, but when there is more understanding about the way wholesomeness
        is developed one sees these customs in another light.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Even when one is not giving
        something away oneself, there is still opportunity to develop
        wholesomeness in appreciating the good deeds of other people: at that
        moment there is no <i>lobha</i>, <i>dosa</i> or <i>moha</i>. The
        appreciation of other people's good deeds is a way of<i> kusala</i> <i>kamma</i>,
        included in <i>dana</i> as well. It is to everyone's advantage if people
        appreciate one another's good deeds. It contributes to harmonious living
        in society.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The third means of<i>
        kusala</i> <i>kamma</i> included in <i>dana</i> concerns giving other
        people the opportunity to appreciate our own good deeds so that they can
        have wholesome <i>cittas</i> as well. We should not hide our good deeds
        but we should let our good example inspire other people looking after
        their old parents, or to see people studying or teaching Dhamma. We
        should follow the example of the Buddha. We should continually think of
        means to help other people develop wholesomeness. This way of<i> kusala</i>
        <i>kamma</i> is a means to eliminate our defilements. There are
        opportunities to cultivate wholesomeness at any moment. When one has
        developed more wisdom one will try not to miss any opportunity for<i>
        kusala</i> <i>cittas</i> because human life is very short.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">There are three ways of<i>
        kusala</i> <i>kamma</i> included in <i>sila</i>, or morality. The first
        way is observing the precepts. Laypeople usually observe five precepts.
        The five precepts are: abstaining from killing living beings, from
        stealing, from sexual misbehavior, from lying, and from the talking of
        intoxicants such as alcoholic drinks. One can observe these precepts
        just because one follows the rules, without thinking about the reason
        why one should observe the precepts. Observing the precepts is<i> kusala</i>
        <i>kamma</i>, but the degree of wholesomeness is not very great if there
        is no right understanding. One observes the precepts with <i>panna</i>
        if one understands that unwholesomeness is eliminates while one observes
        them.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The killing of a living
        being is <i>akusala</i> <i>kamma</i>. One might wonder whether it is not
        sometimes necessary to kill. Should one not kill when there is a war,
        should one not kill insects to protect the crops, and should one not
        kill mosquitos to protect one's health? The Buddha knew that as long as
        people were living in this world they would have many reasons for
        breaking the precepts. He knew that it is very difficult to keep all the
        precepts and that one cannot learn in one day to observe them all.
        Through right understanding however, one can gradually learn to keep
        them. The precepts are not worded in terms of, for example, 'You shall
        not kill.' They are not worded as commandments, but they are worded as
        follows: 'I undertake the rule of training to refrain from destroying
        life.'</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha pointed out what
        is unwholesome and what is wholesome, so that people would be able to
        find the way to true happiness. It is <i>panna</i> or right
        understanding which will lead people to train themselves in the
        precepts. Without <i>panna</i> the precepts will be broken very easily
        when the temptations are too strong, or when the situation is such as to
        make it very difficult for people to keep the precepts. When <i>panna</i>
        is more developed one will not so easily break the precepts. One will
        find out from experience that one breaks the precepts because of <i>lobha</i>,
        <i>dosa</i> and <i>moha</i>. When one understands that one purifies
        oneself in observing the precepts, one will even refrain from
        intentionally killing mosquitoes and ants. One always accumulates <i>dosa</i>
        when there is the intention to kill, even if it is a very small insect.
        One should find out for oneself that one accumulates <i>akusala</i> <i>kamma</i>
        when killing living beings, no matter whether they are human beings or
        animals. However, one cannot force other people to refrain from killing
        living beings.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">To refrain from killing is
        a kind of <i>dana</i> as well- it is the gift of life, one of the
        greatest gifts we can give. The classification of<i> kusala</i> <i>kamma</i>
        as to whether it be <i>dana</i> or <i>sila</i> is not very rigid. The
        way realities are classified depends on their different aspects.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">As regards the taking of
        intoxicants, one should find out for oneself how much unwholesomeness is
        accumulated in this way. Even if one has but a slight attachment, one
        accumulates unwholesomeness, and this may be harmful in the future. When
        the attachment is strong enough it will appear in one's speech and
        deeds. Even the taking of a little amount of an alcoholic drink can
        cause one to have more greed, anger and ignorance. It might have the
        effect that one does not realize what one is doing and that one is not
        aware of the realities of the present moment. <i>Panna</i> will induce
        one to drink less and less and eventually to stop drinking. One does not
        have to force oneself not to drink, one just loses the taste for alcohol
        because one sees the disadvantages of it. In this way it becomes one's
        nature not to drink. The person who has developed <i>panna</i> to such a
        high degree that he has attained the first stage of enlightenment, the
        'sota<i>panna</i>', will never break the five precepts again; it has
        become his nature to observe them.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The second way of<i> kusala</i>
        <i>kamma</i> included in <i>sila</i>, is paying respect to those who
        deserve respect. It is not necessary to show respect according to a
        certain culture; the esteem one feels for someone else is more
        important. this induces one to have a humble attitude towards the person
        who deserves respect. In which way one shows respect depends on the
        customs of the country where one is living or on the habits one has
        accumulated. In Thailand people show respect to monks, teachers and
        elderly people in a way different from the way people in other countries
        show their respect. In some countries&nbsp; the respect people feel
        towards others may appear only in a very polite way of addressing them.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Politeness which comes from
        one's heart is<i> kusala</i> <i>kamma</i>; at that moment there is no <i>lobha</i>,
        <i>dosa</i> or <i>moha</i>.&nbsp; It is<i> kusala</i> <i>kamma</i> to
        show respect to monks, to teachers and to elderly people.&nbsp; In
        Thailand people show respect to their ancestors; they express their
        gratefulness for the virtues of their ancestors.&nbsp; This is<i> kusala</i>
        <i>kamma</i>.&nbsp; It is not important whether the ancestors are able
        to see the people paying them respect or not.&nbsp; We cannot know in
        which plane they have been reborn- in this human plane, or in some other
        plane of existence where they might be able to see people paying respect
        to them.&nbsp; It is wholesome to think of one's ancestors with
        gratefulness.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We should always try to
        find out whether there are <i>akusala</i> <i>cittas</i> or<i> kusala</i>
        <i>cittas</i> motivating a deed, in order to understand the meaning of
        the deed.&nbsp; Thus one will understand and appreciate many customs of
        the Thais and one will not so easily misjudge them or take them for
        being superstitious.&nbsp; In the same way we should understand the
        paying of respect to the Buddha image.&nbsp; It is not idol worship;
        indeed, it is<i> kusala</i> <i>kamma</i> if one thinks of the Buddha's
        virtues: of his wisdom, of his purity and of his compassion.&nbsp; One
        does not pray to a Buddha in heaven, because the Buddha does not stay in
        heaven or in any plane of existence; he passed away completely.&nbsp; it
        is wholesome to be grateful to the Buddha and to try to follow the Path
        he discovered.&nbsp; The way in which one shows respect to the Buddha
        depends on the inclinations one has accumulated.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The third way of<i> kusala</i>
        <i>kamma</i> included in <i>sila</i> is helping other people by words or
        deeds.&nbsp; The act of helping other people will have a higher degree
        of wholesomeness if there is the right understanding that helping is<i>
        kusala</i> <i>kamma</i>, and that one purifies oneself in this way.&nbsp;
        Thus one will be urged to perform more<i> kusala</i> <i>kamma</i> in the
        future; one will be more firmly established in <i>sila</i>.&nbsp; It is
        therefore more wholesome to perform <i>sila</i> with right
        understanding, or <i>panna</i>.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Performing one's duties is
        not always<i> kusala</i> <i>kamma</i>; people may perform their duties
        just because they are paid for their work.&nbsp; For example, a teacher
        teaches his pupils and a doctor takes care of his patients, because it
        is their duty to do so.&nbsp; However, they can develop wholesomeness if
        they perform these duties with kindness and compassion.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Panna</i> conditions one
        to perform<i> kusala</i> <i>kamma</i>, no matter what one's duties are.&nbsp;
        Wholesomeness can be developed at any time we are with other people,
        when we talk to them or listen to them.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Helping other people with
        kind words and deeds alone is not enough.&nbsp; When it is the right
        moment one can help others in a deeper and more effective way, that is
        by helping them to understand who they are, why they are in this world
        and what the aim is of their life in this world.&nbsp; This way of
        helping is included in <i>bhavana</i> or mental development.</font></p>
