        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he Buddha proved
        his compassion for men in his teaching of Dhamma. One may wonder why it
        is especially the teaching of Dhamma that proves the Buddha's
        compassion. Are there no other ways of helping people, such as visiting
        the sick and speaking kind words to other people in order to make them
        happy? It is true that one can help one's fellow men in doing good deeds
        and in speaking kind words. However, it is not possible to give them
        true happiness in this way. When one is kind to other people one might
        help them in so far as one can make them feel more relaxed or less
        depressed for a moment. However there are people who tend to go on being
        anxious and depressed, no matter how kindly one treats them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha knew that the deepest cause
        of happiness and sorrow is within man. It is not possible to give other
        people real happiness; one can only be a condition for them to feel
        happy for a while. The Buddha helped people in the most effective way:
        he helped them to have 'right understanding' about their life, about
        themselves, and about the way to find true happiness.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">His disciples followed his example and
        helped people by teaching them Dhamma. We read in the <i>'Channovada-sutta</i>'
        (<i>Majjhima Nikaya III, Salayatana-vagga</i>) that Sariputta and Maha
        Cunda visited a sick monk whose name was Channa. First they asked Channa
        how he was feeling, and they offered to give him good food and medicine,
        and to attend personally to his needs if he wanted this. However, they
        knew that kind words and deeds are not enough. When it was the right
        moment they spoke to him about Dhamma, in order to help him to have
        right understanding about his life.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the 'Discourse on the Analysis of the
        Undefiled' (<i>Aranavibhanga-sutta, Majjhima Nikaya III, Vibhanga-vagga</i>)
        we read that the Buddha told his disciples that they should not say of
        other people that they are walking the right path or the wrong path.
        They should neither approve of people nor disapprove of them but teach
        which cause brings which effect. They should simply teach Dhamma. Dhamma
        means everything that is real. The Buddha helped people to develop right
        understanding about everything one can experience, no matter whether it
        is good or bad.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one wants to eliminate defilements
        one should first understand what are <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i>
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i> and what are <i>kusala</i>-<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i>
        and be aware of them when they arise. Only when we can be aware of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i>
        when they appear will we know them as they are. We will not know <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i>
        by speculation. As we have seen, a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta
        </i>does not last. It arises and then falls away immediately to be
        followed by the next citta. There is only one <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta
        </i>at a time. Life consists of an unbroken series of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i>,
        arising and falling away continuously. There is no moment without citta.
        There are many kinds of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i>
        which perform different functions such as seeing, hearing and thinking.
        Moreover there are <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">cittas</i> and <i>kusala</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i>.
        An <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">citta</i>and a kusala <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>cannot
        arise at the same moment since there can be only one <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">citta </i>at a time. However, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i>
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i> and kusala <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i>
        might arise with very few moments in between, even during the time one
        is doing a good deed. When the kusala <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta
        </i>has fallen away, regret about one's good deed might arise. This is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <i>'Channovada-sutta'</i>
        mentioned above we read that the monk Channa suffered severe pains. As
        he could not stand the pains any longer he committed suicide. The Buddha
        knew that before the moment of his death Channa had kusala <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">cittas</i> after the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i>
        which moved him to perform this unwholesome deed. He was able to purify
        himself of defilements after his deed. The Buddha said therefore: 'He
        took the knife to himself without incurring blame.' We do not know about
        the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>of someone else
        merely from the outward appearance of his deeds, because we do not know
        each different moment of <i>citta</i>. We can only know with regard to
        ourselves at which moments <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i>
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i> or <i>kusala cittas</i>
        arise.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Akusala</i>
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i> can be rooted in three
        different unwholesome 'roots', or <i>'akusala hetus'</i>. They are:</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:36.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">-
        attachment (in Pali, '<i>lobha</i>')<br>
        - aversion or ill-will (in Pali, '<i>dosa</i>')<br>
        - ignorance (in Pali, '<i>moha</i>') </span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman"><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">By
        the word 'root' is meant the foundation of the <i>citta</i>. The root is
        the foundation of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">citta </i>just as the root of a tree supports the tree and makes it
        grow. There are many different degrees of these three <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">akusala</i> hetus.</font></span></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">All <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i>
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i> are caused by <i>moha</i>
        or ignorance. Ignorance is, for example, not knowing what is unwholesome
        and what is wholesome, and not knowing which cause brings which result
        in life. There are many intensities of <i>moha</i>. An animal has a
        great deal of <i>moha</i>; it does not realize at all what it is doing,
        it does not know how to cultivate wholesomeness. however, not only
        animals have <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">moha</i>: human beings can have a great deal of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">moha</i> as will. There is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">moha</i>
        when one does not realize one's bodily movements, as for example, when
        one plays with one's fork and spoon, or when one stands up and walks to
        the other side of the room without being aware of the movement of the
        body. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Moha</i> can only be
        completely eradicated when one has attained the fourth and last stage of
        enlightenment, when one has become an '<i>arahat</i>'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">lobha</i>
        (attachment) arises together with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">moha</i>,
        the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>is called a '<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">lobha</i>-mula-citta',
        or a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>rooted in
        attachment. (Mula means root; it is the same as 'hetu'.) At that moment
        there is not only <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">moha</i>, which
        is common to all <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">cittas</i>, but there is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">lobha</i>
        as well. A <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">lobha-mula-citta </i>has
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">moha</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">lobha</i> as roots; it is different from the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">citta </i>which is rooted only in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">moha</i>,
        the ignorance about realities. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lobha</i>
        can be greed, lust, selfish desire, and it can be a very subtle form of
        attachment as well, a form of attachment one can hardly recognize if one
        does not yet have the right understanding.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lobha</i>
        can be accompanied by a pleasant feeling. For instance, when we enjoy
        beautiful music there is a <i>lobha-mula-citta</i>. Then the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta
        </i>is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i>, although this
        kind of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">lobha</i> is not as gross
        as greed or lust. One might be inclined to think that whenever there is
        a pleasant feeling, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>which
        is accompanied by this feeling must be a <i>kusala citta</i>. However,
        when there is a pleasant feeling, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta
        </i>can either be a kusala <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>or
        an <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">akusala citta</span>. For
        instance, when we feel happy while doing a good deed, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta
        </i>is a kusala <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta</i>with a
        pleasant feeling. When we feel happy because of beautiful music or a
        beautiful view, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">akusala</i>: it is a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">lobha-mula-citta</i>
        with a pleasant feeling. We can be deluded about the truth very easily.
        We find feeling so important that we cannot see anything else. We are
        unable to see whether the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta</i>
        is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i> or <i>kusala</i>
        because we think only of the feeling at that moment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lobha-mula-cittas</i>
        can be accompanied either by a pleasant feeling or by an indifferent
        feeling. When we want to do something such as standing up, walking,
        taking hold of an object, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">lobha-mula-cittas</i>
        which arise are accompanied by an indifferent feeling. We do not,
        usually, have a happy feeling when we stand up or when we reach for a
        glass of water. We cannot help having <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">lobha</i>
        very often. All people except <i>arahats</i> are bound to have <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">lobha</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha did not speak to those who
        still have defilements in terms of 'sin' or 'punishment'. The Buddha
        pointed out everything which is real and he explained which cause would
        bring which effect. The bad deeds one does will bring about their own
        results, just as a seed produces a tree. This is the law of '<i>kamma</i>'
        and '<i>vipaka'</i>, of cause and effect. The Buddha explained to his
        disciples that they should neither approve of people nor disapprove of
        them; they should simply teach Dhamma. Thus one will know what is real. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lobha</i>
        is real and one should therefore know what <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">lobha</i>
        is, what its characteristic is, and when it arises.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another unwholesome root is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dosa</i>,
        or aversion. When the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta</i>which
        arises is accompanied by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dosa</i>
        and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">moha</i>, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>is called <i>'dosa-mula-citta'</i>,
        or a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>rooted in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dosa</i>.
        At that moment there is not only <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">moha</i>,
        which is common to all <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i>
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">cittas</i>, but there is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dosa</i>
        as will. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dosa</i> appears in its
        coarsest form as anger or ill-will. There is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dosa</i>
        when one hurts or kills a living being, when one speaks harsh words, or
        when one curses. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dosa</i> is
        always accompanied by an unpleasant feeling.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are more subtle forms of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dosa</i>
        as well: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">dosa</i> can be a slight aversion when we see or hear something
        unpleasant, or when we are in a bad mood. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dosa</i>
        can be recognized by the feeling which accompanies it. Even when there
        is a very vague feeling of uneasiness we can be sure there is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">dosa</i>. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dosa</i> arises quite
        often in a day. We cannot help having <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dosa</i>
        when there is a loud noise or an ugly sight.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are three 'wholesome roots' or <i>'sobhana
        hetus'</i>, which are the opposite of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i>
        hetus. They are:</font></p>

        but not always by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">panna</i>. Thus
        a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta</i>can be <i>kusala </i>without
        wisdom (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">panna</i>). One can, for
        example, help other people without understanding that helping is kusala
        and that wholesome deeds bring wholesome results. However, when there is
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">panna</i> the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>is more
        wholesome. If one observes the precepts only because they are rules,
        prescribed in the teachings, without any understanding of the reasons
        for those precepts, ill deeds can be suppressed for some time. However,
        if the temptations are too strong the precepts will be broken. If one
        has understanding about unwholesome and wholesome deeds and knows the
        effect of those deeds, one will not break the precepts very easily. We
        can develop more wholesomeness in understanding realities and their
        causes and effects.</font></span></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Everyone, except the <i>arahat</i>, has
        both <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

        Each <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta</i>arises when there
        are the right conditions. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cittas</i>
        cannot arise without conditions. It depends on many conditions whether
        there will be an <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">citta </i>or a <i>kusala citta</i>. We have all accumulated conditions
        for both unwholesomeness and wholesomeness. If the present <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">citta </i>is unwholesome one accumulates a condition for more
        unwholesomeness and if the present <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta
        </i>is wholesome one accumulates a condition for more wholesomeness. For
        example, if we have a slight feeling of aversion, there is a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">dosa-mula-citta</i>. If <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dosa-mula-cittas</i>
        occur quite often, we accumulate <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dosa</i>;
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dosa</i> might become a habit. If
        the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dosa</i> which is accumulated
        becomes a strong habit, it could easily be the condition for unwholesome
        deeds and unwholesome speech.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One may wonder how one can accumulate
        unwholesomeness and wholesomeness, as each <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta
        </i>which arises falls away completely. Each <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">citta </i>which arises does fall away completely but it conditions the
        next <i>citta</i>. That is the reason why the next <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">citta </i>has the accumulations of the previous <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">citta </i>as well. If we understand how different the accumulation of
        people are we will be less inclined to blame other people when they do
        wrong. We will try to help them to have right understanding about
        accumulations. If we have more understanding about the conditions which
        make us act the way we do we will be able to lead a more wholesome life.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One may wonder what the Buddha taught
        about the will or the intention which motivates ill deeds and good
        deeds. Is there on 'free will' which can direct one's actions, speech
        and thoughts? When we think of 'free will', we generally think of a
        'self' which could have control over our decisions to do good or to do
        wrong. However, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i> arise
        because of conditions; there is no 'self' which can let <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i>
        arise at will.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Pali term 'kamma' literally means
        action. In reality kamma is intention or volition. It's not that which
        is generally understand by 'free will'. <i>Kamma</i> does not stay, it
        arises and falls away with each <i>citta</i>. One cannot say that it is
        'self' or that it belongs to a 'self'. <i>Kamma</i> is volition which
        motivates good or bad deeds. For example, there is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala
        kamma</i> through the body if one hits someone; there is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">akusala kamma</i> through speech if one speaks harsh words or if one
        curses someone; and there is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala
        kamma</i> through the mind if one has the intention to take away
        something which belongs to someone else, or if one plans to kill
        someone.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught that everyone will
        experience the result of the kamma he has performed; one will reap what
        one has sown. <i>Kamma</i> is the cause which produces its result. The
        result is called '<i>vipaka</i>'. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Akusala
        kamma</i> will bring an unpleasant result, or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala
        vipaka citta</i>; <i>kusala kamma</i> will bring a pleasant result, or <i>kusala
        vipaka citta</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">People are born with different
        characters and in different circumstances. In the 'Discourse on the
        Lesser Analysis of deeds' (<i>Culakammavibhaga-sutta, Majjhima Nikaya
        III, Vibhagavagga</i>) we read that Subha asks the Buddha what the
        reason is for these differences:</font></p>

        good Gotama, what is the cause, what is the reason that lowness and
        excellence to be seen among human beings while they are in human form?
        For, good Gotama, human beings of short lifespan are to be seen and
        those of long lifespan; those of many and those of few illness; those
        who are ugly, those who are beautiful; those of great account; those who
        are of little account, those of great account; those who are poor, those

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">Not
        only birth in a certain plane of existence and in certain surroundings
        is the result of kamma. All through our life we receive unpleasant and
        pleasant results. Everyone would like to experience only pleasant things
        through eyes, ears, noses, tongue and body sense. However, everybody is
        bound to experience both unpleasant and pleasant things through the five
        senses, because everyone has performed both <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala
        kamma</i> and <i>kusala kamma</i>.</font></span></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">A deed which we have performed may
        produce a result shortly afterwards, or it may produce a result a long
        time afterwards. We should remember that intention, or <i>kamma</i>,
        which motivates the deed is a mental phenomenon and that it can
        therefore be accumulated. Thus it can bring about its result later on.
        The Buddha taught that the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala
        kamma</i> and the <i>kusala kamma</i> we have accumulated all through
        our life and during countless existences before this life, will produce
        their results when there are the right conditions for the result to be
        produced. The <i>vipaka-citta</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"> </i>is the result of kamma. When we see unpleasant things, there is at
        that moment <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala-vipaka</i>,
        which is the result of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">akusala
        kamma</span>. This <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala vipaka
        citta </i>receives an unpleasant object through the eyes. When we see
        pleasant things the <i>kusala vipaka citta,</i> which the result of the <i>kusala
        kamma</i>, receives an unpleasant object through the eyes. When we hear
        pleasant things the <i>kusala vipaka citta</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
        </i>which which is the result of <i>kusala kamma</i> receives a pleasant
        object through the ears. there is <i>vipaka</i> every time we see, hear,
        smell, taste, or receive an impression through body-contact. We cannot
        help there being <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vipaka</i>; we
        cannot help seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and receiving impressions
        through bodily contact. Each citta, and thus each <i>vipaka citta</i>,
        has its own conditions; nobody can make <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i>
        arise at will. Which particular <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vipaka</i>
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>will arise at the
        present moment is beyond control. When one does good deeds one can be
        sure that those deeds will bring a pleasant result, but the moment when
        the result will take place depends on other conditions as well.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala
        vipaka citta</i> that experiences an unpleasant object through the eyes,
        is not the same as the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala
        vipaka citta </i>that experiences an unpleasant object through the ears.
        There is not a 'self' which experiences different unpleasant and
        pleasant objects through the five senses. Each <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta
        </i>has its own conditions and is different from all other <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i>.
        The more one realizes this truth, the less one will be inclined to
        believe in a 'self'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>vipaka cittas</i> arise and fall
        away within split seconds, like all other types of <i>citta</i>. After
        the <i>vipaka-cittas</i> have fallen away another type of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta
        </i>arises; for example, a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>which
        likes or dislike the object, that is, a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">lobha-mula-citta</i>
        or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dosa-mula-citta</i>. If people
        do not know the different type of <i>citta</i>, they may be inclined to
        think that like or dislike are still <i>vipaka</i>. However, like and
        dislike arise after the <i>vipaka-cittas</i> have fallen away; they are
        not the result of <i>kamma</i>. A <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">lobha-mula-citta
        </i>or a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dosa-mula-citta</i> is
        not <i>vipaka citta</i>, but <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala
        citta</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Different types of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">cittas</i> succeed one another very rapidly. For example, when we hear a
        harsh sound, the <i>vipaka-citta</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
        </i>arises at the moment the sound is perceived through the ears and
        then falls away immediately. The moments of <i>vipaka</i> are very
        short. After that there might be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i>-<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">cittas</i>. For instance, dislike of the sound might arise, and this
        follows so closely that it seems to occur at the same moment as the
        hearing. In reality these <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>do
        not arise at the same moment. Each <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta
        </i>has its own function. A <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vipaka</i>
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">citta </i>is the result of former <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala
        kamma</i> or <i>kusala kamma</i>. The like or dislike after the <i>vipaka
        </i>is unwholesome. We should realize that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i>
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">cittas</i> accumulate and thus only lead to more <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">akusala</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many times when we might not
        know at which moment there is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vipaka</i>
        and at which moment there is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">akusala</i>
        citta, because we find our feelings about the thing we experience so
        important. The pleasant feeling which accompanies the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dosa-mula-citta</i>
        can be so strong that we are carried away by our feelings. Thus we
        cannot see things as they are.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Part of our life is spent in receiving
        pleasant or unpleasant results and part of our life is spent in
        performing unwholesome and wholesome deeds which will condition our
        behavior in the future and which will also condition the results we will
        receive in the future. If we understand more about <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vipaka</i>,
        which is the result of our own deeds, it will help us to cope with the
        unpleasant results in our life. We will not blame other people for
        unpleasant <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vipaka</i> we receive,
        because <i>kamma</i> is the real cause of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vipaka</i>.
        We will give in less to our feelings concerning <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vipaka</i>
        when we know the different <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittas</i>
        which arise at different moments.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Indeed, the Buddha showed his great
        compassion in teaching people to understand reality, in teaching them
        Dhamma.</font></p>
